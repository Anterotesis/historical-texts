            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The like also did Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Let the<note place="margin">Reu. 17. 4</note> Factious be ashamed of <hi>so</hi> doing, and
<pb facs="tcp:19246:4"/>
we will be ashamed of so writing and hearing.</p>
            <p>Some say that in the Diologicall speeches, I seeme to point at certaine particular persons, vpon whom some of my speeches cannot be truely faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I grant; first that I haue aymed at some particular persons, so well as they in their Dialogues of the <hi>Barwicke Souldier,</hi> the Host and Chaplaine &amp;c. with many such Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinicall libels, haue done right often. But as their magnaticall one-eard Inuectiues were set on fire from hell, for destroying the Church peace, so, I doubt not but my feruent breathings, will be found to haue beene kindled by the coales of the Altar, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of Schisme Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the parable of <hi>Iothams</hi> trees, that gathered together for electing a King; when as none but the brabling<note place="margin">Iudg. 9. 8. &amp;c.</note> Bramble would accept of the offer. That parable will fit them, as if it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:19246:4"/>
had propounded vnto them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I answere, though all there spoken, cannot bee auerred of euery person in a faction, (by reason no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is at vnity in it selfe) yet it may sit close to some other they thinke not of, in the same faction: and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially,</hi> though <hi>not actually,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the leud spirit of that whole Corporation.</p>
            <p>Besides, to such as say, that <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi> was long since confuted by the Fathers, and what neede <hi>Clapham</hi> meddle with it, &amp;c? I answer: first by Retortion: So <hi>Donatisme, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme, Reordination Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, Atheisme &amp;c.</hi> were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Fathers (so was the very adultery, murder, &amp;c.) what need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preacher then iterate these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? The answer to the last, will fit<note place="margin">So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. More in his tables doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> the first. Secondly, I answer: Our heretikes haue added vnto the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teaching such conclusions as of old

were not dream'd of. And had I not<note place="margin">one Arrian Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, &amp; ano ther, a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Arrian, both burnt at <hi>Norwich</hi>

Search all the bookes that I haue writ, and that is from <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1595. hitherto, 1608.) and consider if still I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noked not all the Factious, specially on the right hand, howsoeuer hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnanswered of any. VVhich doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they would haue done, had I not too truely pressed them. Thirdly I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, I know none that condemne my labours, of that kind, but suchas be either <hi>open</hi> foes, or <hi>hypocriticall</hi> brethren. If open foes, then no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though they ball and barke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, whenas they raile against the whole body of the Church. If <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall</hi> brethren, who let some Factious haue their hearts, and for maintenance sake let vs haue their bodies onely, I waie not of their doome no more then of <hi>Laodiceans</hi> deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<pb facs="tcp:19246:5"/>
for what is such an Hypocrite, but an <hi>Ambo</hi> between two, a bifronted <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> looking two wayes, and a <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> faithfull to none? The opposite side do spit at them, and can we do lesse then spurne them?</p>
            <p>In this booke is acted <hi>Errour on the Left hand.</hi> In the fore-front wherof I haue Marshalled the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi> as one who primordially through a frozen security, did decline towards <hi>Libertinisme,</hi> establishing such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, as vnto flesh and blood might be most acceptable. Vnto which side also, if I had reduced the carnall Familist, (for there be a second sort more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall) I suppose I had done him no wrong. But sit as they shall, naught be they all, and it is the naughtines of their opinions that I specially dart at.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Male-content,</hi> I make him the <hi>Nicka-fidge</hi> here (running from one faction vnto another) as I
<pb facs="tcp:19246:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did the <hi>Flyer</hi> in the former.

Worse I wish to no <hi>Flyer,</hi> nor a straw the worse to any Mal-contented. <hi>Dei est non er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare, hominis errare, insipientis perseuerare in errore.</hi>

            <p>If thou canst well relish the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but not the <hi>Maner</hi> of handling: (for euery one doth quickly conceit a Dialogicall <hi>Prosopopeia</hi>) I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thee to my <hi>Antidoton,</hi> my <hi>New Ierushalem,</hi> my <hi>Manuall of the Bibles doctrine,</hi> together with diuers of the heades, sparsed in my <hi>Bibles briefe,</hi> in my poeme <hi>Aelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> and fiue parts of my labours of <hi>Salamons Song;</hi> not to mention
<pb facs="tcp:19246:6"/>
any of my imperfect workes printed abroad ouer immaturely.</p>
            <p>But to helpe the slowe conceited (for these two bookes of Dialogues were penned, almost altogether for such about the citie of London, who are ordinarily toyled with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious) it must first be obserued that the maine thing I driue at, is, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the principall argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by euery sort of Schismatique doth fabricate vnto himselfe a new society or Church. Secondly, to shewe, how that principall argument is laide at home by our <hi>Mal-content,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon others build their rendings from vs. Thirdly, to disclose such their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by that forme of introducting them, in their mutuall brablings, wherein, as sometimes one of them confuteth another, so, much of their extrauagant speech is so absurd, <hi>Vt recitare, idem est quod refutare,</hi> As the bare repetition is a sufficient

            <p>Had not some learned (in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) obserued so many points (at least) in my former booke it had not obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a <hi>passe</hi> to the presse: For sure I am, that it stood vpon more sufficient examination, then all the books which besides I haue diuulged.

Go to the Brownist, shall I do so? In them and their proceedings, I find no vnity, no concordance; Their hand being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all, and the hands of all against them. The <note n="a" place="margin">Geo. Io.</note> brother of that Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Pastor, hath writ a great booke against them, their vnsetled resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bloody excommunications, and hie-handed tyrannies; as if the Pastor were a Pope, taking more vpon them (for the measure of strength they haue) then do all the English prelates. In so much as, howsoeuer he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades

people to ioine with the cause of Separation, as himselfe had (and therein since hath died) yet, at no hand to ioyne with his brothers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: for manifold reasons there alledged.</p>
               <p>Since which time, one (whose<note n="b" place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sm.</note> name soundes vpon an Anuile) hath dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen certaine <hi>Principles and inferences, touching a true visible Church;</hi> where in he quoteth scripture for another forme of discipline, then that which the Brownist practise, and most of vs haue taught in our sermons and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: He purposing as it seemeth, to receiue others into communion with him, who shall separate, as he hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so shew themselues willing to be ruled by his discipline. Aes me, which side shall I leane vnto? Both of them hold a <hi>set forme</hi> of discipline to be contained in the word. Both of them alleadge (for the substance thereof) the very sarue scriptures; but both of them differ exceedingly in the sense of such Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Another side, hauing no Baby for

their leader (although his sir name begin with a <note n="c" place="margin">Him and his words I haue al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged in my preface to my <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nuall.</hi>
                  </note> B.) he holds both with the gouernement at home by Lord Bishops; as also, with that of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elders abroad; as being in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neither commanded, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, but things in themselues of an indifferent nature. So he holdes, and yet denies to <hi>subscribe,</hi> for sundry reasons. Shall I separate with the first two? or shal I continue in the Church of England with the third?</p>
               <p>But miserable man, how shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or not separation be good? If I separate from the Church as Antichristian, then the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist take hold vpon me, and saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I must separate not so much for the prelaticall discipline; as for that the spirit of Antichrist there breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Antichristian doctrine. Yea that the Church becomes to be Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: for that their groundes of faith therein held, be principles opposite to Christ. And in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, if the first be granted, the second will ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitably follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:19246:10"/>If I separate not, but continue still in the Church, I shall in my worke iustifie that which I haue condemned in word. In word I haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Tippet, the Surplice, the Corner-cap, the Crosse in Baptisme, and the like for markes of Antichrist. But forsaking my ministry, I may liue in some other calling, and so be put to the vse of no such ceremonies. Yea but if I haue a child, I must bring it, where before I will not, it cannot be baptized without the crosse. Come I to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon seruice, I must sit in the sight of a Surplice; and come I to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, I must there kneele &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue at the hands of one that vseth the ceremonies. And be I called to be a Church-warden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I must take an oath to present the sincere-sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that omit, or speake against such ceremonies. I am diuided in my selfe, what shall I doe? <hi>H.

misery. Wo is me, how is my soule pained within me? Though hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ifumed against the author of that booke, intituled <hi>Errour on the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,</hi> yet now mine affections bee cooled and calmed: for well I see, that there is nothing yet right amongst them. And at home I know not how to liue, as I would not be held an Hypocrite or turne-coat. The eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion must be by some third meanes, &amp; that as yet I know not. Rest poore head, rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rest against this trees roote, and take a little nap in the shade.</p>

But stay, some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique retch now or neuer: for an inch of policie, I hold better then an ell of Diuinity. In the time of discontent it is best working vpon <hi>Malcontent:</hi> for vpon <hi>conceit</hi> it is then most easy to worke. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Dialogue in <hi>Erasmus</hi> his great <hi>Colloquium;</hi> where one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by the hie-way, was desire us to fasten some strange conclusion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the conceit of his fellow Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers. Hereupon hée stops his course, with his eies vpon the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament fixed, gaping, gazing, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, blessing, trembling. The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers thereupon stay, looke vp, and wonder whereat he should so wonder. Anon, as with much ado, he tels them what a fearefull signe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19246:11"/>
he saw in the firmament, a Dragon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a terrible thing in description, I warrant you; hereupon he startles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holds vp his hands and wondreth at all the rest, that they should say they see nothing. Anon, one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scorne, but he should see as much as another, he also affirmeth that he saw such a terrible wonder: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, some and some, euery one said he saw it, and trembled. In this dialogue (some haue thought) that <hi>Erasmus</hi> flouted people in England, for conceiting a certain great prelate in the Churches firmament, beyond that they should conceit, &amp;c. But howsoeuer, I will take aduantage of the time, and see if so I can worke some strange thing vpon him. I hope it the rather, because one of this spirit (a <hi>Sole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sincerian</hi>) being of late conuented before a great Prelate of this land, he offred, that if he the said Prelate, could proue but one point then in hand, hee would without more adoe turne back to the Church of Rome. whereupon the Prelate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19246:12"/>
spake to this effect: I, is it true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed? are you now ready to go a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? what a poping I had thought there had bin many grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between vs &amp; them (howsoeuer this stands) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> would haue kept you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poping: wel, I wil break one cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of my inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon him.

               <p>O Sir, he told me, that you would not submit your selfe to the truth, but vpon palpable reasons. I was this morning, as you haue beene, and yet are, a desirer of Reformation. But all in vaine, to séeke after a reforming of <hi>Israel,</hi> beeing once schismed from <hi>Iudah.</hi> To kéepe vs at home, from going vp to <hi>Rome,</hi> the place of the <hi>High Priest;</hi> loe, <hi>Dan</hi> hath béene builded at Yorke, and <hi>Bethel</hi> at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie. As the vpstart ministry of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did make their people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19246:13"/>
that all was naught at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> so this ministry of <hi>Harry</hi> the eight, sowes all false rumors of the holy <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Stand not (Sir) mazing at the matter. I hated the Church of Rome till now; but the holy Angell no sooner breathed vpon me, but my bowels yearned after her presence, yea, me thought such a light flashed vpom my senses, as therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, all intricate scruples vanished. There was a booke published by <hi>Doctor S.</hi> Hars. concerning falshood of certaine Priests about London, in counterfeiting possessions &amp; dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, specially practised vpon the bodies of yong tender damsels. That booke made me loath the holy Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as being but false packing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. O sir, I repent my creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for new it was reuealed vnto me, that such as came to bee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and so deposed by the Prelates of England, they were but such, as sought profits &amp; pleasures, amongst the Protestant Libertines, by so reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the eldest sonnes of their mother.

               <p>True sir, because in his place, he was but a priuat man. But this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is done by publike authority. Otherwise you fall vpon the rocke of <hi>Anabaptisme.</hi> For they reason thus; Our Sauiour and the Apostles vsed no swords; therefore not to be vsed of

               <speaker>Roma.</speaker>
               <p>That is to be denied; for though Christ carried no sword, yet hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his successor S. <hi>Peter</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two; and said that there should be a time to vse them. Now, our holy Father the Pope succeedeth him, so verily as did S. <hi>Peter:</hi> and so the sword Ciuil, and the sword Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique are both in his hands. Now, when we are too weake for them, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his successor must put vp the sword left they perish with it: but when we are able to ouertop the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out must the sword; for as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, the sword is not carried for naught. O father <hi>Garnet,</hi> father <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> how glorious is thy martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and how miraculously shineth thy physnomy vpon a strawe!</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Libert.</speaker>
               <p>First, I doe beleeue that there is a God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that his sonne came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to saue sinners, by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in our nature. And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Euery spirit that confesseth that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God:</hi> but I do so confesse, therefore I am of God: So are you, and you, and you, and my hostesse <hi>Blowse,</hi> in so confessing that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh. And therefore lawfull for me to heare Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, Protestant, Anabaptist or any that so professe. This point I learned of a William, that sometimes liued in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland; who running from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Church here, to the Brownist; from the Brownist to a particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his owne, wherto he did bap tize himselfe; from that to one sect of the Anabaptists, where they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him againe; from that to another sect of the Anabaptists &amp;c, finding no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19246:19"/>
rest in any, till hee setled (from that place of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>) to heare all, to walke with all, and to hold all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that confessed Christ as afore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roma.</speaker>
               <p>The Diuell confessed him to bee Christ and the son of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and so to be come in the flesh: therefore you must vnderstand S. <hi>Iohn</hi> better.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Libert.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, these varieties of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, causeth varieties of sects, and therefore I leaue them to such as loue to contend. Mine Host, <hi>Loue</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>beleeues all things and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it selfe to all,</hi> as my stomach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to all these dishes, sauing the Smelts.</p>

               <speaker>Liberti.</speaker>
               <p>Hostesse, on the faith of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, such things are not vnlikely to be acted of them. I haue seene some of their fashions in my trauels Talk what they shall of religion, when all comes to all, they iump with mee in Religion, excepting their treasons. I will tell you a prety story of some of them, then iudge of their Religion. The Scene of my discourse shall lie at home. In <hi>Wisbich</hi> castle there were many Priests and Friers of sundry fashions; what time the foule railing schisme fell out, betweene the secular Priests and Iesuites. Let these fellowes haue gone to bowles in the castle yard, as viually they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19246:20"/>
did; you should haue had some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to play for their <hi>Deuotions,</hi> that is, for so many <hi>Pater-nosters,</hi> so many <hi>Aues,</hi> and so many <hi>Creedes.</hi> If you had asked, how these should haue bene paid? they would haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the loser shall pay them on his bare knees. For when he went to say ouer his owne deuotions; then hee was after that, to say ouer so many of the <hi>Paters, Aues</hi> and <hi>Creedes</hi> as hee had lost; and that in the behoofe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winner. This is my tale: now iudge of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for my part I think y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most of their religion to be but méere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to cast Popery on the left hand, as begetting Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</note> political, for keeping people in a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: otherwise, for the learned of them, let them be alone by themselues, they can turne that into glée and gladnes, which the Lay-lort must tremble at in sadnes. <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel</hi> could well say, that the bringing of people into such seruile feare, it fainted their hearts in fight, wherby the Empire still lessened. But hee should haue further obserued; that howsoeuer it decreased the Empire,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19246:21"/>
it was the meanes to strengthen the Popedome.</p>

               <p>Master Malcontent, a word in your eare. We do not well to stay the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of such vile speeches against our holy mother the Church. And it is no contending with him, for feare hee bring vs into question. Follow a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, as nothing were. And if you ouertake me not in the next field, I will stay at the great gate beyond it. Hostesse I must rise; my friend may stay a little, and hee will pay for my dinner.

               <p>It was neuer famed for worse then it now is. <hi>First,</hi> for the state of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is generally very beggerly. Traffficke, as some other Cities in <hi>Italy</hi> haue, it hath not. Indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trauell thither as Pilgrimes, and there be allowed to stay for certaine daies: but as the number of such Pilgrims now, be scarse one for an hundred that passed thither of yore: so, ordinarily they bee but of meane degree, and ere they come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their purse hath cast her calfe: For the small time of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19246:25"/>
then there, somewhat comes out of the coffers of the scarlet Cardinals. Which spent, they put vp their pipes and packe away. They might come out full, but they returne foole and empty. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for the state of Pope and Cardinals, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pompous and princelike: the Cardinals hauing hinges enowe in their doore to turne vpon, and the Pope besides other meanes hath a mighty allowance annually from the Curtizans scalding-tubs: for no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in Rome more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then <hi>Venery,</hi> and <hi>Penury. Thirdly,</hi> for the state of their religious houses, let the vaults &amp; secret preambulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnder earth tell y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> for their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique deuotions, the formes of them be Pagan-like; the multiplicitie of them, be as <hi>Sisyphus</hi> stone, alwaies rolling, but neuer at an end. In a word, it is an <hi>Egypt</hi> for slauery, a <hi>Babel</hi> for bondage, a <hi>Bethel</hi> for ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, a <hi>Tophet</hi> for confused noise, a <hi>Gehinnon</hi> for bloud-shed, a <hi>Sodome</hi> for all spurcicity, an <hi>Hell</hi> for da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

               <p>Nay you haue said enough, and yet but that, which I oft before haue heard. I beseech you sir of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: I haue beene one of them, which haue stood heere for the new disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, holding that we haue for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and Antichristian. And seeing this discipline would not be had, I lastly resolued to separate, and so enter into that course, which is called <hi>Brownisme.</hi> As I thus resolued, there comes a booke into my hands, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Principles and inferences of a true visible Church.</hi> This booke teacheth a Separation as do the writings of the former: but when he comes to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, he then differs much from the former; and so from the most of our Reformistes, heere at home, so well as from the Church of Scotland and the like.</p>
               <p>First we haue held, that the <hi>Pastor</hi> might onely administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but the author of this booke,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19246:26"/>
holdeth that the <hi>Doctor</hi> may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster them also.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we haue taught, that the <hi>Elders</hi> were to be imploied in Church gouernement onely (I meane in the discipline) but he affirmeth further, that they are all of them <hi>apt to teach;</hi> and so to assist in doctrine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we haue published, that the Church is to giue the officers their <hi>Calling;</hi> meaning thereby all the men of the Church were to giue their voice: but he intimates further, that women and children are to giue their consent also for such election and calling.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we held <hi>Excommunication</hi> to be the casting out of a contumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus person; and that to the excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, there appertained only, rebukes, the word and prayer; as all spirituall: but he infinuates further, that some <hi>bodily punishment also</hi> is to be annexed.</p>
               <p>What shall I say? in many things he is crosse to the discipline, which before hath beene applauded: and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19246:27"/>
yet the man (they say) an honest man, reuerend and learned.</p>
               <p>In the necke of this booke, I met with another, called <hi>Errour on the right hand.</hi> The author thereof being sometimes intangled about <hi>Discipline,</hi> (and yet it must be confessed that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares he hath in print checked ours, for the which we euer caried an hard hand ouer him) and during such time of the entanglement about that point he trauailing into forren parts, and there abiding some yeares (where all sorts of factions were daily in his eies and eares) he, (about some nine yeares since) came ouer, and in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don continuing, hath all this while conflicted with factions, and not a little vexed vs. The foresaid book he <hi>now</hi> publishing, it plainely euinceth, that if separation bee made from the Church of England for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, then will ineuitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an endles wandring from facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to faction. These two bookes haue put me to my wits end; I know not what to do: and to subscribe vnto this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19246:27"/>
Churches Canons and orders, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: Once, for that I am knowne in these parts to haue set my selfe against them. Secondly, for that I hold some of them to be repugnant vnto the word of God. Could I get out of these briers, I were an happy man.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>No sir, for I was no man of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts.</p>

               <speaker>Libert.</speaker>
               <p>Then that damme is closed vp. There be some which I know, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19246:28"/>
if their case were such, they would presently subscribe, specially in secret. Your best then is, to leane this place where you haue beene noted, and so to repaire vnto another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>But how then shall I doe for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Libert.</speaker>
               <p>The subscription runneth, that you must ex animo protest that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they propound is agreable to Gods word, and in nothing re pugnant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>True.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Libert.</speaker>
               <p>Now sir, they can propound no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so erroneous and wicked, but it doth agree with some part of Gods word: As for example, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any thing for Christian, which is indéed Antichristian, it doth agrée with the <hi>word of prophecy,</hi> who foretelleth that such euils shall be. If they propound obedience to the beast in <hi>Reuelation</hi> the 13. it agrees with the <hi>word of Prophecie,</hi> which saith, such euils shall be propounded; And in such sense you onely subscribe, namely, that all their euill agréeeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19246:29"/>
with the <hi>word of prophecy:</hi> &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you meane, that their euill is good; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then respectiuely, as it is a fulfilling of the holy <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Muse not at the matter, the case is plaine, the pearle of your meaning is not to be cast before them, no more then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> would deliuer his <hi>preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> meaning vnto the licentious <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> nor Christ would deliuer his <hi>Reseruatiue</hi> meaning vnto them of <hi>Emmaus,</hi> when he looked another way. A certaine Doctor once being demanded, what hee thought of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> supremacy: hee vnto them replied; I desire (my Lords) to know what you thinke of it. They answer, we do beléeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> within her owne dominions she is ouer all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and in all causes, Ciuill and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastique, supreame. He answeres, And my very good Lords, I do truely <hi>beleeue the same.</hi> Whereupon (it is said) he scaped. Now sir, what was it he beleeued? not that the Queene was <hi>so</hi> supreame,; but he beléeued that the Lords so beléeued.</p>

               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>Me thinkes this should be equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in him, and yet the former I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably affect.</p>

               <p>Tut, if euery close helpe wee vse, for euading dangers, must be called equiuocation, then we wil condemne Patriarkes and Prophets, Martyrs and Confessors and all godly policy. Whereas contrariwise our Sauiour hath taught vs, yea, commanded vs to be subtile as serpents.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>Without all question, it must bee so, and I do verily beleeue you: But another thing, sir, if I come to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficed, I must once within a moneth after, publiquely read in my cure, 39. articles of religion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded vpon by our Conuocation house, and thereto must then signify my assent, and there be some that I like not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Libert.</speaker>
               <p>Thats nothing, for vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ground you may say: <hi>All these</hi> agrée with Gods word: Or you may say thus; beloued, <hi>here be articles, that I must read, whereto I assent, and of whom I affirme that they be gooly.</hi> Now, you say, there be such holy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19246:30"/>
but not that all the articles are such and holy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>O, how happy was I to meete with a man of such prudence &amp; diuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience! O, that all my brethren were acquainted with this sacred policy.</p>
               <p>O sir, you must beware to whom you communicate it: Otherwise, it may come to the Bishops eares; and they would fetch you about againe, &amp; not only you, but all others, that yet kéep their places, who seeme to leane to the new discipline.

yet in the heele of our discourse (let me make my selfe no wiser then I am) I could not collect, what (after the bodies death) became of that soule, except it then entred into some other body, <hi>Uegetatiue, Sensitiue,</hi> or <hi>Rationall.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>It is somewhat which you say, and

more then I euer heard before. But me thought you inferred further, that the starres haue life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atheos.</speaker>
               <p>Uery true; else how should they giue life to inferiour bodies? <hi>Plato</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philosopher, read him well. The like do to <hi>Clemens Alexandrine</hi> his <hi>Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> towards y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> end: &amp; hee a famous diuine amongst the Gréekes within 200 yeares of Christ.

Whereupon else co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all sortes of daily dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there is yet a plentious conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of euery creature in this kind?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>Surely, it must needes bee so. And I now perceiue, that is impossible
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19246:32"/>
for a man that pores much vpon the Scriptures, should euer bee a wise man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atheos.</speaker>
               <p>Tut, the writers of the scriptures, were very politick men. The sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> notes <hi>Moses</hi> to haue beene a very pollitick Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> a notable Magician, who well knew, that such an itchie people as <hi>Israel,</hi> would neuer be kept vnder, but by propounding some formes of Religion, whereby they might be imbusied in these religious deuotions, as time should not afford, (ouer and besides that) any leasure to looke into their Captaines purposes. Vnto which religion, they being once fashioned, in hope of a reward, at the hands of one they called GOD, they afterwards, neither durst do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as they would auoid certaine torments, in a place they called Hell. What was it that <hi>Mahomet</hi> else inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the deuice of his <hi>Alcoran?</hi> And hath hee not thereby, purchased to himselfe abundance of Kingdomes, with subiugation of very many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19246:32"/>
And this the rather, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing a want in the others policie, (at least, in the exercise of their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) when as he leaues no liberty to his people, for calling so much, as any one point of their religion in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but die therefore he must. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followes that differences they haue none; and so are at all times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues vnited, and fit with one heart and spirit, to fly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently in the faces of any their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.

               <p>It comes from that region of the aire which is middle-most. And is no thing else, but a sodaine bursting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder of a cloude: the tearing of whose wombe in peeces, you might sensibly heare. The cloud consists of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19246:35"/>
viscous vapours, which rolling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, doe in fire beget a stone in the wombe of the cloud; the heauiest part of the matter falling into that center. But as the whole bodie of the cloud cannot be a like condensed and firme; so, a breach in time is made, for venting that stone or pellet. The resemblance of this lightning, this crack &amp; thunderbolt flying, you may see in a peece of Ordinance, where you haue a sudden flashing light; a terrible crack, &amp; the pellet flying out.</p>

I will tell you further, if shee can draw her sting back againe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all is well enough with her, howsoeuer she haue tickled her molestor. But if she leaue it quite behind, then through want of choser to inflame her vnto duty she becommeth a drone and loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, liuing vpon the spoile of others. All which may put vs in mind; First that a Christian is to be zealous in a good cause, but so as he ouershoot not the compasse of his owne good. Secondly that a man ouerlashing in zeale, doth finally grow to be as cold as a clocke, a plaine loiterer, liuing, vpon the vndeserued paines of others: For extremity of zeale, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily is turned into extreame secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19246:43"/>
these two bées, you shall haue a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent instance; sée you how that blacker bee is got vpon the iacke of the other? sée how she tugs her forward, now she tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bles down with her from the stone, now she flies vp againe, hauing left the other for dead.</p>

Now sir, marke againe how some come forth to fly about for more prouision: Others againe, see how they come with their thighes laden with matter for effecting of hony. And in the third place obserue, how some others help to beare in their burthen. From hence may wee not learne, that as euery Christian is to haue his calling and therein to bee painfull; so, the stronger are to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weaker, one bearing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19246:43"/>

               <p>Now sir, all these maintaine V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the bonds of peace; and so their small beginnings increase to a mightie lump: whereas on the other side, the greatest things by discord and dariance, do come vnto nothing. Furthermore, as they haue a gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to goe in and out before them, so they do camp round about his person as willing to be slaine before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> their anointed be touched. And may not the obseruation hereof bring confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of face vnto such as not only make away, but also themselues ioyne in traiterous violences against the Lords annointed, our dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne king <hi>Iames?</hi> Besides, how may it plainly demonstrate the leaud spirits of some <hi>Zeloists,</hi> who being called to inuiron the Church, as the Tribes with their tents in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes inuironed the Sanctuary, are not onely, not such, but in deede
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19246:44"/>
and in word, and in writings incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe her with firebrands, setting all on fire. Though the Lord had his holy fire in the Temple; yet it was the Diuels wild-fire (by <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netsar</hi>) that set the Temple on fire.</p>

               <p>Wel, now I perceiue that the smallest creatures do go before me in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Creator.

I haue sinned against our Church mightily (I am afraid) in hauing bin vnto her not a Bee, but a spider, in drawing all into the euill part, for nourishing my poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonfull iudgement. My humble desire is, that in propounding some doubts, which yet (as stumps) remaine behind vnpulled vp, you would vouchsafe vnto mee some reasonable resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Malcon.</speaker>
               <p>Amen, I beseech him. The first question is, how may I be assured that the ministrie of our Church, is one with that ministry which Christ left vnto the ministration of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, that is, of the Gospel, or glad tidings, through Faith in Christ, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite (in respect of the forme of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification) to the workes of the Law. The doubt ariseth; First from their diuersity of titles; the one called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Deacons; the other called Arch-Bishops, Lord Bishops, Priests, Parso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Vicars. Secondly, our Bishops seemto haue greater dignities &amp; prero gatiues in the world the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other had.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Medioc.</speaker>
               <p>To the first I answer: The house of <hi>Ioseph</hi> made no separation from their master; nor the Iewes from <hi>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael</hi> and <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah:</hi> howsoeuer <hi>Pharaoh</hi> altered the first and <hi>Nebuchadnetsar</hi> gaue bad ones to the second. Names are not of the <hi>essence</hi> or being of things, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, false Christs should bee true
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19246:45"/>
Christs, and false Prophets, true Prophets, because they be inuested with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> commendable titles of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Prophet.</hi> And yet no such euill in our names, (for what is <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> but <hi>chiefe ouerseer?</hi> Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, a ruling ouerséer: Priest (the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt word of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as Bishop of <hi>Episcopos</hi>) signifieth onely an <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (which phrases of Bishop and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were giuen to the Apostles also) The first in respect of ouerseeing Church or Churches; the second in respect of their yeares sufficiencie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entred into the worke of the ministry. As for the terme <hi>Parson,</hi> you may call him <hi>Pastor</hi> if you will (the Law giues you leaue) the terme <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> arguing rather the nature of his <hi>Maintenance,</hi> then of his <hi>Office.</hi> The same may be said of <hi>Vicar</hi> also: and therefore hee that in Lancashire said <hi>God hath giuen me a liuing, and the diuell hath giuen me a name:</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued therein more precipitate zeale then sadnes of learning. I wonder why Phanatique spirits, (so well as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19246:45"/>
at this) do not brabble with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for <hi>giuing,</hi> and with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for <hi>bearing,</hi> such names (as <hi>Richard, Robert, Roger, Hercules, Diana, Mar-prelate</hi> (for so one was baptized) and these &amp; thousands moe, be not onely, not in the Bible, but, many of them rapt from heathen Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, &amp; what not? But they haue litle to do, that will contend with their owne shadow.</p>
               <p>Secondly for the greater dignities &amp; prerogatiues, which our Bishops haue in the world: I answer, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had right to far greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 1. &amp;c.</note> then ours be possessed of, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had right to euery vineyard<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 20. 21.</note> hée planted, to euery flocke hee had fed; and that is, right to maintenance from multitudes of Churches, and countries. If it be replied, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apostles had it not, no, not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Arch-apostle S. <hi>Paul:</hi> I answere, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was not because it was not their right; but because the people would not giue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their right. If here it be obiected, but our Bishops haue not so laboured and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19246:46"/>
conuerted y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people from whom they haue such dignities; I answer, the first had to do with meere <hi>Infidels</hi> without the Church, but ours with <hi>Christians</hi> within the visible face of the Church, and therefore no such cause nor néed. But as the Apostles hauing ordained Presbyters (or Priests) to euery Church, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> néere ouer sight thereof, did notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>care for all the Churches,</hi> and<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 28.</note> visite them as opportunity was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 3. Tit. 1. 5.</note> so it is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> duty of ours, and their maine duty. If any one faile herein, <hi>Est quidem error personalis, non le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis,</hi> the fault is in the person, not in the function confirmed by Law.</p>
               <p>As for their <hi>Prerogariues,</hi> what haue they, wherein the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not? If they incarcerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, by authority deriued lawfully from our Prince (a thing which Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delious Princes would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apostles, nor yet to any Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

A weake &amp; despised Church they would haue her; who being destitute of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power, would haue her robbed of that which is ordinary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. The Prophets could foretell, that Kings of the earth should bring their honour and glory vnto it, and these cannot abide it. Yes (they will say) we would haue the Church, not her ministry to haue it. I beleeue it, they would haue themselues and their lay children euected, and the ministry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.

               <p>Indeede sir, I must needes say, it would come to no better. Experience euery where, will giue testimony vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But I beseech you (sir) another question; how shall wee cleare, that the Surplice is not an Idolothyte?</p>

               <speaker>Medioc.</speaker>
               <p>By the definition of an Idolothyte: for, an Idolothyte is, whatsoeuer is dedicate or consecrate to an Idoll by way of deuotion: But none of our Surplices haue been so deuoted, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of them Idolothytes. If any can fetch out a Surplice, that hath beene by the Papists consecrated to their Idol-idle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>masse; such a one may be termed an Idolothyte, and it skils not though it were burnt. As for ours, they be not such, though like to such; no more then the Animal-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Israel vnder the lawe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were Idolothytes; howsoeuer like to the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> out of which they made their exode and passage. But that which is more; if the idolatour had abused it, may I not vse it? The Apostle teacheth otherwise: vnto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he layes downe the case<note place="margin">Cor. 10. 23.</note> thus: Of cattle offered vp to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, some part comes to the offerers; and from them sometimes, that part comes to the flesh market. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell buyes of it, dresseth it, and sets it before thee. Let thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science make
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19246:48"/>
no scruple to eate of it, how soeuer it was Idolatrized for as the earth is the Lords (not the Diuels) so, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof is his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and created for the vse of his. Yet, this <hi>prouiso</hi> withall: If any one at table w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thée, doe pointe at it, and say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> certainly this is an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolothyte, I like it not; then because of his conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (not because of thine) let it alone: for the Lord hath things know besides in the earth for thee to feede vpon. Otherwise, thou eating of it and giuing thankes to God for it, why should another speake end of thee? Hence it is plains, that the children of God may lawfully vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature in the earth, howsoeuer it haue beene by others prophaned. Only, in case of anothers weaknes, he is to forbeare, euen from his owne right. This <hi>Prouiso,</hi> I know, is the maine of all their speech, who kéepe such a stir about the poore garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but in pressing this <hi>prouiso,</hi> they must take with them this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselues to bee but (as yet) very yong Christians, and not fitted

who within these fewe yeares said thus vnto mee: <hi>what if I poue that there is no true bible &amp;c?</hi> God tooke him soone after away, I hope for his owne good; but sure I am, for the Churches good. Good friend, our mother church knowes what shee doth herein; but these excepters are blinde in their manner of exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leading the high-way vnto <hi>Atheisme</hi> For thus they must argumentate.</p>
               <p>No lawfull subscription (in such sort as our Church vrgeth) can bee made to any Translation, in any thing dissenting from the Originall.</p>
               <p>But euery Translation in some things dissenteth from the Originall:</p>
               <p>Therefore no Translation to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to, as our Church vrgeth.</p>
               <p>Then hereupon will followe;</p>
               <p>1 No such subscription is due to any Bible, sauing to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> for the Old testament, &amp; the <hi>Greeke</hi> for the newe.</p>
               <p>2 These <hi>Not-subscriptors,</hi> besides may ioyne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some <hi>Romanists,</hi> &amp; séem to haue as lawfull exception against

the said Hebrue and Greeke also. If they know what I meane in this, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let them be ashamed of their ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t péeuishnes.

               </p>
               <p>3 (Not to say any thing of our Sauiour, &amp; some others of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) Then they will bring the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of S. <hi>Luke</hi> into question; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that 75 soules went downe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whereas <hi>Moses</hi> mentioneth only <hi>70</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 7. 14, Genes. 45.</note> soules. Nor can <hi>Beza</hi> deny, but that all Greeke copies hee met with, doe read <hi>75.</hi> As also the Syrian and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian, and the Latine, with <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Augustine.</hi> And herein indéede (to speake only what is probable) S. <hi>Stephen</hi> followed the Greeke trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the old Testament, called the Septuagint (of the 70, or 72 Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, that translated it so, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Egyptian King, <hi>Ptolemy Philadelph</hi>) which translation in our Sauiours time was most vulgar, &amp; best knowne to the Iewes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Master Broughton standeth stifly for this.</note> that I speake nothing of others; nor yet here, what the Septuagint might intend by 75: nor, how in very many places, they differ from the Hebrue.</p>
               <p>4 Then neither may there be such Subscription to any Sermons, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, Ecclesiastique constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Leitourgie or the like. For ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> failing in his worke, vppon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non or Rule of faith, then likewise (if not much more) he is like to faile in his maner of building vpon that rule of Faith, yea, not only in <hi>maner,</hi> but in the <hi>matter</hi> also.</p>
               <p>5 Then necessarily followeth, that no such subscription is at all to bee made; but euerie mole is left to dig in the earth, as pleaseth his owne blindnes. And in such libertie, they may go shake hands with <hi>Segnior Li bertino;</hi> and of Libertines become <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,</hi> and of Atheists Diuels incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
