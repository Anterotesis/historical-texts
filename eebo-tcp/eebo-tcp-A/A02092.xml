         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the inconuenience that growes to men, through the lightnes of
inconstant wantons, who being wholy giuen to the spoyle, seeke
the ruine of such as light into their companie. In this Dialogue,
louing Country-men, shall you finde what preiudice ensues by

pleasures of vnchast Libertines, (not onely by their consuming
of their wealth, and impouerishment of their goods and landes,
but to the great indangering of their health. For in conuersing
<pb facs="tcp:6232:3"/>
with them, they aime not simply at the losse of goods, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of their good names, but they fish for diseases, sicknesse,
sores incurable, vlcers brusting of the ioyntes, and sault rhumes,
which by the humour of that villanie, lepte from Naples into
Fraunce, and from Fraunce into the bowels of Englande, which
makes many crye out in their bones, whilest goodman Surgion
laughs in his purse: a thing to be feared as deadly while men liue,
as hell is to be dreaded after death, for it not only infecteth the
bodie, consumeth the soule, and waste wealth and worship, but
ingraues a perpetuall shame in the forehead of the partie so abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Whereof Maister Huggins hathwell written in his Myrror
of Magistrates, in the person of Memprycaius, exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
harlots, the verses be these:
<q>
                  <l>Eschue vile Venus toyes shee cuts off age,</l>
                  <l>And learne this lesson oft, and tell thy frend,</l>
                  <l>By Pockes, death sodaine, begging, Harlots end.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, I haue here lay de open the wily wisedome of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Curtizens, that with their cunning, can drawe on, not only
poore nouices, but such as hold themselues maisters of their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation.
What flatteries they vse to bewitch, what sweet words
to inueagle, what simple holines to intrap, what amorous glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
what smirking Ocyliades, what cringing curtesies, what stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Adios, following a man like a blood-hound, with theyr
eyes white, laying out of haire, what frouncing of tresses, what
paintings, what Ruffes, Cuffes, and braueries, and all to betraie
the eyes of the innocent nouice, whom when they haue drawne
on to the bent of their bow, they strip like the prodigall childe,
and turne out of doores like an outcast of the world. The Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile
hathnot more teares, Proleus, more shape, Ianus more
faces, the Hieria, more sundry tunes to entrap the passengers,
then our English Curtizens, to bee plaine, our English whores:
to set on fire the hearts of lasciuious and gazing strangers. These
common, or rather consuming strumpets, whose throathes are
softer then oyle, and yet whose steppes leade vnto death. They
haue their Ruffians to rifle, when they cannot fetch ouer with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cunning, their crosbiters attending vpon them, their foysts,
<pb facs="tcp:6232:3"/>
their bufts, their nippes, and such like. Being wayted on by these
villaines, as by ordinary seruantes, so that who thinkes himselfe
wise inough to escape their flatteries, him they crosbyte, who
holdes himselfe to rule, to be bitten, with a counterfeyt Appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
him they rifle, if hee be not so to bee verst vpon, they haue a
foyst or a nyppe vpon him, and so sting him to the quicke. Thus
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat medles with pitch, cannot but be defiled, and he that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainteth
himselfe or conuerseth with any of these Connycat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
strumpets, cannot but by some way or other bee brought
to confusion: for either hee must hazard his soule, blemish his
good name, loose his goods, light vppon diseases, or at the least
haue been tyed to the humor of an harlot, whose quiuer is open
to euery arrow, who likes all that haue fat purses, and loues none
that are destitue of pence. I remember a Monke in <hi>Diebus illis,</hi>
writ his opinion of the end of an Adulterer, thus:
<q>
                  <l>Quatuor his casibus sine dubio cadet adulter,</l>
                  <l>Aut hic pauper eit, aut hicsubito morietur,</l>
                  <l>Aut cadet in causum qua debet indice vinci,</l>
                  <l>Aut aliquod membrum casu vell crimine perdet,</l>
               </q>
Which I Englished thus:
<q>
                  <l>He that to Harlots lures do yeeld him thrall,</l>
                  <l>Through sowre misfortune too bad end shall fall:</l>
                  <l>Or sodaine death, or beggerie shall him chance,</l>
                  <l>Or guilt before a Iudge his shame inhance:</l>
                  <l>Or els by fault or fortune he shall leese,</l>
                  <l>Some member sure escape from one of these.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then such inconuenience grows from the caterpillers
of the Common-wealth, and that a multitude of the monsters
here about London particularly &amp; generally abroad in England,
to the great ouerthrow of many simple men that are inueagled
by their flatteries, I thought good not only to discouer their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
in a Dialogue, but also to manifest by an example, howe
preiuditiall their life is, to the state of the land, that such as are
warned by an instance, may learne and looke before they leape,
<pb facs="tcp:6232:4"/>
to that end kind Country-men, I haue set downe at the ende of
the disputation, the wonderful life of a Curtezin, not a fiction,
but a truth of one that yet liues not now in an other forme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant.
In the discourse of whose life, you shall see how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
such truls be to all estates that be so simple as to trust theyr
fained subtilties: heere shall parents learne, how hurtfull it is to
cocker vp their youth in their follies, and haue a deepe insight
how to bridle their daughters, if they see them any waies grow
wantons, wishing therfore my labors may be a caueat to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,

laie a country Farmar, with diuers of his neighbours about Law

was by a Foyst stript of all the pence in his purse, and comming home,
made great complaint of his misfortune, some lamented his losse, and
others exclaimed against the Cutpurses, but this Farmer he laught
loudly at the matter, and said such fooles as could not keep their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
no surer, were well serued, and for my part quoth hee, I so much
scorne the Cutpurses, that I would thanke him hartily that would
take paines to foyst mine, well saies his neighbor, then you may thank
me, sith my harmes learnes you to beware, but if it be true, that many
things fall out between the cup and the lip, you know not what hands
Fortune may light in your owne lap, tush quoth the Farmar, heeres
fortie pounds in this purse in gold, the proudest Cutpurse in England
win it and weare it, as thus he boasted, there stood a subtill Foyst by
and heard all, smiling to himselfe at the folly of the proude Farmar,
and vowed to haue his purse or venture his necke for it, and so went
home and bewrayed it to a crue of his companions, who taking it in
dudgion, that they should be put down by a Pesant, met either at Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Pickerings, or at Lambeth: let the Blackamore take heede
I name him not, least an honorable neighbor of his frowne at it, but
wheresoeuer they met they held a conuocation, and both consulted and

that all their trauell was in vaine, at last one of them fledde to a more
cunning pollicie, and went and learnde the mans name and where hee
dwelt, and then hyed him to the Counter and entered an Action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him of trespasse, damages two hundreth pounds, when hee had
thus done, hee seed two Sargiants, and carried them downe with him
to the mans lodging, wishing them not to arrest him till he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

they came, where were a crue of Foystes, whom he had made priuy to
the end of his practise, stood wayting, but he tooke no knowledge at all
of them, but walkt vp and downe, the Farmer came out and went to
Powles, the Cutpurse bad staie, and would not yet suffer the Officers
to meddle with him, til he came into the West end of Paules Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
and there he willed them to do their Office, and they stepping to
the Farmer arrested him, the Farmer amazed, beeing amongest his
neighbors, asked the Sargiant at whose suite hee was troubled, at
whose suite soeuer it be, sayd one of the Cutpurses that stood by, you
are wrongd honest man, for hee hath arested you here in a place of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge,
where the Sherifes nor the Officers haue nothing to do with
you, and therefore you are vnwise if you obey him, tush saies an other
Cutpurse, though the man were so simple of himselfe, yet shall hee not
offer the Church so much wrong, as by yeelding to the Mace, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bollish

that hee drew his swoord, an other tooke the man and haled him away,

mightily turmoyld amongst them, and almost haled in peeces, whilest
thus the strife was, one of the Foystes had taken his purse away, and
was gone, and the Officer carried the man away to a Tauerne, for he
swore he knew no such man, nor any man that he was indebted too, as
then they satte drinking of a quart of wine, the Foyst that had caused
him to be arrested, sent a note by a Porter to the Officer that he should
release the Farmer, for he had mistaken the man, which note the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
shewed him, and bad him pay his sees and go his waies, the poore
Country-man was content with that, and put his hand in his pocket
to feele for his purse, and God wot there was none, which made his

Foyst layde all the plottes they could, as well by discoueryng him
to the Gaylors as otherwayes, yet hee was so pollitique, that they
couls not verse vpon him by any meanes, which greeued them so, that
one day at a dinner, they held a counsaile amongst themselues how to
couzen him, but in vain, til at last a good wench that sat by, vndertooke
it, so they would sweare to let her haue all that hee had, they confirmed

it sollemply, and she put it in practise thus, she subtilly insinuaed her

after twise meeting to waxe familiar with her, and to question about a

her supper and what els hee would of curtesie bestowe vppon her, for
she held it scorne shee sayd, to set a salarie price on her bodie, the Foyst
was gladde of this, and yet hee woulde not trust her, so that hee put
no more but tenne shillings in his pocket, but hee had aboue twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

and thither comes my gentle Foyst, who makyng good cheere, was
so eagar of his game, that hee would straight to bedde by the leaue of

Fayre had three horse of her owne or an other mans to sell, as shee her
husband and an other good fellow, walkt them vp and downe the faire,
the owner came and apprehended them all, and clapt them in prison,
the Iaylor not keeping them close prisoners, but letting them lye all
in a Chamber, by her wit she so instructed them in a formall tale, that
she saued all their liues thus. Being brought the next morrow after
their apprehension, before the Iustices, they examined the men how
they came by those horses, and they confest they met her with them,
but where shee had them they knewe not, then was my prettie peate
brought in, who being a handsome Trul, blusht as if she had been full
of grace, and being demanded where she had the horses, made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
may it please your worships, this man being my husband, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

house, and bad me ride on afore and he would presently ouertake mee, well
forward I road halfe a myle, and looking behinde mee cauld see
no bodie, so being alone, my heart began to rise, and I to thinke on my
husband, as I had ridde a little farther, looking downe a lane, I saw
two men comming lustily vp as if they were weary, &amp; marking them
earnestly, I saw one of them was my husband, which made my heart
as light as before it was sad, so staying for them, after a little vnkinde
greeting betwixt vs, for I chid him for his vnthriftinesse, he asked me
where I had the horse, and I tolde him how curteously the Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had vsed me, why then saies hee, staie for him, nay quoth I, lets
ryde on, and get you two vp on the emptie horses, for he will ouertake
vs ere we come at the Towne, hee rydes on a stout lustie yoong gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
so forward wee went, and lookt often behinde vs, but our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman
came not, at last we comming to Spilsby alighted, &amp; broake
our fast, and tied our horses at the doore, that if he past by, seeing them,
hee might call in, after wee had broake our fast, thinking hee had gone
some other way, wee went into the horse faire, and there walkt our
horses vp and downe to meete with the Seruingman, not for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to sell them. Now may it please your worship, whether hee hàd
stolne the horses from this honest man or no, I knowe not, but alas,
simply I brought them to the horse faire, to let him that deliuered me
them haue them againe, for I hope your worships doth imagine, if I
had stolne them as it is suspected, I would neuer haue brought them
into so publicke a place to sell, yet if the law bee any way dangerous
for the foolish deed because I know not the Seruingman, it is, I must
bide the punishment, and as guiltlesse as any heere, and so making a
low courtsie shee ended. The Iustice holding vp his hand and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

alas, you poore theeues do only steale and pur loine from men,
<pb facs="tcp:6232:12"/>
and the harme you do is to imbollish mens goods, and bring them to

that growes from robbing or filching, so much do we by our
theft, and more by our lecherie, for what is the end of whoredome but
consuming of goods and beggery, and besides perpetuall infamie, we
bring yoong youthes to ruine and vtter destruction, I pray you Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
whether had a Marchants sonne hauing wealthie parents, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
light vpon a whoore then a Cutpurse, the one only taking his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the other bringing him to vtter confusion, for it the Foyst light
vpon him or the Conny-catcher, he looseth at the most some hundreth
poundes, but if hee fall into the companie of a whoore, shee flatters
him, shee inucagles him, shee bewitcheth him, that hee spareth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goods nor landes to content her, that is onely in loue with his
coyne, if he be married, hee forsakes his wife, leaues his children, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
his friendes, onely to satisfie his lust with the loue of a base
whoore, who when he hath spent all vpon her and hee brought to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie,
beateth him out lyke the Prodigall childe, and for a finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
brings him if to the fairest ende to beg, if to the second, to the
gallowes, or at the last and worst, to the Pockes, or as preiuditiall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
I pray you Lawrence when any of you come to your confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at Tyborne, what is your last sermon that you make, that you
were brought to that wicked and shamefull ende by following of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
for to that end doo you steale to maintaine whoores, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

little grace. I will conceale my parents, kin, and Country,

about thréescore miles from London, of honest and welthy
parents, who had many children, but I their onely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and therefore the Iewell wherein they most delighted,
and more, the youngest of all, and therefore the more
fauoured: for beeing gotten in the wayning of my parents
age, they doted on me aboue the rest, and so set theyr harts
the more on fire. I was the fairest of all, and yet not more
beautifull then I was witty, in so much that beeing a pretty
Parrat, I had such quaint conceipts, and witty words in
my mouth, that the neighbours said, I was too soone wise,
to be long olde. Woulde to God, eyther the Prouerbe had
been authentical, or their sayings prophecies, then had I by
death in my nonage, buried many blemishes that my riper
yeeres brought me to. For the extreme loue of my parents,

vpon such as say, young Saints, olde deuils, it is no doubt
a deuillish and damnable saying, for what is not bent in the
Cradle, will hardly be bowed in the Sadle. My selfe am an
instance, who after I grew to be sixe yeeres olde, was sette
to Schoole, where I profited so much, that I writ and read
excellently well, playd vpon the virginals, Lute &amp; Cytron,
and could sing prick-song at the first sight: in so much, as by
that time I was twelue yeeres olde, I was holden for the
most faire, and best qualitied young girle in all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but with this, bewailed of my wel-wishers, in that my
parents suffered me to be so wanton.</p>
               <p>But they so tenderly affected mee, and were so blinded
with my excellent quallities, that they had no insight into
my ensuing follies. For I growing to be thirteene yeere
old, feeling the rayne of liberty loose on myne owne necke,
began with the wanton Heyfer, to ayme at mine own wil,
and to measure content, by the sweetnes of mine owne
thoughts, in so much, that pryde creeping on, I beganne to
prancke my selfe with the proudest, and to holde it in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
that any in the Parish, should exceede me in brauery.
As my apparrell was costly, so I grew to be licencious, and
to delight to be lookt on, so that I haunted and frequented
all feasts and weddings, &amp; other places of merry meetings,
where, as I was gazed on of many, so I spared no glaunces

               <p>Thus as an vnbridled Colte, I carelesly led foorth my

beganne déepely (oh let me blush at this confession) to fall in
loue with him, and so construed of all his actions, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to mine owne ouerthrowe: for as smoake will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be concealed, so loue will not bee long smothred, but will
bewray her owne secrets, which was manifest in mee, who
in my sporting with him, so bewrayed my affection, that hee
spying I fauoured him, began to strike when the yron was

hotte, and to take opportunitie by the forehead, and one day
finding me in a merry vaine, began to question with me of

suffered such a base slaue to possesse it, which many men of woorth had
desired to enioy, I waxed hold in sin &amp; grew shameles, in so much he
could not desire so much as I did grant, whereupon, seeing hee durst
not reueale it to my father to demand me in marriage, hee resolued to
carry me away secretly, and therefore wisht me to prouide for my selfe,
and to furnish mee euery way both with money and apparrell, hoping
as he sayd, that after we were departed, and my father saw wee were
married, and that no meanes was to amend it, he would giue his free
consent, and vse vs as kindly, and deale with vs as liberally as if wee
had matcht with his good wil. I that was apt to anyil, agreed to this,
and so wrought the matter, that hee carried mee away into a straunge
place, and then vsing me a while as his wife, when our mony began to
wax low, he resolued secretly to go into the Country where my father
dwelt, to heare not only how my father tooke my departure, but what
hope we had of his ensuing fauour, although I was loath to be left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in a strange place, yet I was willing to heare from my friendes,
who no doubt conceiued much heart sorrow for my vnhappy fortunes,
so that I parted with a few teares, and enioyned him, to make all the
hast he might to returne, hee being gone, as the Eagles alwaies resort
where the carrion is, so the brute being spred abroad of my bewtie, and
<pb facs="tcp:6232:18"/>
that at such an Inne laie such a fatre yoong Gentlewoman, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted
thither many braue youthfull Gentlemen and cutting compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that tickled with lust, aymed at the possession of my fauour, and
by sundry meanes sought to haue a sight of me, which I easily graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all, as a woman that counted it a glory to be wondred at by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mens eyes, insomuch that comming amongst them, I set their harts
more and more on fire, that there rose diuers brawles who should bee
most in my company, beeing thus haunted by such a troupe of lustie
Ruffiers, I beganne to finde mine owne folly, that had placst my first
affection so losely, and therefore beganne as deeply to loath him that
was departed, as earst I likte him, when hee was present, vowing in
my selfe though hee had the spoyle of my virginitie, yet neuer after
should he triumph in the possession of my fauour, and therfore beganne
I to affection these new come guests, and one aboue the rest, who was
a braue yoong Gentleman, and no lesse addicted vnto mee, then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted
vnto him, for daily hee courted mee with amorous Sonnets
and curious proude letters, and sent me Iewels, and all that I might
grace him with the name of my seruant, I returned him as louyng
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to all the rest, I made him sundry nights my bedfellow, where
I so bewitcht him with sweet wordes, that the men began deepely to
doate vpon me, insomuch that selling some portion of land that he had,
hee put it into readie money, and prouiding Horse and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
carried mee secretly away, almost as farre as the Bathe.
This was my second choyce and my second shame, thus I went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in wickednesse and delighted in chaunge, hauing left mine olde
loue to looke after some other mate more fit for her purpose, how hee
tooke my departure when hee returned I little cared, for now I had
my content, a Gentleman, yoong, lustie, and indned with good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and one that loued mee more tenderly then himselfe, thus liued
this new entertained friend and I togither vnmarried, yet as man
and wife for a while, so louingly as was to his content and my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
but as the Tygre though for a while shee hide her clawee, yet
at last shee will reueale her crueltie, and as the Agnus Castus leafe
when it lookes most drye, is then most full of moysture, so womens
wantonnesse is not quallified by their warinesse, nor doo their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for a moneth, warrant their chastitie for euer, which I prooued
true, for my supposed husband beeing euery way a man of worth could

not so couertly hide himselfe in the country, though a stranger, but that

but also to see mee being proude of any man of woorth, applaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

haue beene so fonde as to haue brought his companions into my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but rather would haue mewed mee vp as a He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that seuerall to himselfe by force, which hee could not retaine by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but the houest minded Nouice little suspected my chaunge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I God wot placed my delight, in nothing more then the desire
of new choyce, which fell out thus. Amongst the rest of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that kept him company, there was one that was his most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
and hee reposed more trust and confidence in him then in all the
rest, this Gentleman beganne to bee deepely inamoured of mee, and
shewed it by many signes which I easily perceiued, and I whose eare
was pliant to euery sweete word, and who so allowed of all that were
bewtifull, affected him no lesse, so that loue preuailing aboue friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
hee broake the matter with mee, and made not many suites in
vaine before hee obteined his purpose, for hee had what hee wisht, and
I had what contented mee, I will not confesse that any of the rest had
some sildome fauours, but this Gentleman was my second selfe; and
I loued him more for the time at the heele, then the other at the heart,
so that though the other youth beare the charges and was sir pay for
all, yet this newe friend was hee that was maister of my affections,
which kindnesse betwixt vs, was so vnwisely cloaked, that in short time
it was manifest to all our familiars which made my supposed husband
to sigh and others to smile, but hee that was hit with the horne was
pincht at the heart, yet so extreame was the affection hee bare to mee,
that he had rather conceale his greefe, then any way make me discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
so that hee smoothered his sorrow with patience, and brookt the
miurie with silence, till our loues grew so broad before, that it was a
woonder to the worlde, whereupon one day at dinner, I being verie
pleasant with his chosen friend and my choyce louer, I know not how,
but either by fortune, or it may be some set match, there was by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
there present a question popt in about womens passions, and
their mutabilitie in affection, so that the controuersie was defended,
<pb facs="tcp:6232:19"/>
                  <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> which arguments, whether a woman might haue a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
friend or no, at last it was concluded, that loue and Lordshippe
brookes no fellowship, and therefore none so base minded to beare ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall.
Hereupon arose a question about friendes that were put in trust,
how it was a high point of treason, for one to betray an other, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in loue, in so much that one gentleman at the boord, protested by a
solemne oath, that if any friend of his made priuie and fauoured witly
the sight of his mistresse whom hee loued, whether it were his wife or
no, should secretly seeke to incroach into his roome and offer him that
dishonour to partake his loue, he would not vse any other reuenge, but
at the next greeting stabbe him with his Poynado, though hee were
coudemned to death for the action. All this fitted for the humor of my
supposed husband, and strooke both mee and my friend into a quanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
but I scornfully iested at it, when as my husband taking the ball
before it fel to the ground, began to make a long discourse what faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
friends they were that would faile in loue, especially where a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
trust of the partie beloued was committed vnto them, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
to make the matter more credulous, and to quip my folly, and to

                  </gap>yd who had
been an old seruant in the house, began to grow suspitious, that there
was too much familiaritie betweene her mistresse and her maisters
friend, and vpon this watcht them diuers times so narrowly, that at
last she sound them more priuiate then either agreed with her maisters
honor, or her owne honestie, and thereupon reuealed it one day vnto her
maister, he little credulous of the light behauiour of his wife, blamed
the mayd and bad her take heed, least she sought to blemish her vertues
with slaunder, whom hee loued more tenderly then his owne life, the
mayd replied, that she spake not of enuy to him, but of meere loue she
heare vnto him, and the rather that hee might shadow such a fault in
time, and by some meanes preuent it, least if others should note it as
well as shee, his wiues good name and his friends should bee cald in
question, at these wise words spoken by so base a drug as his mayd, the
Gentleman waxed astonished and listened to her discourse, wishing her
to discouer how she knew or was so priuy to the folly of her mistresse,
or by what meanes he might haue assured proofe of it, shee tolde him
<pb facs="tcp:6232:20"/>
that to her, her owne eyes were witnesses, for shee saw them vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
togither, and please it you sir quoth shee, to faine your selfe to go
from home, and then in the backhouse to keepe you secret, I will let
you see as much as I haue manifested vnto you, vpon this the maister
agreed, and warnd his mayd not so much as to make it knowne to any
of her fellowes. Within a day or two after, the Gentleman sayd, hee
would goe a huntiug and fo rise verie early, and causing his men to
couple vp his Honndes, left his wife in bed and went abroad, assoone
as he was gone a myle from the house, he commanded his men to ryde
afore and to start the Hare and follow the chase, and wee will come
faire and softly after, they obeying their maisters charge, went theyr
wayes, and he returned by a backway to his house, and went secretly
to the place where his mayd and he had appointed. In the meane time,
the mistresse thinking her husband safe with his Houndes, sent for he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was not stacke to come, but making all the haste hee could, came and
went into the chamber, asking for the Maister of the house very famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly,
the old mayd noting all this, assoone as she knew them togither,
went and cald her maister and carried him vp by a secret pair of staires
to her mistresse chamber doore, where peeping in at a place that the
mayd before had made for the purpose, he saw more then he lookt for,
and so much as pincht him at the very heart, causing him to accuse his
wife for a strumpet and his friend for a traytor, yet for all this, valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his owne honour more then their dishonestie, thinking if he should
make an vprore, he should but ayme at his owne discredite, and cause
himself to be a laughing game to his enemies, he concealed his sorrow
with silence, and taking the mayd apart, charged her to keepe all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
whatsoeuer she had seene, euen as she esteemed of her owne life,
for if shee did bewray it to any, hee himselfe would with his Swoord
make an ende of her daies, and with that putting his hand in his sleeue,
gaue the poore mayd sixe Angels to buy her a new gowne, the wench
glad of this gift, swore solemnely to tread it vnder foote, and sith it
pleased him to conseale it, neuer to reueale it as long as she liued, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this they parted, she to her drudgery, and he to the field to his men,
where after hee had kild the Hare, hee returned home, and finding his
friend in the Garden, that in his absence had been grafting hornes in
the Chunnies, and entertained him with his woonted familiaritie, and
shewed no bad countenance to his wife, but dissembled al his thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:6232:20"/>
to the full. Assoone as dinner was done, and that he was gotten solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
by himselfe, he beganne to determine of reuenge, but not as euerie
man would haue done, how to haue brought his wife to shame, &amp; her
loue to confusion, but he busied his braines how hee might reserue his
honour inuiolate, reclaime his wife, and keep his friend, meditating a
long time how he might bring all this to passe, at last a humour fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his head, how cunningly to compasse all three and therefore he went
&amp; got him a certaine slips, which are counterfeyt peeces of mony being
brasse, &amp; couered ouer with siluer, which the common people call slips,
hauing furnished himselfe with these, hee put them in his purse, and at
night went to bed as he was wont to doo, yet not vsing the kind fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
that he accustomed, notwithstanding he abstained not from the
vse of her body, but knew his wife as afore times, and euery time hee
committed the act with her, he layd the next morning in the window a
slip, where hee was sure shee might finde it, and so many times as it
pleased him to be carnally pleasant with his wife, so many slips he still
layd down vpon her cushnet. This he vsed for the space of a fortnight,
till at last, his wife finding euery day a slip, or sometime more or lesse,
wondred how they came there, and examining her wayting maydes,
none of them could tell her any thing touching them, whereupon shee
thought to question with her husband about it, but being out of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
the next morning as he &amp; she lay dallying in bed, it came
into her minde, and she asked her husband if he layd those slippes on her
cushnet, that she of late found there, hauing neuer seene any before. I
marry did I quoth hee, and I haue layd them there vpon speciall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and it is this. Euer since I haue been married to thee, I haue dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thee honest, and therefore vsed and honored thee as my wife, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

contrary, &amp; with these eyes seeing thee play the whore with my friend
in whom I did repose all my trust, I sought not as many would haue
done, to haue reuenged in blood, but for the safetie of mine own honor,
which otherwise would haue been blemisht by thy dishonestie, I haue
bin silent, and haue neyther wronged my quandom friend, nor abused
thee, but still do hold bed with thee, that the world shall not suspect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, and to quench the desire of lust I do vse thy bodie, but not so
louingly as I would a wife, but carelesly as I would a strumpet, and
therefore euen as to a whoore, so I giue thee hyer, which is for euerie

to his friend, or to make it knowne to him that hee was priuy to their
loues. Thus the debate ended, I gesse in some kinde greeting, and the
Gentleman went abroad to see his pastures, leauing his wife in bed
full of sorrow and almost renting her heart asunder with sighs, assoone
as he was walked abroad, the Gentleman his friend came to the house
and asked for the goodman, the pander that was priuy to all their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
said, that his maister was gone abroad to see his pastures, but his
mistresse was in bed, why then saies he, I will go and raise her vp, so
comming into the chamber and kissing her, meaning as hee was wont
to haue vsed other accustomed dalliance, shee desired him to abstaine
with broken sighes &amp; her eyes full of teares, he wondring what should
make her thus discontent, asked her what was the cause of her sorow,
protesting with a solemne oath, that if any had done her iniury, he wold
reuenge it, were it with hazard of his life, she then tolde him scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to speake for weeping, that shee had a sute to mooue him in,
which if he granted vnto her, she would hold him in loue and affection
without change next her husband foreuer, he promised to do whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it were, then saies she, sweare vpon a Byble you will do it without

that whatsoeuer she requested him to do, were it to the losse of his life,
he would without exception performe it. Then she holding downe her
head and blushing, began thus. I need not quoth shee make manifest
how grosly and greeuously you and I haue both offended God, and
wronged the honest Gentleman my husband and your friend, hee put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a speciall trust in vs both, &amp; assuring such earnest affiance in your
vnfained friendship, that hee euen committeth me his wife, his loue,

constancy, in playing the harlot, that saith that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
you returned with trechery and falshood, in abusing mine honesty and
his honor, now a remorse of conscience toucheth me for my sinnes, that
I hartily repent, and vow euer hereafter to liue onely to my husband,
and therefore my sute is to you, that from hencefoorth you shall neuer
so much as motion any dishonest question vnto mee, nor seeke any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
pleasure or conuersing at my handes this is my sute, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I haue sworne you, which oath if you obserue as a faithfull gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
I will conceale from my husband what is past, and rest in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
sort your faithfull friend for euer, at this shee burst a fresh into
teares, and vttered such sighes, that he thought for very griefe her hart
would haue claue asunder. The gentleman astonied at this straunge
Metamorphesis of his mistresse, sat a good while in a maze, and at last
taking her by the hand, made this reply, so God helpe mee faire swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
I am glad of this motion, and wondrous ioyfull that God hath
put such honest thoughts into your mind, &amp; hath made you the meanes
to reclaime me from my folly, I feele no lesse remorse then you doo, in
wronging so honest a friend as your husband, but this is the frailnesse
of man, and therefore to make amends, I protest a new, neuer hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so much as in thought, as to motion you of dishonestie, onely I
craue you be silent, she promised that and so they ended. And so for that
time they parted, at noone the gentleman came home and cheerfully
saluted his wife and asked if dinner were ready, and sent for his friend,
vsing him wonderfully familiarly, giuing him no occasion of mistrust,
and so pleasantly they past away the day togither, at night when his
wife and he went to bed, shee told him all, what had past betweene her
and his friend, and how she had bound him with an oath, and that hee
voluntarily of himselfe swore, as much being hartily sory that hee had
so deepely offended so kinde a friend, the gentleman commended her
wit, and found her afterward a reclaimed woman, shee liuing so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
that she neuer gaue him any occasion of mistrust. Thus the wise
gentleman reclaimed with silence a wanton wife, and retained an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
friend.</p>
               <p>At this pleasant Tale all the boord was at a mutinie, and they said
the gentleman did passing wisely that wrought so cunningly for the
safetie of his owne honor, but highly exclaiming against such a friend
<pb facs="tcp:6232:22"/>
as would to his friend offer such villany, all condemning her that wold
be false to so louing a husband. Thus they did diuersly descant &amp; past
away dinner, but this Tale wrought litle effect in me, for as one past
grace, I delighted in chaunge, but the gentleman that was his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and my Paramour, was so touched, that neuer after hee would
touch me dishonestly, but reclaimed himselfe, abstained from me and
became true to his friend, I wondring that according to his woonted
custome, he did not seeke my company, he and I being one day in the
chamber alone, and he in his dumpes, I began to dally with him, and
to aske him why he was so straunge, and vsed not his accustomed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
to me. He solemnely made answere, that though he had playd
the foole in setting his fancy vpon an other mans wife, &amp; in wronging
his friend, yet his conscience was now touched with remorse, &amp; euer
since he heard the Tale afore rehearsed, hee had vowed in himselfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to do my husband the like wrong againe: my husband quoth I, he
is none of mine, he hath brought me from my friends and keepes mee
here vnmarried, and therefore am I as free for you as for him, &amp; thus
began to grow clamorous, because I was debard of my lust, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
seeing me shamelesse, wisht me to be silent, and sayd, although
you be but his friend, yet he hold you as deare as his wife, and therfore
I will not abuse him, neither would I wish you to be familiar with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, seeing you haue a friend that loues you so tenderly, much
good counsaile he gaue me, but all in vaine, for I scorned it, and began
to hate him, and resolued both to be ridde of him and my supposed hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
for falling in an other familiar of my husbands, I so inueagled
him with sweet words, that I caused him to make a peece of mony to
steale me away, and so carry me to London, where I had not liued long
with him, ere he seeing my light behauiour, left mee to the world, and
to shift for my selfe. Here by my example may you note the inconstant
life of Courtezens and common harlots, who after they haue lost their
honestie, care not who grow into their fauour, nor what villany they
commit, they fancy all as long as crownes last, and only ayme at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and ease, they cleaue like Caterpillars to the tree, and consume
the fruit where they fall, they be Vultures that praie on men aliue, and
like the Serpent sting the bosome wherein they are nourished. I may
best discourse their nature, because I was one of their profession, but
now beeing metamorphosed, I holde it meritorious for mee to warne
women from being such wantons, and to giue a caueat to men, least
<pb facs="tcp:6232:22"/>
they addict themselues to such stragling strumpettes, as loue none,

Courtizins, to my selfe, who now being brought to London, and left
here at randon, was not such a housedoue while any friend stated with
me, but that I had visite some houses in London, that could harbour
as honest a woman as my selfe, when as therefore I was left to my
selfe, I remoued my lodging, and gat mee into one of those houses of

to allure or draw in wanton passengers, refusing none that wold with

of euerie desperate Ruffian, till on a time, there resorted to our house a

would be ashamed to haue any of their friendes see them in the act of
generation, or performing the rightes of marriage which is lawfull,

               <p>SO it fell out, that a Gentleman was sicke and purblinde, and went
to a good honest mans house to soiourne, and taking vp his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
grew so sick, that the goodman of the house hired a woman to keep
and attend day and night vpon the Gentleman, this poore woman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a good conscience, was carefull of his welfare and lookte to his
dyet, which was so slender, that the man although sicke, was almost
famisht, so that the woman would no longer staie, but bad his Hoste
prouide him of some other to watch with him, sith it greeued her to see
a man lye and starue for want of foode, especially being set on the score
for meate and drinke in the space of a fortnight, foure ponndes. The
goodman of the house at last, hearing how that poore woman did finde
fault with his scoring, the Gentleman not only put her out of doores
without wages, but would haue arrested her, for taking away his good
name, and defaming and slaundring him, and with that calling one of
his neighbours to him, sayd neighbour, whereas such a had to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
