            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T my returne from <hi>London</hi> late last night, I met with
some scattered reports of your dealing with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Practicall Catechisme,</hi> in a late Sermon
or Sermons of yours in this City; within a few
dayes after, I met you at Col. <hi>Hammonds</hi> lodgings,
and signified my intentions to goe out of Towne the next day.
Now though the care I have of the reputation of that Author be
not so great or passionate, as to put me upon the least thought or
designe of working any proportionable revenge on him, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
publiquely to defame him; or to make you any return,
save onely of my prayers to God for you, that he will forgive
you all the trespasses that either this, or any other dealing of yours
hath been guilty of, and that he will give you a right Judgement
in all things; yet because I would not be in danger to beleeve
any thing of you causlessly, I thought my selfe obliged in Justice
to you, to desire from you (who know best what you said)
an exact account in writing (as farre as your memory will serve)
of all that you said in publike, either at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> or <hi>Carfax,</hi>
wherein the Author of that Catechisme was concerned. I do much
abuse my selfe in the notion I have of Christian Justice, if that doe
not oblige you to answer this request of</p>

            <p>I Returne you thanks, and am before-hand with you for Prayers,
the Lord pardon, and lead you into all truth and holinesse. Truly
Sir, I had said as much of the <hi>Practicall Catechisme</hi> as I did say,
though you had beene in Towne, nay, had beene (where you
might learne something of my brethren) at Church. What I said
of the Author of that Catechisme, was (your Friends being Judges)
as such as hee deserved: some thinke I spoke too highly in his
commendations: But to the point; first you say you are obliged in
Justice to mee to desire an exact account of my Sermons: Sure
this is somewhat more then equall Justice to mee, it is to exercise
Jurisdiction over mee. Secondly, you doe much abuse your selfe
in the notion of Christian justice, if you conceive mee obliged in
Christian justice to give you an account this night (being to preach
to morrow) of what I preached about ten dayes agoe.</p>
            <p>I will deale plainely with you, I have not said all that I intend
to say of that Catechisme, because it seemes to evacuate the morall
Law, under pretence of filling up its vacuities, and it doth in effect
overthrow the sum and substance of the Gospel. Sir, this is more
then I said in either Sermon; But you shall (in due time, place, and
manner, as soone as my weighty occasions will permit) receive the
reasons of this assertion.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am sorry I was so mistaken in you, as to make a request
to which you doe not by your answer return mee one word,
nor are so favourable as to promise me any at your greater
leasure. Having had this experience of you, I shall make no
more new questions (to which the former part of your Letter
might tempt one that were curious) as who of my Friends they
were, which were so well satisfied with what you said of the
Author of that Catechisme; or, who againe, that envyed him
the elogy which you affirme your selfe to have bestowed upon
him. I shall rather take occasion from these two affirmations
of yours, to inforce my one former Petition, that you will
commit to paper what you said, and give me leave to passe a
judgment whether the Author be obliged to thanke you for
civilities, or (as my present intelligence goes) to clear himself from
your accusations I am willing to flatter my self by the second leaf
of your Letter (begun with a [Sir, what I said of the practicall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism]
and so abruptly broke off) that you were once in so
good humour, as to design me the favour I petition'd for; and
if I am deceived, yet have I now more reason to importune it;
because, first, by your present mistaking of my few Lines: and
secondly, returning an answer very distant from the particular
proposed by mee, I am enclined to beleeve it possible that your
exceptions to the Author of the Catechisme might be mistakes
also, (and then I would hope I might rectifie, and you retract
those mistakes;) Or else, secondly, that your answers might be
somewhat from the matter, and the shewing you that might to
you be usefull also. And if neither of these should prove true,
I shall farther invite you to that charity by a serious promise,
that whatever you to my apprehension justly object against, or
confute in that Author, shall by Gods grace tend to my edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And having that preparation of mind, I hope your
prayer will be heard, that God will <hi>pardon, and lead me into
all truth and holinesse.</hi> That you may not thinke I have beene
unjust in mentioning such blemishes in your Letter (and that
I may performe to you, what I desire of you) I shall first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the mistakes in it. The first is, your interpreting my desire
to you for <hi>an exercise of Iurisdiction over you,</hi> which that it may
appeare probable, you say, <hi>I desire an exact account of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96915:4"/>
Where first, Sir, to <hi>desire an account,</hi> is not to <hi>exercise ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction:</hi>
Secondly, the account I desired, was not of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or of any part of them, saving onely of that wherein the
Author of the Catechisme was concerned, and that I then told
you I was obliged (in Justice to you) to desire, and I still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
I am so, it being but just, to use this obvious conducible
meanes to keep me from beleeving you to have said any thing
but what you did say, when perhaps the relations of others may
bee unjust to you, (and tempt mee to be so also) and no body
can well assure mee of either, but your selfe. What you meane
by <hi>[more then an equall justice to you]</hi> I shall not demand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I would make haste to conclude this paper: yet because I
suppose you would intimate by that phrase, that it was not Justice
to you (for if it were more then equall on your side, you would
not complaine; and besides you say, it is exercising jurisdiction
over you, which for mee to doe over you, were I confesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice)
I must further evidence it were not, by naming you the
particulars which are reported to mee from your Sermon, which
are such false suggestions, that nothing but your saying, and saying
truly that you sayd them not, can cleare you from a great fault,
of which that I may not charge you untruly, I had no sure way,
but to make that request to you. The particulars are four:</p>
            <p>First, That you told your Auditory that there was a Catechisme,
and never a word of the Trinity in it. Of this I desire you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
mee whether you said it or no. For if you did, there was
great injustice in it. For 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you had mentioned the full title
of the Book, not a Catechisme (to which it may seeme proper
to treat of the Trinity) but a Catechisme with a restriction to
one kind of matter a Practicall Catechisme, there had then been no
great matter of wonder or complaint, that that speculative
mysterie had not been handled.</p>
            <p>But then 2, the very first lines of that Booke would farther
have prevented that objection. For the Scholar there professing
himselfe to have attained in some measure to the understanding
of the principles of Religion proposed by our Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme
(and that by this very Catechists care, who had often
done it in his Parish, and at this time chose to doe somewhat
else) and the beliefe of the Trinity being part of that Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,
and of those instructions, there is a cleare reason why
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96915:4"/>
in the subsequent discourse the Doctrine of the Trinity is not han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,
because it is supposed as a <hi>praecognitum</hi> before it.</p>
            <p>3 This speech if it were yours, would seeme to have some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
in it, and (whether meant by you, or not) be thought by
others to affix on the Author either denying of the Trinity, or being
guilty of some errour in that point, which he was willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale:
and that this Author is guilty of neither, I beleeve any man
will be convinced by that Catechisme, <hi>viz.</hi> in the last lines of it,
where there is expresse mention of, and prayer directed to the
blessed Trinity coaeternall, to which one infinite Majesty, &amp;c. In
which few words are disclaimed (though not confuted) as many
of the errors of the <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> as could be well
expected in that matter, I mean the words Trinity, and Unity,
eternity of each Person, and coaeternity.</p>
            <p>The second thing that I heard of, was in the matter of Oaths,
that the Catechisme had trained up youth very ill, in giving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
to vaine Oaths, which you are said to have concluded from
these words in the Catechisme, where in answer to this question,
Is the third Commandement in <hi>Exod.</hi> [Thou shalt not take the
name of God in vaine] no more then Thou shalt not forsweare
thy selfe? It is answered, No more undoubtedly—for there,
I am told, you stopt, and from thence fell into some expressions
against the Doctrine and Booke. If this were so, then were you
very unjust to your Auditory, in with-holding from them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents,
which would certainely have kept them in charity
with the Author. I beseech you, Sir, read on, and you shall
finde that there is there as severe an interdiction of all kinde of
swearing in a Christian (and sure such are all to whom this
Catechisme was meant) as can bee imagined: in plaine words,
<hi>a totall universall prohibition of swearing it selfe, making that as
unlawfull now, as perjury was before,</hi> and a great deale more, so
extremely strict, that I have by learned men been asked whether
that Author were not too severe against all kinde of swearing,
but (I thanke God) never heard it fancyed, that there was any
ground or appearance of liberty to bee drawne thence. All that
that Author can differ from you in, is his opinion, that the
words of the third Commandement belong expresly to perjury
onely; and for that opinion hee brings the plaine words of Christ,
which reads it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>thou shalt not forsweare, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96915:5"/>
Secondly, the importance of the word in the originall, where
to lift up (or take) the name of God, signifies to sweare, and
<hi>[vainely]</hi> signifies [falsely,] and so the very word used in <hi>Exod.</hi>
and there rendred <hi>[vaine]</hi> is <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. in the ninth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
rendered [false.] To these Arguments, if you can give a
satisfactory answer, he may chance to change his opinion in that.
But however, the insisting on Christs direct punctuall prohibition
will sure prove it a sufficient calumny in him that shall hence
conclude the Author to have given youth any liberty in this
kind. I would no man were more guilty of vaine Oaths, in
himself or others, then that Catechist is, and resolves to bee.
Having said thus much, I shall adde <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and submission to the meanest, the Author thought fit to
adde in a last edition (intended above a yeare since, but sold in
this Towne above a month agoe) after these words [no more
undoubtedly] these words, by way of explication of what before
hee meant [In the primary intention of the phrase] for to that
only hee professes to have designed that speech, never thinking
to deny or doubt, but that vaine Oaths (though not swearing
simply taken <hi>i. e.</hi> all kinde of swearing) would there bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
also though not primarily, yet by way of reduction;
which you may guesse to have been his meaning, because hee adds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that perhaps foolish, wanton using of Gods name (though not in
oaths, for one may use Gods name and not sweare) surely profane
using of it, is forbidden by that reduction. And (I pray) doe you
guesse whether it be likely that hee which said, perhaps foolish
using of Gods name was in the law forbidden, and all kinde of
voluntary swearing under the Gospel, could justly bee charged as
a friend to young men, in giving them any of that liberty. If you
can thinke it possible, yet read on to the end of that matter, and I
will be bound you shall think otherwise.</p>
            <p>Your next exception (I am told) was, that in the matter
of repentance, the Author makes inclination to sinne an infelicity,
not a sinne. This, if you said, you are much to blame. For
in the place whereto that refers, 'tis cleare that under the generall
words, of [All kinds and sorts of sinnes] the first kinde named is
weaknesses, frailties, pollutions of our natures, our pronenesse and
inclination to sinne. Which being positively said, would, in
the judgement of any ingenuous man have helped to interpret that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96915:5"/>
which follows [as infelicities, if not as sinnes] thus not to deny
them to bee sinnes, within two lines after it had been affirmed they
were, but that even in their opinion that tooke them to be onely
infelicities, not sinnes, (as sure some doe, when they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to) they were yet to bee to them matter of humiliation,
true sorrow and griefe, as the words are cleare, no where so much
as intimating that they are not sinnes, unlesse when hee saith they
are no actuall sinnes, which I hope you wil not say they are, when
not consented to.</p>
            <p>Your next exception, (I am told) was about justification, but
my relations differ in the particular. Some say your quarrell was,
that hee makes faith a condition, no instrument. If that were
it, I pray tell me whether you thinke faith a physicall instrument
of justification, (as for a morall instrument, that he in termes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges)
or when justification is onely an act of Gods through
Christ pardoning of sin, and accounting just, you can imagine that
faith hath any kinde of reall though instrumentall efficiency in
that worke, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether faith in any such sense can pardon sin, or
pronounce just, or whether it bee not sufficient to acknowledge it
an instrument in receiving of Christ, and all other acts of the man
as Christian, and onely a condition or capacity in the subject to
make capable of Gods act upon him in justification? this is the
sum of what the Author saith in that point, and shal be farther clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to you, if that were your exception. Others tell mee it was
concerning the priority of sanctification before justification.
Which point, as it is there stated, can bee no matter of quarrell
to any that affirmes the receiving of Christ to bee pre-required to
justification. For as that is no more then that faith is pre-required
(in the true notion of faith, and that wherein Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
it) so is it by that Author said, that onely that sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is precedent to justification, which is the cordiall assent to
Christs commands and promises, giving up the heart to him,
resolution of obedience; not the actuall performance and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of those vowes, for that is acknowledged there to bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
justification. These are the particulars I have heard of, and
have now reason to beleeve, that of all them you are not
guilty, especially of the first, though 'twas (even at <hi>London)</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
told mee from you. And therefore I doe by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
acquit you of that, but yet thinke it not amisse to have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96915:6"/>
mentioned that report, that by it you may see (what alone I
have now in hand to prove) how truly I told you, that to avoid the
danger of beleeving any thing of you causlesly, I thought my self
obliged in justice to you, to beg an exact account of what you said.
I have been too long on the evidencing your first mistake, I would
you had answered my request, and then you had taken away all
excuse of that prolixity.</p>
            <p>Your second mistake was, that you conceived mee to have said
that 'twas a piece of Christian justice in you to have given mee an
account this night, &amp;c. wherein you were faine to adde to my
words <hi>[this night]</hi> whereas I onely mentioned an answer, but
assigned you no time for it, but punctually required the Messenger
to desire to know, when it would bee seasonable, and hee should
call for it; and accordingly, though I have this evening written
this rejoynder, yet that I may not trouble you, I meane to respite
the sending it till Munday. And yet by the way, I conceive it
had been as easie for you to have given mee what I desired, as that
Letter in stead of it, unlesse it be easier for you to write out of
your invention then your memory. I am sure it had been the
savingst way, for then you had escaped this importunity. The
distance of your answer from my proposition I shall not need
to put you in minde of. That which you meane to adde more
of the Catechisme, is not all, nor (if my intelligence faile me not)
any part of what you have said already: and 'tis but diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to tell mee you will say more, and give mee reason of that
more, when as yet much lesse is desired of you, and cannot bee
obtained. I shall when you are at leisure, desire all your heape of
exceptions against that poore creature, that (I will bee deposed
for it) meant no man any greater malice, then to land him safe
at heaven the nearest and surest way that the Author could imagin.
But I will not yet importune you for any more then you have yet
delivered publikely in this City. By granting me this uprightly
and candidly, you will make me really rejoyce to hear that you
shall have taken any further notice of me; but if you shall persist to
deny me this first request, you will utterly discourage</p>

            <p>YOu are pleased to mention your designe of further severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Authour in the matter of the morall law, which
(say you) it seemes to evacuate under pretence of filling up its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuities;
and adde, that it doth in effect overthrow the summe and
substance of the Gospel. The latter of these (I confesse) would be
a little strange to me, that he that labours to elevate the Gospel-precepts
(as you think, too much) above the Law, should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the summe or substance of the Gospell. I must professe to
beleeve that whatever charge can be affixt to that Doctrine, that
would not bee it, but rather that it labours to raise the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to a greater height then it would bear, or indeed to lessen
the Law, not to alter any thing in the Gospell. In this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
I must professe my self posed, and utterly unable to conjecture
what you mean, till you are so kind as to adde your reasons. One
thing onely I meant to serve you in by this Postscript (because
I see that, unlesse others have deceived mee, you may possibly
bee deceived in passing judgement on that Book) and that is, to
tell you, that you have a hard taske to prove that that Authour
doth at all evacuate the Law morall (unlesse you guard your
selfe by that cautious word, that <hi>it seemes</hi> to evacuate it, and
that it may, and not doe it really.) For you may please to
marke from mee, (who know the sense and spirit of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
better then you) that hee saith not positively that Christ
added to the Law new precepts, but one of these two, either
new precepts, or new light; and concludes that either of these
two will serve his turne, and enhance the Christians obligation;
and addes, that hee that will acknowledge that Christ requires
more of his Disciples or Christians now, then the Jewes by
any cleare revelation had been convinced to be necessary before,
did grant as much in effect as he desired to bee granted. And
yet farther, in the close, that if any will contend, and shew as
universall plain obliging precepts under the Law, as there are
in the fifth of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> he shall bee glad to see them, and
not contend with him, so that hee will bring the Jews up to
us, and not us downe to the Jewes; professing that the onely
danger which hee had used all his diligence to prevent. Now

                  <p>I Was not the first, no nor the last, that endevoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the dangerous errors of your much admired Catechisme,
yet I doe not hear that you have fallen foule upon any but on my
selfe. I acknowledge my selfe the weakest, and yet am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that Gods power will bee manifested in my weaknesse, that
God may have all the glory. I received your Rejoynder upon
Munday: that day I was forced to goe out of Town to speake
with a Gentleman; I was to preach yesterday morning, and to
performe some exercise in the afternoon for the satisfaction of
some that are much seduced, this Friday morning I return you
what I can, and hope it will give you some satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Sir, your messenger forgot your charge, and never told mee
that you expected an answer when I was at leasure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I scribled somewhat in haste, as now I doe, for I have not
one houre in a day free from disturbance.</p>
                  <p>Your errors were more solidly refuted by two of my Reverend
Brethren, that are both of them Seniors to you: they would have
been able to have given you better satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>You desire to know what I said at <hi>Carfax.</hi> I tooke notice of
that passage <hi>page</hi> 243. of your last edition, where you speake to
this effect <hi>[That the holy Ghost was our advocate in setling a Ministery
to pray and intercede for their severall Congregations (and enabling
them in the very Apostles time to forme a Liturgy to continue in the
Church to that end) and thereby helping our infirmities, and teaching
us to pray as wee ought.]</hi> I said, I should bee glad to see that
Liturgy which you say was then formed; And 2 was to bee

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was not much taken with your notion of Justice, but I shall
gratifie your desire, being now <hi>invited to charity by your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
promise and preparation of minde</hi> to entertaine the truth, if
God be pleased to discover it to you by so weake an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as I confesse my selfe to bee. You have changed and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
your phrase, you did not stoope so low in your Letter,
as you doe in your Rejoynder (as you are pleased to terme it)
to <hi>beg an account:</hi> Truly Sir, I did stumble at those hard words, <hi>exact
account,</hi> considering that you have exercised jurisdiction hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in a Countrey, where I am now seated by the Parliament.
You complaine of <hi>false suggestions,</hi> I pray God forgive them that
suggested so many false accusations against mee to you, who have
(as I perceive) more worth in you, then to beleeve them.</p>
            <p>1. It is reported that I complained of you to my Auditory,
because you did not handle the Trinity in your Catechisme,
nay, <hi>that there was not a word of the Trinity in that Catechisme:</hi>
I beleeve Mr. <hi>Digle</hi> will bee so candid, as to assure you that
this is a false suggestion. But give me leave, Doctor, to deale
plainely with you, there is an accusation framed against you by
your owne Apology, for you speake in the language of you
know whom, when you tell mee, that I need not <hi>wonder if the
speculative mystery of the Trinity bee not handled in a Practicall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme.</hi>
Beleeve it, the Doctrine of the Trinity is a Practicall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96915:8"/>
mystery, the very foundation and ground-worke of the mystery
of godlinesse. The blessed Trinity is not onely the object of
our faith, but of our Worship too; nay, the Doctrine of the
Trinity hath by Gods blessing a comfortable and quickning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
into the maine passages of the life and conversation of
all Orthodox and judicious Christians. I hope, I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you of your Baptisme, or tell you that a Sacramentall
Covenant is Practicall. Sir, rectifie that mistake, and I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
the suggester.</p>
            <p>Your next reason concernes the Church-Catechisme, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you meane that Catechisme in the Common-prayer-book:
now truly Sir, I must confesse that I like that Catechisme farre
better then your Practicall Catechisme: and your Friends will
tell you, that you might have contented your selfe with that
Catechisme, unlesse you could have made a better.</p>
            <p>To your third reason I answer, that I did once in <hi>London</hi> shew
that passage, which you cite out of your prayer, to assure a
friend of yours, that you did acknowledge the Trinity, though
you maintaine many errours, broached by them that deny the
coeternall Trinity in unity. I hasten to your second report.</p>
            <p>2. Concerning your exposition of the third Commandement,
I said, the youths, &amp;c. had learnt the Art of swearing as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as their Catechisme; and added, that I did not wonder at
it, when I read such a passage in a Practicall Catechisme prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>Oxford;</hi> as you may also read, if you begin at the eighth
Section of the second Booke (I adde these words now, because
I have sent home the <hi>Oxford</hi> edition, and cite it according to the
last edition,) where the eloquent Author (to whom for parts,
gifts, learning, I acknowledge my selfe farre inferiour) being
desired by his Scholar to weed out the vice of swearing, lest
it should take too deep root in young men, and get into fashion,
doth assure his Scholar that after this Preface, Ye have heard, &amp;c.
the first part of the Precept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 33. [Thou shalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
thy selfe] is clearely the third Commandement: but the
latter part [But shalt performe, &amp;c.] is taken out of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Law to explaine the meaning of the former, and to
expresse it to bee (as literally it sounds) against perjury or
non-performance of promissory oaths: where note, there's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
enough for assertory oaths, for the third Commandement
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96915:8"/>
is not meant of assertory oaths, as is plainly said afterwards. But
lest the Scholar should thinke that this was not the <hi>full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
of the Law sent by <hi>Moses,</hi> hee is prompted to put the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
home, whether there <hi>bee no more</hi> meant in the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
then [Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe?] The
Catechist answers sadly and peremptorily [No more undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly.]
This is a flat deniall indeed, which requires full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of belief in the Scholar, as it doth note confidence in the
Teacher, <hi>no more,</hi> and <hi>undoubtedly</hi> no more. I feare that the <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
[perhaps] and imaginary superaddition</hi> following (of which I
may have faire opportunity to speake more hereafter) will not
bee so effectuall to restraine the Youths or Doctors from swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
as the unquestionable command of God. I hope, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the third Commandement is not generally received in
this University, and doubt not but some will be so ingenuous as to
protest against it.</p>
            <p>Sit, I have no more then this in my notes concerning that passage
in your Catechisme, though I was sufficiently prepared by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have discoursed at large upon that Argument: whether
the clock struck, or what other diversion there was, I know not;
I beleeve I said not much more, but whether I delivered more or
lesse at that time, I am not able to give you an exact account, it was
not a businesse worth a designe to passe over such excuses as you
alledge for your selfe.</p>
            <p>1 A totall universall prohibition of swearing it selfe, and
making it is as unlawfull now as perjury was
before,<note place="margin">Christus persecit tertium manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, nec in rebus veris nomen Domini invocare permittit, nisi talc quid a nobis exigat dei gloria. <hi>Vide Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium de Divinit. Christi, &amp; Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism. Racoviens.</hi>
               </note> is a doctrine which you cannot prove,
unlesse you mince your <hi>totall</hi> and <hi>universall</hi>
with so many qualifications, that at last you
lose the totall in a cypher. You say, as <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
and the rest doe, that I must not take an
oath but for Gods glory and the publike good; now this is
not to forbid swearing it selfe,<note place="margin">Non assumes nomen Domini dei tui gratis, frustra, temere, in ullum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, uti viri diffusissimae eruditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis passim. Mendacium prohibetur hoc in loco, quia mendacium est gratis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, vanum, nihil.</note> but <hi>unnecessary
swearing:</hi> what's become of your <hi>totall</hi> now?
Did the perfect Law of God give men leave to
to take vain oaths, so vain as that God should
have no glory, nor men any good by them?
Why, sure, it was by this Argument lawfull
to lift up the soule to vanity in a sense intolerably bad. 2 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96915:9"/>
our difference, it is this: you undertooke to prove that
by the third Commandement, there was <hi>no more meant,</hi> then that
a man should not forsweare himselfe. Can you conclude this out
of all your premises in the Catechisme? your ingenuity would
not permit you to frame such a conclusion, and therefore you
conclude that answer of yours which begins C. <hi>No more undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The last editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>London,</hi> pag. 120.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus, [By all which it is cleare, that to take Gods
name in vaine is to forsweare ones selfe.] You doe not adde,
[and no more] which was the point in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">

               </note>
between the Scholar and the Catechist, and
therefore that should have been proved, and
in the conclusion inferred. 3 You appeale to
Christ the best Judge. Christ saith; that whatsoever oath is
unnecessarily taken (so you must say, as I have proved before)

forbid all evill; or all devilish oaths? 4 That the
word is rendered [false] sometimes, I grant; that it is as properly,
if not more properly, rendred [vaine] you cannot deny; and if
you consult <hi>Aben-Ezra, R. Selomo, &amp;c.</hi> they will assure you that
wee are not to lift up or take the name of God vainely:<note place="margin">

not goe about to prove that the Jewes saw this truth as clearly
as we doe, but I can prove that they saw and acknowledged it,
and that is sufficient for mee to prove against your assertion.

<hi>Exod. 20. 7. Deut.</hi> 5. 11. 6 You know, that the primary and
principall signification of the word is not [false] but [vaine,]
and every man that hath looked into the Hebrew,<note place="margin">Vide Stegman, Photin.</note> gives you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
enough. 7 You know, that others tell you, that if the
primary intention had beene to forbid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing,<note place="margin">Non assumes nomen Domini gratis sive frustra, ut si non jures in ejus nomine nisi ob necessitatem; etiam veritas non est juranda nisi ob neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitatem. <hi>Vide Pagnini thesaurum, curâ Merceri editum,</hi> pag. 2186.</note> divers other words or phrases would
have been used in all probability, such as the
holy Ghost uses in other places; learned men
are bold to name divers, but I am not so bold.
I might say a great deale more, if I had a mind
to wrangle with you about the primary intention: but that is
not the question between you and mee; onely, you have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in a manner that the edition of your booke printed at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> had in the judgement of Learned men somewhat questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96915:9"/>
You tell mee of the last edition of your Book at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
I answer, 1 That I saw one edition printed at <hi>London,</hi>
and compared it with the <hi>Oxford</hi> edition; what difference there
is between them, it is your part to shew. 2 As for that edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you talke of, sold in <hi>Oxford</hi> about a moneth agoe, that was
a fortnight before I preached; truly I bought that edition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
You see I was at some cost and paines to know your minde.
3 I read this last edition, and saw no difference between that
and the other in this point about the meaning of the third
Commandement. 4 I asked others, and they told mee that
there were some additions at the end of this last edition. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
those additions, and then concluded that I might take it
for granted that was your opinion which was to bee found in
all three editions. 5 You now referre mee to that last edition,
and tell mee that you have <hi>added</hi> somewhat to those words [No
more undoubtedly] by way of explication; good Sir, say, Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. 6. I have looked over those additions once againe, with
the best eyes I have, and finde nothing about the primary inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the phrase; You say, you added it; and where should
I looke for an addition, but amongst your additions? you see
how hard it is to finde your explication. Your Printer and you
may well make a confessing apology; for the additions to the
120 <hi>page,</hi> concern nothing but perjury or sacriledge. 7 I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
on, to see whether it was not inserted afterwards, till I came
to the end of your additions, and there I found some alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
your last reserve, which (I confesse) I did not peruse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I preached: my reason was, because you call them <hi>[Lesse
remarkable alterations]</hi> and therefore I thought very innocently,
that you had onely corrected some literall mistakes; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my conjecture, I there finde not onely some alteration,
but (what I blesse God for) a direct recantation of sundry parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
and I hope you will see cause to recant much more. I
will continue my prayers for you, and doe what I can to help
you to some new light to discerne old spirituall rules which
were given by God in the time of <hi>Moses.</hi> Sir, seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the carriage of this businesse, and tell me whether your
patience or mine hath been more exercised? Take another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
the sixth if you please, will you say there is <hi>no more,
undoubtedly no more</hi> meant by that, but the actuall taking away
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96915:10"/>
the life of a man? no, you answer more fairely, <hi>pag.</hi> 99. and
why then could you not have interpreted the third Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement
as clearely? 3 Consider that there are three editions of your
Book abroad, every man will not bee at the same cost and pains
that I have been; doe you make the sad and wofull inference.
4 Look into the Treatises of Learned men; doe any say that
there is no more, undoubtedly no more meant in a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but what is directly <hi>primâ facie</hi> presented? is that which is to
bee reduced to a command, not meant in that Commandement,
to which it is properly reduced? 5 In these X words or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
words should not be too much restrained, but
taken in their latitude. 6 Is it proper for a man that hath said,
<hi>No more undoubtedly no more is meant,</hi> to come in with a <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
perhaps</hi> afterwards, and say perhaps there is more meant? 7 Your
lesse remarkable addition is a plaine recantation. 8 It is more for
Gods honour and yours, to make a free, noble, solemn recantation,
and (now you have deceived the Kingdom with three editions) to
doe all things like your selfe, ingenuously: a worthy action lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
its grace, and our brethren lose their share of benefit by it,
when done with so much reservednesse, that others cannot well
take notice of it for their edification. Pray Sir, let your recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
bee as remarkable as your seduction; doe not put it at
the fag-end of some <hi>lesse remarkable alterations,</hi> acknowledge that
you were seduced by—into this opinion, and recant with
observation, lest others be seduced by so many hundred Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes
as are dispersed throughout the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But it may bee that you will deny that you have made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation.
Truly Sir, first the addition of those words <hi>[in the
primary intention of the phrase.]</hi> 2 The putting in of <hi>[Idle]</hi> and
blotting out of <hi>[perhaps]</hi> which did much affront your <hi>[No more
undoubtedly.]</hi> 3 The change of these words [the particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law was of Promissory (nor Assertory) oaths]
for these [The matter was peculiarly of promissory, not onely of
assertory oaths,] all these three together will amount to a round
recantation, considering that in three editions you had said, there
was <hi>No more, and undoubtedly no more</hi> forbidden in the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
then the breach of promissory oaths.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, consider, that if this amendment had been before <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
had been taken, or if you would say that it (as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96915:10"/>
edition of your Book) was intended, before you were in
danger to bee called to an account for this and many things
of worse consequence, your recantation would bee more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.
I spake to you as a friend, and speake not out of my
owne breast, for I doe but repeate the censures of other men.
For my owne prart, you have made a solemne profession un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your hand to give mee satisfaction, but how will you satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
other men? 10. Yet I must professe, that I doe not like that
expression of yours [Neverthinking to deny or doubt, but that
vaine oaths <hi>would bee</hi> forbidden there also.] Doe you mean that
they were forbidden by God when <hi>Moses</hi> published the Law, or
would bee forbidden afterwards by a superaddition? <hi>Would bee</hi>
is not so cleare an expression as is desired. 11. I doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that expression of yours, when you say, [That in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and submission to the meanest, the Author thought fit
to adde.] If you meane it of mee, I take it kindly, for I did
speake to your friends at <hi>London</hi> about you, and they promised
to tell you positively of it, and I spoke for that end; for I doe
respect you more then you thinke I doe: and some worthy
friends both of yours and mine know, that neare upon tenne
yeares agoe wee did exchange some Letters about your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning certaine vacuities in the morall Law of God.
12. But Sir, you should consider that Learned men have told
you of this errour, and therefore say, in submission to better
Judgements. 13. Say, in submission to the greatest, even to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi>
the God of glory, I will abase my selfe, recant my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and acknowledge the perfection of his morall spirituall
Law. Surely it is meet to bee said to God, &amp;c. <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 31, 32.
I beseech, that you will weep over those two Verses, and then
read that passage, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 38. Christ came downe from heaven
to doe the will of God, &amp;c. Oh, doe you come downe from
your Criticismes, come downe from your notions, your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
superadditions; which you looke upon as a kind of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and endeavour to doe the will of your Father, revealed in
his perfect and spirituall Law, and I'll warrant you you'll finde
it so perfect, without any superadditions, that your Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
obedience shall not excell or transcend that excellent rule;
nay, you will confesse that you cannot see an <hi>end of its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and you <hi>will hate every false way.</hi> Pardon mee, if I seem to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96915:11"/>
preach to you; the Lord set it home upon your heart.</p>
            <p>3. The next report is, <hi>that you made inclination to sinne an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity,
not a sinne:</hi> I said, that the Author of that Catechisme
did acknowledge that godly sorrow was to be conceived <hi>for all
kinds and sorts of sinne:</hi> but when hee descends to particulars,
hee speakes with so much irresolution, as if hee doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our aptnesse to fall into all sinne, were an infelicity onely or
a sinne.</p>
            <p>Sir, your expression is inexcusable, and your apology doth
no way satisfie. Truly Sir, you must fall downe at a Throne of
grace, and beg pardon of God, and you must speake more posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
or else you will not bee able to give satisfaction to impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
men.</p>
            <p>1 You speake of pollutions of nature: sure that expression is
more proper to denote actuall sinnes, then originall sinne, which
is one entire, universall, and naturall pollution. 2 Every one
that is of age to conceive godly sorrow, hath actually consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the corruption of his nature, hee hath cherished it, and
been pleased with it. 3 You seeme to imply, that there must
needs bee some consent given to every actuall sinne; Sir, that is
yet to bee proved on your part; for you are too magisteriall,
and so much given to dictates, that you may well stand to bee
perpetuall Dictator in Divinity; every point of a Catechisme
should bee exactly proved. 4 You seeme either to recant what
you said before, or at least to doubt whether these pollutions
bee infelicities onely, or sinne. 5 The danger is the greater,
because you expresse such a grand point Sceptically; there are
indeed too many that say, <hi>The corruption of our nature is rather
an infelicity then a sinne;</hi> doe you expresse your selfe thus doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that you may comply with them? indeed if you were
composing such a Liturgy as some have wished for, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
&amp;c. might joyne together, I confesse you have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
served that designe: but sure it was your duty, especially in
a Practicall Catechisme, to have declared your selfe freely and
fully against that dangerous error. 6 If you are of their mind
who maintaine the corruption of our nature to bee onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity,
not a sinne; it was not fairly done to blind your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with an Orthodox expression in the beginning of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that you might afterwards tempt him into a dangerous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96915:11"/>
error. 7 It is absurd to say, that godly sorrow is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for an infelicity <hi>quà sic,</hi> meerly as an infelicity. 8 There
is no doubt but that every sinne should bee wailed <hi>quà sic,</hi> as a
sinne: an inconformity to a spirituall Law, and a pronenesse to
actuall rebellion against God, and all the commands of God,
ought to bee bewailed even with tears of bloud; you need not
speake timorously or doubtfully in so weighty and cleare a point.
9 I found the more fault with this doubtfull expression, because
you write a Practicall Catechisme, and you know that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our nature hath great influence into our practise, and
therefore you should have been most cleare and expresse in this
point, that by Gods grace this pronenesse to sinne might bee
both bewailed and mortified. I need not tell you, how many
dangerous consequences have been inferred from some doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expressions in Catechismes or confessions about originall
sinne, but I hasten to your last report, which is about justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>4 It seemes you are most to seek here, you desire mee to help
you out. Sir, I never said that faith was a <hi>Physicall Instrument</hi>
of justification; sure justification is no Physicall thing. You doe
grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at least <hi>in termes,</hi> that faith is a <hi>Morall</hi> instrument of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
but if you deny it to bee a <hi>Reall</hi> instrument in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Christ, then sure what you grant in termes, you deny in
deed. No man ever dreamt that <hi>faith doth pardon sinne,</hi> but a
sinner doth by faith receive a pardon: 1 Faith doth receive
Christ really, but spiritually, not corporally, or physically.
2 That which you call a sufficient acknowledgement, is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
cleare, bee pleased to explaine what you meane, when
you say [that faith is an instrument in receiving of Christ, and
all <hi>other acts of the man as Christian,</hi> and onely a <hi>condition</hi> or <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
in the subject to make capable of Gods act upon him in
justification.] 3 You should distinguish, as the Apostle doth,
between receiving of Christ, and walking in him. 4 If you
meane, that all other acts of a Christian, namely acts of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
charity, and in a word, all acts of Evangelicall or new
obedience, are Morall instruments of justification, I desire a proof
of that. 5 Doth my receiving of Christ make mee capable of
Christ, or rather make mee possest of Christ? 6 I thinke you
will not deny that Gods act in giving Christ, giving a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96915:12"/>
&amp;c. is in order of nature before my receiving of Christ,
and a pardon. 7 You have not yet clearely expressed, what is
the true notion of faith in your opinion, and what Dr. <hi>Preston</hi>
saith to confirme you in it, and where he saith it. 8. If
you conceive that a cordiall assent to Christs commands hath
any influence into our justification, bee pleased to unfold that
riddle: you know, it is confessed by all, that the true beleever
doth give a cordiall assent to Christs commands; but is hee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by that assent? 9 How doe you prove, that any soule
whilst it remaines un justified doth cordially and wholly give up
it selfe to bee ruled by Christ? I confesse it to bee a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of justification, but not an antecedent to (much lesse a
Condition to make us capable of) justification. 10 If a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall
assent to Christs commands, and a resolution of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
are morall instruments of justification, bee pleased to shew
what efficiency these instruments have in justification; whether
the <hi>Terminus</hi> of that efficiency bee a capacity in the soule, which
doth formally make the soule capable of Gods act in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sinne, and pronouncing the person just and righteous?
11 If a resolution or vow of obedience bee sufficient unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
without the actuall performance of the vow, why
doe you winde in <hi>all other acts of a man as Christian,</hi> into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the very first act of faith, in receiving Christ, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse
of sinnes? 12 If, on the other side, God justifies the
ungodly, how doth a constellation of Gospel-graces, and all
the acts of grace put a capacity into the subject to make a man
capable of justification?</p>
            <p>Sir, that which I tooke exception at, was your confounding
of faith and workes in a discourse of justification. 2 That you
doe frequently imply, that wee are justified by faithfull actions,
acts of sincerity and obedience,<note place="margin">Your last Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>pag.</hi> 28.</note> that they are the <hi>Condition</hi> of
justification, and that God doth absolutely require them as the
<hi>onely things by which a man is justified,</hi> p. 28. you say, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which makes us capable of pardon of sinnes, is positively
the new creature, or renued, &amp;c. obedience to the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
the performing, &amp;c.—and Constellation of Gospel-graces,
&amp;c. I need not transcribe your words, in your last editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they are to bee found, in the 8 <hi>page.</hi> 3 You say, that faith
without the addition of such workes, such obedience Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96915:12"/>
would bee unsufficient to justification, &amp;c. The words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
are as bad or worse, <hi>page</hi> 35, 36. and the like you have
<hi>page</hi> 44, 45 Sir, I proved that faith was sufficient to bee an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of justification, without the addition of Evangelicall
workes unto that purpose, and in that act; and that wee were
not justified by a righteousnesse inherent in us, or any acts of
repentance, charity, or new obedience performed by us. I am
not ashamed, yet am not now at leisure to repeat my arguments
to prove that wee are justified by the obedience of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
freely imputed by God, applyed and rested on by faith
onely.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your returns, and the Letter that enclosed them; and
shal (as briefly as I can) give you my sense of both. And first to
your letter, I shall tell you truly that you are the onely man in
the world that ever I knew to have endeavored the confuting one
syllable of that Catechisme; and therefore the addresse I made
to you, I acknowledge to have made to you onely. If by your
<hi>reverend brethren</hi> you meane those which are here with you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
at this time, I suppose your periphrasis hath told mee
who they are, and then I am confident they are persons which
would have communicated to me any such advertisements, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I am so neerly concerned (to discerne whether their dislikes
were causlesse or no) before they had publiquely accused me for
them: which because they have not done, I must not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that refutation was publique, or such as could bee capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of my notice; though I must acknowledge to expect from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them that which is, as you say, much more solid then
yours, and heartily wish it were either of those to whom I am
now writing: for then I should make no question, but the
satisfaction (mutually) would bee much greater. But as it is, I
must undergoe my fate, and cannot be deceived in the successe of
this paper, more then I now finde my selfe to have been in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96915:13"/>
reception of my former, which when I had kept my selfe within
those limits, which I suppose farre from all motion toward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
and onely asked (and as you say beg'd) an exact account
of what you had said of that Author, and given you the plaine
reasons of my request, is yet charged by you to have <hi>fallen foully</hi>
on you: To this reproach of yours I reply not one word (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not so much in love with that part of your spirit as to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it; which yet both here and hereafter I beseech you not
to mistake for a no-sense of it) but conceive it as true that I have
done so, as that the errours, so styled by you, are either errors,
or dangerous. I will not doubt of your employments or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances,
nor thinke your returnes are too slow, I wish you
had more leisure, and more perfect tranquillity of thoughts at all
times, especially when I have the luck to discourse with you. In
the mean, I beseech you to beleeve, that what question soever
may depend concerning the Messengers delivering his errand
(whom yet, upon his asseveration that he did it aright, I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve)
there can be none of the words in my letter, or consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the addition in yours, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>[this night]</hi> wherein I
conceived you obliged to give me that account, when you have
my paper by you to assure you, that I did not.</p>
            <p>The words which you affirme to have taken notice of in your
<hi>Carfax</hi>-Sermon, I acknowledge to bee in the Catechisme, and
must set them downe againe in this paper, that you may judge,
while I advise with you, whether you mistooke them, or no.
<hi>[The holy Ghost was our advocate in setling a Ministery to pray and
intercede for their severall congregations (and enabling them in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Apostles times to forme a Liturgy to continue in the Church to that
end) and thereby helping our infirmities, and teaching us to pray as
wee ought.]</hi> You see Sir, and must acknowledge, the parenthesis
in the midst of the sentence; and (I suppose) know the meaning
of that, that it is so set, that it may unite the words after to the
words before it, not pretend to joyne them to it selfe; So that
the sentence without the parenthesis is this (and not altered by
it) <hi>That the holy Ghost was our advocate in setling a Ministery to pray
and intercede for their severall congregations, and thereby helping our
infirmities, and teaching us to pray as we ought.</hi> Onely 'tis added
by the by, that the holy Ghost that thus setled that Ministery,
enabled them in the Apostles times to forme a Liturgy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96915:13"/>
in the Church to that end, <hi>viz.</hi> of praying and interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for their severall congregations. To either of these thus
set (as onely these words can bee set in construction) your
questions are wholly impertinent, <hi>i. e.</hi> doe no way ingage him
that had said these words, to satisfie your severalls, (and I am
not over willing now to engage my selfe to answer any more
then the matter requires of mee.) For first, the saying that the
holy Ghost enabled the Ministery in the very Apostles times to
forme a Liturgy to continue in the Church, doth not conclude
that that very Liturgy was to bee continued, as in the second
and fourth question you change the words, which you needed
not have done, unlesse you meant to get advantage by it, and
from thence to conclude it my opinion, that there was some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
that that Liturgy formed in the Apostles times should
bee continued in the Church, as I am told you collected thence:
but, you see, I said not, and professe not to have meant in
those words <hi>[to continue]</hi> but onely that it <hi>might</hi> continue <hi>(i. e.</hi>
if the Church thought good) either so as it was, or with such
additions or alterations as the Church should thinke sit; as hee
that leaves lands to continue to his heires, obliges not them
from ever alienating them, or exchanging. You see, the utmost
that these words <hi>[to continue]</hi> on which all the weight of your
exceptions lie, can bee extended. And that comes not home to
your <hi>[was to bee continued,]</hi> nor to your questions, which are
built upon it. I need say no more to your second <hi>quaere;</hi> And
yet if I thought you sought for any thing but exceptions in
my Papers, I would adde freely, as to a Scholar, or friend, my
whole sense of this matter, as a little conversation with ancient
Writers hath made it up to mee. For once, 'tis this; That the
Apostles, and those that were by the holy Ghost consecrated to
the planting of the Church, had the gifts of miracles; not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one all, but one one, another another, powred on them;
that, among these, in those first times, there was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the gift of prayer, (that gift a miracle, as the gift of healing,
prophesying, &amp;c.) that this was bestowed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that did
pray for the rest, and aske those things that were usefull for them,
and teach others how to pray; that some of the prayers thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by them, which were fit for the common perpetuall uses
of all Christians, were received and kept by those whom they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96915:14"/>
thus taught; that those are they which the Ancients meane by
Liturgies of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> St. <hi>Marke,</hi> &amp;c. Though I beleeve not, that
either all these are in those Liturgies which now wee have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their names, nor that all that are under their names are
those, That in the celebration of the Sacrament, which they
daily used, some formes were constantly observed by them, no
new occasion making it fit to alter them: Of which sort I lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
doubt of the Lords prayer, the <gap reason="foreign">

other, and whatever else there was of that nature) set formes in

then as those formes were preserved and continued, so when
those extraordinary <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ceased, there was need of somewhat
else to supply that place; and that would not bee in any reason

for the daily constant wants, and those provided by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the Church, Apostolicall men, which had so benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under the prayers of those that had the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or perhaps
remembred some formes of theirs, at least the method and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
used by them, that their formes might well deserve to bee
heeded by, and so continue in the Church, at least were likely
to bee fitter for the turne then the unpremeditated effusions of
them that now had not the extraordinary <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and of all
whom it cannot bee presumed that they have the ordinary wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to pray alwayes as they ought. I conceive, I can satisfie
any reasonable man for the maine of what I have now said,
upon those grounds that are fit for a matter of this kinde. I
meane it not for a new ball of contention betweene us; I shall
satisfie your exceptions to the Author without it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96915:14"/>
all my answer to your second <hi>quaere.</hi> And for your first, I say,
that speech concludes mee no undertaker, nor obliges mee to
shew you that Liturgy, any more then my telling you, that as
Christ taught his Disciples to pray; so <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> before him
taught his, will oblige mee to tell you what the <hi>Baptists</hi> forme
was: The Disciples tell mee, the <hi>Baptist</hi> did teach his Disciples
to pray, and 'tis possible they could not, I am sure they did
not help you to the sight of that prayer: and the Authors
meannesse, or his being so farre lesse authenticall then those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
though it may make it more fit for you to dis-beleeve
his report that they formed a Liturgy; yet will it not, to thinke
him more obliged to give you a copy of it, or to acknowledge
it temerarious to have said that they did forme one, because hee
hath it not ready to shew. Other reasons, beside that of cleare
ocular demonstration, may bee thought worthy our heeding in
matters of fact; the testimony of men nearer those times then
wee are: And under that head I conceive there are many things
to be produced; for whether the Liturgies that goe now under
the name of St. <hi>Marke</hi> and St. <hi>Iames</hi> are the very Copies compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by them or no, it is to mee no improbable argument that
that age which first acknowledged them to bee theirs, had been
taught by Story that there were some written by them, upon
which they thought fit to father those upon them. Besides this,
you have been shewed in another place from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. that
in the Apostles times some of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Asaph</hi> were
used ordinarily in their devotions,<note place="margin">View of Dir. <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</note> and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> found fault
that they did not all joyne in the same <hi>Psalme</hi> at the same time,
which would, saith hee, bee best for edification: and if it were
mended upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> admonition, the use of those very <hi>Psalmes</hi>
were (at least a part of) a publique divine service, which is the
English of Liturgy. Secondly, that, if wee beleeve Stories,
St. <hi>Iames</hi> made choice of some speciall prayers most frequently
used by the Apostles, shortned againe by St. <hi>Basil</hi> and Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome;</hi>
all which the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, which is fitter to judge
(in this matter done among them) then wee, doe still retaine,
and make no doubt of the Authors of them. Thirdly, that
there is famous mention of a short forme of St. <hi>Peter's,</hi> used alone,
they say, for a great while in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Fourthly,
that 'tis cleare, that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaking of <hi>Sursum corda,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96915:15"/>
saith, that they are <hi>verba ab ipsis Apostolorum temporibus petita,</hi>
and so the compiler of the Apostles Constitutions, which imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
that antiquity, and makes use of that forme, must be thought
to have beleeved, or else he had been much mistaken in his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and had put off his disguise, even by putting it on. 5 That
the same words with those in out Liturgy, are not only in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
which is said to be St. <hi>Iames's,</hi> and those other of St. <hi>Basill,</hi>
and St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> but are recited by St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (in his
Catechisme) one of the Ancientest Authors we have. If it may be
with your leasure (though, as I said, I undertake not to demonstrate,
yet) to offer to your judgment; not to breed you more controversies
or disturbances, I shall not onely refer you to <hi>Cassander</hi> to prove
that to Christs words in the Lords Supper, the Apostles added the
use of the Lords prayer, (which though it were not much, is more
then nothing of set forme, or Liturgy, and might doubtlesse have
been accompanied with much more, though I am not able to
shew it you) but also goe a little farther with you, upon occasion
of that last mentioned forme, and that Father.</p>
            <p>The forme of doxology, following those versicles of <hi>sursum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
&amp;c. in our Book, is, you may remember, this; <hi>[therefore with
Angels, &amp;c.]</hi> of which there is little question, but that it is the form
which was called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by the <hi>Latines Praeparatio
(viz.</hi> of the Sacrament, as 'tis stil in our Church) that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which, saith <hi>Iust. Mar.</hi> precedeth the Eucharist, or blessing of the
elements, <hi>i. e.</hi> prayer of consecration; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
by <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which as it is there placed
after the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> (not the Sacrament, but) the giving of
thanks, (as with us it is after the <hi>[Let us give thanks to our Lord
God])</hi> so it is before the prayer of consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; (which other where,
as even now in <hi>Iustin,</hi> is called by that title, and the Sacrament
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) as with us also, and is the very <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which, saith that ancient Author, under the Apostolical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the whole Church profest before the Sacrament.
All this I have said, to shew you (if you delight in it) some part of
that Liturgy (&amp; being in our book you may yet see it) which was by
those Ancients used: And to bring it yet nearer home to the point
in hand, 'tis that ancient <hi>Cyrills</hi> affirmation of this very form, that
it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which words; in the use of those Ancients,
most commonly note the thing they speak of to be delivered them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96915:15"/>
from the Apostles, or Apostolicall men; and being spoken by <hi>Cyrill</hi>
who was not long after those times, and S. <hi>August.</hi> saying expresly
of <hi>sursum corda</hi> (which may very probably extend to this whole
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> after it) that they were delivered down from the very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times: I conceive this, with the other precedent testimonies
of it, may amount to a proof tolerably sufficient to perswade a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man that they were so. I will prevent a mistake in this matter
of <hi>Cyrills</hi> words, which I do not think probable you would fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but yet am willing to serve you by preventing it, that the <hi>Greek</hi>
[<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] imports
not, as I conceive, that it was delivered by the Seraphim, (for then it
would be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and though that were more then an Apostolicall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
an Angelical tradition; yet it would rather look to the <hi>[Glory
to God on high] &amp;c.</hi> (but that it is an hymne taking in the Angels
to joyn in lauds with us, (to which I conceive S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

call it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
by (our <hi>i. e.)</hi> that <hi>Cyrills</hi> ancestors at least, which who they
were likely to bee, I before gave you reason to conjecture.
That this thus mentioned by St. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> is that very part of our
Liturgy, which I noted it to bee, is cleare enough by the words
that follow in him [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,]
compared with our <hi>[With all the the company of

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
&amp;c. noting this Hymne to bee immediately before
the<note n="*" place="margin">Or that Prayer that I told you was called <gap reason="foreign">

it, which the Liturgick Writers meane by
calling it <hi>praefatio actionis, &amp; hymnatio prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedens
confirmationem sacramenti,</hi> and so with
us it is continued. If I should proceed to
give you any more arguments, to perswade
you that the Apostles did use set formes of
publique divine Service, and mention those
formes to you, I should hope but for little
thankes from you, and therefore shall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from that profusion, remembring that all that I am this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96915:16"/>
minute about to prove, is, that I am not bound to shew you
that Liturgy which was said to be formed in the Apostles times.
And having said this, I suppose you will discern what my answer
would bee, (if I were obliged by my former words, to give
you any as you see I am not) to your other questions; or for
feare you should mistake againe, I will, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> return you
my opinion; To the third, that hee doth; To the fourth, that
they may; (I wish I could adde, they alwayes doe; but I am not
obliged to that;) To the fifth, that it is not, if you meane by
<hi>[that very]</hi> the same without any change: but yet in the sense
that <hi>Theseus</hi> his ship came home the same that it went out, and
is an instance in Logick of one notion of <hi>idem numero,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, if possible, more then the very same, having some of
the same ribs remaining in it (as even now I instanced, and
professe to bee perswaded by those Authorities,) when that is
supposed to have never a one. I have no occasion to add any
more in answer to the Letter, but to thanke Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> and
you for your willingnesse to give mee directions about my first
fruits; though the truth is, I am returned from <hi>London,</hi> and did
speake to my Brother to aske L. Gen. <hi>Cromwels</hi> assistance; but Sir
<hi>Henry Vane</hi> junior is not of that Committee. Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>
senior was in the Chaire, and I delivered my case to him, and
hee fully consented to the justice of my request: and then your
saying, <hi>Sir Henry Vane hath power to relieve me,</hi> shall be ground of
hope to me that he will.</p>
            <p>NOw for the longer, and so sadder part of my taske, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you are not so curteous to me, as you were in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
line of your Letter, I must proceed to that.</p>
            <p>In the entrance I must have leave to bee sorry, that I have
to deale with a man that will professe himselfe not much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with that notion of Justice (which I said obliged mee to
desire an exact account in writing from you, of that wherein
that Author was nearly concerned, and could no otherwise bee
sure not to thinke any thing of you causelesly.) If this were
not justice to you, or may not yet bee beleeved so by you, I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96915:16"/>
despaire of ever doing any thing acceptable in your presence.
Our humours, or our principles, will be so contrary, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I shall say, I shall have reason to suspect you will not bee
much taken with it; yet I shall farther adventure to give you
one relation, which will not onely cleare my former notion of
justice to you, but offer to your consideration whether there bee
not somewhat due from you by that notion of justice (or some
other) to that Author, to others, yea and to your selfe.</p>
            <p>There fell out in some Lay-company in this Towne, since
your Sermon fore-mentioned, a discourse, Whether it were not
lawfull to sweare, so that that which was sworne were exactly
true; one of the company insisted rightly, that it was not, the
other was confident it was, and produced for it the Authority
of that Author; and to prove that againe, said, that the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
at St. <hi>Maries</hi> read it out of that Book. Of the truth of
this he was so confident, that he presently resolved to make use
of that liberty, which he beleeved from your citation to bee
the opinion of that Author, more then his carnall heart did
permit him to beleeve the truth of what you added (if you did
any thing besides the reproaching of that Author) in confutation
of that Doctrine, and thereupon he swore a great Oath, that that
which was before him was a candlestick, and perswaded himselfe
that he had done no hurt in doing so.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, when I have againe told you, and all the world;
that that Author hath written most strictly against swearing,
(and onely differs from you in that question concerning the
primary intention of the words of the old Commandement)
and said in plaine words, 1 That idle, foolish, wanton using
of Gods name, (which if it be not in oaths, is lesse then swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
sure profane using of it, (which in all the editions was in,
and absolutely belonged to all kinde of unlawfull oaths) might
bee resolved to bee forbidden there by reduction: And 2 That
under Christ (which againe I tell you, belonged to all to whom
that Catechisme could speake,) there is a totall universall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of swearing it selfe, making that as unlawfull now, as
perjury was before. 3 That to sweare in ordinary conversation
is utterly unlawfull. 4 That all voluntary, especially promisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
oaths, are now utterly unlawfull for a Christian. And 5 those
voluntaries defined, to be those that have their impellent or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96915:17"/>
from my selfe; when I have, I say, told you all this, then
for Gods sake ponder sadly with your owne heart, in case that
poore soule bee ever tormented in hell for that vaine oath, (as,
without Gods mercy upon repentance, undoubtedly hee will)
how much you have to charge upon your selfe for giving him
confidence that that Author had said what hee learnt from you:
especially seeing your Sarcasme in that phrase of <hi>the much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Catechisme,</hi> might tell you that it was possible some poore,
passionate, sinfull creature, might thus unhappily admire it. I
conjure you, not to thinke there is any jest in this, but beleeve
from mee, that I am able to produce the person that heard it,
(and that had that care and love of piety and of truth, and that
particular knowledge of my detesting all oaths, as to come in
some passion to mee for satisfaction,) and that I have already
seriously sent to disabuse the offender, lest that sinne should bee
laid to his charge, which you have made that Book bee the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of; and when you have laid this to your heart, the God of all
grace direct you to doe your duty in this particular.</p>
            <p>I will not confute your opinion, that I have stooped lower
in my Rejoynder then I was in my Letter, by begging what I
did before but desire, (I will bee very willing to do so alwayes,
and shall yet bee more vile then so, if that may perswade you
to doe mee justice;) and yet it may bee observed, that in your
judgment to desire and request (which I did before) is so much
lower then to beg, (which is but a nicety,) that untill I did beg,
as well as desire and request, and againe re-inforce my request,
you did not thinke fit to grant me the least crumbe of that justice
which I desired from you.</p>
            <p>At the phrase <hi>[exact account]</hi> you affirme your selfe to have
stumbled, and call it <hi>[those hard words.]</hi> If this bee so, I
cannot tell how to behave my selfe so cautiously, as either to
speak plainely enough to you, or to keep you from stumbling.
For <hi>[axact account]</hi> is so plaine to bee understood, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>jurisdiction,</hi> unlesse you mistooke it for exacting an account,
(which you are too subtle to doe, when the word <hi>desire</hi> went
before it,) that if ever I had exercised jurisdiction over you, or
any other, (which I never was in place to doe the Office for
which my first fruits are required, being without a jurisdiction
annext to it;) yet you could not have been tempted by that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96915:17"/>
to this mistake. I suppose you were pleased to be merry, when
you imply you were; and therefore must friendly admonish
you, that there is a shrewd disease, in which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had so
much skill as to pronounce <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and therefore I shall briefly desire you, that hereafter you speak,
1 So properly as not to say <hi>desiring,</hi> is <hi>exercising jurisdiction.</hi>
And 2 Seriously, (for truly I am not in jest, when I write to you,)
and that would have kept you safe from stumbling. Yet because
you are at such leisure as to remember I had an Office in your now
Countrey, I shall tell you that there is a seale belonging to that
Office, from which, if you had induction to that Living, you
may read in your Wax, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and then you
will soone discerne how many men, as well as mee, you have
helpt to make happy. I blesse God, (and will never curse you,)
that I am one of that number.</p>
            <p>In your next Section, you pray for them that suggested so
many false accusations against you to mee. But first, you affirme
not above one to have been false; and that I confesse to bee so,
and need not to bee told so back againe. As for your new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
which you are resolved to pay mee in stead of that
former, I desire you to know that I defie it, and know no
danger or ill sound in the language of <hi>Speculative mysterie,</hi> nor
acknowledge any Author of it whom you can suspect; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
not him whose name you blotted out, so that I might
read; I meane, neither <hi>Smalcius</hi> nor <hi>Socinus,</hi> whose doctrines
in the businesse of the Trinity I doe heartily disclaime; and am
so farre from being tainted or tempted by them, that I cannot
say I ever permitted my selfe to read any Tract in them, or
any other of that set, (unlesse in the <hi>Racovian Catechisme)</hi> on
that subject. And you will never repaire the injury, if you use
arts to fasten it on mee, or to perswade any man, that I was
ever inclined towards it. For your nicety by which you except
against my calling the doctrine of the Trinity a <hi>speculative my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
saying that it is <hi>practicall,</hi> and giving your reason, [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the blessed Trinity is the object of our worship, as well
as of our faith;] I shall make no scruple to acknowledge the
Trinity to bee the object of our worship, (and to that end I
directed that concluding act of my worship to that blessed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
and every point of that which in the Catechisme is made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96915:18"/>
due to God, I supposed there, and now professe to bee perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
due to the Trinity. But then you might remember, that
you acknowledge it the object of our faith; and of that there
be many parts which will not be disparaged by being stiled
mysteries and depths of speculation, and in that sense, or as
they are so, I then spake, and onely so, and need not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any impropriety in that speech; because though a specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
doctrine may be also practicall in another respect, as the
knowledge of the causes of diseases is a practicall knowledge in
respect of the cures it will help to worke, yet as that is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
called the <hi>Theory</hi> of Physick, and is presumed before Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
ascend to the practicall; so I told you the Author sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the speculative understanding of that mystery in the
Church-Catechisme, before hee came to the Doctrines in this
Booke, which are the practicall. You remember mee, that a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
Covenant is practicall; and I may as well remember
you that there are <hi>credenda</hi> proposed to the vower in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as <hi>facienda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On occasion of mention of the Church-Catechisme, you say,
you like that better then my Practicall, and I confesse my selfe
to doe so too; so vehemently, that I beleeve 'twill bee long ere
wee see a better in its stead. But yet I conceive, that hee that
hath learnt that, may bee capable of more, at least of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make use of that knowledge imbibed to the amendment
of his life: else, most of our preaching were in vaine; nay else,
both that Catechisme ought never to have been expounded, and
every one that hath written any thing else for the benefitting of
youth or men, must lye under the prejudice of that insolence of
thinking himselfe able to make a better, as well as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>For your justice in that answer to the third reason, I am
not to thanke you, nor can I thinke that any man that was in
any measure my friend, needed to bee told by you or any, that
I acknowledged the Trinity. If hee did, examine your owne
heart, whether you know not some body, who had helped to
defame mee in that particular, by saying I was a <hi>Socinian</hi> or
the like, or by saying I maintaine many errours broached by
such; If you doe not, I will thank you for the good office you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and so hasten also, (and wish heartily I could make more
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96915:18"/>
haste to get into some more delightfull imployment) to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
report.</p>
            <p>In that, I see, I met with no false accusation of you, but in
you enough of injury to that Author, by picking out what
might make him odious, and present him an eloquent learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
of yours, to bee taught, that swearing is a sinne; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a profane designer and corrupter of the Nation, that hath
given Boyes a liberty of swearing in their Catechisme. I have
sufficiently told you, and all men, that that Author is most
guiltlesse of that charge, and if you will not yet acknowledge it,
I must leave it to God to judge betwixt us; as also, whether
hee produce not the unquestionable command of God against all
swearing, assertory or promissory; and whether you doe not
imply, that hee doth so, in saying against him that <hi>[the perhaps
imaginary superaddition]</hi> (which you know are no other then
the words of Christ) <hi>will not bee so effectuall to restraine, as the
unquestionable command of God.</hi> Sir, doth hee question the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God to bee against swearing? doth hee not say that
all profane use of Gods name is sure forbidden under the third
Commandement of the Law by reduction? (or is not all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
swearing, assertory as well as promissory, a profane u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of his name?) that I may not adde that hee produces, and
earnestly insists on the direct clear command of Christ against all
voluntary oaths, which is unquestionably a Command of God
to any that is not worse then a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and denies Christ to
bee God at all. And whereas you observe by the way, that
there is liberty given by this Author for assertory oaths, doe
you thinke there was not that liberty for some sort of them?
or doth the Author say there was for all sorts of them? or for
any that were voluntary? Hee supposes the primary intention
of the third Commandement (and of these words, <hi>thou shalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
&amp;c.</hi> against non-performance of promissory oaths) to bee
against perjury; Under that, by reduction, to bee forbidden (not
swearing simply taken, and so not all assertory oaths, but) all
profane using of Gods name, which sure containes assertory
oaths, though not them onely, or all of that sort, because some
others doe profane Gods name; and of these, all doe not, but
onely those that use it unnecessarily. This is sufficient indeed to
conclude all kinde of assertory oaths, not to bee the particular
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96915:19"/>
matter of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and indeed no sort of them to be so much
as reducible thither, but onely those where his name is unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
used; but sure those that are such, it doth not give any
liberty to, nor can you think it did, without pronouncing at
the same time, that 'twas contradicted in the next page, which
I must suppose you were able to see, because you lookt so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
here to finde this hole, which I am perswaded never any
the most carnall man ever took notice of, to encourage himself in
his sinne, till you directed him to it. By which you may see,
that some men are more industrious in finding faults to accuse
their brethren, then others in seeking pretences to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>To your Arguments I shall endeavour to say little, partly as
not apprehending the force of them, partly supposing that we
now talke of a matter of fact, which may be tryed by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
the Booke being ready to prove the truth of what I
affirme from it; and then tis not in the power of a 1000 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
arguments (much lesse of a few dis-joynted) to wrest any
man out of such a certainty. I should willingly venture them
to any Reader to doe their worst on him, especially your first,
whereby you would shew that hee cannot prove the Doctrine of
a totall universall prohibition of swearing it selfe, and making
it as unlawfull now, as perjury was before, unlesse hee lose the
totall in cypher. Where sure, Sir, 1 If a man would bind you
to your words, you are now much lesse an enemy to swearing
<hi>in universum,</hi> then the Author was: for otherwise that would
not bee objected, that hee prohibits more of that kinde then
hee can prove. And 2 for mincing the totall into a cypher, you
will have no reason to feare, for though hee should mince the
totall somewhat, and say with (I assure you not from) <hi>Smalci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
(for who doth not say so too?) that I must not sweare, but
for Gods glory, and the publique good; yet is not that all cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
I hope, for it prohibits all swearing in communication,
as utterly unlawfull; all voluntary, especially promissory oaths.
But then, Sir, you must know that a totall prohibition of
swearing it selfe, containes all swearing by any creature, as well as
by God, and that is no cypher neither.</p>
            <p>As for your question, Whether the perfect Law of God did
give men leave to take vaine oaths? hee is willing most clearly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96915:19"/>
to satisfie that, and assure you of his opinion, that it did not;
and because by the whole period I cannot possibly conclude any
thing but onely this, that you know not why I used the word
Totall, <hi>(a totall universall prohibition of swearing)</hi> I will tell you
that too; because Christ had said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>swear not at
all;</hi> which what it signifies, is here sufficiently explained; thus,
not onely not by God, but not by any creature of God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>2 In the difference, as you state it, betwixt us, you are very
unjust, in saying I undertooke to prove, that by the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
there was no more meant, then that a man should not
forsweare himselfe. This is false; I never undertooke it, but
professe that what is forbidden by <hi>reduction,</hi> is meant as <hi>truly,</hi>
though not so <hi>evidently</hi> proposed, as what is <hi>exprest,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must bee content to open your eyes, and see what is
the question between the <hi>Scholar</hi> and the <hi>Catechist,</hi> (and the same
also is the conclusion) <hi>viz.</hi> not what is meant, <hi>i.e.</hi> what is the
<hi>full adequate importance</hi> of <hi>that Commandement,</hi> or what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
under it; but what that is, <hi>i.e.</hi> what the words strictly
signifie, or, as 'tis now exprest, what is the <hi>primary intention</hi> of
the phrase; and to that question the answer is made <hi>[no more
undoubtedly but forswearing;]</hi> as if the question were askt of [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>]
is that no more then that <hi>thou shalt not commit adultery?</hi>
I should answer, <hi>no more undoubtedly;</hi> yet never feare that any
man would thinke that I affirmed, that <hi>fornication,</hi> and <hi>all other
villany</hi> was not there forbidden, especially when I had also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that it were by <hi>reduction;</hi> and so in like manner, to take
the question that you after set, whether I will say there is no
more meant by the <hi>Commandement</hi> then <hi>taking away the life of a
man;</hi> I answer, that the word <hi>killing</hi> is no more, and that was
all the Author said of the third <hi>Commandement, viz.</hi> that the
<hi>Commandement</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> (that is, the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Commandement</hi>
(which are there set down) <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the
Lord thy God in vaine)</hi> is no more then <hi>forswearing;</hi> that the
<hi>words</hi> were the subject spoken of, 'tis plaine by the proofes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
of it, from the use of those words in other places. This
is so probable a truth, that I could not have thought it needfull to
have given it illustration to any man else.</p>
            <p>3. When I appeal'd to <hi>Christ</hi> as Judge, and thought I had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96915:20"/>
made good may appeale by producing his words whereby hee
renders that <hi>Commandement,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>[thou shalt not forswear;]</hi>
you attempt to argue and prove against mee, but never take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of my proofe, which is absolutely against law of pleading
or disputing. And for the argument you confront to it, I assure
you it perswades mee nothing, but that you thought <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was
to bee writen with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For though I shall tell you that all
oaths, that come from the evill or from the Devill, are not from
thence concluded to bee evill or devillish, because the oath that
I take lawfully in Judicature may come originally from evill or
from the devill in <hi>another,</hi> and must not needs bee from evill in
the <hi>taker,</hi> so I have no need to answer you with that, but plainly
confesse, that all evill and devillish oaths are forbidden in the third
Commandement.</p>
            <p>4 I need not deny but that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may sometimes be rendred
vaine, and so sometimes 'tis, even when it signifies a <hi>Lye,</hi> (as
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Bible</hi> hath a peculiarity sometimes to denote <hi>Idols,</hi>
those greatest lyes in the world.) All that I was to conclude was,
that <hi>Christ</hi> having exprest it by a word which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> here
reads <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there was nothing in that <hi>Hebrew</hi> phrase, but
what was agreeable to this, and that is true, though it should
bee granted to signifie <hi>vanum,</hi> because it doth <hi>falsum</hi> also. But
you say, you need not goe about to prove that the <hi>Iewes</hi> saw
this truth as clearely as wee doe, but you can prove that they
saw and acknowledged it, and that that is sufficient for you,
and then let mee tell you, you have fought blind all this while,
and now you may see, if you will, that forasmuch as concerns
this Author (unlesse you will fight on, when you say you need
not) your great quarrell is at an end, for hee that said in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of all this <hi>Sermon</hi> in the <hi>mount,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> added either
<hi>new precepts,</hi> or <hi>new light,</hi> promised to bee satisfied with either
of them: and though hee conceives the<note n="*" place="margin">See the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Fathers both Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, in the Catechisme <hi>pag.</hi> 106. not thought fit then to swell up this Letter.</note> 
               <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> to have
generally affirmed the former, and the <hi>Latin</hi> also, for the first 400
yeares, (particularly in this matter of swearing, <hi>Theophylact,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: expressing his opinion
to bee, that some swearing was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> under <hi>Christ,</hi> which had
not been so before) yet hee hath obliged himselfe to bee
content with the latter, which now, you say, you need not
deny, (I would you had never needed to oppose one so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96915:20"/>
that asserted no more, then what you need not to deny;)
and therefore I will now adde onely thus much, that. 1 This
is the meaning and effect of affirming it [forbidden there, not
by the <hi>primary</hi> intention of the word] for from thence it is that
the clearnesse arises; that which is forbidden by <hi>reduction</hi> only,
being not so cleare, nor consequently so deeply obliging those
to whom it is not (supposing still that it is not their fault, that
it is not) so cleare. 2 That if it were granted, that <hi>Christ</hi> gave
a <hi>new precept</hi> here, it would not yet follow, that all unlawfull
swearing by <hi>Gods name</hi> was not forbidden before: because there
is another thing which he may have added to the third <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
the not swearing by <hi>any thing else,</hi> as well as not by
<hi>God.</hi> But, you see, I need not now affirme this; I will give
you leave to thinke that I am so awed by you, that I am not
willing to spring you any new game of controversies. I confesse
I like not the sport so well, as to sollicite your company any
further.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Septuagints</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I gave you an hint by the way,
that that will gaine you but little.</p>
            <p>For my knowledge of the primary signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> you
must not judge, for hee that shall but looke into <hi>Schindler</hi> (as
venerable an Author sure as <hi>Pagnin)</hi> will finde that hee saith
'tis used <hi>de re falsâ; vanâ;</hi> First <hi>falsâ;</hi> but if you had pleased,
my argument of the use of the word in the <hi>ninth Commandement</hi>
(as fit to expound the <hi>Second</hi> as any) might have been thought
as fit to bee considered, as what you have insisted on in stead of
it.</p>
            <p>You doe well to abstaine from the <hi>negative</hi> argument of [hee
might but did not.] But then it is not true that the question
betwixt you and mee is not about the <hi>primary</hi> intention of the
phrase: for whosoever reads that <hi>Catechisme,</hi> these letters, or
even many of your arguments, will know it is; or if not, I
make no scruple to pronounce, what I have done so oft, that I
have no other quarrell to you in this matter, save onely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
you did mee at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and every one that beleeved
ought of it from you. But sure, Sir, I have not acknowledged
in any manner, that the first edition of that Booke had any
thing in it questionable in the judgement of learned men; I told
you it was <hi>[in kindnesse and submission to the meanest,]</hi> and that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96915:21"/>
               <hi>kindenesse</hi> and <hi>submission</hi> intimates no more acknowledgement of
questionablenesse, then the word <hi>meanest</hi> intimates the <hi>learnedst.</hi>
I would now adde, that I might have done it to prevent
causelesse quarrelling, but that I now see that it will not doe
that neither.</p>
            <p>As for your long deduction and magnifying of your cost and
travaile through the additions, &amp;c. of that <hi>Catechism,</hi> you might
have been lesse Playsome <hi>in re seriâ.</hi> If you doe not already
know that you have prevaricated herein, you may read and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the <hi>Printers</hi> Postscript (which I think you cite also,
and so have read, I shall now but advise you to remember it)
and you cannot chuse but see, (and, I hope, acknowledge) that
all your Fable vanishes, and your History ends in this plaine
briefe, that will bring no scorne on the <hi>Authour, viz.</hi> that he
prepared a new edition of the <hi>Catechisme;</hi> added a third part
more; and, to serve the meanest, explained every thing that by
any advice or hint hee observed to need explaining; call it <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,</hi>
if you will, for <hi>to alter from worse to better</hi> hee professes
himselfe to thinke an amiable, imitable quality, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bee ashamed of it: yet must not now assume it to himselfe,
having, I assure you, no right to it, any further then it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>explaining.</hi> This edition had long since been Printed in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
could the Printer have gotten downe so much paper. When
the City was rendred twas carryed to <hi>London</hi> to that end, where
against the Authors will or knowledge three editions had been
made by the first Copy, one of which was just then ended; and
by that meanes the <hi>Printer</hi> had been at greater losse then I was
willing to bee cause of to an enemy, if another new impression
had been then made of it. This, God knows, was the cause
it is now set out so troubledly (the <hi>Printer</hi> being willing to
put out the additions thus, rather then not at all; and to put
this <hi>inconvenience</hi> on the <hi>Reader,</hi> then losse upon <hi>himselfe)</hi> for
which, though I was very sorry, yet I never foresaw that I
should bee thus chid and reproacht, and triumpht over for it.
I hope some of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Christs Sermon may bee the
portion of them that suffer without a cause, though it bee not
upon that excellent stile <hi>[for righteousnesse sake:]</hi> I am sure, this

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96915:21"/>
to be thankt for your charges, unlesse it had brought in

if after this, nothing will satisfie you but <hi>recantation,</hi> so oft

that lying shall bee no sinne, and that no other sinne
in you or others shall bee consequent to it in this, and for the
other part of it, if it can delight you more then the calling for
it hath done already, you shall have my most willing consent
towards it. For the latter end of the sheet, of <hi>deceiving the
Kingdome,</hi> of <hi>seduction, &amp;c.</hi> and what followes in the next, to
the end of the report, I am sensible of it, and I thanke God
I have received grace from him to pray that I may make the same
use of it, that <hi>David</hi> doth in the story of <hi>Shimei</hi>'s reviling,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. I pray also, and desire the prayers of all good
men, that God would shew me the sin which hath now brought
this portion of calumny upon mee, and that is all I would say
to it. And yet, after this resolved silence to that part, I shall
againe answer to you some few things. 1 That when in your
fourth consideration you say <hi>[meant in a Commandement]</hi> you
should say, <hi>signified by the words of a Commandement.</hi> 2 That which
you call, <hi>taking in a latitude,</hi> I call <hi>reduction.</hi> 3 That my
explications were designed by mee to bee as remarkable, nay
much more then the first edition was: for I designed a full
impression, and many other things to make them so. 4 I
never had any thing to doe (not so much as the knowledge, at
that time) with the setting out any edition of that book, save
onely of those additions, and of printing the first few copies
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the use of those that were more willing to bee at
that charge, then at a greater in transcribing it. 5 I say most
distinctly, that every emendation in that Booke, that to my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
remembrance I can speak of, was intended long before
ever the Towne was neare taking: and for danger of being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to an account of any thing said in it, God knows my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
I was never neare dreaming or thinking of it, and
am now in courage enough to feare neither men nor Angels in
that particular. 6 That I know not, that ever I have made you
a solemne poofession under my hand to give you satisfaction;
and my most carefull recollecting what I have wrote, cannot
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96915:22"/>
bring it to my remembrance: certainly you dreamt of that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>round recantation.</hi> If it were any thing above en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
it, certainly it was a very rash promise; and if so,
I beseech you remit it to mee, for I would not willingly take
any more paines about it. For other men, I am more secure:
and if you once be satisfied, I shall suppose all men, that know
it, will thinke it time for them to give over quarrelling. 7 That
by <hi>[would]</hi> I did in effect meane, were forbidden also by God,
when <hi>Moses</hi> published the Law; and have oft told you how I
meant so. 8 I have already told you, that you came not into
my heart, when I thought or spake of submission to the meanest:
and wonder as much, that you should thinke the alterations
were made in <hi>submission to you,</hi> as that you should now rank your
selfe with the meanest, who have not supererogated in humility
since I met with you. Truly, Sir, I doe not thinke, meannesse is
the cause of your mis-understandings, nor did I ever from any
friend at <hi>London</hi> heare of any particular you disliked in it: or
if I had, by any such message, I would have found out some way
to have offered you or any man living a friendly debate about
it. For your respects, I finde little signes of them now, and by
the subjects doe beleeve that there were little exprest in those let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of yours ten yeares agoe about mee, I can, and doe freely
forgive you all: but know not that I am bound to thanke you,
till some body else tell mee so. 9 If any learned men ever told
me of that opinion about <hi>Christ improving the Law,</hi> and exprest
themselves to thinke it were an error, I am confident I have given
them such a state of my opinion in that matter, that no good
Christian can finde fault with, or lay any charge on it of hurt or
danger to any mans manners, if it were supposed false. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
you may know, that as Learned as any this age now hath,
both of Ancients and others, are fully of my opinion: And let me
tell you, that ten yeares agoe I had no objection against my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that it was by some men fathered on <hi>Socinus:</hi> but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that I beleeved it long before I ever saw one word (I thinke,
had heard the name) of <hi>Socinus;</hi> and that the Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and other the like means, which taught me all my other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
taught me that too; and saw, that if it were a mistake, it
could make no man live worse, (as the contrary opinion might
doe, if it were so) I resolved to deny my selfe in that phantasie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96915:22"/>
then objection; and speak what I thought might edifie what
diminution of credit soever it brought after it. I shall adde my
thanks for your counsell, which I would faine thinke to bee in
great earnest, but that I suppose you cannot beleeve that I looke
upon <hi>Criticismes</hi> as a kinde of heaven, nor that you would thinke
fit to send out in the same breath true Christian earnest, (for, above
all things, I account admonitions so) and Sarcasmes. I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire, that I may study the Morall Law, as I finde it delivered
from that second Mount: and I will obey you in all other moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and (as you desire) not censure you for this part of your
Sermon, how bitter soever it is, but thank you for all the good
you meant by it. But whatever you say of the Morall Lawes
perfection, I hope it must not so bee understood as to deny that
Christ (as hee gave more grace then was ever allowed in the
state of nature, or by the Law, so) might, if he pleased, improve
the obligations which either the naturall Law, or that given by
God through <hi>Moses</hi> had laid on men; and whether by new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
or new lights call us to a higher degree of perfection (and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to it) then others had by any particular precept thought
themselves obliged to. As for the <hi>imaginary super additions</hi> you
talk of, you will I hope consider, that 'tis as dangerous to detract
from the World of God, as to adde to it; and to deny Christ to
have added, if he have, as to affirme him, if he have not, I am
sure, the consequences may be more dangerous. As for your stile
of <hi>perfect and spirituall Law,</hi> I shall in the plain word acknowledge
it, that it was both perfect (in respect of the state of men to whom
it was given, whether by <hi>Moses</hi> to the Jewes, or by the God of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to all men) and spirituall also, extending to the spirit or soule
of man, and not onely to the outward actions. But this, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
hinders not but that Christ that gives more grace then was
brought into the world by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> or Nature, and that
disburdned all men of that sad yoke that lay on the Jews, and that
is content to accept of sincere without not-sinning obedience, may
have leave to advance his disciples to an higher pitch of spirituall
perfection (whether by new laws, or new light) then the Law in
the former delivery of it had advanced them: And to set up this
pitch, whatever it is, as a precept, (not only a counsell of perfection)
to us Christians, was the utmost of my designe and endeavours in
that Sermon you speake of 10 yeares agoe, and is of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96915:23"/>
now; and I never imagined it possible that this doctrine
could give any man liberty to thinke worse of the Law of God,
or practise lesse of it; but have reason to think (and could give
an experimentall account of what I say) that the not teaching
it, might flatter men ignorantly to beleeve that there was lesse
required of them then I conceive (and desire, they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
there is. And doe you consider also, that hee which is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and most cunningly resists all the restraints that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
or undermine his temptations, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> also;
can plead against, accuse, and calumniate any man or doctrines
that are contrary to him. And so I humbly take leave of the second
report, the Lord forgive you for it.</p>
            <p>In the third report it seemes I was not mistaken neither, nor
in my expectation, that plaine positive affirming the things you
would have affirmed, would not satisfie you. I told you, that
the Author under the generall phrase of all kinds and sorts of
sinne, sets in the front the weaknesse, frailties, and pollutions
of our nature, our pronenesse and inclination to sinne. This
your Sermon said was speaking with irresolution, as if he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp;c. I tell you once againe this is no irresolution; and he
doth not doubt but that this aptnesse to fall into all sinne is a
sinne, to wit, an aversion of our faculties from God, which ought
wholly to be converted to him; will this satisfie you? I have
reason from your former carriage not to bee over confident
that yet it will; for if it doth, you ought in all reason to have
beene satisfied before, where it was set downe as a first <hi>species</hi>
of sinne. You say, my expression is inexcusable of <hi>[as infelicities,</hi>
if not as <hi>sinnes,]</hi> you, it seemes, are resolv'd it shall not bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
to you, and therefore will not interpret it by the words
that went next before it, or so as it may bee reconciled with
them, but will force it to a sense directly contradictory to what
went just before it, and so must suppose <hi>mee mad</hi> (for so is hee
that can affirme contradictions at once) onely because you will
not be just; any thing that is most irrationall must bee beleeved
of another man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather then an expression bee excused by you.
But, Sir, I doe not yet thinke it inexcusable, if I desired to bring
all those men on their knees (in humiliation and godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for their inclinations to evill) which doe not beleeve them
when they are not consented to, to bee other then infelicities.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96915:23"/>
Men that will not bee of my opinion in all things, I can bee
content to serve and minister unto, and labour to doe them
good upon their owne (if they will not permit mee upon my)
principles. But then 1 it seemes I must not say, <hi>pollutions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(I said, <hi>of our nature,</hi> and you seldome leave out the least
word by chance, or but when you have some designe in it,) or if I
doe, that expression is more proper to denote actuall sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then
originall sinne, which is one entire, &amp;c. I shall put it to the
question, whether <hi>pollutions of our nature</hi> bee at all proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
actuall sinnes, which are pollutions of our persons; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not most proper to our naturall aversions from God, or
inclinations to evill: If the wisest or meanest would have that
better exprest, I desire to heare from them, and it shall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
against another edition, which will againe (after all
your triumph on that occasion) stoop to serve the meanest in
explaining.</p>
            <p>2 For him that (as you say) hath <hi>consented</hi> to the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his nature, that hath cherished and been pleased with it,
I shall suppose him to have committed an actuall sinne, and then
sure his evill inclination was not the thing which could bee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the title of infelicity in any mans sense, for that title
supposes positively that they are not consented to. And though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man that is of age hath sometimes so consented, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and in some one act, I shall by Gods grace suppose it
possible that he hath not; and then, that his act of non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
will bee a peece of Christian victory over that sinfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination;
and the sinfull inclination, though it shall still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a sinne, and bee matter of humiliation, yet sure will
not passe with you for a sinne cherished at that time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to.</p>
            <p>Your third quarrell grounded on the conceit that I seeme to
imply, <hi>that there must needs bee some consent given to every actuall
sinne,</hi> did make a very hard shift to bee a quarrell; and in stead
of being managed with blowes, stands still, and falls out into
contumelies; and concludes that I should prove, but it selfe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
not to disprove any thing: otherwise (if I saw your
grounds of scruple) it may possibly bee beleeved, that this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
might bee cleared to you, without pretending, as you say, to
<hi>Dictatorships.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:96915:24"/>
4 I doe neither recant what was said before, nor doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>inclinations to sinne bee sinnes, i. e.</hi> aversions from God, and
then it matters not what you say I seeme to doe: I said this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and so I say still, and (how humble soever the dislike of your
behaviours towards mee may by Gods grace helpe mee to bee)
this is not recanting.</p>
            <p>5 For the danger, I shall acknowledg it, when I acknowledge
the thing, but to set downe inclinations to sinne in the front of
the <hi>species</hi> of the generall phrase <hi>[all sorts of sinne]</hi> is not to speak
sceptically. How many soever there be that teach otherwise, you
see I am not one of them; And why that Author used the word
<hi>[if not,]</hi> you have been told so oft already, that you could have
no excuse to aske the reason of it againe, but your desire to lay
a new accusation on mee of complying with the <hi>Socinians.</hi> Which
Sir is, as your accusation, so your calumnie againe, if you meant
any other thing by <hi>compliance</hi> then the desiring more to bring
all to humble themselves before God for their inclinations to
sinne (on what principles soever they went) then at that time,
in the midst of a <hi>Practicall Catechisme,</hi> in the matter of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to fall a disputing with all commers about originall sin.
For the <hi>Liturgie</hi> you speake of, if you know not my minde, let
mee tell you, 1 That I would have the Letany continued in the
Church, the first part of which is sufficiently contrary to your
<hi>[&amp;c.]</hi> and this you may guesse by a Book which I professe to
subscribe to in that particular, <hi>viz. The view of the Dir. page</hi> 25,
and 26. Then secondly, that I would have the <hi>Doxologies</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and how that would become such a Liturgie you may
see, <hi>View of the Dir. page</hi> 32, and 33. yet farther, that I would have
the <hi>Creed</hi> continued, yea, and <hi>kneeling at the Sacrament,</hi> among
other reasons for this, (on which the Protestants in <hi>Poland</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
sitting,) because I would not comply with the ancient or
moderne <hi>Arians,</hi> or any other that make our Saviour a meere
creature. For which I shall direct you also to that <hi>View of the Dir.
page</hi> 28. I shall not now aske you which is more complyant to
your <hi>[&amp;c.]</hi> the New Directory, or Old Liturgie; nor whether a
<hi>Socinian</hi> may not more conveniently officiate now (and so, in
that case, those of his opinions joyne with him) then they
could six yeares agoe, when the whole Church service was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to bee read constantly in every Church. I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96915:24"/>
to trouble you with any new questions, but onely to bee
satisfied by you in matter of fact what wrong you have done
that Author in your Sermons, and to shew you that it is wrong.
As for reparations from you, I now know you better then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
to expect any, and by your carriage in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and your <hi>[If I were composing such a Liturgie,]</hi> I am for the
future arm'd to bee content with what now I finde, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that when you want even words in the Author to cavill
at (as it will bee long before those will bee wanting, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to have seen an art of cavilling that turn'd every word
of the <hi>Creed</hi> into heresie, or blasphemy, or Atheisme, and then
what shall become of this poore mortall fraile Catechisme, when
such an artificer is resolved to triumph over it?) possibilities,
and jealousies, such as the <hi>[If you were composing, &amp;c.]</hi> shall bee
sufficient to rob that Author of his little reputation. That that
<hi>[if]</hi> could have no ground but in your designe <hi>quocunque modo</hi>
to defame him for a <hi>Socinian,</hi> you will guesse, when againe I
tel you that the placing inclinations in the front of sins, was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
free and full against that errour.</p>
            <p>6. I am, you see, neither of their minde that thinke inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ill no sinne, nor therefore did I blinde, but instruct my
Reader with that <hi>Orthodox expression,</hi> as you call it; and 'tis
hard that a man cannot use Orthodox expressions, but he must be
accused for doing it, upon supposition that he did it to this end
that he might afterwards tempt others to an error. God knowes
our hearts, and must onely judge that of me: and till hee have
done so, and revealed it to you, 'tis want of charity in you to say
I have not done fairely.</p>
            <p>7. If it were never so absurd, to say that godly sorrow were
to bee conceived for an infelicity <hi>quà sic,</hi> meerely as an infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
yet it might bee conceived for it <hi>[as an infelicity if not a
sinne;] i. e.</hi> by them who doubt whether it bee a sinne or no,
or who, though they are not certainly perswaded that it is a
sinne, when unconsented to, yet acknowledge it so, when it is
consented to, and then grieve for it as for a sinne; and when
it is not, acknowledge it to bee an infelicity, and grieve for that
also. Besides, an infelicity may bee such an infelicity, that it
may be matter of godly sorrow, though not <hi>quà sic,</hi> meerly
as an infelicity: as, in this point, I may have sorrow that I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96915:25"/>
have a vitious impure nature about mee, which is justly thought
by me an infelicity, especially in comparison with that pure state
of them that are with Christ; and this sorrow is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a
sorrow according to God; and the interpretation of desiring or
loving the appearance of Christ, and so a godly sorrow: and
hee that doth not positively resolve that this having a vitious
nature is more then a pollution and an infelicity, taking neither
of them for a sin, may yet mourne for it <hi>quà</hi> a pollution, not
<hi>quà</hi> an infelicity; and make good that he doth so, by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
sincerely, that hee would undergoe any infelicity, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to get rid of this pollution. And yet lastly, (which is the
onely answer necessary for you to consider to this point) if
that which you say is absurd, were so indeed, it would rather
prove, that what is called <hi>[an infelicity, if not a sinne]</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a sinne, when 'tis said of if in that very place, that it
must be matter of contrition or godly sorrow, then that it is
taken to bee no sinne, when 'tis both affirmed to be one, and
to bee matter of contrition. If I should say, that I may have
sorrow for somewhat that is an infelicity, and call that a godly
sorrow, an errour this might bee, but I hope not a dangerous
one; or if it were, not such an infectious one as to turne every
other affirmation of mine into a non-affirmation, or make mee
guilty of other errours, of which I professe (and 'tis cleare at
that time by other evidences) that I am not guilty. Thus hard
is it for flesh and blood to lay downe a quarrell or a jealousie,
when 'tis once engaged. Otherwise, plaine words might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to bee heeded to prove a man Orthodox, as well as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
consequences to arraigne publiquely, and condemn him
for errours. In how much more quietnesse have poore creatures
possest their soules, that have learnt from those words (and
ever since dayly practised) the humbling of themselves for their
very inclinations to sinne, then you that have thus used your
skill unhappily to limbeck, extract, and force poyson out of
them?</p>
            <p>8. I acknowledge, that every sin ought to bee bewailed as a
sin, and that inclinations to sin ought to bee so bewailed; and
I meant by contrition, or breaking of the heart to pieces, as
much as your <hi>teares of blood</hi> amount to: And of this I neither
doubt, nor feare to professe my sense. Yet sure they that doe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96915:25"/>
not agree with mee in that particular, may be advised to have
true griefe and sorrow for them and their own principles.</p>
            <p>9. That the corruption of our nature hath speciall influence
on our practice, I am as confident, and have considered as pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringly
as you: and this whole Catechisme was designed to
obstruct those fountaines, as much as was possible, and to helpe
to purifie unto Christ a peculiar people zealous of good works;
and according to my best understanding, I designed a scheme
that might bee instrumentall to that end: and whatever your
method would have been, and what your commands for the
particulars that might bee more expresly cleared, I could not
divine, and had liberty to use my own method. This onely I
know, that inclinations to sin are there exprest to bee sins, and
that clearely enough, that hee may discerne it who hath so much
leisure from quarrelling as to bewaile them. And indeed you
need not tell me what dangerous consequences have been inferred
from doubtfull expressions in Catechismes, &amp;c. For I have an
example before mine eyes of one that will inferre those conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from one word in such a Booke, that the whole sense
of the place contradicts directly, as much as sin and no sin are
contradictories, and then 'tis but reason a man were allow'd
pardon (and not triumph'd over presently) for being willing (when
'tis by anothers fault become so necessary) to explaine. And so
much for the third report.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>(that about faiths being, whether a condition, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Iustification:)</hi> I cannot observe by your words that
you have at all insisted on in either assembly; for though you
deny it not, yet also you affirme nothing, as in the two former,
which you owne; and as in the last you are pleased to doe.
Either then you spake to this particular, and then although it
bee a fault in you not to acknowledge it, yet till I am sure of
it, and that my reputation is concerned in it, I have no reason
farther to importune you; or else you did not speake to it, and
consequently did mee no injury in that particular, and then I
truly cannot accuse you, having no authority that you did,
worth my depending on, and that which I had, contradicted
by others, as the other of the Trinity which proved untrue,
and so the rather inclines mee to beleeve that this is so also:
On these grounds I have no temptation to adde more to this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96915:26"/>
matter, because the whole businesse which brought us now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
was to vindicate my selfe from (and that made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for me to know what had been) your accusations, and
not to render you at this time (which I can spend much more
profitably to my selfe and others) an account of my faith, save
onely where you have calumniated it. Yet because it is possible
that the questions here proposed by you, may through some
mistake or ignorance of the grounds that I goe on, bee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of some scruple to you, and it may bee my duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
those mistakings, I have now thought fit to tell you, what
is the generall ground that I build on in this matter, by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
to which you may forme an answer to those questions,
and reconcile those seeming differences which you may have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of. My grounds are these, 1 That justification is
divine acceptation, and pardon of sin. 2 That the mercy of
God, through the satisfaction and merits of Christ, is the sole
cause of this justification. 3 This worke of justification is of
such a nature, consisting meerly in Gods pronouncing us just,
accepting and pardoning, a worke of God without us, upon us,
concerning us, but not within us, that consequently nothing
within us can have any reall proper efficiency in this worke:
for then that, whatever it is, must bee said to justifie, <hi>i. e.</hi> to
accept, and pardon, which nothing in us can be said to doe,
though but <hi>minus principaliter, secundario,</hi> or <hi>realiter instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliter;</hi>
for if it had any such efficiency, there might in strict speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be some reall vertue or force in that thing, and that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the effect in some measure, at least it must act <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
primae causae,</hi> and by the impulsion of that might immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
produce the effect; which any even grace, as it is in us, hath
not force enough to doe. For either it must doe it as an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
meritorious cause, subordinate to Christs merits, or as an
inferiour efficient cause, subordinate to Gods pardoning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting;
and then, as I said, that must pardon and accept also
immediately, though not principally; as the knife cuts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
though the hand or the man principally. 4 This work
of grace in God through Christ thus justifying, is not every mans
portion, some qualification or condition there is required in
the subject, in the person whose sinnes God will thus pardon in
Christ, or without which God that justifies the sinner, will not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96915:26"/>
yet justifie the impenitent infidell: the promises of God, though
generall, being yet conditionall promises, and the promise of
pardon being one of them, as shall be proved at large if you
thinke fit. 5 This condition is set downe in severall phrases
in the Scripture, Conversion, Repentance, Regeneration, but
especially receiving of Christ, faith in the heart, an embracing
of Christ, the whole Christ, taking him as our Priest, whose
sacrifice, and whose intercession to depend on; as our King,
whose throne to bee set up in our hearts; as our Prophet, to
submit our understandings to his doctrines, and captivate them
to the obedience of faith. 6 This grace of faith hath mauy
excellent offices and efficiencies; one principall one, laying hold
on the promises, laying hold on the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; others also of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
the passions, mortifying lusts, overcomming the world.
In all these, being workes wrought in us, by God principally,
instrumentally by this grace, Faith is an efficient. But all this
doth not at all conclude it to bee in any propriety of speech
an efficient, or any kinde of logicall proper cause in the act of
justification: because there is no need of any such, God being
ready to doe his worke, to performe his promise, <hi>i. e.</hi> to justifie
the penitent beleever; and whensoever by his grace that qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is wrought in the heart, or there but truly rooted, God
pronounces that man just.</p>
            <p>I have out of my heart set downe my sense, which I suppose,
you will finde every where scattered in the Booke. I desire
not that it may prove a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> between us, (in case there
bee any word hastily let fall, which though to mee, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
my owne meaning, it bee plaine, to you, especially if
you delight to bee captious, may want explication;) but yet I
would bee glad to heare, if there bee any poyson in any of
these propositions; and whether, and wherein I am mistaken:
If not, I suppose you will be able to answer all your twelve
<hi>quaeries</hi> out of these premises, or discerne that it was imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to aske them, these grounds being thus supposed. I shall
I think, onely need to adde, that as soone as ever this new
creature hath life in him, at the first cordiall receiving the
whole Christ in vow, or resolution sincere, <hi>i. e.</hi> at the first mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of conversion thus to God, the person is justified; not one
of those in time after the other, but in order of nature, as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96915:27"/>
naturally the condition must be undertaken, before the Covenant
belongs to mee: but at what minute soever this is done, God
puts away his wickednesse, &amp;c. <hi>I have sinned,</hi> saith <hi>David, and
the Lord hath put away thy sinne,</hi> saith <hi>Nathan; I said I have
sinned unto the Lord, and thou puttest away the iniquity of my sinne.</hi>
This thus pre-required I call sanctification <hi>in semine,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
(the direct Greeke for that word) <hi>without which no man shall see
God;</hi> and consequently, without which no man is justified; for
whosoever is so, is in that condition at that minute, that, if
hee dye in it, hee cannot misse of glory. Beside this notion of
sanctification: there is another for the acts, and fruits, and state
of sanctification: and that I acknowledge a consequent of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and an effect of that grace that justifieth the ungodly.
And having added this, I conceive I have clear'd the way to your
last particular.</p>
            <p>In which, it seemes, you tooke some exceptions, which, by
what hath been said, will appeare to bee your fault, not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the Catechisme. For 1 faith and workes are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in the discourse of justification, any otherwise then St.
<hi>Iames</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> confound them; St. <hi>Paul</hi> saying, <hi>Abraham</hi>
was justified by faith, and St. <hi>Iames</hi> by workes, aud the way
of the reconciling them punctually set downe there. 2 What
hee doth say of being justified by faithfull actions, as it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the very stile of St. <hi>Iames</hi> [Abraham <hi>was justified by workes;]</hi>
so doth the word <hi>[by]</hi> signifie onely a <hi>condition,</hi> not an <hi>efficient.</hi>
And whereas you mention obedience to the whole Gospel,
constellation of Gospel-graces, &amp;c. and thinke strange that
they should bee affirmed the condition of justification, you must
remember that those phrases denote them onely in the seed, or
first life of all these proportionably to the first notion of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
and then I suppose you can make no scruple of
that affirmation. 3 You scruple that faith without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of such workes, such obedience Evangelicall, would
bee affirmed unsufficient to justification. Wherein perhaps
you thinke <hi>[workes]</hi> signifies actuall performances: but that
is not the meaning of it in that place, but the word is taken
in another Scripture-acception of it, for such obedience as
the Gospel now requires, and for that which the Story of
<hi>Abraham</hi> once makes the thing on which hee was justified, <hi>i. e.</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:96915:27"/>
resolution to obey God in the sacrificing his Son, not the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sacrificing of him: this is there called in the <hi>Catech. page</hi> 35.
Evangelicall obedience, and is set as the explication of workes;
and without this, I acknowledge to beleeve that faith would
bee unsufficient to justifie; meaning faith in any other notion
but that which doth containe this receiving him as a King, and
giving up the obedience of the heart to him. And you must
give mee leave a little to wonder why you should add, that the
words following (in that place) are as bad or worse then the
former, (and yet 'twas but civility and prudence not to name
them) when they are but a direct citation of a place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thus [the same is called in a parallel place, <hi>Faith consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
by love, Gal. 5. 6.]</hi> (for so the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendred
by the <hi>Syriack.)</hi> The truth is, the last thing by you excepted
against, was in effect a place of Scripture also. <hi>Iam. 2. 22. [Faith
made perfect by workes,]</hi> set downe in some words of paraphrase;
and then this in the <hi>Galatians</hi> might be as bad or worse then that,
(I shall mollifie the harsh phrase for you, and adde) more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Fiduciaries.</hi> As for your
disproving that doctrine, I shall not need consider that,
because the doctrine is new set when it comes to bee dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and in those termes which you see I acknowledge not: for
I doe not suppose the necessity of adding Evangelicall works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that purpose, and in that act, to make faith the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of justification. For 1 I acknowledge not faith an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of that, any other then a morall instrument, by which
I expresse my selfe to meane a condition accepted by God to
justification; and a logicall or proper instrument of receiving
Christ, (which Christ, not which Faith, justifies.) 2 Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
workes, in the notion wherein I surpose you now take
them, for fruits of faith, performances of obedience, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
not to bee either instrument or condition in the act of
justification, or to that purpose; but I require them afterwards
when occasions and opportunities of exercising that faith, of
performing those resolutions, doe call for them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
3 I make no scruple to acknowledge that wee are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by any righteousnesse inherent in us, as I oft have said,
but onely by the righteousnesse of Christ imputed: Only that
infusion of new righteousnesse (which when 'tis infus'd and rooted,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96915:28"/>
is inherent in us) is the condition without which we shall not
bee justified; not taking it againe for the actuall performances,
or acts of righteousnesse. Yet in the three last lines you have
now againe changed your question, and made it such an one,
that I cannot blame you not to bee ashamed to repeat your
arguments, or to maintain; For I shall most joyfully conclude
with you in the very words, the truth of that you say you used
those arguments to prove, <hi>viz. That wee are justified by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ alone, freely imputed by God, applyed and rested on
by Faith onely.</hi> For whatever other qualifications be required as
conditions in the subject, 'tis the worke onely of faith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in that sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> to rest on Christ. And having so well
agreed in the conclusion, one would wonder how wee should
so differ in the premises. Certainely there was some fault some
where. Was not it a willingnesse to find faults in that Book
that made it appeare so full of errours, and a heat (that might
have been spared) which turned the pulpit into a <hi>Pasquin,</hi> or
<hi>Morforius,</hi> on which that Author was to be defamed?</p>
            <p>That which I have now affirmed, I am confident is the summe
of what is said on that Point in more words, and with more
proofes and clearings in that Catechisme; and not now minced or
drest anew by your directions, or for your palate. Yet if it
may now please you, and you will ask God forgivenesse for your
slandering of me, and consider me so much, as to think that that
reputation was valuable to the Author which you unjustly labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to rob him of, I shall most heartily (as I do already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
you the injury, so) conclude this Paper, and take leave of
you, and continue</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Conceive your Letters are meant, (as they are by the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
directed) to mee onely: yet I thought it my duty to
direct you to some that are equally ingaged, and able to give
you better satisfaction. You will not beleeve mee, and I have
done. As for your discourse about desiring an exact account,
truly Sir, I doe seriously beleeve, that when you were at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
you would shew as much civility towards any Minister of
Christ, as you did towards mee. It may stand with the state
of an Arch-deacon to desire an account, if hee adde, exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
The greatest Generall will give Orders to his Officers in
as homble a stile; These are to desire. But enough, if not too
much of that. If your challenge made mee smile gravely, yet
sure you are too angry when you say, I have reproached and
slandered you; you endeavour to make mee as happy, as you
conceive your selfe to bee. Sir, I never thought that there had
been so much advantage to bee made of a Parenthesis; I doe not
desire to mistake your meaning, and am sorry to read your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse.
Your judgement is, that I seeke for nothing in
your Papers but exceptions; you intimate that I am no Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and to your selfe no friend; yet you are so curteous as to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96915:29"/>
communicate some part of your mind to your unlearned enemy:
but you professe, that you doe not cast up a ball of new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
between us, onely you are pleased to referre mee to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Book called the <hi>View of the new Directory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I acknowledge that I have heard, what I now begin to beleeve,
that that Book is yours, because you smile upon it, as Fathers use
to do upon their pretty Babes.</p>
            <p>The Author of that view of the new Directory layes downe
this rule, <hi>page 2. [Nothing is necessary in the worship of God, but
what God hath prescribed;]</hi> Pray, Sir, let us know how many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veralls
of the Common-prayer-book that are purposely left out
in the Directory, are prescribed by God.</p>
            <p>2 The said Author abuses both Presbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
but whether hee doth answer the severall Arguments
propounded by either, I leave to you to consider. Sir, if you
have any thing to say against our Learned and Reverend bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they are of age to answer you, try their
strength.</p>
            <p>3 If you please to undertake the answer of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against set Formes, you may have liberty to speake your
minde; but truly Sir, till you have performed this taske (I mean,
till you have shewen how many things are prescribed by God,
and rejected by us in this Directory: 2 Till you have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> (to say nothing of
others) you have no temptation to triumph, unlesse you meane to
triumph before the victory, as that Author doth. You should not
refer us to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> now the state of the question is so much
varied.</p>
            <p>4 If it bee granted to you, that some set Forme may, by some
persons, at least for some time, bee lawfully used; how will
you prove it necessary that any whole entire set Platforme of
Liturgie should bee rigorously imposed upon all the Ministers of
these three Kingdomes of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c? is not that the thing
which you doe so passionately long after, and earnestly contend
for? if it be not, I confesse I am much mistaken; and if it be, let
it be clearly and undeniably proved.</p>
            <p>5 In this last returne, I doe not finde you willing to owne
what your words seemed to import, <hi>[That there is some necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the Liturgy formed in the Apostles times should bee continued
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96915:29"/>
in the Church.]</hi> For you give the present Church leave to judge
of the Liturgy composed in the time of the Apostles (as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
and to make what alterations or additions, alienation or
exchange shall seeme fit to the present Church. But Sir, if those
Apostolicall men were extraordinarily assisted by the Spirit in
composing that Liturgy, shall men of ordinary gifts take upon
them to passe a peremptory sentence for altering, alienating, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing
what was (as you conceive) composed by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
assistance of the Spirit, and is by a more then ordinary
blessing and providence preserved and transmitted to posterity?
Sir, take your words according to your owne interpretation,
that the holy Ghost who setled a Ministery, enabled them in the
Apostles time to forme a Liturgy to continue in the Church,
to the end that the Ministers might pray and intercede for their
severall Congregations; and you doe certainely decline, if not
studiously, the maintaining of what you are engaged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
by your <hi>View of the Directory;</hi> if a Minister may pray as
hee ought in a congregation, without the use of the Liturgy,
which you say was formed in the Apostles time to continue in
the Church, then sure a Minister may pray as hee ought in the
Congregation, without the helpe of the late Common-prayer-book.</p>
            <p>6 You name severall Liturgies; which will you stand to, and
avouch that it is without any interpolation or corruption?</p>
            <p>7 Not to spend time about the miraculous gift of prayer,
you say there were some exercises of that gift, and confesse those
exercises to bee different from the set Formes you contend for.
Sir, is there no ordinary gift of Prayer vouchsafed to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ? should not this ordinary gift be stirred up by
meditation, and exercised in prayer? should not Ministers of
Christ give themselves to pray, and study how to pray seasonably,
according to the severall occasions administred by the various
turnes of God providence? How doe you prove, that a man
that hath not ordinary wisdome to pray as hee ought, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Christ to bee a Minister of the Gospel? Surely Sir, I
thinke a Minister should study to pray seasonably, as well as
preach seasonably, and if the Primitive method and manner of
prayer bee to bee observed, it doth not follow that the Liturgies,
which goe under the name of St. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96915:30"/>
been suspected by Learned men, should be rigorously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the Ministers of the New Testament, who have an
ordinary gift of prayer, nay, are indued with the spirit of
prayer.</p>
            <p>8 You mention the use of Psalmes, and the Lords prayer.
Why sure Sir, you did view the Directory very slightly, if you
tooke no notice of the Order about the publique reading of the
holy Scriptures, and the frequent reading of the Book of <hi>Psalmes.</hi>
Wee acknowledge the prayer which Christ taught his Disciples
to bee of it selfe a most comprehensive prayer, and not onely a
patterne of prayer; And it is specially recommended to bee used
in the prayers of the Church; if you please to call this a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
(and, it seemes, you can demonstrate no more) doe not
complaine that you are deprived of all manner of Liturgy; for
now you have told me that <hi>publique divine Service</hi> is the English
of <hi>Liturgy.</hi> Sure I am, the Parliament desires that our publique
service of God should be most divine and orderly; for their care
hath been to hold forth such things as are of divine institution in
every Ordinance, and to set forth other things according to the
rules of Christian prudence, agreeable to the generall rules of
the Word of God: and for the consent and harmony of the
Churches, there are generall heads propounded, and if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the generall heads, the sense and scope of the prayers, and
other parts of publique worship, you will have no cause to
complaine of disorder and confusion in our publique worship.
But you tell mee that wee may pray as we ought, without the
helpe of that Liturgy, which you conceive was formed in the
Apostles time; and therefore I thinke I may proceed to the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part of your task.</p>
            <p>1 Concerning your sad Story, I need say no more, but that I
am glad you have disabused one offender, I could wish that
you would disabuse all those whom you have abused with three
or foure editions of your Booke, by a remarkable Recantation
of your error. Sir, venture my arguments to any Reader, I
feare none; let your Book bee witnesse whether I charge you
justly or no: I meane your Book printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and all
printed after that Copy; I except nothing, but your lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
alteration, which was not remarkable enough for mee
to take notice of in so short a time; and therefore you must
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96915:30"/>
blame your selfe, that your Recantation was no more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for when you told mee that you added these words <hi>[In
the primary intention of the phrase.]</hi> I looked over your additions
more heedfully, and could not finde it: and I did at last read
even your lesse remarkable alterations, and the Printers Postscript,
or yours, for the excuse of your selfe and him.</p>
            <p>Sir, your first answer in the eighth Section of your Catechisme,
explains the meaning of the third Commandement to be according
to the literall sound, against perjury or non-performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misory
oaths; mark that <hi>[Promissory oaths.]</hi> Whereupon your
Scholar is immediately prompted to aske whether the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<hi>[Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vaine,]</hi> bee no more (marke that, <hi>no more)</hi> then <hi>[thou shalt not
forsweare thy selfe?)</hi> your answer is, <hi>No more undoubtedly.</hi> The God
of heaven judge between us; nay, your severall editions do judge;
there being not a syllable of the primary intention to be found in
three or four editions.</p>
            <p>2 I say, the question is, what is meant in the third Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement?
Your first answer being an explication of the meaning
of the Commandement: The second question is, whether the
third Commandement bee <hi>no more?</hi> that is, whether the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it be no more, then that thou shalt not forswear thy self?
this is most cleare to mee.</p>
            <p>3 The question is not of the intention of a phrase; that's
but a harsh expression, which must bee explained to bee meant
of the intention of the Law-giver; and it was Gods intention to
forbid foolish and wanton swearing, as well as forswearing.</p>
            <p>4 Wee had not best dispute what is primary and secundary in
Gods intention; one intention is sufficient, and that is to forbid
both.</p>
            <p>5 You are not able to make it good that that's the primary
intention of the phrase: and therefore I glanced at that by the
way.</p>
            <p>6 Your doubtfull <hi>perhaps</hi> was that which troubled mee: and
surely Sir, you doe see what reason you have to blot out <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 Why doe you say, <hi>perhaps foolish</hi> and <hi>wanton, sure prophane</hi>
using of <hi>Gods Name</hi> is forbidden? is it not as sure that foolish
and wanton using of Gods Name is forbidden as prophane using
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96915:31"/>
of it? or is not all foolish and wanton using of Gods name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane?</p>
            <p>8 Your remarkable alterations assure mee, that you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that you had not said enough against vaine assertory oaths,
in any of your editions: for the words run thus in them all, the
particular matter of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, <hi>[was of promissory</hi> (not asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory)
<hi>oaths,]</hi> which you alter thus, <hi>[peculiarly of promissory, not
only of assertory oaths:]</hi> and if that be not a recantation, I doe not
know what a recantation means.</p>
            <p>9 I said truly that a doubtfull <hi>perhaps</hi> would not restraine
youths from foolish and wanton using of the Name of God; if
Preachers bee so timerous to cry, Perhaps it is forbidden, and that
but by reduction neither, swearers will grow bold. I doe not like
your instance in this last Paper, when you say, that fornication
is forbidden in the seventh Commandement by reduction; surely
Sir, there needs no reduction to evince that fornication is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>10 You talke of the words of the Commandement; the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, of the meaning of God in the Commandement. Gods
mind is to forbid foolish swearing in the third Commandement,
and fornication in the seventh.</p>
            <p>11 I did not take notice of your argument to prove that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing
is forbidden in the third Commandement, because you
prove what I never denyed.</p>
            <p>12 You say, the Oath which you take lawfully in Judicature,
may come from the Devill in another. You are mistaken; it is not
the oath, but the vanity of the oath which comes from the
Devill.</p>
            <p>13 You come not off with honour, when you say, First, that
the superaddition (which I call imaginary) is a command of
Christ, and afterwards say, if it was not a superaddition by a
new precept, yet there is a superaddition of new light. Your
Catechisme is, it seemes, like the Tridentine Canons, capable
not onely of severall but contrary interpretations. I appeale to
your Booke againe, <hi>Lib. 2. Sect. 3. page</hi> 93. First, your interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that Christ came to fill up the Law, as a vessell that had
some water in it before, but now is filled up to the brim; and
that which is worse, of a picture, &amp;c. Sir, was there but a rude
draught of morall perfection in the perfect Law of God? was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96915:31"/>
it drawne in colors to the life, or as it were with a coale? Take
heed, bee not too busie in imitating any Father in a dangerous
expression, or in excusing the great evacuators of the Law.
Secondly, though you pretend often to bee very carelesse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you prove a superaddition or improvement of the Law to
have been made by Christ, yet you confesse that it is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a weighty superstructure, <hi>page</hi> 94. Pray Sir, declare
what that superstructure is. Is it that you may be justified by
obedience to these new superadded precepts, and yet say that
you are justified by a righteousnesse without the Law? say ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
is that the superstructure, or is it not? 3 Doe you not
tell us, that <hi>light</hi> is the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christianity, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sinne and imperfection?</hi> observe how untowardly that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
runs; though you do not bring it round, yet you goe too
farre; you say, that before Christ, there was some mixture of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
and some vacuities in the Commandements of God;
you are speaking of the morall Law; you say, <hi>These vacuities
are filled by Christ, page</hi> 94. These expressions sure have reference
to new precepts, and not onely to new light; if not, read <hi>page
96.</hi> to shew that Christ came to <hi>fill up the Law,</hi> say you; first
hee rehearses the old Law, and thereby confirmes it, and then
annexes his new Law to it. What say you, who is blindfold
now? is not this undeniable? 4 You speak too doubtfully,
<hi>page</hi> 95. when you say, that Christ under the Gospel gives <hi>higher
or plainer promises:</hi> you should speak with more resolution in a
Practicall Catechisme. 1 There was Gospel under the Law, and
the Spirit was ministred to all the elect then, during the time of
legall administrations; divers Jewes were penitent beleevers, and
therefore under the second Covenant before Christ came in the
flesh. 2 The promises were plaine enough to them that were
endued with the Spirit, as is evident by the Apostles discourse
in the 11 Chap. to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> they were so plaine that they
saw them, were perswaded of them, and embraced them; though
the thing promised, the Incarnation of Christ, was farre off, yet
their light was so cleare, and eye of faith so strong, that they
beheld Christ afarre off. 3 Wee have no higher promise then
that of being heires and co-heires with Christ in glory, and
they had the promise of eternall life, the promise of being
blessed for ever in Jesus Christ. 4 The ceremonies which you
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96915:32"/>
say had nothing good in them, did direct to Christ, and therefore
there was this good in them, that they did by Gods ordinance
and blessing direct the elect of God under that dispensation unto
Christ, in whom they were to enjoy all-sufficient and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
good things in glory. 5 No sinne was able actually to
damne penitent beleevers during the time of legall administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And therefore I wonder at your discourse in the 95 <hi>page.</hi>
Pray Sir, is there any veniall sinne? 6 You speake too faintly,
when you call the Evangelicall discoveries before Christ, glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings
of light, and insert the scepticall <hi>perhaps, page</hi> 95. of
your Pract. Catech. Sir, there is no perhaps, no hap-hazard in
this businesse; Jesus Christ was sufficiently discovered during the
time of Leviticall administrations to all the elect for their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
salvation. 7 When you speake of the glimmerings of
the Gospel, you say these things were not universally comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to all under threat of eternall punishment, but onely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them that will doe that which is best, and so see good
dayes, &amp;c. Observe 1 That you doe here by consequence assert,
that there were counsells of perfection under the Law: I will
not say workes of supererogation, but the Jewes were (it seems)
encouraged to doe somewhat more then was commanded. 2 Will
you say, that to beleeve in the promised seed, to circumcise their
hearts, mortifie their lusts, reforme their lives, walke in new
obedience, was more then was commanded in the time of the
Leviticall dispensation? 3 Will you say, that the Jewes were
not obliged to beleeve in the promised seed, circumcise their
hearts, and the like, under threat of eternall punishment? I
might enlarge, but by your answer to these few proposalls, I
shall be able to understand your obscure Catechisme; doe not
say, that there is a Sarcasme in the Epithet. I hope, you will
now confesse that you did contend for <hi>new precepts;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you recant once more, if you will bee satisfied with <hi>new
light.</hi> Sir, counsells give new light, but you say the superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in the fifth of <hi>Matthew</hi> are all commands, and not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
onely; and you endeavour to prove it <hi>ex professe, page</hi> 96.
Surely the same things were commanded of old; then these are
but imaginary superadditions, as I called them: but if they bee
superadditions, and not onely counsells but commands, they are
new precepts, and therefore you did not contend for new light
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96915:32"/>
onely, but for new precepts. By this little that hath been said,
it is cleare that you had some weighty superstructure to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ample foundation of new precepts, or else you did but
sweat and toyle in laying the foundation that you might have
your labour for your paines, which you are too wise to doe. <hi>Sic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>notus
Vlysses?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I desire is, that you would alter from worse to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for I joyne with you in professing that such an alteration
doth declare amiable and imitable qualities. Finally, if you
contend not for new precepts, then acknowledge that the super-additions
you dreamt of were, as I said, imaginary; and I must
remember you that the third Commandement, which is out of
question the command of God, and Christ, and the holy Ghost,
will by Gods blessing bee most prevalent to restraine men from
foolish or wanton using of the name of God in assertory oaths,
or any other idle using of Gods name when they doe not sweare.
What I said of Criticismes was no Sarcasme: I did but remember
you that Critiques are apt to thinke themselves so farre above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, that they doe usually contemne the serious admonitions
of poore Countrey Preachers. But as high as the Critiques
thinke themselves, I hoped that you would not thinke them
mounted to the highest heaven, and therefore called it a lower
heaven.</p>
            <p>You tell mee, <hi>[That you doe onely desire to study the morall Law,
as you finde it delivered from the second Mount]</hi> in your last return,
<hi>page</hi> 14. So say the men whom you cry out upon, the <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and they give this for a reason, because the Law of God pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> doth not in their opinion oblige be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you goe beyond them in the next page,</hi> pag. 15. <hi>and imply,
that no unbeleever is obliged under paine of damnation, to observe
the morall Law. Your words are to this effect,</hi> [That Christ, who
gives more grace then was brought into the world by the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or nature, hath disburdened all men of that sad yoke that lay on
the Iewes, and is content to accept of sincere, without not-sinning
obedience.]</p>
            <p>1 I desire to know what grace was brought into the world
by the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> Doth not the Apostle say that grace came
not by <hi>Moses,</hi> but by Christ onely? 2 How doe you prove that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96915:33"/>
all men, I meane, every one of mankinde, is put under the second
Covenant? I suppose that is your meaning, because in your
Pract. Catech. <hi>page</hi> 5. you affirme <hi>[That Christ did satisfie for all
the sinnes of all mankinde, and that all other parts of the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
are consequent and dependent on that]</hi> And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that in your opinion there is a revelation of the Law of faith
made, a pardon granted, and sufficient grace given to every one of
mankinde to performe what is necessary now under the second
Covenant; because you acknowledge that these are mercies made
over in <hi>Christ</hi> by the second Covenant, in the selfe same page; and
to whom are the mercies made over, but to them for whose sinnes
Christ hath satisfied? 3 I desire to know how Christ could disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
any man, or satisfie for the sinnes of any one, according to
your opinion, if he did onely exercise the office of an Aaronicall
Priest by his sacrifice? For it is certain that no Aaronicall Priest
did ever make any more then a Typicall satisfaction by the exercise
of his office; and you adde, that when the Scripture speaketh inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
of Christs Priesthood, or his eternall Priesthood, or of his
blessing us and turning of us from our iniquities, these expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have no reference to his <hi>[single, finite, unrepeated sacrifice upon
the crosse, which belongs to his Aaronicall Priesthood,]</hi> but they must
be understood of his Melchisedechian Priesthood, to which hee
was consecrated by his death, which you terme an Aaronicall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and looke upon it as a rite and ceremony for the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Christ to be our eternall High-priest, <hi>page</hi> 17, 18, 19. You
think you have gone farre beyond the <hi>Socinians</hi> in this point; but
heare what <hi>Smalcius</hi> saith, <hi>Non est autem dissimulandum nos non
negare Christimortem ad ejus sacrificium pertinere,</hi> Refutat. Smiglec.
de erroribus nov. Arianorum, lib. 2. pag. 282. a word is enough to
a wise man. Our case stands thus then, 1 Your doubtfull <hi>perhaps</hi>
will not restraine men from foolish wanton swearing; you did
well to blot out that. 2 Your new precepts will not doe it, and
you doe well to rest satisfied without them. 3 Your totall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of swearing it selfe will not doe the deed; because Christ
doth onely prohibit false swearing and vaine swearing, he doth
not prohibit swearing it self; for if swearing it selfe were prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it would never be lawfull to sweare in any case; even as
adultery it selfe is prohibited, and therefore it is not lawfull to
commit adultery in any case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96915:33"/>
I hope you will distinguish between vaine swearing, and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it selfe; if swearing it selfe bee prohibited, I must not
sweare for the publique good, because I must not doe any thing
that is prohibited, though it tend to the publique good. You won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to heare me speake of <hi>Smalcius,</hi> and demand who is not of that
opinion? Sir, remember that you say, <hi>[Christ hath superadded to
the old Commandement a totall universall prohibition of swearing
it self, making that as unlawfull now, as perjury was before,]</hi> pag. 120.
Now for a man that maintaines this, to say likewise that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to swear for the publique good, is to speak like <hi>Smalcius, &amp;c.</hi>
Examine well whether you be not guilty of the sinne of dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing:
for I know if you did not condescend too passively to
take up both opinions, you have reason enough to discerne that
these opinions do fight with one another. Sir, I have proved it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
take one argument more. If swearing it selfe be as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
now, as perjury was before Christ came in the flesh, then it is
as unlawfull to sweare for the publique good, as for a man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
himselfe for the publique good, which I hope you will not
affirme. A man may be lawfully called to sweare, but no man
can be lawfully called to forsweare himselfe; <hi>Ergo</hi> swearing it
selfe is not as unlawfull as perjury. If you wonder that rationall
men should contradict themselves, I answer they seldome doe it
but upon a designe; and I could easily guesse at the designe, but
you have taught me to be more reserved.</p>
            <p>In the 12 <hi>page</hi> of your last Answer, you say, <hi>That what is
forbidden by reduction is not so deeply obliging;</hi> and therefore I stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at your notion of reduction, considering that you say, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
is forbidden by reduction</hi> in the seventh Commandement.
Sir, I thinke my selfe as deeply obliged to abstaine from forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as from adultery, I meane, by the same Authority. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
you plead there, that Christ may bee said to have added to
the third Commandement, because he forbids swearing by any
thing else as well as by God. 1 Were men at liberty before
Christ came to sweare by any creature? 2 Wee may now in
some cases sweare by God, but in no case by the creature; and
therefore swearing by God is not totally and universally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
as swearing by the creature is. You tell mee that
<hi>Schindler</hi> is as venerable an Author as <hi>Pagnine;</hi> truly Sir, I am
not ashamed to professe that I have profited by that edition of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96915:34"/>
               <hi>Pagnine</hi> which <hi>Mercer</hi> put forth. If you conceive <hi>Grotius</hi> more
venerable then <hi>Mercer,</hi> hee will assure you that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>proprie
significat vanum. R. Isaac Abarbinel</hi> on the 20 of <hi>Exod.</hi> saith, the
word is taken so largely in the third Commandement as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
both vaine and false oaths. If I had said, false oathes
had not been prohibited in the third Commandement, I would
have considered your argument drawne from the signification of
the word in the ninth Commandement. If you please to consult
<hi>R. David Kimchi in libro Radicum,</hi> hee will prove by the <hi>Talmud
Ierusal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Onkelos,</hi> that the word signifies <hi>frustra, &amp; sine causâ;</hi>
and that hee who sweareth that figs are figs, is to bee punished for
swearing in vaine; hee cites the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 21. to prove that the
word signifies <hi>vaine, [surely in vaine have I kept.] David</hi> doth
not say hee kept <hi>Nabals</hi> cattle <hi>falsely,</hi> but <hi>in vaine;</hi> nay, you will
finde, that they tell you that a false oath is forbidden, because
what is false is vanity, and <hi>Tohu,</hi> and nothing. I cited <hi>R. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
Aben-Ezra</hi> on the the third Commandement; and he will
tell you, that one that hath accustomed himselfe to sweare vainly,
will sweare in one day oaths without number; and if you reprove
him for swearing, hee will sweare that hee did not sweare, and
much more to this purpose. See <hi>R. Solomon Iarchi,</hi> if you please;
you will finde, they all come to this, <hi>non assumes nomen Domini
gratis, frustra, in vanum;</hi> and therefore you need not reject, what
was humbly tendered to you, with so much scorne and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
You say, by <hi>[would be forbidden]</hi> you did in effect meane
were forbidden. I doe not understand what you meane, when
you say you did in effect meane it: but let that passe. I understand
you better when you talke of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: I forgive
you: and if that be part of your Rhetorique, I doe not envie you,
and will not imitate you.</p>
            <p>I passe on to your scanning of the third Report. 1 Sir, if you
did not doubt, you did ill to speake doubtfully; for your doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expressions may helpe to make or keepe others doubtfull.
2 You acknowledge something worse then that I charged you
with, namely, that you used that expression to serve them, <hi>[Who
thinke our naturall aversion from God, and inclination to all sinne, to
bee no sinne, but an infelicity, unlesse actually consented to,]</hi> by labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to doe them good upon their owne principles. Sir, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee brought to true repentance upon false principles; if mens
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96915:34"/>
principles are corrupt, refute their principles, and instruct them
better, that they may bee better principled; Otherwise if you
build upon a false foundation, your building cannot stand, and
they will be hardened in their impenitence by your connivence.
Be pleased to take notice, that this corrupt opinion is not a foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abasing
principle, but rather a selfe-exalting error; and therefore
the pressing of such a principle upon them, wil never humble them.
If you had told them, that we are all by nature spiritually dead, in
a polluted and cursed condition, this might humble them; but if
you serve men upon their owne proud principles, they will take it
for granted that their principles are good, and grow the prouder.
No man can conceive true godly sorrow for his actuall sinnes, who
doth deny the very root and fountaine of all his sinnes to be a sin.
3 You suppose, that corruption is not cherished in some act, and
conclude, <hi>ergo,</hi> in that act it is not cherished; just <hi>idem per idem.</hi>
4 You are desired to prove what you take for granted: is not that
equall? I say, that originall sinne is truly and properly a sinne in
them that are not of age to consent to it; and that every actuall
sin in men of ripe yeares, is not actually and formally consented to;
corruption is so strong in us, that it doth many times breake forth
without our consent; and I am ready to prove both propositions,
if you doubt of them. 5 You were ill advised to passe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
in a Practicall Catechisme, with men of corrupt opinions,
contrary to your owne principles. 6 You mention the <hi>Socinians</hi>
very often; but let me intreat you to be wiser: do not provoke me
to make a parallel between your expressions and theirs. I take not
upon me to know any mans opinion, or his heart, any further then
his words declare both. 7 When I spake of a Liturgy that was
in designe, you know I did not meane the Common-prayer-book.
8 For your <hi>View of the Directory,</hi> doe not magnifie it till you have
finished your taske; never talke of the suffrages of the Jewes, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
or Mahometans, but speake to the point; I have shewen you
the point in question. 9 You would have <hi>Doxologies</hi> and <hi>Creeds:</hi>
is this worth answering? doth not the Directory take in the whole
Scripture for a Liturgy? and are there not Doxologies enough, and
Creed enough (even all things necessary to salvation) in the holy
Scripture? When the confession of faith is published to the
world, you will finde this Reverend Assembly (so much scorn'd
in that Booke you subscribe to) bee no enemies to any Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96915:35"/>
Creed: and you may, amongst the rules and directions
about the Sacrament, in the Ordinance of <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. 1645. see
that wee have not forgot our Creed. 10 I am not at leisure
to dispute with you about sitting at Sacrament; the Parliament
is not guilty of your illogicall conclusions, though you would
faine expose them to contempt in your <hi>View of the Dirictory, View
Dir. ca. 1. p.</hi> 1. If it please you, we will put it to the question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Directory (in which there is the wisdome of two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
two Assemblies, which I oppose to your wisdome) or
your Pract. Catechisme give more countenance to <hi>Socinian</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and practises? I will dispute this question with you where
you please, and when you please. 1 Shew mee where the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
doth enjoyne all communicants to sit in the act of receiving.
2 Tell mee whether all familiarity with Jesus Christ doth inferre
an equality. 3 Doth any <hi>Socinian</hi> thinke himselfe equall with
Christ, or conceive that there is no more honour due to Christ,
then to a meere man? Pray, doe the <hi>Socinians</hi> no wrong, they
will say as you say, That Christ did not blesse us till after his
resurrection, till hee became an everlasting Priest; and ever since
he was such a Priest, hee hath all power in heaven and earth, a
power equall to Gods power, and therefore Divine honour is
due to him. <hi>Sed tum cultum qui nunc Christo debetur postquam in
coelis esse coepit, qui est, ut ipsi tanquam Deo confidamus, &amp; omnia ab
illo speremus, &amp; petamus quae ad salutem aeternam pertinent, adeoque
ipsam aeternam salutem dicimus ei deberi, non propter qualemcunque,
sed talem &amp; tantam potestatem quae par sit Dei potestati,</hi> Smalcius
refutat. prim. lib. Smig. de erroribus Arianorum, cap. 11. p. 109.
Sir, I will give you a better Argument against the Directory,
and for the Common-prayer-booke; you may read it, <hi>View of the
Directory,</hi> page 27 <hi>[It is not necessary to exchange the pleasant easie
course of our Liturgy, for the tedious, toylsome, lesse-profitable course
in the Directory.]</hi> Tell Prelates and Courtiers of ease and pleasure,
and you winne their hearts. This was a good Argument for an
University Orator to urge, but this same word <hi>Ergo</hi> spoiles all such
Rhetoricall arguments. I hasten to your discourse about godly
sorrow: This is your first assertion. 1 <hi>Godly sorrow may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for the pollutions of our nature, as infelicities, if not as sinnes.</hi>
Be pleased to prove this proposition; and I will abide by it, and
maintaine the negative. 2 <hi>Hee which doubts whether originall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96915:35"/>
sinne bee a sinne, may conceive godly sorrow for it,</hi> this is the second
dictate. But your third Dictate is admirable. 3 <hi>He that thinks
inclination to sinne no sinne, but when he actually consents to it, may
when hee doth not consent to it, grieve for it as an infelicity.</hi> Sir, the
question is of Godly sorrow: is it godly sorrow, or is it not, for a
man, to grieve for an infelicity, which, as he conceives, is no way
sinfull? 4 You say, <hi>If a man look upon originall sin as a pollution,
though not as a sinne, hee may grieve for it with a godly sorrow.</hi> I had
thought that all pollution of the soule of man had been by sinne
onely, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 23.</p>
            <p>You are much mistaken, when you say, that they who thinke
originall sinne no sinne, may bee advised to true griefe and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for it on their owne principles. If by true griefe you meane
a godly sorrow, no man mournes for sinne after a godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
but he that grieves for it as a sin against God. Sir, in a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Catechisme, you should have laid undeniable grounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
and therefore either plainely proved, or at least reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
asserted originall sinne to be a sinne, without any <hi>ifs</hi> or <hi>ands:</hi>
For where shall a man begin in his repentance, if he bee not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that originall sinne is a sinne? should hee not lay the axe to
the root of corruption, and bewaile the fountaine of pollution?
will not hee be apt to doubt whether actuall sinnes be sinnes, who
doubts whether an inclination to all sinne be a sinne? surely such
an acute wretch will say, My inclination to such and such an act is
naturall, and not evill. <hi>Ergo</hi> this and the like acts, to which I am
naturally inclined, are not evill. You know that I could adde;
let mee beseech you to consider what hath been said, and I will
passe on to your fourth report.</p>
            <p>Your fourth Report concernes Justification. Sir, I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to give an account of your faith, but I should have
been glad that you would have vouchsafed an answer to my
<hi>quaeres.</hi> I thanke you for your second acknowledgement that
you were mis-informed, and I thanke you for your endeavour
to prevent mistakes. Truly Sir, I doe not wilfully mistake your
sense, nor doe I desire to take any advantage of an hasty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
            <p>Your first Proposition is, that <hi>justification is divine acceptation
and pardon of sinne.</hi> I will not stand to aske you why you put
acceptation before pardon; it is likely that was not done
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96915:36"/>
               <hi>de industrià;</hi> but I would know why you speake of remission
and acceptation, and leave out imputation? I observe, that in
your second proposition you doe affirme that <hi>[The mercy of God,
through the satisfaction and merits of Christ, is the sole cause of this
justification.]</hi> Doe not thinke mee too curious, since you desire
mee to give my opinion of these propositions; you know, there
are some that distinguish between a first and second justification;
and they doe expresse themselves warily, and they will grant what
you say, so you will give them leave to chuse which they meane,
this, or that justification. But I will judge charitably of you,
hoping that by this justification you intend not to imply that
there is another justification; and so, as they say, a first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
justification. Give me leave to aske you a question or two
about the second proposition, compared with the fourth, and
with some passages in your <hi>Practicall Catechisme,</hi> that by a cleare
answer to a few <hi>quaeres,</hi> many mistakes may be prevented.</p>
            <p>In your second proposition you say, <hi>The mercy of God, through
the satisfaction and merits of Christ, is the sole cause of justification.</hi>
In your Catechisme you say,<note place="margin">Pract. Cat. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>That Christ did sacrifice himselfe for
all the sin of all mankinde;</hi> and yet in your fourth proposition
in this last return you say <hi>[That this worke of grace in God through
Christ, is not every mans portion.]</hi> Sir, if Christs satisfaction bee
the sole cause, and hee hath made satisfaction for every man,
the grace of God (which extends as farre as Christs satisfaction)
must be the portion of every man for his justification by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ alone. My first <hi>quaere</hi> then is, 1 Why the grace
of God in justifying those for whom Christ hath satisfied, doth
not extend to every man for whom he hath satisfied? 2 Whether
the qualification and condition, which you require in the subject
bee bestowed upon the elect absolutely or conditionally? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
you say is a condition which doth dispose the subject
for justification, that is, for acceptance and pardon, as I conceive,
and you expresse. Pray Sir, shew mee what condition God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
unregenerate persons to perform, that they may attaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
regeneration, which you take to be the condition of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I acknowledge, that God doth never justifie an impenitent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell
<hi>in sensu composito,</hi> that is, the infidell doth not remaine an
impenitent infidell; but then you must grant on the other side,
that God doth justifie the ungodly. 3 Whether there be any
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96915:36"/>
condition which doth so qualifie the subject, as that you can
say, by these habits, acts, vowes, and these onely I am justified?
<hi>Pract. Catech. page</hi> 28. Sir, Learned men say that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
required to dispose the subject for justification; but there
is a condition, namely Faith, bestowed upon none but the elect,
to receive the object of justification, Christ, and his compleate
obedience, perfect righteousnesse; and hence (as I conceive)
some men (that meant well) say, there is a condition required,
that is, to receive the object; and others say, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
required, that is, to dispose or qualifie the subject, so as
that the subject shall bee constituted righteous by that dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or qualification. I speake as plainely as I can devise, that there
may bee no mistake. God doth by his free and effectuall grace
worke the hearts of his elect to receive Christ, that they may
bee justified; not by their own obedience, or vow of obedience,
but by the obedience of Christ alone, freely imputed by God, and
rested on by faith onely.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Learned men doe distinguish betweene disposing of
the subject to salvation (which is the last part of the excution of
Gods decree of election) and disposing the subject unto justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
though they grant that there is a condition to enable the
subject to receive the object Jesus Christ, who is <hi>Iehovah</hi> our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.
And therefore Protestants do maintaine, that all the
habits and acts of grace which are in the best of men concurring
together, are not sufficient to justifie a man before God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith concurring with a vow of obedience, or any faithfull
actions, cannot justifie us: Though faith alone bee said to justifie
us Relatively, that is, in regard of the object received by faith. I
acknowledge with you, that justification is Gods act, wee cannot
pardon out selves, and God sitting as a fatherly Judg upon a
throne of grace, doth justifie us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> upon the
8. of <hi>Rom. 33. vers.</hi> Sir, let me intreat you not to wonder, that I
find fault with some passages in your Book, which you say are in
effect places of Scripture. Sir, to abuse the Scripture for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of any error, is to my apprehension a great deale worse
then to deliver any erroneous conceits in our own language. The
Papists say as you doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they say no more then St. <hi>Iames</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
saith. I did not dreame that you thought <hi>Abraham</hi> was
justified by the actuall sacrificing of his sonne: <hi>Socinus</hi> saith, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:96915:37"/>
was justified by offering up of <hi>Isaac.</hi> I doe not think he
means it in any other sense then that which you repeat; namely,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by a resolution to obey God in
the sacrificing of his Sonne, not by the actuall sacrificing of
him.</p>
            <p>Sir, I am heartily glad to heare you acknowledg that you
agree with mee in the conclusion: bee pleased to retract all that
is contrary to that conclusion in your <hi>Pract. Catechisme,</hi> and
then I am sure you must retract what I complained of. Pray
Sir, doe you not thinke that we are justified by a sincere vow
of obedience, as truly as wee are by faith? that is, that
our vow of obedience is a condition of Justification; I doe not
say an instrument, for you deny faith to bee an instrument of
justification. And therefore if a sincere vow of obedience be the
condition of justification, wee are justified as truly by that, as
by faith. 2 Consider that you say in this last returne, <hi>p. 20.
[The condition must bee undertaken before the Covenant belongs to
me.]</hi> This vow or resolution of obedience is, as I conceive, that
which you call the undertaking of the condition; why then
surely obedience is the condition of the Covenant of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for obedience is that which is undertaken in a vow of
obedience. 3 If by Covenant you meane the whole Covenant
of grace, you must make some condition goe before our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also. 4 You know the Papists speake as fully as you
doe any where for the meritorious satisfaction of Christ: but
you know what they say of the <hi>praevious dispositions,</hi> to dispose
and qualifie the subject for justification; and you know what
others say of the vow of obedience. 5 Though to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
bee Gods act, yet to receive forgivenesse is an act of faith.
<hi>Acts.</hi> 26. 18. Wee doe not receive a pardon by an act of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or by a vow of obedience, or receiving of Christ as King,
and giving up the obedience of the heart to him; I beleeve
you have not forgotten these expressions which are scattered up
and downe in your Catechisme and Papers. If faithfull actions
bee the onely thing whereby a man is justified, as you affirme
<hi>page</hi> 28. then are wee not justified onely by a vow of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If faith bee unsufficient to our justification, unlesse it bee
consummate by love, that is, by acts of Christian charity, or
keeping the Commandements of God, as you expound that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96915:37"/>
phrase, <hi>page</hi> 35. then sure you cannot say you plead onely for
justification by a vow of obedience. Unlesse you will make a
first and second justification, I doe not see how you can come
off. On the other side, if wee are justified by a vow of perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

Christ, as that obedience whereby wee are constituted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
nor by faith onely, as that whereby wee receive a pardon;

Sir, I doe not yet see how you can agree with mee in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
namely, that we are justified by the obedience of Christ
alone, freely imputed by God, applyed and rested on by faith
onely, unlesse you will retract those passages in your Booke,
which were justly complained of, for the good of you, and this
whole University. I speake plainely and freely, as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON <hi>Saturday, October</hi> 31. I received your Papers (dated the
day before) by way of return to mine of <hi>October</hi> 20. That
night I got a liberty from other avocations to read them over,
and am now on <hi>Munday</hi> at the beginning of the weeke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on preparation to give you some account of them. Your
letter which conducted them was but briefe, yet was willing
to take notice of one particular, that of your having written
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which though it bee onely a grammaticall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and very extrinsecal to the matter in hand, yet seeing you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make it the onely subject of those few lines, I must in civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
tell you somewhat of your manner of excusing it. 1 That
literall mistake you know you were guilty of, and I onely told
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96915:38"/>
you that you were so, and added not one word more. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of excusing or confessing it, you now desire mee onely to
pardon the mistakes of an ill <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> and adde your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that forced you to make use of him. Sir, I will doe more
then you desire. First, I will pardon that former mistake in
your selfe also; and tell you, that in one that undertakes to bee
a Scholar, (and to be very severe to those writings of other men,
which many pious persons have beene willing to receive with
some kindnesse, and now professe to see no kinde of ground
for your quarrells in them,) the not spelling so plaine a word
of Greeke, would by very many men bee hardly excused; I
meane, it would take off from their opinion of your learning,
as much as if you had written <hi>impius</hi> with a <hi>[y,]</hi> that is, more
then many faults of a higher nature could bee fit to doe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
I will beleeve (or excuse) your saying, that your haste
forced you to dictate to an ill <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> when I have some
reasons to thinke it did not. 1 Because you had had my last
Returne in your hands ten dayes, and I suppose the occasion
that caused your haste, was not knowne to you all that time,
or more dayes then one or two of them: for I professe to think
your avocation so very urgent, and should bee sorry to heare
that I was the occasion of detaining you one minute; but then
before you knew of it, I suppose that did not force you to
choose this shorter way. This was my first reason. 2 Because
the <hi>Amanuensis</hi> was so farre from being an ill one, that in the
whole paper I know but of one failing in the kinde forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and that is in the word Sacrifice, where in stead of the
letter <hi>c.</hi> there is <hi>s,</hi> which is in effect to write <hi>facio</hi> with <hi>s.</hi> But
then upon the first sight this plainely appeares to be your owne
hand, interposing this word in stead of another blotted out, as
you know I can discerne both by your former Letters, and by the
like alterations in other places of these Papers. This againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
mee to beleeve, that the dictating you mention, might bee
designed a little to conceale such slips which might possibly fall
from you, and that it was not forced by your haste onely. My
third Reason is; because I conceive it farre more speedy way to
write from my own phansie or understanding, (which may be done
without any stay but that of inventing and writing,) then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
to another, wherein much longer time is required for mee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96915:38"/>
to dictate articulately, and for him after that to write, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to recite to mee what he hath written, before I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to dictate. In this I can speake but mine owne, and some
others sense, and the common notion that I have of it; but
considering how farre my notions are wont to bee from pleasing
you, and that 'tis possible you might mean dictating out of your
Note-booke, where you may have throwne together all your
exceptions against that Author (for that your <hi>Amanuensis</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
what you had formerly writ, I suppose you doe not
meane that by dictating,) on these grounds, I say, it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
here may bee some difference in judgement between us also.
And therefore if againe you tell mee, that you have spoken your
full sense in this particular, I shall make all haste to beleeve you,
and aske you pardon for this importunity: Yet in the meane
time I will tell you my reasons also for my being so free with
you <hi>in materiâ non gravi.</hi> 1 Because I discerned so little in your
future discourse which would bee more pertinent to the matter
of my last returne; having found, that after my having answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or laid grounds of answering neare twenty questions in your
last Paper, more then the matter in hand, or my leisure enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
mee to, you have thought fit to spring new matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and to that purpose (that you may never faile of the
like matter) to catechise mee in a strange number of questions
more; when the whole intention of my Paper was, that it might
bee considered, whether you had not wronged that Author in
your first quarrells at that Booke; and not to engage my selfe
in discourse for ever with him that had so little pleasure in any
thing of mine. 2 Because by some such infirmities as these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
represented to you, you might thinke it possible for you to
mistake in greater matters. For truly, I thinke it farre more
possible for a Scholar (that reads hastily, and is intent to note
and number faults) to impose causelessely upon his Author, then
to commit such slips, (and not mend them at the review) when
hee writes as hastily. And truly if I did not beleeve that this
which I have written were fit to perswade you that this were
possible; and did I not hope, that being calmely mentioned to
you, it would perswade you, I would not venture it to your
eyes; and if I am mistaken in my beliefe or hope, doe but tell
mee so, and I promise you to retract my errour, to aske you
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96915:39"/>
pardon in my next, and (to repaire all the injury that can bee
possibly consequent to the errour) to throw thus much of the
Paper into the fire, and not to permit it to the eyes of any other
judge or witnesse, when you have thus signified your pleasure to
mee.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to your enclosed; and for your first period,
[where you repeate onely, and say you have done;] I answer, that
I have done also.</p>
            <p>In the repetition of the discourse of <hi>exact account, &amp;c.</hi> there is
a great mistake, <hi>viz.</hi> That, <hi>because when I was at highest I would
have shewed as much civility towards any Minister of Christ, as I
did toward you,</hi> therefore <hi>my present desiring an exact account</hi> of your
speeches concerning the Author of the Catechisme was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
jurisdiction over you. I must needs tell you that in my
opinion height and dignity in the Church, is not a proper ground
of lessening civility, but an obligation to encrease it to all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ, from that example of our Saviour, who when
he acknowledges the title of Lord from the Disciples to bee well
bestowed on him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 13. doth yet wash their feet, and give
them an example of doing the like, <hi>(v. 14.)</hi> when they are at
the highest also, and so <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 27. and in the parallel pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
hee requires them to expresse their greatnesse in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and sets them his owne copie of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and you shall have my opinion (and I should bee glad
to be told of it, if my practise hath not been agreeable to it) that
(as he that is not the more liberall and extensively charitable for
having received the benefit of Ecclesiasticall preferments, so) hee
that is not the more civill and truly humble for having received
any dignity in the Church, hath somewhat of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
&amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in him, and hath no countenance from
Christ, or Apostolicall institution or practise, for that misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in his dignity. From hence Sir, I will leave (and not helpe)
you to conclude, that how civill soever I would have beene to
any Minister in any degree of greatnesse, or how civill soever
any Generall may bee, if hee please, to his souldiers, my being
thus civill now, (and no more) is not exercising jurisdiction over
you, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the onely thing which I had then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate;
and so I have said enough (and shall consent to the
truth of your <hi>[too much])</hi> of that also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:96915:39"/>
Next for your grave smile, I shall not question it, or deny you
those delights, so the <hi>ridentem dicere verum</hi> may go along with
it, but sure the graver the smile was, the more it became you not
to impose on mee the exercising jurisdiction over you then, or
challenging you now, while I onely desired and begged, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
and re-inforced my request, (that you would give mee an
exact account of what you had publiquely said of that Author)
on purpose that I might think no ill of you causelesly; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
Sir, such a carriage as this, thus grounded and designed,
will neither provoke a grave smile, nor passe either for act of
jurisdiction or for challenge; or if it must, no man shall ever
bee admonished for having trespassed against a brother, and so
be brought to repentance for it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. nor shall he that
heares (or hath matter of suspition) that any injury hath beene
done him by another, have meanes of knowing surely whether
hee heares or suspects with cause, or no. As for your affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That <hi>sure I am too angry when I say you have reproached and
slandered mee, from whence you conceive, I endeavour to make you
happy.</hi> Sir, it is a heap of mistakes. For, 1 by the grace which
I meekly acknowledge to have received from God, I have beene
enabled (and I conceive, in some measure made use of the ability,
by the helpe of the same grace) to heare that I have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht
by you, and to tell you so, without being too angry,
and therefore you are not sure. 2 I did not say you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht
and slandered mee (your additions are alwaies to some
advantage of your owne;) I onely said <hi>[to this reproach of yours]</hi>
which I conceive was not said without cause; For [to say, that
my desiring an <hi>exact account</hi> of you, and not of others, (when I
knew not of any other) was <hi>to fall foule on you,]</hi> cannot be lesse
then a reproach; nay, your addition was true, (though then I
did not say it, and now I transcribe it from your Paper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any passion,) it was a slander also. 3 Hee that is too an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
doth not at all (by that act) endeavour to make him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
with whom hee is too angry; at least, not by the importance
of that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 11. unlesse the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
bee added to it; and that you doe not in this pretend I was
guilty of: of which yet I confesse to have been as guilty in those
words, as of the too much anger. 4 It ought to bee proved,
that my calling your words <hi>a reproach</hi> was without a cause also
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96915:40"/>
(which you doe not attempt to doe,) or else from thence your
conclusion had no right to he induced.</p>
            <p>In the next businesse, concerning my returne to the passage
read out of the Catechisme in your <hi>Carfax-Sermon,</hi> you are in
great haste, passing through all the many pages which I had sent
you to satisfie you about that matter, till you meet with a citation
of the <hi>View of the Directory:</hi> and then you thinke you have an
occasion to leape into a new field, and presently tell mee of my
<hi>fatherly smile</hi> upon that <hi>pretty babe;</hi> (I beseech you, bee more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne,
and impose not on mee either smiles or fondnesse to any
creature of mine; or however, doe not first faine smiles, and
then build conclusions upon them) and without more adoe you
spend foure <hi>Sections</hi> in asking mee questions, and setting mee
taskes about that <hi>View of the Directory,</hi> and severall passages in
that Author. I cannot thinke this is the way of replying; it is
certainely at the best, diverting to another matter.</p>
            <p>But Sir, in your speedy passage to this other field you scattered
something which I shall not despise so farre as not to take up
after you; and tell you, 1 That (whatever you did) you
ought to have beleeved, from the very nature and importance of
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that the advantage which I made of it was
very proper to bee made: and why you tell mee you never
thought it, and neither answer my reason, nor give mee any
to the contrary, I cannot imagine; in your haste, that unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
speech of yours might have beene omitted as well as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
2 For those speeches of mine (whereon you judge my
uncharitablenesse, and are pleased to expresse your sorrow for it,)
I must professe you have wholly mistaken them; and I think that
is done by you very unseasonably, at the very minute when you
had said you desire not to mistake my meaning, and are so kinde as
to bee sorry for mee. For let mee tell you, that such mistakings
are least incident to them that are such lovers of truth, and so
sorry to see others uncharitable. Now for your mistakes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they will be cleare to any man that reads the words; I am
sure they are to mee, that know my sense: I said, That <hi>if</hi> I
<hi>thought you sought for any thing but exceptions, I would adde as to a
Scholar and a friend, &amp;c.</hi> This no way intimates my looking on
you as no Scholar, or no Friend to mee, much lesse as on my
<hi>unlearned enemy</hi> (which againe you adde <hi>supra computum;)</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96915:40"/>
you, doe so no more, for there is difference betwixt no friend
and an enemy, as betwixt positive hating and negative not-loving)
but rather that I did looke on you (and meant to deale with
you) as both a Scholar and a Friend, if that onely third thing,
<hi>my thought that you did not seeke for any thing but exceptions]</hi> did
not interpose and hinder mee. From this 'tis cleare, that the
utmost that could bee charged upon that speech, was my <hi>thought
that you sought not for any thing but exceptions;</hi> which if I had been
guilty of, I doe not yet discerne it had beene uncharitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in all the passages betweene you and mee at this time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
at that Author, and at my words, have been the whole
affaire discernible by mee, and so there was no ground to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
my charity to thinke (whatsoever possibility might bee, on
which to hope) any other of you. But I shall not need grant
you that my former speech intimated this neither; for my
words, taken and joyned with what follows, doe not so much
as intimate that I did positively thinke, &amp;c. (for beside that
<hi>suppositio non ponit,</hi> and <hi>[if]</hi> is but a marke of a supposition) my
doing the contrary to that which would have regularly beene
superstructed on that <hi>thought,</hi> (as it is apparent I doe, by my
freely adding my whole sense in the words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
makes that <hi>[if]</hi> to bee farre from an intimation by which
you might conclude that I did thinke what is there mentioned.
Hee that proposes hypothetically [if a man were any better then
a stone, then hee would learne something] and then assume not
that hee learnes nothing, but contrariwise within few lines
affirmes that hee doth learne very aptly, doth certainely not so
much as intimate by that <hi>[if]</hi> that hee is no better then a stone,
but rather clearely affirmes the contrary. Bee pleased to apply
it to the case in hand, and you will finde you were too hasty to
conclude me uncharitable, as before you were too willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
mee angry.</p>
            <p>In the next place; whereas you adde, That <hi>I professe, not to
cast up a ball of new contention, but onely am pleased to referre you to
another Booke, the view of the Direct.</hi> This, I suppose, was a product
of your haste also, for the former part of that speech was by
mee delivered of one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> of that account given you <hi>ex abundanti</hi>
of my sense of that whole matter about Liturgy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Apostles, which therefore was not in any reason to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96915:41"/>
become matter of new contention, for then there would bee no
end. But the second thing (my reference to the <hi>View of the
Direct.)</hi> came in afterwards, in my answer to your first question,
and that too with a <hi>[besides]</hi> a note of an <hi>ex abundanti</hi> also, when
I had before sufficiently answered your question, at least so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
as that you reply not to it. What you meant by making
this change, and mixing of things so distant, you will (I hope)
upon examination of your selfe remember. And I beseech you,
for my sake to doe it, that there may hereafter bee some few lesse
materiall passages in your discourse, which may bee pas't over by
mee without occasion of confuting: For as yet you see there hath
been nothing of any deep consideration, and yet nothing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
not some animadversion.</p>
            <p>Sir, I come now to the new field you desire to lead mee to, the
severall passages which you now newly mention in the <hi>View
of the Directory,</hi> and the taskes and questions that you offer
mee on that new occasion, without any the least temptation offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by mee to bring you to it (for they are not those places
which I had referr'd you to, to which you make these excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,)
and which is most unreasonable, before you had either said
one word in answer to what I had now produced on that matter,
or confesse your selfe satisfied with it: I must leave you againe
to passe sentence on your selfe for this behaviour; and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that you have no way encouraged mee to undertake all your
commands, or defend at this time every part of every Booke
which you shall have leisure to except against. Yet Sir, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to faile you in nothing that you can vouchsafe to thinke
reasonable for you to expect, on condition that for the future you
will weigh your scruples better before you throw them into your
Papers.</p>
            <p>First you say, the Author of that <hi>View</hi> layes downe this rule,
<hi>pag. 2. Nothing is necessary in the worship of God, but what God hath
prescribed.]</hi> and from thence demand how many severalls of the
<hi>Common-Prayer-Booke,</hi> that are purposely left out in the <hi>Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
are prescribed by God?</p>
            <p>This will be very admirable to him that lookes on that 2 <hi>page</hi>
of that <hi>View.</hi> For first, that which you say, that layes downe for
a rule, is there produced onely as a ground of the adversary with
whom the Author of the <hi>View,</hi> there disputes, in these plaine
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96915:41"/>
words <hi>[I shall suppose it granted by them with whom I now dispute,
that nothing is necessary, &amp;c.]</hi> If I shall labour at any time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
or answer you by an argumant or answer <hi>ad hominem,</hi> by
urging somewhat against you, that you take for a principle, and
mention it as a thing which I suppose granted by you, would you
ever thinke fit to impose this principle of yours as a rule laid
downe by mee? If you will offer to doe this, or now conceale
that you doe it, and make advantage of it, there is no dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with you. But then secondly, you must take notice what
'twas that the Author of the <hi>View</hi> was there a proving, not
any necessitie of retaining all or any of the severalls of our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,</hi>
but that there was no <hi>necessity of abolishing the Booke, &amp;c.</hi>
That was the easie taske hee had to prove against them that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to thinke it necessary to abolish it: and you must not set
that inanimate booke new tasks (as you doe mee;) or if you doe,
you must not thus expect to be obeyed. Now I have gone thus
farre; I do remember to have heard that you objected some such
thing to the Author of that <hi>View</hi> (under the title of <hi>the same
person who was the Author of the Catechisme)</hi> in your <hi>Carfax-Sermon,</hi>
and challenged him to prove that our Liturgie was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
If the having said it there, and having conceal'd it when
you were pleased to give mee an account of that Sermon, caused
or occasioned your inserting it in this place, then though it
bee now a kinde of restitution to give it mee here, which then
you were willing to keepe from mee, (of which nature I have
heard of more, which I shall anon mention to you,) yet shall
I not thanke you for it, because you doe it under another <hi>species;</hi>
but shall onely complaine, that both there and here you were
either very unkind in not observing the maine argument of that
whole first part of that Booke, or else very unjust, if you did
discerne it, and were willing to impose so distant a theme upon
that Author.</p>
            <p>To your second accusation, I must as briefly say, that that
Author abuses neither <hi>Presbyterian</hi> nor <hi>Independent;</hi> onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the severall influences which hee professes himselfe forced
to beleeve that they had, the one sort into the premisses, the
other into the conclusion; and renders his reasons for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the conclusion is very distant from what the premises would
necessarily inferre <hi>(viz.</hi> a necessity of abolishing our Book, when
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96915:42"/>
none of the three premises ascended neare so high) and that
which the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as hee conceives, would not affirm, (for
sure all of that perswasion doe not, or have not alwayes thought
it necessary to abolish set Formes:) and I now demand of you,
whether in this thought hee did abuse them; or if not, what
else hee did say of them that can deserve that phrase from you.
For the arguments proposed by either] as farre as the Booke
with which hee undertooke to deale did propose or intimate
them, you know hee hath answered them; and till those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
are disproved, they may passe for good ones. For your chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
in the name of your <hi>Reverend Brethren of Scotland,</hi> I know
not what occasioned it, unlesse some citations out of Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>'s
<hi>Liturgie:</hi> and if those were not rightly cited, the pages are
noted in the margent, and will presently inable you to disprove
them.</p>
            <p>To your third of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> arguments against set Formes,
the businesse of that <hi>View</hi> tempted not that Author, nor doth
our present matter of debate incline mee to thinke them necessary
to bee taken in. It is not every mans worke to doe every thing
at every time: yet perhaps it might bee answer sufficient to you,
to tell you that it appeares not to mee by any thing that here
you say, that you beleeve set Formes unlawfull; and till you
professe you doe, you are perhaps as much obliged to answer
Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> arguments, as that Author; I am sure, as much as
hee is obliged to shew how many things are prescribed by God,
and rejected by you in the Directory, when hee looks not on
the Liturgie which hee defends, as any of Gods prescribing, but
onely presses the no-necessity (from thence or from other grounds)
of abolishing it, and after proceeds to some other particulars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; but no where to the divine prescription of it. If by the
answering <hi>your Brethren of Scotland,</hi> you meane any arguments of
theirs against set Formes (as you seem to doe by joyning them
with Mr. <hi>Cotton)</hi> I am perswaded by some part of that <hi>View (viz.</hi>
by the Authors producing the practise of the <hi>Scots</hi> for set Formes)
that hee never dreamt they had appeared against them, at least so
far as to thinke abolishing necessary (which was his only point in
hand,) and then you must excuse him that he did not know first,
and then not answer them. Yet after all this, what occasion you
had <hi>to accuse him of triumphing, or of doing it before victory,</hi> (when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96915:42"/>
you bring no objection against that victory, but onely his not-answering
Mr. <hi>Cotton, &amp;c.</hi> (which were things to which his
present task obliged him not, nor so much as intimated that it
did;) and when you object not one word against his answers to
that which hee did undertake) I can no more guesse, then at the
reason why that Author might not (for some things which hee had
so particularly defended, and was never confuted by any) refer you
to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> or why the state of the question is so varyed, as
you say it is.</p>
            <p>For the fourth charge and question <hi>[How it will be proved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that any whole set Forme of Liturgie should bee rigorously
imposed, &amp;c.]</hi> all that I shall need to say in vindication of that
Author is, that hee is never forced by the taske before him to
prove any such thing; if it bee not necessary to bee abolished,
it is enough for his turne against his adversary. And then for
your opinion of the matter or object of my passionate longing,
or earnest contention (who, I thanke God, am at this time nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
passionate, nor longing, nor earnest, nor contentious for
any thing but that you would permit mee to to bee quiet) I shall
not need bee much concern'd, because all that you bring to prove
all this against mee, is, that if it bee not true, you are much
mistaken: in which you cannot blame mee, if I grant the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
because 'tis easier farre then the other member, which
you have left mee, [viz. <hi>to prove clearely and undeniably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> which
sure is not every mans taske, especially when you are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I must approve these proofes to. Onely I must desire you
to remember, that to make it unlawfull to use this set Forme, is
much more then to relaxate or forbid a rigorous imposing; and
the former of these had been possible to have been done, without
the latter.</p>
            <p>5 For my not owning a necessity, that the Liturgy formed in
the Apostles times should be continued in the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as I
there expresse) <hi>that that very Liturgy should bee continued without
any alteration or additions,</hi> I am content to joyne with you; but wish
you had not mangled my words; 1 by putting in <hi>alienation</hi> and
<hi>exchange</hi> (which is there applyed to lands, not to Liturgy; and
onely used as a resemblance to shew that he that saith, <hi>[The holy
Ghost enabled a Ministery to forme a Liturgy to continue]</hi> doth not
affirme that it was necessary to continue, any more then hee that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96915:43"/>
leaves land to continue to his heires, obliges them from ever ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating,
&amp;c. which similitude will enforce <hi>à majore,</hi> what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from it, the no-necessity of not adding or altering that
Liturgie; but (whatsoever it might doe) is not there brought
home to that of alienating, &amp;c. because it is not by him that
brought it, applyed so farre, (as you will see in the place.) 2 By
saying, <hi>That I give the present Church leave to judge of the Liturgy
composed in the time of the Apostles, and to make</hi> (as <hi>what alterations
and additions,</hi> which onely I did say, so) <hi>what alienation or exchange
shall seeme fit to the present Church.</hi> Wherein you have inserted and
imposed on me almost every word recited particularly <hi>[the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church, &amp;c.]</hi> in stead of <hi>[the Church]</hi> (which signified quite
another matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church either of those Apostolicall
men, or those next following them,) and the <hi>Church</hi> againe
not onely in order to adding or altering as they should thinke
fit, but (which differs much from it) of abolishing, as the
affaire now stands; or, as you there say, <hi>alienating and exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:</hi>
(not to mention, that I no where have yet given that
Church leave indefinitely to judge of the Liturgie, much lesse
the present Church to judge so farre as to alienate.) Certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a man may affirme, that the Church next after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times may have leave to alter somewhat, (as occasions
might alter,) and to adde somewhat (as they thought fit)
to the constant Formes used by the Apostles, and so to settle
somewhat in the Church (by that adding) which might
supply the place of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which the Apostles had
above the succeeding Church, and yet not give the present
Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any persons in it, which are not the
present Church in any notion of it, leave to cast out all set Forms,
particularly those which without any alteration, those first ages
of the Church had delivered downe to us from the Apostles. So
againe afterwards, you much vary the state, when you talke of
men of <hi>ordinary gifts</hi> taking upon them to passe a peremptory
sentence for alienation or exchange. Who would thinke that
<hi>[the Primitive Churches thinking fit to adde or alter,]</hi> should be so
improved under your hands? (I beseech you once more never
to alter one word in the period with which you are displeased; for
other men that are in any degree credulous, or not very wary,
may bee deceived by your doing so; though you see I am not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96915:43"/>
altogether so ignorant of my owne sense, or of your wont, as
to depend on you without examining.) You see now how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
right your conclusion of that fifth <hi>Sect.</hi> had to bee induced
upon any words of mine: and yet let mee tell you, that if it
were granted you possible, That <hi>a Minister may pray as in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
without the use of the Liturgy formed in the Apostles times,
&amp;c.</hi> nay, <hi>without the helpe of the late Common-prayer-booke,</hi> yet
will it not follow from thence, that it is well done to abolish (with
this Liturgie) all set Forms, much lesse that it was necessary to
abolish this.</p>
            <p>To your sixth you already discerne my answer, that neither I
nor the Author of the <hi>View</hi> are obliged to shew you any Liturgie,
and avouch that it is (I suppose you meane) that formed in the
Apostles times without any interpolation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In your seventh you will not spend time about the <hi>miraculous
gift of prayer,</hi> (which if you had done, and observed the use that
I there made of that doctrine to the present purpose, it would
have stood you in some stead, at least kept you from being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of my sense, and (the consequent of it) your asking of more
questions,) and I will not spend any more time about your seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
questions then to tell you, that all that I now, or the Author
of the <hi>View</hi> contend for, doth not prove us concern'd in those
new <hi>quaeres:</hi> for were it granted, that there were <hi>an ordinary
gift of prayer, and that to be stirred up and exercised, that Ministers
should study to pray seasonably,</hi> (which I suppose is not to pray <hi>ex
tempore</hi> because you say <hi>study) that he that hath not ordinary wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to pray as hee ought, is not called by Christ to bee a Minister of
the Gospel,</hi> (and yet sure hee that hath that ordinary wisdome to
pray as he ought upon premeditation, may pray as hee ought
not, upon sudden effusion; and the Liturgie would a litle prevent
that, and perhaps enable him to pray more to the edification
of the people, then hee is able to doe, who yet is able in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to pray as hee ought) and <hi>that it doth not follow that the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
under the name of</hi> St. James <hi>and</hi> St. Marke <hi>should be rigorously
imposed,</hi> nay, that it were true that there are some <hi>endewed with the
spirit of prayer,</hi> (as that is by you set, for somewhat more then
the ordinary gift, and which it will bee heard for any man to
demonstrate to others that hee is truly possest of) were, I say,
all this granted to you, yet sure from all this heape of <hi>data</hi> (if
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96915:44"/>
they were <hi>concessa</hi> too) it would not follow that it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or so much as tolerably well done, to abolish all set Formes in
the publique service of God, which was the prime thing by that
<hi>View</hi> insisted on.</p>
            <p>To your eight <hi>[about Psalmes and use of the Lords prayer,]</hi> I
was not to be accused for too <hi>slight a view of the Direct.</hi> but you
for not observing to what purpose I now mentioned these. It
was to shew the use of set Formes in the Apostles times, and then
1 You must marke, that the using of some set <hi>Psalmes</hi> by all the
people as a part of prayer or thanksgiving, differs somewhat from
reading them as any other piece of Scripture; and let me tell you
by the way, that either the singing of them, or the manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them <hi>alternatim,</hi> is a mark (though not inseparable) of that
difference. 2 That the recommending the Lords Prayer is not
so much as the Apostles constant using it in their service, (especially
of the Eucharist) nor proportionable to our Saviours <hi>[When you
pray, say, Our Father,]</hi> and yet I suppose you will not doubt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
with me, that there are many that acknowledge it recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Directory, that constantly abstaine from using it in their
Pulpits. 3 That I conceive my selfe to have demonstrated more
then the use of <hi>Psalms</hi> and the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> (if by demonstrating
you meane proving by the authority of Witnesses <hi>fide digni,</hi>
(which is the highest way of demonstration, that matters of fact
are capable of.) 4 That <hi>[for your rule of holding forth such things
as are of divine institution in every ordinance, and setting forth other
things according to the rules of Christian Prudence agreeable to the
generall rules of the Word of God;</hi> this is not the first time you have
been told, that it is an excellent rule, and that it is farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
any necessity of abolishing all set Formes; or even all
or any part of our present Liturgy. As for the cause I have of
<hi>complaining of discord and confusion in your publique Worship,</hi> I am
not engaged by any thing I have said to give you any answer;
having not ventured on such a degree of boldnesse, to speake so
grossely either against the generall use of the Directory, or against
any of your particular exercises of your gifts. Lastly, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I did tell you, that wee may pray as wee ought without the
very Liturgie formed in the Apostles times, and so nothing
hinders but that I may goe on also to the next particular;
which you will give mee leave to have called the <hi>then sadder part
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96915:44"/>
of my taske,</hi> because it was then the <hi>longest,</hi> not because it had any
thing else beside the length, and other things of that nature, (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
still that you meane not any solid exception, or any strength
of argument to be repell'd) which might make it either taske,
or sad to mee. In that I shall not finde any fault that the businesse
of the Trinity is at length dismiss't, but suppose that you have
received satisfaction in that point. Onely it had not been any great
matter if you had vouchsafed to tell mee you were so satisfied.
But I must not expect those acts of grace from you. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow as you lead mee. And 1 Sir, concerning <hi>the sad story,</hi>
(as you please to call it) I am much tempted to wonder (but that
I have for some time a little resolved to give over that innocent
quality, and learne with <hi>Numicius</hi> that <hi>prope rem unam, Nil admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari)</hi>
that it should produce but one thing in you, and that should
be gladnesse. For though the gladnesse, as you have fastned it, I
shall not thinke a fault in you, but bee also glad with you, that <hi>I
have disabused one offender,</hi> (whose sinne no man but you, and
his owne soule was guilty of;) yet that it should not be matter of
some sorrow or regret to you, to have been the occasion of that
offence in him, (which is certainely to scandalize your weake bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and leave it still possible for many other, through that
scandall to stumble and fall in like manner;) this must bee matter
of wonder and admiration to mee, but withall of advertisement
what I am to expect from you by way of return to any act of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
admonition, and for that you shall give me leave to be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
sorry, though you will not.</p>
            <p>For you command, <hi>[That I should venture your arguments to
any Reader, &amp;c.]</hi> I professe my self ready to obey you: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall now take boldnesse to tell you, that I doe expect from
you, according to the purport of this speech of yours, that you
will give your consent that this whole matter be referred to others
judgement; and to that end, that all that hath thus past between
us be straight-way Printed; and I will then desire no further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the injury which I conceive my selfe to have received
from you. As for the witnesse you desire the matter shall depend
on, <hi>viz. that Book as it was printed at Oxford,</hi> I shall be as ready as
you to stand to it, and by that to have it tryed, whether the Author
of that <hi>Catechisme</hi> in that first edition gave any Christian man any
degree of liberty (more then you your self confesse is his due) of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96915:45"/>
swearing. This way of tryall I shall never refuse, but professe to
you (what before I told you) that the advertising you of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the last edition was perfectly <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and that the
Author was justified sufficiently from the main part of that charge
<hi>(viz. giving youth liberty to sweare)</hi> without it. And therefore by
the way let mee tell you, that when that Author had in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of his heart put in those words <hi>of the primary intention</hi> to
prevent all mistake in the most ignorant, (not questioning but
that all ordinarily learned or intelligent would understand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it,) for you to fasten peculiarly upon that one supernumerary
answer of mine, and to make such shewes of triumph, and impute
clancular dealing to that Author, and a great deale more, (on
so no manner of grounds or probabilities, when all is laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
is that, which you ought to lay to your heart, though you
will not the sad Story. What you adde againe to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
after so full an answer, is like all the rest; and as I must not
thinke that strange neither, so I despaire that my repeating my
former answers will provoke or invite any better dealing from
you.</p>
            <p>In your next <hi>Section</hi> beginning with, <hi>[Sir, your first answer, &amp;c.]</hi>
you have, I conceive, one new mistake. For by your <hi>[mark that]</hi>
twice repeated, I suppose you would have it marked that that <hi>Cat.</hi>
affirmes no more to be forbidden by the third Commandement,
then the <hi>non-performance of promissory oaths.</hi> If you meane thus, you
are much mistaken. All that is toward that sense is onely this, that
the second part of the words cited by Christ, <hi>[Thou shalt pay unto
the Lord thy vowes,] explaines the meaning of the third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be against perjury or non-performance of promissory oaths.</hi> Do
you now please to marke, <hi>[against perjury]</hi> not denying but that
the falsenesse of assertory oaths, which is also perjury, is there
meant by the words of the third Commandement; but giving the
non-performance of promissory oaths, a speciall right to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
part of that Commandement, as it is there lookt on by
Christ. And I beseech you consider, &amp; passe your conjecture, what
did, or could move that Author to adde that distinct mention of
promissory oaths in that place, but those words which there Christ
recites, <hi>[Thou shalt pay, &amp;c.]</hi> and do you tell me, if they doe not
peculiarly (nay, onely belong to promissory, (for sure assertory
oaths are not capable of being thus paid) and if the Author thus
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96915:45"/>
strictly desired to follow Christs method, ought this to bee
imputed to him? Certainly not, when hee never made question
but that assertory oaths were meant also by the third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and distinctly affirmed that perjury (which sure containes
that) was there forbidden. The considering of this might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have suggested to you this truth, that that Author was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to make it his first taske, or part of his method, to weigh
the literall importance of each part of the Text, and gaine as
much from each part, against the sinne, as hee was sure it would
necessarily import, and then to build upon it, what by reduction,
<hi>(i. e.</hi> by any thing but the primary literall importance) what by
Christs superadditions, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the words induced with a <hi>[But I
say unto you]</hi> whether they note new precepts, or onely new light)
would bee as firmely superstructed. And your want of observing
this method, this designe of that Author, is the likelist thing, that
in charity I can pitch on for the occasion of your mistake in any
part of this matter; though for your affirming that this Catechism
gave any Christian liberty of swearing, I cannot be just if I speake
so favourably. To this, which I conceived a new mistake in you,
I must adde another old one in that Section, <hi>viz.</hi> that you will still
talk of my severall Editions, (and not mean that last where the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are set;) when you have been so oft assured of this truth
(of which I can produce the confirmation of severall oaths) that
I never had the least knowledge of, or gave consent to any other
but the first <hi>Oxford</hi> printing of those few Copies, and those last
additions.</p>
            <p>For the second thing, which is so cleare to you, 'twill bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
farre from being so, if I againe tell you that the
meaning of those words of the second question, <hi>[Whether the
third Commandement is no more, &amp;c.]</hi> is most precisely this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the literall importance, (or if you will, the literall meaning)
of the third Commandement bee no more, &amp;c. and that will
well agree with the first question, what is the meaning of the old
Commandement, <hi>(viz.</hi> as 'tis delivered by Christ in these words
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the consequents out of other places, <hi>Thou
shalt performe, &amp;c.)</hi> that is againe the literall meaning, or the
necessary importance of the words produced by Christ, agreeable
to which is the answer, that <hi>'tis set to expresse it to be, as literally it
sounds, against perjury, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:96915:46"/>
3 'Tis not very reasonable for you to over-rule all others, by
saying the question is not, when I have as much reason to know
as you, (being so well knowne to him that set the question) and
affirm it is, or (because with you <hi>the intention of a phrase</hi> is a hard
expression) to conclude from thence, that <hi>it must bee explained by
the intention of the Law-giver,</hi> whereas I againe tell you that the
literall notation of the phrase is the thing that was meant by it,
and not the intention (I meane, the totall full intention) of the
Law-giver.</p>
            <p>4 For the question of <hi>what is primary and secondary in Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
[which you would not have disputed,]</hi> that you ought to
have spared also: for againe I say, 'tis about the primary or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
notation of the phrase. But you by drawing in (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the intention of the Law-giver, found it an easie change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the intention of God; but neither of those is the thing here
spoken of.</p>
            <p>5 I conceive, Christs rendring the third Commandement by
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is, as I was then confident, (beside others) a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
proofe that that is the primary intention of the phrase:
and I have reason to continue in that opinion, because you
have not dropped any word of answer to it, in all your tale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynders.</p>
            <p>6 For the doubtfull <hi>[perhaps,]</hi> if I had reason to blot it out,
you need not challenge me for doing what was rationall: the
truth is, I was not confident that every body was perswaded
or could bee convinced, that all foolish, wanton using of Gods
name (if without any kinde of swearing) was forbidden in
that Commandement, which onely speakes of taking, or lifting
up Gods name, which with the Hebrewes signifies swearing, and
(if wisemen may bee beleeved) nothing else: and therefore I was
(according to my judgement) more willing to put in <hi>[perhaps,]</hi>
then to venture a quarrell with any body in that matter; but
afterwards, conceiving <hi>(reduction)</hi> would beare it, and willing
to be as strict in this matter as I could possibly any way justifie
(God knowes, farre from any thought of being accused for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
liberty of swearing) I put in <hi>(idle)</hi> in stead of the word
<hi>(perhaps:)</hi> and so you have, you see, the fate of shrifting me.
I am not permitted to keepe any thing from you; and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
not to burthen you with a secret, or to deliver this my confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96915:46"/>
under the restraint of any seale to you.</p>
            <p>7 I have given you grounds to discerne that 'tis not so sure
that foolish and wanton using of Gods name is forbidden by that
Commandement (in case that foolish using it bee without oaths)
as profane or blasphemous using it; the former of which you
were told, I conceived to belong to oaths, and those unlawfull
oaths, (and when not to such oaths, then to something else
which was equivalent to them) as <hi>[to profane,]</hi> signifies
to use that commonly or unworthily, which is onely to bee
used in holy matters, and such are oaths resolved to bee, and
therefore called <hi>sacramenta;</hi> and the using them in common
talke, or to any but that sacred use, is to profane them; and
so you see, that was a causelesse exception also. For though
some foolish and wanton using of Gods name may be profaning
it, <hi>i.e.</hi> profaning Gods name, or using it lesse solemnly, yet is
it not the profaning of a <hi>sacramentum</hi> or oath, which sure is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the former.</p>
            <p>8 Your conclusion, <hi>truly,</hi> is not true; all that can bee justly
concluded of mee from those alterations, is this, that I began to
conceive that what I had said against assertory oaths, might bee
made more cleare to all; though 'twere to mee, that knew my
owne sense, said clearely enough before; and I ought to be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for this care, (especially by you, if to you it was not clear)
and not so oft to bee reproacht for it. And I will once more
professe, that to my best remembrance I made no one alteration
in that Booke, but onely on designe to explaine, not to alter or
retract any thing; or to alter the words that they might more
fully speak my sense. I wish there were any thing would content
you, but speaking against my conscience; I would not much care
then, if you still call'd it <hi>recantation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9 You still mistake <hi>[foolish and wanton using of Gods name]</hi> for
<hi>swearing:</hi> (and I will bee so charitable to you, as to thinke this
is it makes you so hard to bee satisfied in this matter.) But I
have oft told yon, Gods name may bee used without swearing,
and that (not using, but) taking or lifting up his name signifies
that. And then why should the <hi>[perhaps]</hi> which is not affixt to
swearing, but to something else, contribute any thing toward
the swearers boldnesse? I beseech you discerne what is so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and so oft repeated to you. The words there are, <hi>Profane &amp;c.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96915:47"/>
is surely there forbidden]</hi> and that, I have oft shewed you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
every unholy, unlawfull oath under it. For your dislike
of my instance of <hi>fornication</hi> in the seventh Commandement, there
is no remedy; you will not like any thing that comes from mee;
and yet 'tis sure enough, adultery cannot signifie fornication in
the primary sense, or save by reduction; and besides, if to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of fornication you had a propriety of dislike, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of killing would serve the turne, and that you might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have either lik'd or confuted also.</p>
            <p>Your 10 is but a recitation of what was oft said before, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the first, and second, and ninth, and there you will find
it answered.</p>
            <p>Your 11 is no faire passage, for though the proving perjury
to bee forbidden in the third Commandement, bee the proving
a thing that you never denyed, yet the inference of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there used being this, that to take Gods name in vaine is no
more in the prime sense, or propriety of speech, then to forswear,
that you know was the onely thing denyed by you, and therefore
the argument in any reason ought to have beene taken notice

            <p>In the 12 I pray bee not too confident that other men are
mistaken; 'tis in this more possible that you may bee. For when
the incredulity of another man is the onely thing that calls for
my oath from me in a matter which is not <hi>materia legitima jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi>
there the Devill having to do in the incredulousnesse, the
oath may be said to come from the Devill also.</p>
            <p>13 My honour will sufficiently bee provided for in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
also, after all your scoffes; for which soever the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addition
is, of <hi>new precept,</hi> or of <hi>new light,</hi> the super-addition
<hi>i. e.</hi> the thing thus inferred by Christ <hi>[But I say unto you]</hi> or
Christ superadding these words, <hi>Sweare not at all</hi> (either of
which is a frequent ordinary meaning of the word superaddition)
is a command of Christ without question. And therefore your
<hi>simile</hi> of the <hi>Tridentine Canons</hi> must lye upon your hands: for
this is not a place for you to put it off upon your Reader, or your
servant (that takes all this paines and drudgery for you, for no
other pay but of reproachfull <hi>simile's)</hi> the Author of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme.</p>
            <p>But, O, that this so slight an occasion should, in the midst
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96915:47"/>
of another engagement, give you hint or excuse to breake out
from hence into that other large field concerning that whole
matter of <hi>Christs adding to the Law!</hi> I wish you could have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
your selfe with 13 degrees of confutation (which sure you
would have done, if any one of them had beene solid, and if
number had not been necessary to supply for weight) and not
have thought it necessary thus to expatiate. But, Sir, I must
not neglect you, or let you passe unattended in any your most
casuall notions; But clearly tell you to that whole matter, that
I do produce the authorities of, and reasons out of the Fathers
(and confesse my selfe so weake as to be inclined, if not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by them) to confirme Christ to have improved the Law; and
shall not count this to be <hi>imitating a Father in a dangerous expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
but a full current of Fathers for many yeares, in a cleare
pronouncing. And whensoever I shall understand that those testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
or those reasons may bee likely to perswade with you,
I shall (out of a very ill topicall memory, being farre distant
from my Bookes) be ready to produce you some of them. But
then thongh in the <hi>Catechisme</hi> this be done, yet 'tis as clearely
there said that no man shall bee contended with in this matter
(a little practise of piety with peace, being valuable above a
great deale of this kinde of disputing) so hee acknowledge that
Christ brought more light, and clearely convinced men of the
unlawfulnesse of some things, <hi>which by nature or Moses men had
not been convinced to be unlawfull.</hi> Thus much for the Doctrine
once againe. As for the superstructure that the Author meant to
lay upon it, I shall satisfie your importunity, if it bee but to get
you into ordinary charity with him. 'Tis plainely and briefly
this; A serious and hearty desire that the utmost that Christs
words in that Sermon can safely and properly extend to, may
bee now thought by men the duty of every Christian; and that
it may not either bee put off (as a counsell of perfection, or a
precept for Clergy-men onely, under the stile of Disciples) or
bee brought downe againe to the old Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or the
fundamentall of nature, (and being then either not conceived,
or not found to bee so severely prescribed there, bee thought
fit to bee removed from the Christians shoulders) or else bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with some <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which by reconciling it with the
latitude thought to be allowed under <hi>Moses,</hi> may take it off
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96915:48"/>
from all strictnesse, and so from that height which I conceive
now to bee required, and which I desired very earnestly that
all men would looke on as their necessary duty, and so try by
Gods helpe (and the force of the old <hi>pythagorean hemistichium</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) whether they might not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bee able to performe it. This was the utmost of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure
by that Author designed or thought on, and that made
mee so wonder (from knowledg of my owne sense, and conscience
of my innocent intentions) that any man should say, That <hi>this
Doctrine could destroy the summe and substance of the Gospel;</hi> and
yet I confesse, I have heard of one other man that hath said that,
and perhaps from him you may remember it, and not have pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the truth of it. And so by my <hi>honest saying,</hi> which you call
for, you see what spirit of jealousie possest you, when you fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such an aereall superstructure for me, which I professe never to
have dreamt of, and to wonder at the sharpnesse of your inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that could bee so prompt for mee, I plainely confesse,
That <hi>Christ and his merits is the onely cause on which I depend, and
expect to bee justified, without the righteousnesse of the Law;</hi> and the
most obedient submission to his most elevated precepts can no
more contribute toward justifying mee then the like obedience
to the law of nature of <hi>Moses</hi> would have done, if Christ were
not conceived to have heightned that Law. When we have done
the highest that Christ requires of us, wee are but unprofitable
servants; and by our new obedience have been farre from doing
more then was required of us, or making expiation thereby for
that which we have not done.</p>
            <p>In your third Section of that matter, I grant that which you
would inferre from <hi>page</hi> 94. that the Author there produces
arguments to confirme that part of the opinion for <hi>new precepts,</hi>
and therefore I shall spare reviewing your proofes that hee doth
so: but in stead of it, tell you, that after hee hath confirmed
it both by a remarkable Scripture, and the reasons given for it
by the Fathers, (which concludes their opinion also) yet hee
confesses to be content with the acknowledgement of more light;
and that hee will not contend with any that is contrary mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so hee will bring the Jewes up to us, and not us downe to
the Jewes. Which that it is the expresse doctrine of that Book,
you have oft enough been admonished, and can never perswade
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96915:48"/>
any man to the contrary, that shall after the places cited by you,
have patience to proceed to the rest of that matter.</p>
            <p>But now Sir, you begin againe, and would seem to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
against that doctrine;</p>
            <p>As 1 that <hi>there was Gospel under the Law, and the Spirit, &amp;c.
and divers Iewes penitent beleevers, and therefore under the second
Covenant.</hi> Sir, all this is granted most willingly, and yet Christs
comming in the flesh did bring more light, more plentifull effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Spirit, and so might possibly be allowed to give new
precepts also.</p>
            <p>2 For the <hi>promises,</hi> how plaine they were to the Jews, needed
not to bee disputed by him who speaks onely of precepts (save
onely as the height or plainnesse of the promises is, amongst other
arguments, apt to make higher precepts more seasonable:) and
yet that the promises might be cleared by Christ, and made
more universally knowne, you will hardly deny or disprove al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
For though they were so plaine that they saw them, yet
'twas afarre off, in your owne citation of <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11, and they
that were present to Christ, (who was one of the promises) might
sure have a clearer sight of them.</p>
            <p>The same will bee answer to your third argument, for that
concernes the promises againe: and in that respect 'tis sufficient
to adde, that the promises were they never so high before, were
now sure clearer under Christ; and that is all that is affirmed
by that Author, and will suffice to inferre his concluded obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to higher obedience.</p>
            <p>And so likewise the fourth will be answered, concerning the
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which I acknowledge to have had some good in
them, in order to Christ whom they prefigured; but yet many of
them had none in themselves, I am sure none when Christ is come,
and hath removed the obligation of them, and so may bee allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have added some new precepts in lieu of them: and I am as
sure they have not so much of goodnesse or easinesse, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as now is in the very highest and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
precepts that are given us under Christ, and therefore there is
nothing like unreasonable in the change.</p>
            <p>In your fifth, sure 'tis not so strange that I should mention
the <hi>pardoning of sinne now under Christ;</hi> for though that was to
bee had for the penitent beleever under the time of the Law of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96915:49"/>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> yet was it 1. Not by the power or purport of the Law,
but onely by Christ; And 2 'twas not at all to bee had in the state
of nature, or first Covenant, which required unsinning obedience;
and to the Law of nature that law of Christ was said to super-add,
as well as to the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> and therefore that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in the 95 <hi>page,</hi> was not impertinent neither, or capable of
your sad wonder. But how I am obliged to thinke your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<hi>[Whether there is any veniall sinne?]</hi> tolerably pertinent, or
fit to expect any returne from mee at this time, I cannot guesse,
yet shall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and answer that also; that though no sinne
have any title to pardon under the first Covenant, yet under or
by the purport of the second, many sinnes not gotten out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
&amp;c. shall be washed in Christs blood, and so bee actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
pardoned, (which is more then veniall or pardonable in
that sense) whereas many other shall never bee capable of that
washing, or that pardon, without particular forsaking, but
bring them that lye under them (impenitent unbeleevers) into
condemnation. This were abundantly enough, considering the
call I have to the answering of that question at this time. Yet
to demonstrate to you that I am not over shy of answering you
a question (though it bee of some nicety) when you think fit to
ask it me, I will goe a little farther to serve you, and give you the
state of this question (if you please, by way of supposition at large)
in such a manner possibily that no party will find much to object
to it. Thus;</p>
            <p>What is the meaning of this ordinary question, <hi>[an aliquod
peccatum sit suâ naturâ veniale?]</hi> will appeare by the answer that
must bee given (if it bee satisfactory) to this argument, which
I shall imagine produced against it; [No sinne is in its owne
nature mortall;] for that sinne should bee the cause of damning
any, or that punishement eternall should bee due to sinne, is
but an accident that the Law or Covenant of God brought in,
either to <hi>Adam, Quo die comeder is morte morieris,</hi> or after, <hi>Behold I
set before you life and death, &amp;c.</hi> for sure had it not beene for that
Law of prohibition (that Covenant with that penalty, on breach
of conditions) sinne had never damned any one; and therefore
those irrationall creatures to whom no such Law is made, and
Covenant given, though they should be supposed to sinne against
the Law of their creation, they shall not be punished eternally for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96915:49"/>
that. Now it is an old rule in Logick, that <hi>Accident advenit
enti in actu existenti,</hi> and is not <hi>de naturâ subjecti,</hi> though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so ingraffed into it, that it becomes inseparable from it,
therefore this <hi>[being mortall or damning]</hi> being an accident that
came in by Gods Covenant or Law, cannot bee of the nature
of sinne, what ever that sinne bee: For if it were so, then God
who cannot make contradictions true, nor consequently take
away the nature of the thing and preserve the thing, could not
take away the damningnesse of sinne from sinne (any more then
quantity from a body) <hi>manente peccato realiter,</hi> which yet wee
know God can doe, and ordinarily doth, by pardoning of sinne:
for however it may be said by way of answer to that part of
the Argument, that Christ suffered and satisfied for sinne, or else
God could not pardon any, (not to dispute the truth of that,
whether hee could or no) it still remaines that the damning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sin is then taken from sin, by what meanes it now mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not.</p>
            <p>This is the Argument I meant to suppose made against that
plaine granted truth; and to this argument, hee that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the maine question, and held it negative, if hee will ever
answer, must say that the Law and Covenant of God (whether that
signifie the eternall Law, or even the eternall will of God, who
wills holinesse as hee is God, or in any other motion of Law)
is a maine ingredient in the constituting of sin, the very <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
ratio,</hi> that makes that which is of its selfe materially an act,
to become <hi>formaliter</hi> a sinfull act; that makes the killing of a man,
which is materially murder, to be also formally the sin of murther;
and therefore if by the Law or Covenant of God all sinne bee
made mortall, then may it truly bee said in this other notion
or respect, or for this reason, that all sinne is so of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>This answer must bee acknowledged to bee pertinent and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
and so any Protestant will receive it: and in stead
of excepting against it, I desire to strike in and close with both
Disputer and Answerer, and inferre that then it seemes this
is resolved on by that party that holds all sinnes in their owne
nature mortall, that that is all one with this other proposition
<hi>[All sinnes which are by the Law prohibited under paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
are by that Law damning sinnes, and noneveniall;]</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96915:50"/>
so, I aske the opposite party, that disputed even now, what he
thinks of this proposition <hi>[All sinnes which by the Law, or first
Covenant were prohibited under paine of damnation, are by the tenure
of that Law all damning sinnes, none veniall]</hi> I am verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
hee will consent to it too. And having done so, what
hinders now but that this controversie may bee accommodated
between disputers, being once rightly explained and understood?
For that under the Law, or first Covenant every the least sinne
was sufficient to forbid a mans justification, and consequently
to damne, is apparently the words of Scripture, <hi>Gal. 3. 9. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is every one that continues not in all.</hi> As for the Gospel, or
state of Christianity, or second Covenant, stricken with us in
Christ, wee know there is pardon for sinne by the very tenure
of the Covenant, and every sin is not now such, as that it shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
damne hereafter, or exclude every one that commits it from
the present favour of God, but may bee competible with a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
estate, and a hope of heaven. Gospel-obedience is not
perfect, exact, without sinning at all, but onely faithfull, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
impartiall, without hypocrisie, or indulgence in any known
sin; not the righteousnesse of him that never sinned, but of him
that beleeveth on Christ, that repenteth and amendeth his life,
that of the new creature, <hi>[Hee that confesseth and forsaketh shall
have mercy]</hi> and the like. This was so farre seene and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by some Papists of the Learneder sort,<note n="a" place="margin">Tertia parte de vit. spirit. Sect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Gerson,</hi>

               <hi>Io. Ep. Roffensis,</hi> that they have left their opinion in those
words to which no moderate Protestant will refuse to subscribe.
The two former thus, <hi>Peccatum mortale &amp; veniale in esse tali
non distinguuntur intrinsece, &amp; essentialiter, sed solum per respectum
ad divinam gratiam que peccatum istud imputat &amp;c.</hi> The third, <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum

need to adde no more but this, that if this do not prove accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to you, I have lost my labour, especially if it should be matter
of any new contention, thus to have been willing to pacifie conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>As for your sixth of the <hi>[glimmerings]</hi> and the <hi>[perhaps]</hi> it
was a little unlucky, not onely because 'tis said of Christ in
Scripture, <hi>in terminis,</hi> that hee was <hi>the day-spring</hi> to give light
to them which sit in darknesse, which is certainly as much as
the <hi>[glimmerings]</hi> or the <hi>[perhaps]</hi> can be imagined to import,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96915:50"/>
but also, because those glimmerings are mentioned by that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
clearely in order to the commands in that place (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the question that induced that answer) and you talke
of the discovering of Christ to all the elect for their everlasting
salvation, which seemes to mee still to respect the promises; or
if it doe also referre to the commands sufficiently discovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, &amp;c. yet that is nothing against our doctrine, which
supposes the former light (for precepts) sufficient <hi>pro statu,</hi> and
that men were then saved <hi>non obstante</hi> this want of greater light;
and onely require higher obediences now from those that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
higher light.</p>
            <p>To your seventh, which againe breakes asunder into three
under-charges or examinations, there will bee little scruple to
tell you, that though the things you mention were required of
the Jewes <hi>sub periculo animae, Viz.</hi> beleefe, mortifying lusts, &amp;c.)
yet some other things, <hi>viz.</hi> some of the things proposed by
<hi>Iob</hi> in his speeches to his friends, by <hi>David</hi> in his Psalmes,
especially by the Wiseman in his Proverbs, &amp;c. might bee but
glimmerings of the Gospel-precepts, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and being 1 Not so strictly and manifestly required of all as
the commands of the Decalogue, &amp;c. 2 Not delivered by these
as Law-givers, but as wise men. And 3 being not by way of
particular precept proposed to all, they might then not oblige
them (to whom they were not manifest, or not delivered <hi>sub
praecepto)</hi> under those hazards under which now the knowledge
of our Fathers will by Christ involves us. Besides, I suppose
'tis no newes to you, that there were voluntary oblations among
the Jewes in <hi>Moses</hi> his time, and many acts of strictnesse after,
wherein they that obliged all men to performe them, were said
to dogmatize: and though for so doing the Pharisees (that did
impose them as necessary) were condemned, yet the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <hi>Asidaei,</hi> that practised them, and yet not conceived them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and so never so imposed them on others, were never
condemned, but thought fit to be commended and rewarded:
and though the Jews were encouraged to the performance of these
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet is nothing of the doctrine of super-erogation
inferr'd by this neither. But 'tis now impertinent to
enlarge on this subject; when all other difficulties that now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
are satisfied. I may chance bee able to give you a justifiable
account of that also.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96915:51"/>
And so how farre soever the Author of the <hi>Cat.</hi> contended
for new precepts, yet having exprest what he would bee content
with in that matter by way of composition, rather then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
and saying the very words that I have in that matter tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
thence, I must bee no more said to recant this second
time then that Author did even at the first edition. Who by
that one willingnesse to live peaceably with you and all men, must
it seems, be condemned to that reproach of having recanted; and be
triumpht over, onely because he would not quarrell with every
man that is contentious.</p>
            <p>And to goe on with you, what if counsells give new light?
may not commands doe so too? or must I bee reprehended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am no Papist? I meane, because I conceive these in St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> to bee no counsells, but precepts? I hope, that which
I have said will sufficiently rescue mee from any more of your
jealousies concerning my weighty superstructures. I have told
you my whole heart; you need not use any optick glasse of your
own providing to see that which is so naked, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
before you.</p>
            <p>For the second page of your sixth leafe, where you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to mention the <hi>[All that you desire]</hi> it is too wanton for mee
to returne any thing to it; I have no leisure to bee playsome,
or to consider how <hi>poore</hi> you are, or how the Critiques have
offended you, or what lower heaven they converse in. Onely
I hope, I shall not now at last bee condemned for an Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,
(because I onely think the whole Law of the Jewes doth
not now oblige us) much lesse to goe beyond them, to bee a
hyper-Antinomian, for no more then these two plaine asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that Christ hath rid us from the sad yoke of ceremonies
Judaicall, and will now accept of sincere, though it bee not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinning
obedience. If this Divinity will not please you in any
measure, I shall never approve my selfe to you; but yet hope
that you doe not thinke in earnest that the Antinomians errour
is that Christ added higher precepts, or by more light encreased
the obligation to obedience above that which the Law required. I
suppose you meant that name onely as a <hi>mormo</hi> to fright mee; not
that now, because I am no Socinian, I must bee an Antinomian
presently.</p>
            <p>After the setting downe the <hi>[All that you desire]</hi> and that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96915:51"/>
closed as I conceived with a <hi>[finally]</hi> it seemes you have two
desires more (and one of them hath many more in it also:)
and when your desires doe so increase upon you, I can scarce
hope to give you satisfaction; and therefore shall desire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
if I proceed not to them, because some parts of those desires
I cannot imagine how I am obliged to answer at all, (as to tell you
what grace was brought into the world by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> when
I make no doubt to acknowledge that grace came by Christ, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as I remember 'twas you (not I) that seem'd to say the contrary, in
the top of the second page of your fifth leafe of this last returne,
<hi>[The Spirit was administred, &amp;c. during the time of legall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations]</hi>
which yet I would not there quarrell with neither, but
think them reconcilable by a commodious interpretation) and
other parts are utterly impertinent to any part of our point in
hand; as that, Of all mankind's being under the second Covenant,
Of Christs satisfying for all, and so of pardon and revelation of
the Law of faith to all, (which if it were the thing which brought
in all the former, will be easily satisfied, by saying, that what
was before so revealed sufficiently <hi>pro statu,</hi> was not yet so fully
and clearly as now by the comming of Christ) and so that also of
the Aaronicall Priesthood, wherein yet I perceive you conclude
strangely against that Author. For sure hee can very well think
(what he doth) that Christ can satisfie for sinnes, notwithstanding
that the exercise of his Aaronicall Priesthood consists in his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
For though that sacrifice bee a ceremony of his consecration
to his Melchisedechian Priesthood in one respect, yet as a sacrifice
(not in the shadow, but) of the substance, as a sacrifice not of the
bullock or goat, which indeed can make but a typicall satisfaction,
but of the Lambe and eternall Sonne of God, this sacrifice may
well expiate and satisfie, and so did indeed. And if you can get
the <hi>Socinians</hi> to affirme this also, I shall never quarrell with you,
I should bee glad you could thus make them your converts. But
sure <hi>Smalciu</hi>'s <hi>[Non est dissimulandum nos non negare Christi mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
ad ejus sacrificium pertinere]</hi> will not come home to it: For
they can say this frequently, and yet not think that any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for sinne was made by any sacrifice of Christ; not that that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
consisted in Christs death, or was offered by his dying; but
expresse the meaning of those words sufficiently, that the death
of Christ did onely <hi>pertinere</hi> to that sacrifice which was not offered
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96915:52"/>
up in his death. Which you see is not my sense but that the death
it selfe was a sacrifice, and in it satisfaction made for sinne by
the sacrificer. I was afraid a word would not bee enough to
every wise man, and therefore I have beene forced to adde this
also.</p>
            <p>As for your <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of your conquests, you have liberty
to use it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and triumph as much as you please.
For though the <hi>[perhaps foolish wanton using of Gods name]</hi> (which
is not alwaies in oaths) <hi>would not restraine from foolish wanton
swearing,</hi> (and yet me thinks <hi>à majori</hi> it might) yet sure the <hi>[sure
all prophane, &amp;c.]</hi> and the exposition of Christs <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
may bee allowed to doe it; and so all had beene safe, and to
that matter altogether as cleare, if the <hi>[perhaps]</hi> had never been
blotted out. 2 Christs new precepts will do it, (whether they
signifie superaddition of more precept, or more light, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
encrease of obligation) and if they would not, I should
not by that bee obliged to rest satisfied without them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
you see I doe not rest so satisfied, but onely tell you what
you are to understand by them, and that just agreeably (or
<hi>in terminis</hi> the same) to what had beene said before in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme.
3 For <hi>[Christs not forbidding swearing it selfe]</hi> you
will give me leave to have been long since of that opinion with
you, meaning by it, that swearing for Gods glory or the publique
good is not forbidden by Christ: and therefore sure the meaning
of the answer [A <hi>totall universall prohibition of swearing it selfe]</hi>
was something else, <hi>viz.</hi> of swearing at all by the name of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beside God, which formerly you might have beleeved, if you
had pleased, But I am afraid Sir, you are fallen upon some new
notion of <hi>[the sinne of dogmatizing.]</hi> For to the notion that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
have had of it <hi>(viz.</hi> teaching for doctrines or necessary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the Traditions of men, or imposing things as doctrines of
God, which are not such) 'tis impossible your words can belong.
Doe not you meane by the sinne of dogmatizing <hi>[transire in dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata
vel sententias aliorum?]</hi> I suppose you do, by what follows,
of <hi>my condescending too passively to take up both opinions.</hi> This may
possibly bee a slip in you; I shall not upbraid you with it. By
what hath now twice or thrice been said, your new argument is
superseded; and I am for all my assent to the answer in the
Catechisme, verily perswaded that forswearing my selfe for the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96915:52"/>
publque good were a farre greater sinne then swearing truly in
order to that end. But that that Author must still bee forced
to have contradicted himselfe, is very hard, when the cleare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his not having done so hath so oft been given, and
cannot yet get a little audience from you. I would, you would
bee but so well natured as to tell mee the meaning of your <hi>sic
notus Vlysses?</hi> and what the designe is that you could so easily
guesse at; This plaine dealing would deserve farre more thankes
(but indeed not set mee out for so dangerous an undermining de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signer)
then your suspitious speakings, and then affected reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Speake out the deepest of your heart; 'twill bee as seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and as just, I suppose, and in all reason as well taken as your
question about the weighty superstructure, or your collections in
either Sermon.</p>
            <p>For your stumbling at my 12 page about <hi>reduction,</hi> I am sorry,
and shall labour to keepe you from falling downe right. By tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
you, 1 That sinnes forbidden by the same authority, may
yet more or lesse clearely bee forbidden by that authority, and
under the second of those <hi>(viz.</hi> those that are lesse clearely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden)
that of reduction may come. 2 That the lesse the cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of forbidding is, the lesse deepe is the obligation to them to
whom they are (and 'tis not their fault that they are) lesse cleare:
yet of things forbidden by reduction, some are much more clearely
forbidden then others; and so fornication, then some other sinnes
forbidden by that Commandement: and I suppose you, to whom
it is as cleare that fornication is there forbidden as adultery, are as
deeply obliged to abstaine from one as other; But then still in
other particulars, which are not by the light of the words, nor by
any other meanes made thus equally cleare to some men, to them
they are not equally or so deeply obliging.</p>
            <p>Then for your <hi>[moreover]</hi> about Christs forbidding swearing
by any creature, (which if you had vouchsafed to have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, you might have left out much that went before) you will
sufficiently bee answered: 1 That swearing by any creature will
hardly be thought to be forbidden by the Command against ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the name of the Lord in vaine, (because he that sweares by the
creature doth not directly any such thing) but might perhaps bee
better reduced to the former Commandements of not worshipping
the creature. 2 I do not beleeve that any command under the Law
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96915:53"/>
of nature, or of the Jewes, will be produced so cleare, or bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
so convincing to those that lived before the Law, or
to the Jews, against swearing by some creature, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> which
is brought in frequently in the story swearing by the life of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
without any marke of sin on that forme of speech, shall bee
resolved to have sinned against conscience in it. And therefore it
may at least be granted, that this was of that nature that it might
be matter of Christs [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] and of the Fathers
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore, 4 I
must willingly acknowledge, what the Author doth, that a
Christian may in no case sweare by the creature, and have told
you that that was the meaning of that Authors phrase of totall
universall prohibition, answerable <hi>verbatim</hi> to Christ <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>You are next pleased to proceed to the strife about the word

that he will assure mee that <gap reason="foreign">

hee so saith, you tell mee not, nor will I deny it, because I know
not what in that place hee may meane by <hi>proprie:</hi> but yet I must
tell you, that it was a litle unlucky, that I should examine but
one Author of your citing; and that should prove so contrary. For
I have lookt on that Commandement in <hi>Grotius</hi> his Notes on <hi>Ex.
20.</hi> 7. and there thus you may read, <hi>In vanum] i. e. falso. Non
peierabis. Idem</hi> n. e. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</hi> This is as plain a testimony as you could have
suggested for my turne; and I hope you will now pardon mee, if
I abstaine from examining the rest of your citations, being so sure
that the granting them all will not prove that Christ said any thing
which I may bee ashamed to say after him, when hee rendred the
third Commandement <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and when I acknowledge
vaine swearing by Gods name forbidden by that Commandement,
and that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as 'tis sometimes rendred <hi>falsum</hi> (as by the <hi>Targum,

also; which is the utmost can bee proved by them. Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the word, even when it signifies vaine, hath a peculiar notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of vanity proper to this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> of a faire empty shew,
when in words I seeme to oblige my selfe, but really doe not;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96915:53"/>
which fault is observable in some kinds of swearing, which are
therfore clearely forbidden in that Commandement.</p>
            <p>As for any <hi>scorne</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> exprest by me about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in my last, though I wondred to see it objected, yet because
my memory was fraile, I lookt over those papers (which truly I
keep for the like purposes, to decide such differences, that may be
incident) and there can I not find one word that looks that way,
or that I can imagine could bear that accusation.</p>
            <p>For the sense of <hi>[did in effect meane it]</hi> I shall satisfie you; it
was that I did meane that which is in effect all one with that
other phrase <hi>[were forbidden.]</hi> This you are so kinde to let passe,
and with it some few sides more, which I may therefore suppose
had no greater difficulties in them, but am farre from taking it
ill that you let them passe, but shall assure you that you might
as well have past by that also of: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
by saying you understand, and by forgiving mee, I suppose you
thinke meant by mee against your selfe, to fasten some strange
ill character upon you. This I suppose you did by occasion
of the meaning of those two words, which are not onely titles
of the Devill, but have a significancy proper to them; the one to
expresse a calumniator, the other a plaintiffe or adversary <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
The former (I confesse) of these, you might with some reason
thinke I might apply to you, and perswade your selfe that I can
not but beleeve you to have been guilty of calumniating mee, <hi>i. e.</hi>
accusing mee falsely. But truly Sir, whatsoever I might thinke in
that matter, I never meant to say any such thing to you, nor to
manage a discourse (designed to a better end) with any passion or
asperity, though it were in saying of truth onely. And therefore
let mee assure you, I was farre from meaning or saying any such
thing of you; and was so little guilty in my owne conscience, that
when I found it in your paper, I was a little troubled, till I had
somewhat satisfied my selfe with confidering that you might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be mistaken, and then by looking on the place in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
where I finde the passage most cleare from looking towards
you. The truth is, I was a speaking of the hurt that might come
by teaching that Christ improv'd not the Law, and told you
that I could give you an experimentall account of it (Truly that
referr'd to a particular person that was then in my minde, and is
now in my memory, ready to bee named to you, if you please) in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96915:54"/>
one that by urging that doctrine, and so bringing downe Christ
to the perfect law of <hi>Moses,</hi> became an advocate for a vile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
sinne. This I made no question was a stratagem of the
Devils, accusing to him that Doctrine of Christs superadditions
for a false and dangerous Doctrine, and to that end calumniating
all Authors for <hi>Socinians, &amp;c.</hi> that were for that Doctrine, and by
that meanes fitting him to the jnstifying of that his vile sinne,
which otherwise hee had not probably beene guilty of. This is
in more words the plaine of what I then said in those few
words, not of Rhetorique, but of plaine sense, and might (if you
would) have been excused from the addition and length of this
paraphrase.</p>
            <p>You lead mee on now to the reviewing of what was said on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the third report.</p>
            <p>In that, I see, I have not yet the luck to please you neither, but
have offended you more by my excuse then I had done by the
first crime; thus unskilfull am I in conversation with men of
your temper. This is, it seemes, an errour in mee; I am sure, an
infelicity. Well, I shall againe endeavour to satisfie you in the
reasonablenesse of what I designed, in not disputing with them
that thought not all inclinations to evill unconsented to, to bee
sinnes; but onely affirming that they were, and rather bringing
them to godly sorrow upon their owne principles, then falling to
disputation about it. The reason was, and still is, because I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
every godly man (I meane, those of whose piety I have
no reason to doubt, and that in other things are very orthodox,
I am confident, truly humbled for their evill inclinations consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to) was not of your opinion in this matter. 2 Because it
is a very nice point, which perhaps for wanting of cleare stating
may bee misapprehended between men of distant perswasions. I
will set you a briefe state of it, and leave it to your judgement,
whether I speake reason or no. There is in a man a double facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to which this inclination may possibly bee applyed, either
the sensitive appetite common to men with beasts, or the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
will. The sensitive faculty naturally inclines to the pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
object. <hi>viz.</hi> to that which is agreeable to the flesh; that this
inclination unconsented to by the man, uncherished, unliked,
should bee a sinne, would bee hard to affirme, though you mean
by it but originall sinne; because originall sinne is a consequent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96915:54"/>
of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and this was certainly in our first Parents in the
time and state of innocence before the fall: as when the apple
was so faire to the eye, sweet to the taste, &amp;c. 'tis cleare, the
eye and taste were then inclined to it; and nothing but the
command of God to the contrary could quell that inclination.
Suppose then, they had not eaten after this inclination of the
carnall appetite to that forbidden fruit, had that inclination in
that appetite onely been a sinne in them? 'Tis very probable it had
not; the consent, or somewhat else, of the will being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
required to make them thus guilty, and I now speake ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
from any thing of that. Besides this, there is another
inclination, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>will,</hi> (not a full consent of the will (or
a mixt) to the carnall proposall, but) a bending of the will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that way then the other; not a weighing downe of the
ballance to that side, but an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as that word is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) a pendulousnesse
betwixt the good and the evill, but rather bending toward the
evill. This is it that I conceived to bee an aversion from God;
not fully, but so farre as that it did rather bend to the carnall
object; and this was it that I called a sinne: though being but
the inclination of our corrupt nature, and not confented to, I
could not call it an actuall sinne. Now the word <hi>pronenesse,</hi> or
inclination to evill, being thus an equivocall phrase, I thought
not fit to bee severe or importunate upon them who perhaps did
not know how to distinguish it, nor againe to trouble a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme
with too much nice discourse; but more grossely to bind
the Scholar to humble himselfe for all sinnes, distinctly for his evil
inclinations, (to that purpose affirming plainely that they were
sinnes) or if hee would bee apt to dispute, which might hinder
his being humbled,) I meane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dispute upon such a nicety as was
mentioned) yet still to call for the conclusion, humiliation, upon
his owne principles, if hee would not allow it upon mine. This
I conceive, will cleare that Author from any crime in his doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expressions, or connivence. For 1 the words are cleare,
that inclinations to evill are sinnes; and (if hee will bee taught)
that will instruct him in true principles; if he will not, yet will
not the <hi>[if]</hi> following bee a meanes to harden him in impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
Nor indeed can I consent to you, that no man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
true godly sorrow for his actuall sinnes, who doth deny the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96915:55"/>
fountain of all his sins to bee a sin, if you meane by that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the naturall inclination: For I make no question but hee
that sees, and fully discernes all his actuall sins, and looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them all as progenies of his will, and so his [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>]
that sees nothing of nature,
or necessity, or fault of others in it, but all his owne villany,
may have as true godly sorrow for his actuall sinnes, as he would
have if hee were sensible of that other also. I say not, that hee
would have as much true godly sorrow absolutely, or for all
sins; (for supposing, as now I doe, that hee hath not sorrow
for those inclinations as for sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you must not conceive that I
say hee hath it save onely as for infelicities) but I or hee may
have as true godly sorrow for actuall sinnes, as the other would
bee likely to have for actuall sinnes. To which purpose I shall
farther venture this one example and proofe to you; Our first
parents certainly might conceive true godly sorrow for their first
sinne, which was in them actuall, yet must needs deny the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of that, and (consequent to that) of all their sinnes (their
owne free-will) to have been a sinne or sinfull, unlesse they will
accuse their creator, which will bee no proper companion or
effect of godly sorrow, and I suppose will not by you bee expected
from them. And so I had more reason for my expressions then
perhaps you thought of. And so much for your two first objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in that point.</p>
            <p>3 For your <hi>[idem per idem]</hi> which you impute to mee, you
are much mistaken. For, supposing some inclinations to evill to
bee not cherished, the thing that I concluded is, 1 That in that
case 'tis victory, not sinne; And 2 that in that case, I hope you
will not say, it is a sinne cherisht or consented to: which, if you
marke, was passing an opinion how you must be faine to conclude
(and that, a thing quite contrary to your former concluding) and
not making any such conclusion for my selfe. You were at great
leasure when you observed that illogicall probation.</p>
            <p>4 For that <hi>[which it seemes, I supposed and proved not]</hi> I must now
give you an account. And it was, that <hi>I seemed to imply that there
must needs be some consent given to actuall sinne,</hi> I confesse I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it not, but promised to give you an account of it when I had
your grounds of scruples, you have now mentioned them to me,
1 <hi>That Originall sinne is truely and properly a sinne in them that are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96915:55"/>
not of age to consent to it. 2 That corruption is so strong in us that
it doth many times breake forth without our consent.</hi> To the first I
shall but need remember you, that 'twas every <hi>actuall</hi> sin to which
I implyed that consent necessary, and I hope you are not ready
to prove that <hi>originall</hi> sinne in children (as you call it) is truly
and properly <hi>actuall</hi> sinne; and for the second <hi>[the breaking forth
of corruption in adultis]</hi> that doth (if againe it be an actuall sinne)
certainly suppose some kinde of consent obtained, whether by
sodaine surreption, passion, &amp;c. or by something sometimes that
is worse then one act of consent, <hi>viz.</hi> by the custome of sinne, and
glibnesse toward it, contracted by many precedaneous acts of
consent to it, or the like. Besides, there are two kinds of sinne,
<hi>omissions</hi> as well as <hi>commissions,</hi> and there is a criminous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
required to either of them; and hee that is bound to use
all diligence to subdue his corruptions, at least to represse them,
if hee doe not so, this indiligence of his hath some of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
and that is a prime ingredient in the breaking forth of
corruptions; which consequently doe not breake forth without
all consent. And for mee now to undertake the proofe of that,
that the Schoolmen upon <hi>Thomas</hi> have so fully proved, that every
thing is so farre sinfull or criminous (meaning still actuall sinne)
as it is voluntary, the yeelding of the will to the sensitive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
being necessary to the conception of lust, and that againe
to the bringing forth sinne, I shall venture the worst of your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that I doe not now proceed to demonstrate more largely.
For indeed actuall sinne being a transgression of the Law, will
hardly belong to that faculty, or appetite, which is not capable of
receiving the Law: and such is that appetite that hath nothing of
the consent of the will in it.</p>
            <p>For the complement you charge mee with in the fifth, you
had answer in mine to your first and second of this subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[For my mentioning of Socinians]</hi> I confesse I have been guilty
of it in these Papers, and I think you know who was the cause of
it; and therefore what want of wisdome, or degree of folly soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that is, you should not bee the Author of it in mee, and the
punisher also. As for any parallel Doctrines you can finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
mee and them, any farther then is agreeable to sound
doctrine, and analogy of Faith, I am not so humble, or so guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to deprecate your threats. As for parallels betweene our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96915:56"/>
expression, 'tis possible you may doe somewhat; and so perhaps
with some study I could doe the like between the Scripture and
the Talmud: and to this I would not provoke you (though, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
I know not yet of any one such) because it seemes in your
opinion <hi>[calling the Trinity a speculative mystery]</hi> was one of that
kinde, (and I doubt not but at the same rate there are many more
to bee met with) and then the provoking you, might let open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sluce or treasure of your Animadversions, wherein the sins
of your brethren are laid up, and among them one bundle of these
parallels; and I tell you truly, I shall take little joy in spending so
many sheets more in proving those (whatsoever you shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
under that title) to bee unfit parallels. Yet by the law
it is not so well, that you will doe any thing upon a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which you would not doe otherwise: but I confesse this
sets no such character upon you, that I should bee willing to
provoke you.</p>
            <p>In your seventh I confesse to beleeve, that you meant not the
Common-prayer-booke by the designed Liturgy, (and cannot
imagine why you should thinke I did beleeve you meant it.) And
therefore I conceive I inferr'd regularly, that I had nothing to do
with that designe, because I desired the continuing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-booke,
and particularly those parts of it which were
most incompatible with that designe; such were the Doxologies,
Creeds, Letany, &amp;c. which no <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> would joyne
in. And I wonder you should thus mistake so plaine an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In the eight, where you take care <hi>that I magnifie not the View
of the Directory;</hi> you might have spared your paines, for I can
cite a Booke for a matter of fact (and that is all that I doe in that
place, <hi>by referring you to those places in it, my consent to which</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
my dislike of the designe you speake of) without any kinde
of magnifying it. But for the matter so fit for my humiliation,
which you observe in that Author, <hi>[The using the suffrage of the
Iewes, Heathens, and Mahometans]</hi> that sure will not much tend
to your purpose, not onely because those very particulars you pitch
on are transcribed (and so profest to bee) out of a Booke of a
<hi>Learned member of the House of Commons and your Assembly,</hi> viz.
<hi>Mr. Io. Selden,</hi> but also for these two considerable reasons more;
First, because the suffrage of the Jewes (from whence the other
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96915:56"/>
two are affirmed to have proceeded) doth carry some divine
characters upon it, that whole Church and State having peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
relation to the Theocraty, and so Gods judgement of the
lawfulnesse implyed in their practice. And secondly, because
the Liturgy of the Jewes was by the Apostles and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
made use of, and out of it with some increases and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
the Christian Liturgies fram'd in the first age of the
Church. If I thought it might bee acceptable to you, I would
serve you here also, and give you some observations to this
purpose (very perfectly and easily reconcileable with what
hath been formerly said, but yet) which are not in the View
of the Directory, nor yet mentioned in the haste of my former
Papers.</p>
            <p>'Tis the observation of a noble and a learned French Protestant,<note place="margin">Du Pless. de Miss. l. 1. c. 3.</note>
that the Apostles were sent, not to destroy but establish that
pure worship or service of God which was in the synagogues
of the Jewes, which they therefore retained (after Christs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
as farre as did not contradict the oeconomy or dispensation
of things under Christ: and therefore though they changed the
sacrifices, and the Sabbath, (Christ being the substance adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by one, and the Lords day being appointed to take the
place of the other) yet the service it selfe in other particulars
they did continue. The grounds of this observation you have
in the Scripture: Christ himselfe goes into their synagogues, and
the Apostles ordinarily at the houres of Prayers, and certainely
joyned with them in their service, as farre as agreed with their
present state. And by this meanes some sympathy hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
between the Jewish and Christian services. This is cleare
by the Jewish formes; for some of which, and for the rites of
using them, wee are beholding to a most excellent man (a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
also) <hi>P. Fagius,</hi> and to some others since, who have made
use of his collections. The first part of their service was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the sinnes of their people, (which was alwayes solemnly
used in their sacrifices) a rule for which wee have in the sacred
Writers, and in the Jewish Bookes the very <hi>verba concepta,</hi> the
set constant formes mentioned by that Worthy on the Targum,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 16. This they called <hi>confessio</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>verbalis;</hi> After
that followed some Psalmes of <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> which were sung
the whole Psalmes together, as also some <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hymnes or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96915:57"/>
of thankes, which, say the Jewes, were instituted by <hi>Esdras,</hi>
who after the Babylonish captivity restored the service of God.
After that they had their lessons out of the Law, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into 54 <hi>Sedarim,</hi> or <hi>Parascoth, i.e.</hi> Sections, as also the
lessons of the Prophets distributed into as many <hi>haphtaroth,</hi> or
<hi>Aperturae,</hi> or, as some render it, <hi>Dimissions,</hi> so divided that there
may be one for every Sabbath in an intercalary yeare. Then again
was the whole action concluded with prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> a generall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for the necessities of the Church and State, publike and private,
and in that many particulars. After these prayers the <hi>Archisyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogus</hi>
blessed the people, and dismiss'd them. Save onely that on
any great festivall solemnity, the Passeover, &amp;c. there followed
Benedictions particular to the occasion, which on the Passeover
were pronounced by the mouth of the master of the family; a
forme of which, <hi>Miserere Domine, &amp;c.</hi> we have in <hi>P. Fagius</hi> on
the Targ. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>vestigia</hi> of this practise of theirs, in each part, wee have

was taken up in imitation of Christ, who after Supper sung an hymn
with his Disciples, not disdaining to make use of the ancient Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish

(as among the Jewes for all Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; we for the whole Church,
especially for Kings.) And that men may minde nothing but that
their present imployment, <hi>Ideo sacerdos praefatione parat fratrum
mentes, dicendo, Sursum corda, ut dum respondet plebs, Habemus ad
Dominum, moneatur nil se nisi Dominum cogitare debere.</hi> I shall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you no longer then to desire that the Liturgy lately used in
this Church may be compared with the severalls here mentioned,
from the Jewes first; and after, the Apostolicall Christians: and
as you will finde the generall forme exactly continued in Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Psalmes, Lessons, Hymnes, Prayers for all the Church, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for Kings, &amp;c. (and no reason to doubt but that sometimes the
very words were continued also; assuredly set Forms then, as now,
as appeares by the <hi>Sursum corda,</hi> and <hi>Habemus ad Dominum; Lift
up your hearts, Wee lift them up unto the Lord)</hi> So it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reason that the Author of the <hi>View</hi> thought fit to draw one
argument of many from the practice of the Iewes; to which the
other two of the Mahometans and Heathens come in <hi>ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96915:58"/>
sequelâ,</hi> but as rivulets and derivations from that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>But then besides these suffrages, you know there are in that <hi>View</hi>
many other arguments produced which may chance to bee more
concluding to you. And though a mans arguments (as our own
prayers) may serve the turne, yet the suffrages of others will
do no hurt also. If the point in question, which you say you have
shewed mee, be that which in this Paper you formerly mentioned,
you may in my answer to that satisfie your selfe that you were not
very lucky in shewing. Before I part with this section, let mee
beseech you to tell me, whether 'twere onely a fault in your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
that when you were pleased to tell me what you said at <hi>Carfax</hi>
against the Author of the Catechisme, you did not please to name
this particular of the Mahometans, &amp;c. especially when I am told
that you cited it as a worke of that Authors who made the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,
and spake pretty tragically about that subject.</p>
            <p>9 For your contempt of my mention of Doxologies and Creeds,
it is not so very seasonable, because being mentioned onely in
order to prove that I was none of the designers of the new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
Liturgy, you cannot but say that they were pertinent to
that purpose. And for your proofe, <hi>That Doxologies and Creeds
may be left out, because the Directory takes in the whole Scripture for
a Liturgy, and there are Doxologies and Creeds enough in the holy
Scripture]</hi> it is a kind of arguing that I confesse I understand not;
for sure for all that, <hi>(or granting the Scripture to containe, as you say
truly, all necessaries to salvation)</hi> it will still remain true, that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of God and worshipping him by praises, confessions, and
professions of our Faith, may bee allowed to bee duties of such
a value, that if they doe not deserve to bee brought in, yet
'tis not necessary they should utterly bee cast out from the service
of God. For your Confession of Faith which you say shall be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by your Assemblers, if that bee to bee used in the service of
God, then must there bee some new direction for it put into the
Directory, and then perhaps the Creeds of the Ancient Church
might have continued there as well. If it bee only for other uses,
you know it belongs not to the point in hand. And which way
soever, you know it concludes not against any thing that I was
about to inferre from Creeds, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:96915:58"/>
10 For the question you there put, you do it I suppose but
sportingly. For if you will needs have a question the only one that
can be pertinent to the matter there in hand (or which will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
things of any like nature) is that which is there set, betwixt
the using the Common-prayer-book in each part of it and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it wholly (or in those so many mentioned parts of it) out
of the Church: and then sure the so many obstacles to <hi>Socinian</hi>
errours being retained in one, and turn'd out in the other, the vote
will be quickly resolved on. As for your desired parallel, the Cat.
or the Directory, I suppose you doe not expect I should speake
to that, yet that which countenances no one <hi>Socinian</hi> errour, and
I thinke either profestly, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> discountenances every <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>
errour, will be able to compare (in that matter of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
them) with any other Wirter in the world. For though
it were granted, that it doth not so much discountenance them as
other Books that are written particularly against them, yet not
countenancing them at all, it doth as much not countenance them,
as any other thing can bee imagined to doe. But</p>
            <p>Now 'tis a little wearisome to mee to see this 10 Sect. againe
breaking asunder into questions, which you might so very well
have spared. For sure Sir, 1 I no where had said in these Papers,
<hi>That the Direct. had commanded all to sit at the Sacrament;</hi> I had
onely spoken of the <hi>Protestants in Poland forbidding sitting, because
it complyed with the Arians.</hi> 2 I had also no need to say, That <hi>all
familiarity inferr'd an equality;</hi> 'tis enough to me, that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and distance, kneeling, &amp;c. is more like to bee an argument of
inequality, and an expression of it. 3 <hi>[That Socinians thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
equall with Christ, &amp;c.]</hi> I have no need to affirm, having
onely urged a matter of fact, which stands good without it, because
that familiarity in sitting at the Sacrament will bee more agreeable
to their notion of Christ as a meere creature, then kneeling will
be; and that is all was to be proved from it, and not that the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
equall themselves with Christ. As for my saying, That <hi>Christ
did not blesse us till after his resurrection,</hi> (which perhaps you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
out of the way, to set some ill marke upon it) 1 I pray remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that they are the plain words of Scripture, <hi>having raised his Son
Iesus, he sent him to blesse us, &amp;c.</hi> and I hope 'twill bee no huge
fault to say what <hi>Socinus</hi> doth, when if hee doe say it, hee saith
the same with Scripture. 2 That you may mistake the meaning
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96915:59"/>
of that phrase; and thinke, as some doe, that for Christ then to
begin to blesse, is for him then to begin to have divine power: but
sure you know that is not my meaning; but that Christ may bee
considered in respect of his natures, or of his offices, <hi>i.e.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Fathers use it; and that 'tis
onely in that latter respect that all power is then said to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto him, and so this of <hi>blessing,</hi> and at last to bee resigned
up to the Father: which will not at all hinder the renouncing of
all <hi>Socinian</hi> or <hi>Arian</hi> heresies in the businesse of Christs eternall
Divinity, or of the Trinity. By this you see what an ill parallel you
had fetcht out of <hi>Smalcius,</hi> and I must supppose most of your
others are such.</p>
            <p>For your argument offered me for the Liturgy, I am not merry
enough to receive, or reward you for it, (and you know, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
in hand is not to assert the Liturgy; that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but
the demonstrating that I was none of the men for the new design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Liturgy) onely let mee tell you, that the easinesse and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Liturgy was not thought to consist in the easinesse of
the task for the Minister, (for I do not perceive that the Directory-way,
as 'tis exercised, hath any whit lesse of that ease in it)
but in respect of the Auditors, who can goe on in their duty
with more ease and pleasure: and sure duty is not naturally so
acceptable to all men that there is any necessity of making it more
tedious, toylsome, (especially if it bee added, as you say it
is) and lesse profitable, then was necessary. And therefore you
may perceive for all your scoffes, that Orators arguments (if the
author of that <hi>View</hi> were guilty of that faculty) even those that
you pick out for the very worst, may have somewhat beside Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique
in them. I am sure this which you mention, is more
proper and effectuall to inferre the conclusion, then the fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that argument out of that Book, to expose and shew it openly,
was to the question in hand, whether I was in the designe for the
new complying Liturgy. But I have learnt to passe by all such
Sacrasmes and impertinences, I hope, with some tolerable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>Now then you say you hasten to my discourse of <hi>Godly sorrow,</hi> I
beseech God to give each of us our part of it.</p>
            <p>In that, you begin with a challenge to mee, to prove that
which you know was proved already, if explaining a thing,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96915:59"/>
and laying it before you in such a manner that you doe not
(I conceive, cannot) deny any part of it, may bee called the
proving of it. Your second is but a repetition of what was said
by mee; yet hath some art in it, depriving it of the proofe that
was brought for it, that it might looke the more naked, and
despicable. Your third was discreetly order'd to scoffe at what
was said, for a <hi>dictate</hi> and <hi>admirable,</hi> (which was neither,
but a plaine evident truth, that the impurity of our humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
may bee matter of godly sorrow to any, though not
meerely <hi>quà</hi> an infelicity) and you aske againe whether it bee
godly sorrow to grieve for an infelicity? I say againe, such the
infelicity may bee (particularly that now spoken of) that it may
bee matter of Godly sorrow, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (and be otherwise
described in a gracious stile of loving the appearance of Christ,
which may rid us of our impurities) and yet not bee this <hi>quà sic,</hi>
meerely as an infelicity; which was all that was needfull there to
bee inferr'd.</p>
            <p>In your fourth you mention your opinion, that all pollution
of the soule of man hath been by sinne onely. But sure Sir, this
doth not prove every pollution to bee a sinne; but, as your words
import, an effect or consequent of sin.</p>
            <p>Next, you pronounce that I am much mistaken: and your proof
of it is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> a begging, <hi>i.e.</hi> not proving, yet assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the thing before in question (and prov'd on the other side
by mee, both before and now in the last Sect.) <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>no
man grieves for a sinne after a godly manner, but hee that grieves for
it as a sinne against God.</hi> When you know, that by that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the impurity of our nature mourned for by him that
tooke it not for a sinne, but onely a thing that rendred him
1 imperfect; then 2 prone to sinne; and 3 lesse amiable in Gods
sight, &amp;c. (with an addition of wishing and praying <hi>to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and bee with Christ as farre better)</hi> the contrary was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
inferr'd; and no answer offered by you to these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses.
For the undeniable grounds of repentance, I suppose
they are laid in that Cat. both by requiring it for all sinne, and
by naming inclinations to evill in the front of sinnes, without <hi>[ifs</hi>
or <hi>[ands]</hi> or any dubious expressions. But yet after all your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
in giving your advice for the designing of a Catechisme,
I conceive your inference, in the name of the <hi>Acute wretch,</hi> was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96915:60"/>
farre from any acutenesse: for sure whatever were resolved about
inclinations being no sinnes when unconsented to, 'twould never
follow for your Client, <hi>Ergo, the like acts, to which he is naturally
inclined, are not evill.</hi> For sure Sir, the acts may bee allow'd sinnes
(and not bee excused by our being naturally inclined to them)
whatever were conceived of the inclinations. The conclusion
from your premisses could onely bee this, <hi>Ergo</hi> this and that act,
being naturall also, are not evill. And if you wretch should
conclude so, you would soone bee able to inform him that his acts
are not naturall, and therefore may be allow'd to be evil though
he be naturally inclined to them, because it is very evil not to resist
and deny those inclinations.</p>
            <p>You then goe off in triumph with a <hi>[You know what I could
adde.]</hi> Truly Sir, I professe I doe not: and yet whatever 'tis,
if it bee like this you have allow'd mee, I should <hi>consider</hi> it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in obedience to you, but never be much wrought on by it.
Yet shall I excuse this for the good news it brings with it, being a
transition to the fourth report, another stage toward the end of my
very wearisome journey.</p>
            <p>In that, you have begun with many little particulars which
want of truth; particularly, that I make a second acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I was mis-informed, when I onely professe that by your
discourse I cannot discerne whether I was in this mis-informed
or no. It seemes you are willing to receive acknowledgements
of mistakes: you would otherwise thinke it more pertinent to
tell mee whether in either Assembly you insisted on that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or no. For an answer to your <hi>quaere's,</hi> you sure perceive
(though you complaine for want of it) that I gave you that
whole sense of my soul in that point, not onely by that meanes
to bee sure to tell you my opinion of your then present <hi>quaere's,</hi>
but also of all others of that subject that 'twere possible for you to
ask. And by this time I conceive you do discern that I am neither
very forward to make <hi>quaere's</hi> to divert, &amp;c. nor to deny answer to
them, when they are made.</p>
            <p>About the first proposition you mention, though you stand not
to ask <hi>[why acceptation is put for pardon?]</hi> 'Twere no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if I said 'twere <hi>de industriâ,</hi> on this head, because God first
<hi>accepts</hi> the penitent <hi>person</hi> in Christ, and then after (in order of
nature, though not of time) hee pardons his sinnes: though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96915:60"/>
'tis true againe, that the sinnes are pardoned in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before the acceptation of the <hi>actions;</hi> I meane, of all the
actions of the subsequent life. But then there is a double acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
of the person first, and then of the actions; of <hi>Abel</hi>
first (as the Fathers observe) and then of his offerings. Which yet
I hope, will not passe with you for the double justification; but this
<hi>ex abundanti</hi> also.</p>
            <p>But to your maine question (for I must now wholly deale in the
old trade of answering questions: which I have been told is the
farre easiest way for him that wants other provision, and yet would
faine not make an end of disputing) <hi>Why I speake of remission and
acceptation, and leave out imputation?</hi> Sure 'tis, partly because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of the person, and so pardon also, includes <hi>imputation</hi>
of Christs righteousnesse, as the formall cause of our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
God accepting of Christs <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or payment (which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of his sufferings by way of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for us) and then
accepting our persons, and pardoning our sinnes; partly, because
one kinde of imputation is after our pardon of sinne in order of
nature, a distinct thing from it, and so needed not to bee there
spoken of, as belonging rather to our sanctification, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting
or filling up the imperfections of that; I meane now
the imputation of Christs perfect obedience to that penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
whose sinnes are pardoned by the sufferings of Christ: for
to such a one Christs perfect obeying the Law may so farre bee
imputed as to give a glosse or tincture to his still imperfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences,
so farre as that they shall bee accepted by God; Which
imputation therefore may bee antecedent to, and have to doe
with that acceptation of actions, but yet in order of nature bee
after the acceptation of persons, and forgivenesse of sinnes. But the
truth is, I then meant to give you plaine grosser propositions to
prevent mistakes and disputes, and not to descend to such nicer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
as these.</p>
            <p>But truly you were very wary, when you laid such an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
on the <hi>[This]</hi> in the second proposition, which sure was
an innocent particle of reference looking back to the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>[justification]</hi> in the former proposition, and meaning it in
the very same latitude that thereit had been used, for the entire,
not partiall (or first, or one part of) justification. To
let this passe, when you had taken notice of it, was not an act
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96915:61"/>
of charity, but justice in you, yet that whirh would have beene
very welcome to mee many times. For just from as true or
solid ground as this, have many of your other exceptions
sprang up, and have not so candidly beene laid downe by
you.</p>
            <p>To your next questions, which you professe to aske, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
may bee prevented, upon that account, I professe to answer
most cheerefully; for I see how wearisome a thing it is to have
been mistaken.</p>
            <p>To your first <hi>quaere [Why the grace of God in justifying, &amp;c. doth
not extend to every man for whom Christ hath satisfied?]</hi> I answer
clearely, because Christs satisfaction is not <hi>absolutely</hi> for all, or
that they may bee pardoned whatever they doe, how infidell or
impenitent soever they continue; but <hi>conditionally</hi> for all, and
thereupon that grace of justification extends to none but those
who performe the <hi>Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For your second 'tis very nice (and might sure have beene
spared in this businesse) That <hi>because God hath been affirmed by me
to require regeneration as a condition to justification, therefore I must
tell you what condition God requires unregenerate persons to performe,
that they may attaine unto regeneration.</hi> To question thus were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and to this matter of justification utterly unnecessary. But
yet I shall not faile you in any thing; Ile satisfie you in that
also. God requires in the unregenerate man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as the Ancients expresse it, <hi>a readinesse to obey his call;</hi> not
to resist, but receive his grace, when hee bestows it on him;
and having received it, what degree soever it bee, to cherish, and
make use of it; and this by his grace, God enables him to
doe.</p>
            <p>As for your demand of mee, by way of retribution, that I
must grant that God doth justifie the ungodly, <hi>i. e.</hi> the man
that is guilty of many sinnes, I make no question of that, if
hee bee a penitent, and so may hee bee, and yet bee called
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> still, in the sense that I conceive belongs to that word,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; not one that continues impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in sinne, but one that neither hath nor doth performe exact,
perfect, legall obedience: which is very reconcileable, if not the
same, with what you confesse, <hi>[That God never justifies an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
infidell in sensu composito,</hi> i. e. never any that is then infidell
or remains impenitent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:96915:61"/>
To your third I answer, that there is such a condition, which
doth so qualifie the subject, that I can say, by it, and onely by
it I am justified, <hi>i. e.</hi> by it onely as a <hi>condition,</hi> not including any
<hi>causality</hi> in it. And if you will know, what that condition is, you
have been oft told already, and I now tell you, <hi>Faith in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherein it signifies a receiving the whole Christ, and containes in
it a resolution of obeying Christs Commands, as well as of depending
on him for mercy.</hi> And on supposition, or condition that you grant
that, and so speake of faith as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
I will speake with you in the dialect of the first
sort of the men you mention, and say that faith is required to
receive the object of justification, Christ, &amp;c. but withall adde,
that it is required as a condition too, to dispose or qualifie the
subject, and that without this condition, no man living shall bee
justified. Which being premised, it shall not yet follow from
thence that by this he shall bee, sa you say, constituted righteous,
if by <hi>[constituted by]</hi> you attribute any causality to this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or any thing but that of being a condition by which hee
is justified, <hi>i. e.</hi> is not jnstified without it. And so this is as <hi>plain</hi>
as I can <hi>devise</hi> too; and mee thinkes there should bee no <hi>mistake.</hi>
For in the sense wherein I have now exprest my selfe, I doe again
consent to your conclusion, <hi>that God doth by his free and effectual
grace worke in the hearts of his elect to receive Christ, (that is, the Whole
Christ) that they may be justified, not by their owne obedience, or vow of
obedience (as by a cause) but by obedience of Christ alone freely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God, and rested on by faith onely:</hi> It being one act of that
faith by which the just doe live, to have affiance, or rest on
Christ.</p>
            <p>In your <hi>[moreover]</hi> it may also bee true, that there may be some
difference between <hi>disposing the subject to salvation and to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
as the cordiall habit of faith, aud sincere vow, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to justification; and, in case of living to occasions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
<hi>the acts of faith and actuall performances</hi> will bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
yet so that he that is disposed for justification, if he should
then presently dye, were disposed to salvation also. Which
notwithstanding I shall also add with you, 1 That there <hi>is faith
required, to receive the object, Christ, Iehova our righteousnesse; and
grace prerequired, to enable thus to beleeve;</hi> and obedience to, or
making use of that grace (the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Heb. 12. 28.)</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96915:62"/>
required in us, to that end that grace may have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
worke on us, And 2 that <hi>all the acts and habits of grace,
which are in the best men concurring together, are not sufficient to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
a man before God.</hi> And therefore faith concurring so, with
such a vow, or with faithfull actions, cannot justifie us. This
I write out of your Paper, as fast as I can drive, (and, by the
way, you see some difference betweene our tempers; I consent to
as much of yours as possibly I can, and labour to take as few exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions;
you on the contrary have another method in reading
them that you are not kinde to) and consent to it most fully
at first sight, and never remember to have doubted of it, since
I considered Divinity. But for your addition, <hi>[Of faiths justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relatively]</hi> you must give mee leave not to take that into my
forme of Doctrine (being not very intelligible) but to use my
owne expressions, as conceiving them more perspicuous, and
commodious to the notions I have of this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Thus,
that <hi>Christ onely justifies, Faith receives Christ, but yet still by no
way of causality justifies;</hi> is <hi>causall</hi> indeed in <hi>receiving</hi> Christ, but
onely the <hi>condition</hi> in justifying; because, though receiving is an
act of ours, and in us, yet justification is an act onely of Gods
upon us, and concerning us. Which in effect you yeeld also,
when you say, that <hi>[Faith cannot pardon sinnes or accept.]</hi> For then
it cannot justifie. At this time me thinks we are excellently well
agreed, I wish it may long continue.</p>
            <p>But then in the next words, wee are out againe; I am now
lookt on as one that <hi>abuses Scripture for the maintenance of errors,</hi>
whereas God knows 'twas no more but citing the words in St.
<hi>Iames, faith consummate by works,</hi> as a parallel place to faith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and let the Papists say what they wil, (and
abuse that or any other place) sure this is no <hi>abusing Scripture
for maintenance of errors.</hi> But then what you meane by your not
<hi>dreaming, that I thought Abraham was justified by the actuall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
of his Sonne,</hi> I cannot dreame or imagine; certainly I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
said any such thing; or if you thought I meant that by works,
you are much mistaken: but onely I conceived the resolution of
sacrificing to have been accepted by God, to his justification, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
actuall sacrificing him.</p>
            <p>But then Sir, in that which follows, when 'tis resolved that
wee are agreed in the conclusion, 'tis very strange that that will
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96915:62"/>
not satisfie you without some retraction. O how much a more
pleasant thing is victory then peace! Sir, I must tell you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
all that that Author ever hath said in the <hi>Catechisme</hi>
is perfectly reconcileable with this conclusion; (and hee may
chance to bee as fit to judge of the importance of his owne words,
as any man else) and therefore still <hi>retraction</hi> must be spared,
unlesse you please to <hi>retract</hi> causelesse displeasures. But that it
seemes you will not suddainely doe: for againe you are deepe in
a questioning over againe, what hath beene so often answered,
and profestly acknowledged. I shall proceed to doe it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
once more. 1 I say, that wee are not jnstified by any
thing in us, <hi>i. e.</hi> either by vow of obedience, or faith, save onely
as by a condition, or <hi>causâ sine quâ non;</hi> and in that sense, by both
of them together wee are justified. But then you have an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to those words of mine <hi>[The condition must bee undertaken
before the the Covenant belongs to mee]</hi> and say in your third,
That <hi>if by Covenant I meane the whole Covenant of grace, I must
make some condition goe before our regeneration also.</hi> I answer, that
the word <hi>Covenant</hi> there in that place, signifies any one part of
the whole <hi>Covenant,</hi> which depends on the performance of any
proportionable part of the condition, and so needs not belong in
that place to <hi>regeneration</hi> also, but may bee restrained onely to
that of justification. Yet for the condition praerequired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
also, I have given you my sense formerly, and need
not so soone repeat it to you.</p>
            <p>4 For the third <hi>[you know]</hi> I professe not to know how they
belong to me, or any interests of mine.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>That to receive forgivenesse is an act of faith,</hi> I shall againe
acknowledge, so you conclude not from thence that it <hi>justifies</hi>
by so doing. But that I ever said, <hi>That wee receive a pardon by an
act of charity, &amp;c.</hi> I shall not yet be perswaded, nor can that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
have any truth, any otherwise then that charity is part of
the condition, without which that Pardon shall not belong to me,
(which were a very ridiculous ground of saying, that <hi>wee receive
our pardon by that act;</hi> because <hi>[receiving by]</hi> notes an efficiency,
and of that there is none in a meere condition.) Sir, I am confident
I never said these words, and therefore I cannot well forget
them.</p>
            <p>As for your citation out of the <hi>page</hi> 28. of the Cat. <hi>That
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96915:63"/>
a man is justified by faithfull actions, and by them onely.</hi> That you
must understand (as 'tis there clearely set in the case of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi>
in case there be a present opportunity to exercise the faith.
For though when such occasions are not present, the faith which
consists <hi>in voto,</hi> the full resolution, the cordiall receiving the
whole Christ, will serve the turne, without any actions; yet when
the occasion is present, the action must bee ready, or else the
faith will not justifie. And therfore though in this case of such
opportunities, I plead for more then the bare vow, as necessary to
justification, yet still 'tis true that I plead for no more in any
other case; and even in this I can content my selfe with this vow,
if it bee sincere; nor will God acknowledge it so, if it act not in
time of tryall; when the opportunity is offered. And so, <hi>sure I am
well enough off from a first and second justification.</hi> For all, that I
require by way of condition, is the sincere receiving of Christ in
heart and resolution; which if it bee sincere, will fructifie in its
due season; and if it be not such as will doe <hi>so,</hi> 'tis not fit to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by God to our justification.</p>
            <p>But for your arguing on the other side, That <hi>if wee are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by a vow of personall obedience,</hi> then wee are not <hi>justified by
Christ alone, or by faith onely;</hi> that is but the old Sophisme, so oft
laid open, by our confessing nothing to have to doe with our
justification but Christ, as the <hi>cause</hi> of our justification, or that
which constitutes us righteous; and for our vow of obedience and
faith, that is onely as the <hi>condition:</hi> granting still faith to receive the
pardon, but not thereby to justifie.</p>
            <p>And so once more I will agree with you, that is, with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
proposition of yours, whether you will permit mee, or no;
and doe it now againe without any need of the least syllable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
            <p>Thus have I attended you a most wearisome journy, being
scarce permitted to passe over any line in your Papers without
answering some either mistake, or question of yours. And truly
I have served you freely and faithfully, and that hath swell'd it
to a bulke beyond what in any reason I was bound to pay you.
And if you doe not please that there shall arise to mee some fruit
by all this by your discerning and acknowledging the causles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your exceptions, yet if you please, let us put it to others to
judge between us; for 'tis possible wee may judge amisse of our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96915:63"/>
owne performances. And therefore by your good leave (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I told you) I shall bee willing the world shal judge between
us, or as many of them as shall bee fitted with great patience to
sit out the hearing of so meane an Act. If this course will not
please you, but you thinke good to write back againe. I shall take
confidence to expect (what is most just) that you return <hi>ad
punctum,</hi> or <hi>ad carceres</hi> from whence we set out: and which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of your publique charges upon that Author seemes to you to
remaine unsatisfied by my returnes, let it bee specified, and your
reasons joyned with your expressions of dislike, such as you thinke
will destroy the grounds and bee directly and clearely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the state of the question on which I build. And having
now twice submitted to such punctuall answering of so long a
catalogue of questions, let mee, I pray, bee freed from any more
of that taske. For I know when all other things are at an end,
there will never bee any end of them. There is a very unhandsome
English proverbe to that purpose; Let mee beseech you, not to
fall under any suspition of being guilty of it: and as you might
justly accuse mee, if I applyed it to you, so I beseech you to see that
it bee not applyable. Yet let mee tell you, <hi>When these controversies
now depending are at an end, there is no one question concerning any
line in those Bookes so paradigmatized by you, or in any piece of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
wherein I understand ought, but you or any man shall for the

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur Letter of return to my last I received not till this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(though it were dated on the Lords day was seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night:)
and with it an advertisement that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> whom you
appointed to convey my former to you, was gone to <hi>London</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to mee. So that, although I know not how this
paper will make shift to finde out the way, yet can I not but
addresse it toward you, if it be but to take the leave of you a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
solemnly, and to professe that I designe not any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trouble to you on this matter, having beene assured by
you of the unprofitablenesse of my former paines; and having
little hopes, that any more will prove more fortunate then those
eight or nine sheets, <hi>out of which you tell mee you can pick but
one conclusion,</hi> viz. <hi>an English proverb,</hi> and <hi>that but intimated.</hi> Sir,
I am very unhappy if I have written so much so unconcluding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but cannot bee so severe to my selfe, and those papers, as
to imagine that it was not in your power to have <hi>pickt</hi> out
some others, (had they beene for your turne to take notice of
them) as easily as that one which you acknowledge was <hi>but
intimated.</hi> It seemes, your notes tend all to finding of faults;
and so this came into your observation. I shall not from
hence conclude that this was the onely thing you had reason
to dislike in those papers; Onely I must say that your reasons
of disliking this particular of the <hi>English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proverbe,</hi> as farre as
it was mentioned by mee, are by no meanes concluding; and
to make them appeare such, you are faine to affix a sense on
my words very distant from that which the contexture of them
is capable of. For Sir, that you have yet appeared to bee a
<hi>foole,</hi> or that I undertake to have any <hi>wisdome,</hi> or have any
need to doe so (the innocence of the cause which I have in
hand being sufficient to supply that place) or that you have
asked mee <hi>more questions then I am able to answer,</hi> I had no
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96915:65"/>
way so much as <hi>intimated;</hi> but on the contrary, had for the
time past <hi>answered</hi> all your very many <hi>questions,</hi> or shewed you
(as in some few) how unnecessary it was to the matter in hand,
to answer them; and yet promised you farther, That <hi>when the
controversies now depending betwixt us were at an end, there should
bee no question concerning any line in those bookes, or any piece of
Divinity wherein I understood ought, but you should for the least as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
have my full sense or answer.</hi> All that that mention of the
proverbe could signifie, was this, that I desired you would take
care hereafter not to fall under any suspition of being guilty
of it; which was but a circumlocution of this plaine sense, that
if you returned any thing to those sheets, I desired it might
bee <hi>ad punctum,</hi> without asking any unnecessary questions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that would bee a way unworthy of any Scholar, and
would bee infinite. And if I should have told you plainely, that
if you should doe this, you would, by the force of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe,
bee found guilty of <hi>folly,</hi> and possibly pose a man <hi>wiser</hi>
much then my selfe, this would not have amounted to any
of the three things by you concluded from my Letter. Yet is
all this as truly said by you as what you next adde, That <hi>I passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
long to publish my wisdome to the world in print.</hi> The rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this scoffe shall be pardoned by mee. I shall onely
speake to the truth of it. I had no such opinion of the worth
of any thing, that would bee pertinent answer to your exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
as to have any <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>longing</hi> to have it printed; I
onely told you, <hi>That if you could not yet acknowledge the causles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your exceptions, by your leave I should bee willing the world
should judge betwixt us:</hi> and in one other place, <hi>When you had
bid mee venture your arguments to any reader,</hi> affirming that <hi>you
feared none,</hi> I thought it seasonable to tell you that I expected
according to the purport of your speech, that you would give
your <hi>consent that this whole matter should bee referred to others judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to that end Printed.</hi> I suppose, neither of these spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
imply either <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>longing</hi> after the presse; And truly
Sir, as long as there are such Readers abroad as you, I thinke
a man in prudence ought before-hand to bee assured of their
kindnesse, ere hee have much appetite to bee in print. The

short is, I was and am most willing to submit the dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and mee, and the truth of this question <hi>[Whether
you have wronged mee or no,]</hi> to any or all reasonable men:
and having offered it successelesly to you, I am still ready,
if you consent, to make it more publique; and shall not
consider any interests of my owne so much, as to retract
my offer. You say, <hi>You shall not license any papers of mine
which you have yet received:</hi> and then, I suppose, you are
confident they will not now bee <hi>licensed</hi> in this place;
and it will onely bee in my power to take care that this
bee the last you shall <hi>receive.</hi> Onely I shall adde (without
expressing any longing) that if you will <hi>license</hi> your <hi>owne,</hi>
you shall not need to trouble your selfe in <hi>desiring mee
to license mine,</hi> or to give my consent that they bee <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed.</hi>
As for your advice to the contrary, I know not
from what degree of kindnesse it proceeds: and having
some reason to beleeve that there is nothing in them against
piety, or charity, perhaps you may bee mistaken, if you
thinke <hi>your not licensing</hi> them will ever deserve <hi>thanks</hi> from
mee; any more then that which you call an act of friendship,
doth, <hi>viz. your having dealt plainely with mee.</hi> To which give
mee leave to answer, that friendship is a strange thing, and
very distant from <hi>Christian charity,</hi> if it bee any thing like those
publike reproaches which you laid most causlesly upon the Author
of the Catechisme in your Sermons. Assure your selfe, if I were
now in the temper of minde, in which you were when you did
that, (and it seemes, now continue to bee) I would presently send
all your papers to the Presse with my answer to them; and tell
you, I was in this your <hi>friend.</hi> But I have other imployments for
my thoughts, and other motives and principles of not reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
injuries, then those which you offer mee by way of
<hi>friendly advice to beware, &amp;c.</hi> Which perhaps may intimate
something of terror. I shall for the present sit downe with
full patience and satisfaction of minde, that I have driven
this businesse thus farre: and till your more weighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
permit you to consider mee, as my paines to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96915:66"/>
serve and satisfie you deserve from you, I take my leave of you,
and rest</p>

I would you had signified your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
positively, that I should not permit
to any mans eyes, what you onely say,
<hi>you doe not desire mee, &amp;c.</hi> I should
then think my selfe obliged to burn that

wanting your directions, I have not
done it.</closer>
