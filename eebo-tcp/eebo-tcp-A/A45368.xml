            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chapters; (For the 6th. and 7th. come in by way of Digreſſion, to anſwer the Objections againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification, for the further clearing of it,) That <hi>there is no Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> And becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may pretend to be unite to Chriſt, that are not really ſo, therefore ſuch as are unite to him, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by their Walk, which is <hi>not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being a comfortable Concluſion from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, in the preceeding part of this Epiſtle, <hi>Viz.</hi>

'That there is no condemnation to the Believer that 'is in Chriſt; We ſhall clear Firſt what the Words import. And 2ly. Hold out ſome Scriptural Grounds that may and will clear the certainty of this Truth</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt, When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>there is no Condemnation,</hi> his meaning is, 1ſt, That the Law does not condemn the Believer. 2ly. That the Believers Conſcience cannot warrantably condemn him. And 3ly. By theſe Words, he aſſures us, that the Judge will never condemn Believers in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For the 2d. Thing, The certain Grounds of the Believers Freedom from condemnation are theſe. 1ſt Ground, is the Covenant of God, made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his Spiritual Seed, to which God interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Oath, to be their God. Now theſe to whom he is a God, he muſt prepare for them an Heavenly City; now Believers in Chriſt are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed, with whom that Covenant was made; and therefore they muſt go to Heaven, and cannot be condemned to go to Hell. 2d. Ground of their freedom from Condemnation, is their freedom from the Law; Believers are not under the Law, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 They are married to Chriſt and ſo are not under the Dominion of their old Husband the Law, They are not under the Law as an Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, tho they be under it as an Rule of Life, and ſo they cannot be under the commination of that Covenant, becauſe of the Tranſgreſſions of it; now where the Law does not condemn, the Judge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemn 3d. Ground of Certainty, is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers intereſt in Chriſt's Sacrifice. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. It is ſaid, <hi>we are come to the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> we have a real Intereſt in his Sacrifice, becauſe he is One that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103949:5"/>
had our nature. 2ly. That Sacrifice, by God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and his own Conſent, was offered up for Believers; and he had a Spiritual S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bneſs to them: Now ſince Believers have an intereſt in this Sacrifice, this cannot but ſecure them from Condemnation, if you conſider the expiatory Vertue thereof: which expiatory Vertue, is evinced from theſe few Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, 1ſt. Conſider the infinitely wiſe God choſe this Sacrifice, to expiate the Sins of Believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. 2ly. He accepted of this Sacrifice, as a proper and effectual Mean to produce this end, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. 3ly. This Sacrifice had an Intrinſick Worth in it, and was ſpotleſs. 4ly. It was offered up by the Heavenly-Fire of the Eternal Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 5ly. The Offerer was the High-Prieſt of the New Teſtament himſelf, inaugurate in his Office by God himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21. 6ly. The Sufferings he was put to, by being thus a Sacrifice, were the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of the Commination of the Law. An Fourth Ground of Certainty, is the abſolution of Chriſt, the Believers ſoverty in his Reſurrection, and this abſolution more fully cleared, by his Seſſion at God's Right Hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 and laſt. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. and 3. A 5th. Ground of Certainty of the Believers free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is, the promulgate Goſpel, which plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that the Believer is not condemned, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. and 5.24. And this Truth of the Goſpel is confirmed by external Miracles, and by the Internal Operations of the Spirit of God. A 6th. Ground is, the Priviledges that this Goſpel declares, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on Believers, as 1ſt. The Priviledge of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and that ſecures the Believer from Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; 1ſt. Becauſe it is God's Deed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 33.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103949:6"/>
and 34. 2ly. It is an Act of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24 We are juſtified freely by his Grace, now Grace muſt reign over Sin and Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and laſt. 3ly. It is an Act founded on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which is called the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>viz.</hi> of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and Approbation 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and laſt; And therefore this Priviledge of Juſtification cannot but ſecure the Believer from Condemnation. 4ly. This Act of Juſtification draws with it the total and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alable Pardon of all Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2· For the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 clears from that Pſalm, that the Goſpel-Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not a Righteouſneſs of Works, for it draws with it as its attendant, the Remiſſion of Sins. A 2d. Priviledge that the Goſpel ſecures to a Believer, is Adoption, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. and this cannot but ſecure the Believer from Condemnation, becauſe a ſure Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to eternal Life depends on it, and follows the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, 2. A Third Priviledge that the Goſpel aſſures us Believers have, Is that they are ſanctified by the Spirit of God, which is their being made meet for Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. It is the Earneſt of it, <hi>Eph</hi> 1 14. Now this cannot but ſecure them from Condemnation, becauſe God cannot ſeparate a man that hath his Image from himſelf, ſeing the Image of God is given by him to prepare a man for Communion with himſelf. A 7th. Ground is, the Believer is unite to Chriſt not only becauſe Chriſt hath the ſame Humane Nature with him, but becauſe he is myſtically and ſpiritually one with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. The Believer is a piece of Chriſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, therefore the Church of Believers is called his fullneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. &amp; laſt. Now this Union with Chriſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103949:6"/>
ſecures from Condemnation, becauſe the Love of the Father that is terminate on Chriſt primarly and principally, muſt alſo neceſſarly terminate on them, ſee <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. laſt, An 8to Ground of certainty is, That Chriſt is Judge; and the Rule whereby he proceeds, is not the Law but the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 12.48, 49, and 50.</p>
               <p>Uſe of Conſolation from this Doctrine is. 1st. To theſe who are under the conviction of Sin, Guilt, and Death, and who have fled for Refuge to Chriſt, ſuch are not allowed to have the Spirit of Bondage again to fear Condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. 2ly. To ſuch who are under paternal Chaſtiſements for Sin; becauſe theſe are our evidences of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Condemnation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould not be looked on as Prooffs of our lyableneſs to Condemnation. 3ly. It is comfortable to thoſe that are Aſſaulted with <hi>Satan's</hi> Fiery Darts, ſuggeſting to them that they will be condemned, and yet giving them no ſufficient ground to found that Aſſertion on: If a mans Conſcience tell him that he believes on Chriſt, from this Text he may eaſily repell all theſe horrid Temptations. 4ly. It is very comfortable at the hour of Death, for Death wants its Sting to an Believer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. Death is but a ſleep to a Believer, Death doth not ſeperate a Believer from the Love of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. laſt. But it is the Believers paſſage to immediate Communion with God, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. Deſires <hi>to be abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former Scriptural-Grounds, aſſuring the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that he is free from Condemnation, they are fit to be applyed by theſe Believers that know they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103949:7"/>
have Faith and whoſe fears of Condemnation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe more from their reflection on their Guilt, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Miſery, then from any Jealouſie that they want Faith: But for ſuch whoſe fears of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation ariſe from the weakneſs of their Faith, I would have them conſider many Scripture In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which clear that a weak Faith maybe very profitable, if it be true: As the Faith of the Leper, who believed Chriſt's Power but queſtioned his Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th.</hi> 8, and as the Faith of the Prodigal, who believed his Father might put him amongſt the Servants, but could not make him a Son: ſee what Opinion <hi>Paul</hi> hath of the Faith of the <hi>Hebrews, Heb.</hi> 6.9. compared with the 12. and 13. and compared with the 5. and 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an uſe of Tryal, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have an Intereſt in this Priviledge or no. And 1st. Try it by your Faith whether ye believe the promiſes of God, whoſe performances are very improbable like, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, Then are we <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual Seed, and ſo have Intereſt in the Covenant made with him. 2ly. Try your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in this priviledge by your being Married to Chriſt, that is by forſaking your own perſonal Righteouſneſs, which is by the Law, and betaking your ſelves to Chriſt's. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4 3ly. Try your Intereſt by your Union with Chriſt; If you would know that Union with Chriſt, ye muſt try it by this whether ye be new Creatures or no, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. 4ly. ye muſt try it by the mark in the Text, which is, that ſuch as are in Chriſt, <hi>They walk not after the fleſh,</hi> that is they have not an walk that evidences the dominion of Luſt over them: Pride, Covetouſneſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103949:7"/>
Malice, and Self-love do not Influence their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. And 2ly. They do not regulate their Life by the Laws of Corruption, which are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Laws of God; whereof ſome of them may be repeated. As 1st. The Natural Man thinks it fit to depend upon himſelf, and not upon God, and to pleaſe himſelf and not God. 2ly. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man denys the Being of God and miſtakes the perfection of God, and his walk evidences his <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, Pſal.</hi> 14.1. and his denyal of God's perfection. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1. 3ly. It is a Principle of the Natural Man that he Exerciſeth himſelf in Superſtitious Worſhip. In being formal in appointed Worſhip as meritorious with God, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 18. about the <hi>Phariſee.</hi> 4ly. It is his principle that we may warrantably uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means to obtain our end; That falſe policy is better then tenderneſs of Conſcience. 5ly. It is a Principle of his, that Folk ſhould rather Sin then ſuffer Affliction. 6ly. It is a Principle of the Carnal Man, that we ſhould not love our Neighbour with a pure and ſingle Love, but with a Selfiſh Love, not deſigning ſingly his good, but aiming ſtill at our own Advantage in what kindneſs we do to him. 7ly. Its the walker after the fleſh his Principle, that we ſhould not live in Subjection to Superiours from Conſcience, but becauſe of fear of force, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Expectation of Advantage. 8ly. It's his Principle, that his Felicity ſtands in ſenſual good, 9ly. He is not content with what ſatisfies Nature, but with what ſatisfies Luſt, and Luſt being unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he cannot but always be diſcontented.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Walk after the Fleſh,</hi> does not only import a Walk that evidences reigning Luſts in the Heart, and a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103949:8"/>
Walk that is the practical improvement of thoſe pernicious Principles formerly mentioned and ſuch like; but it is a Walk tending to corrupt Ends, a Walk wherein a Mans Imaginations, Deſires and Purpoſes are all levelled at the gratifying of ſome one predominant Luſt or other. And 5ly. we would try our intereſt in this priviledge, by our <hi>walking after the Spirit:</hi> Which is a walk firſt, which ſtands in obedience to the motions of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. 2ly. It ſtands in giving God ſpiritual Worſhip, <hi>Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ip.</hi> 3.3. and <hi>Jo.</hi> 4 24. 3ly. It ſtands in having a Walk flowing from Spiritual Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. Love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. 4ly. It ſtands in eying an ſpiritual Rule in our Walk, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law in its ſpiritual meaning, in having a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame in conforming our ſelves to that Law, that we may do what we do in the ſtrength of Chriſt's Spirit. And 5ly. It ſtands in deſigning ſpiritual Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> The Glory of God, the Edification of our Neighbour and our own Salvation.</p>
               <p>From the Reſtriction of this priviledge to ſuch as <hi>Walk after the Spirit.</hi> We may infer an Uſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to many <hi>who walk after the fleſh,</hi> and yet will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this priviledge to themſelves; The cauſes of their ſecurity, may be 1st. They lean to their Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Services, <hi>Mica:</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1, 11. And to their External Acts of Worſhip. <hi>Iſai:</hi> 58, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7, 10. 2ly. They Lean to their preſent impunity <hi>Pſal:</hi> 50, 21. And 3ly. They lean to their own Gifts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that the Apoſtle divides all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Viſible Church, in theſe Two ſorts of Men, <hi>viz. Who walk after the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Who walk
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103949:8"/>
after the Spirit;</hi> Importing to us that all thoſe that Walk not after the Spirit, they certainly walk after the Fleſh. From this one may infer, That all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts and Civilians. Whatever pretences they have for Innocency, in Walking, ſince they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a walking after the Spirit, they are certainly to be reckoned as Walkers after the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Obſerve next, from the words, That when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would give a diſcovery to perſons of their ſpiritual ſtate, and of their Intereſt in the priviledge of Non-condemnation, he brings this Diſcovery not from a particular Act of their Walk, whether good or bad; but from the Tract of their Walk; for a Godly Man may be overcome with an Temptation at a time, and do an evil Act, which may be called <hi>an Act of the Fleſh;</hi> and an godleſs Man may do an Act materially good, but a Godly Man cannot Walk after the Fleſh, neither can a godleſs man walk after the Spirit.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>SOme take the meaning of thoſe words to be, That the Goſpel doth free the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> from the Law and Covenant of Works, and its Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: And therefore ſince the Goſpel frees him from the Laws Threatning, It cannnot but ſecure all that are in Chriſt from Condemnation; ſeing he has no priviledge by the Goſpel, but what all that are in Chriſt actually have; for the Goſpel confers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103949:9"/>
priviledges of this ſort and nature equally on all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; And if the words be taken in this ſenſe, they are a proof of the firſt part of the firſt verſe to this purpoſe, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid:
<q>Ye may be very ſure that there is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt: Becauſe I, who am a Believer by the promulgate Goſpel, am delivered from the Threatning of the Covenant of Works:</q>
And ſo theſe that aſcribe this ſenſe to the words, they ſay that by <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jeſus,</hi> is meaned the Goſpel, called the Law of Faith, 3d. <hi>Rom.</hi> And it gets that Name, becauſe as a Law hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it, to oblidge to Obedience, ſo the Goſpel has the ſtampt of Divine Authority on it, obliging to Obedience. Likeways, It is called a <hi>Law of the ſpirit of life,</hi> becauſe the Goſpel, and not the Law, (which is as to this a Dead Letter) is the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.5.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. and we are receivers of the ſpirit by the hearing of Faith, <hi>Gal:</hi> 3.2 and it is ſaid the Goſpel is the Law in Chriſt Jeſus, becauſe Chriſt Jeſus is the principal Subject about which it Treats. Or theſe words, <hi>in Christ Jeſus,</hi> may be added, not to denote that the principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Goſpel is Chriſt Jeſus, but to denote that the Spirit of Life, which is conveyed by the Goſpel is to be had from Chriſt Jeſus. 2ly. Thoſe that aſcribe this ſence to the words they ſay, that by the Law of ſin and death, is meant the Law of God with it's ſanction, and Threatning: For as it is a perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs, it diſcovers ſin: As the Apoſtle ſays, by the Law is the knowledge of ſin; and by reaſon of the Threatning ſubjoined to the Law it brings the ſinner under a lyableneſs to Death, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103949:9"/>
upon thir Accounts it is concluded by thir Divines who aſcribe this ſence to the Text, That the Law of God gets this Name of the Law of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in and Death.</p>
               <p>But yet when we conſider the Text more narrowly, we think it has an other meaning; For it is very clear from the preceeding Chapter. That by the Law of ſin the Apoſtle means, Corruption, and we do not find the Apoſtle in other places of Scripture giving that name of the Law of ſin and death to the Law of God. And therefore by the Law of the ſpirit of life, is meant the powerful influence of the ſpirit of life upon Believers, which frees <hi>Paul</hi> from Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe 3. ways. 1st. By dwelling in <hi>Pauls</hi> heart he makes up a ſpiritual Union betwixt Chriſt and him, and ſo frees him from the guilt of Corruption, becauſe by the ſpirit making up that Union he winns to a juſtified ſtate, 1 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The Coheſion of this <hi>Verſe</hi> with the former, ſeems to be the Apoſtles proving the latter part of the <hi>Verſe</hi> thus, That thoſe that are in Chriſt muſt walk after the Spirit, and not after the Fleſh, becauſe the Spirit of Life breaks the Dominion of Sin in them, as it did in <hi>Paul.</hi> Or 2ly. This Second <hi>Verſe</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to illuſtrate the firſt part of the firſt <hi>Verſe, viz.</hi> That there is no condemnation to the man who is in Chriſt, and it may be ſet down to prevent an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt that Truth, that the man that is in Chriſt is free of condemnation For it may be ſaid, that the man that is in Chriſt, hath the Law of Sin and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103949:10"/>
Death, and ſince he hath the remainders of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in him, how can he be free from Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It is Anſwered, That the Spirit of Life frees the Believer from the Law of Sin and Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by uniting a man to Chriſt, it frees him from the Guilt of Corruption, and by the Spirits preſence, as a Spirit of Life, in God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s own time, he will be freed from the remainders of Corruption.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, we may ſoon ſee. That our diſcerning of the remainders of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in us inevitably brings us under many fears of Condemnation: The fight of Indwelling Sin more forcibly puts us under a fear of Condemnation, than the feeling of all our numerous Miſeries can do, and therefore it were fit for a Believer to ſtrengthen his hope of the total abolition of Sin in him, and this may be done, 1st. By conſidering our Union with Chriſt, and Chriſt's Exaltation to Glory, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarly ſays, that all the Members muſt have a ſinleſs conformity with the Head. 2ly. This Hope may be ſtrengthned, by conſidering that the guilt of our Corruption is already pardoned in our Juſtification, for the 1ſt Verſe ſays, <hi>There is no condemnation to the man that is actually in Chriſt.</hi> And 3ly. This Hope may be ſtrengthned in this, that the breaking of the Dominion of Corruption in us by the Spirit of Life, is a Pledge given us of God, to aſſure us of its total abolition.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 2ly. That <hi>Paul</hi> was a man deeply exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with the ſenſe of remaining Corruption in him, as appears by the laſt part of the former Chapter, and now he wins to a great deal of freedom to apply Goſpel-Priviledges, and this tells you that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103949:10"/>
of the Actings of Faith is very conſiſtent with the ſenſe of Indwelling Sin.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 3ly. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed many Means for Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he watched, he prayed, he kept himſelf out of the way of Temptation, yet he aſcribed not his freedom from Corruption, to the uſe of theſe Means, but to the Principal Author of his freedom, <hi>viz.</hi> The Spirit of Life, who did bleſs theſe Means, for that end. Take notice of that Name that's given to the Influencing Spirit, that liberats <hi>Paul</hi> from the Law of Sin and Death, it is called <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life;</hi> Becauſe, that as a Law hath a Moral Efficacy, to draw thoſe that live under it into Obedience; So the gracious Spirit of God, where he has an indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hath an ſtrong Efficacy to bring the Perſon in whom he dwells, to follow his Conduct. And this leads us into an</p>

Obſervation, anent the mighty Working of the Spirit, and his Grace in the Hearts of Believers; and this mighty Power of the Spirit, and his Grace, evidences it ſelf in theſe few things following, amongſt many moe As 1ſt. In the actings of Faith under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tryals, which muſt argue a great Power that makes a man believe, notwithſtanding of great and manifold Guiltineſſes, and of long Continuance, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Corruptions, notwithſtanding of violent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults from Satan, yea notwithſtanding of Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Chaſtiſements and Death; And therefore, it is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19 That there is an exceeding greatneſs of Power, that works in Believers. 2ly.

made to it; yet there is an abundance of ſtrength in the Spirit of Life, that principally reſides in the Head, and is derived from him to all his Members, to manadge all the Chriſtians Work, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the oppoſition made to it.</p>
               <p>Take notice, 5ly. Of the name the Spirit gets here, he is called the Spirit of Life, or a quickning Spirit, and he is called ſo for Three Reaſons. 1ſt. Becauſe he raiſed Chriſt from the dead. 2ly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he raiſes us from the Death of Sin. And 3ly. Becauſe he is to raiſe the Chriſtian at the laſt day to immortal Glory. From this we infer, that thoſe in whom the Spirit dwells, muſt have Spiritual Life, that is, they muſt live ſo as to make his Will their Rule, and his Glory their End, and his Love their chiefeſt Comfort.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly. Take notice, That the Spirit of Life is ſaid to be in Jeſus Chriſt; and that 1ſt. Becauſe Chriſt did merite the Spirit of Life to his People. 2ly. Becauſe the Spirit of Life did evidence principally It's quickning vertue in his raiſing Chriſt from the dead; He did this, that believers might have a pledge by this deed that he could raiſe them from the death of ſin and of the grave. 3. He is ſaid to be in Chriſt Jeſus, becauſe, he is given to him principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and primarly, and in a greater meaſure then to Believers; the Father gave not the Spirit by meaſure to him <hi>John</hi> 3.34. And the Spirit is given to believers from Chriſt, and for his ſake: and this directs Believers how to ſtrengthen their Faith, as to the expectation of the Spirits grace and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Hearts. Unbelief will ſay in their Hearts, they ſhould not expect the Spirits preſence

ſeeing they cannot deſerve it. The Anſwers is, that Chriſt hath deſerved it from them, tho they have not deſerved it themſelves. 2ly. Unbelief will object the difficulty of the Spiritual and Corporal Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a work ſo difficult how can the accompliſhment thereof be expected? The anſwer is, That this Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Unbelief in Believers will object againſt their undertaking great Spiritual work for God, becauſe they do not find ſuch ſtrength of the Spirits grace in them, as many be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the greatneſs and Spirituality of that work. But the Anſwer is, They ſhould not take their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the work, from the greatneſs of the ſtrength of their preſent inherent grace but from the greatneſs of the ſtrength of that Spirit of life that primarly and principally reſides in Chriſt and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. He bids <hi>Timothy</hi> be ſtrong in the grace that is in Jeſus, and in the <hi>Philip:</hi> 4. He ſays he can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth him, and in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. He ſays, he rejoyces in his infirmity that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon him; And therefore an exerciſed Believer with indwelling ſin, if he would have the moſt comfortable look of Chriſt, let him look to him as having the fullneſs of the Spirit of life in him; for Chriſt is not only lovely to a Believer, as his Blood has an Expiatory vertue to cleanſe away our guilt, but as he has an fullneſs of the Spirit whereby he is able to quicken the Believer and raiſe him from the Death of ſin to a Spiritual life.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:103949:12"/>Obſerve the deſignation of Corruption, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Law of Sin to hold out its moral evil, 2ly. It is called the Law of Death, to hold out the prejudice it doeth to us. It gets the name of the Law of ſin, to hold out the impetuous activity of it, to make us commit Actual ſin, notwithſtanding all the reſtraints that God puts upon us, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, by his Threatenings, by his Judgements and Croſſes, by his Checking, and Reſtraining-providences, by his Allureing mercies, by his awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Smarting challenges of our conſcience. 2ly. This Corruption is very powerful to overcome the reſtraints of Men made againſt it; No humane law, with it's moſt Vigorous execution, can altogether ſtop its Impetuouſneſs: Indwelling ſin is ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that it doeth overcome the reſtraints the the ſinner puts on himſelf, he will break his own Vow's purpoſes and promiſes.</p>
               <p>From the Impetuouſneſs and efficacy of this indwelling ſin, we may inferr the folly of them that think to get it Mortified by their own ſtrength, without the efficacy of the Spirit of life, convoyed to us in the humble uſe of appointed means. 2ly. It ſays, they are fools who look upon their reſolutions to live blameleſly, as a ſufficient guard againſt Scandalous ſins; Indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin is ſo impetuous in its acting, that it will break out notwithſtanding of that reſolution, if it be not mortified by the Law of the Spirit of life.</p>
               <p>Next, the Text holds out the prejudice we luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Corruption: here it is called the Law of Death, and that firſt, becauſe the ſtrength of Corruption and it's Actings marr Spiritual Life. 2ly. Becauſe

               <p n="2">2ly. Take notice of the Action it ſelf, in which conſiſts the way and method that God uſes, to bring about the Sinners Juſtification conſiſtent with his Law, and that is expreſt in theſe words, <hi>He</hi> (or God the Father) condemned Sin in the Fleſh. Some make the Expoſition of the Words to be, That God
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103949:15"/>
ſentenced or appointed ſin to be totally extirpate out of our Nature; But it ſeems rather to be of Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſin in Chriſt's Humane Nature: Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, is here taken for the puniſhment of ſin; Puniſhment ordinarly following on Condemnation, and this is the method that God takes to juſtifie the Sinner, becauſe the puniſhment was inflicted upon Fleſh, that is on Humane Nature, a peice of that Nature poſſeſt by the Redeemer, whereof we all partake; now this is Aſcribed to God the Father, that God condemned ſin in the Fleſh, for though Men were the Inſtruments of Chriſt's Sufferings, yet God the Father had the principal ſinleſs hand in bringing theſe about; He was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffering by the determinate Counſel and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. It is ſaid he was delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> to Death for our offences; And that Delivery muſt be aſcribed to the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is made a ground of our Encouragement to believe on him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. The Delivery of the Son to Death is aſcribed to the Father. Next this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin on Chriſt muſt be referred to God the Father, becauſe he offered himſelf up a Sacrifice to God the Father <hi>Eph:</hi> 5.2. Beſide the Father is ſaid to make him ſin, or a ſacrifice for ſin, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5. <hi>last.</hi> And in the third place the Father is ſaid to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin in Humane Nature, becauſe it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the manifeſtation of Divine Juſtice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Honour and Credite of the Law, that the puniſhment inflicted for the Tranſgreſſion of the Law, ſhould be inflicted on that ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that tranſgreſſed the Law, though not on the ſame individual perſons that did tranſgreſs; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103949:15"/>
it contributes very much to make the ſatisfaction imputable to ſinners, that the Satisfier ſhare of the ſame Nature with them.</p>
               <p>In the third place take notice of the effect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of this Action of God, the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> His Condemning or Puniſhing ſin in the Human Nature of Chriſt and it is this, That the Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in Believers; It is not ſaid, that it is fulfilled by them, for if that could have been done Chriſt needed not to have ſuffered for them; But the meaning is that the Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled for their behoof.</p>
               <p>This Righteouſneſs of the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is nothing elſe but the juſt Puniſhment due to ſin, by Vertue of Gods Law, and the Threatnings thereof, all one with that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Rom:</hi> 1. and laſt. For that is meant of the Righteouſneſs of God, that is, the Puniſhment due to ſin by vertue of Gods juſtice, for it is all one Puniſhment that is due by vertue of divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or by Vertue of the Threatning Law. Now this Puniſhment due by Law is ſaid to be fulfilled in us, by Gods Puniſhing ſin in Chriſt; For though God did diſpenſe ſo far with the ſevere Threatning of the Law, as that he would not inflict that ſevere Puniſhment on the Tranſgreſſor himſelf, yet theſe ſevere Puniſhments <hi>for kind,</hi> that were Threatned by the Law againſt Tranſgreſſors, God, in Puniſhing Chriſt, he inflicted theſe upon him, and therefore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. It is ſaid, that he <hi>behoov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to become man</hi> that he might <hi>bear Death,</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Puniſhment threatned againſt the ſin of man by the Law, And therefore the Scripture aſſerts, that Chriſt bore no other Curſe but the Curſe of the Law;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103949:16"/>
for the Law threatning, was the Rule by which Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did proceed in inflicting puniſhment on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 4 <hi>He was made under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the neceſſity of this Method that God has fallen upon to juſtifie the Sinner, in a way conſiſtent with Law, The Words expreſs it thus, Becauſe the Law as a Covenant, could not juſtifie the ſinner, it being weak and inſufficient to do it, by reaſon of the corrupt ſtate of Man; and this is clear, <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe neither the Natural Law delivered to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor the Moral Law delivered on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> could juſtifie the ſinner, becauſe both theſe Laws, though the ſame as to the matter, did require that the Acts of Obedience ſhould <hi>Firſt</hi> Be Perfect. 2ly. Conſtant, If the Creature were to obtain Juſtification thereby; Now the Acts of Obedience of the ſinner, cannot by reaſon of Corruption be perfect without Defects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot flow from the love of God in the heart; Love being imperfect where any Corruption remains.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Neither can Obedience be conſtant, where Corruption remains. And if it be ſaid, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient ſinner may be juſtified by Law, by bearing the puniſhment threatned by it: It is Anſwered, frail Nature is not able to bear the extremity of Puniſhment threatned by the Law, neither is it able of it ſelf, to overcome Death, which is the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Puniſhment threatned by it againſt ſin. Likeas corrupt m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though Obedience to the Law cannot juſtifie us from the charge, of being in part Tranſgreſſors of the Law; yet it may juſtifie us from the Charge of Hypocriſie: Obedience may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us, as to the reality of our Faith, and we may obey in order to that end, that by it we may know we have true Faith. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3.

former Decree, and was no caſual or fortuitous Thing, but was the accompliſhment of a Divine Purpoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 4 28. and therefore that Providence is not to be ſtumbled at. 3ly.

The Incarnation of the Son of God, He was ſent in Fleſh, he was not ſent in the likeneſs of Fleſh, but in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, he was made real Fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 1.14.

Temptations we are ſubject to. And 5ly. That the Father might make him a Pledge to us of our Victories, and Bleſſings, he would make him in our own Nature, to overcome Death and all our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies, that his Victory might be a Pledge to us, that God can make frail man overcome death, and all their Spiritual Enemies, though they have a frail Nature. And 6ly. That we might have an eaſie Paſſage to God the Father, becauſe we go to him through his own Son, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our Nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20. We go through the vail of his Fleſh, to the Father, That is the Paſſage.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 4ly. Chriſt was not made ſinful Fleſh, but was made like unto ſinful Fleſh; This holds out Chriſt's ſinleſneſs: this behoved to be, that he might be a perfect Patern for our Obedience, that he might be a ſpotleſs and acceptable Sacrifice, that he might be the Truth of theſe his Types, <hi>viz.</hi> the Legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices that were to be offered without blemiſh, that his Sufferings might be for the behoof of others, ſeing he knew no ſin himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and laſt, That he might be a prevalent Interceſſor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. He was free of Original Sin, being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, in the Womb of the Virgin, and ſo not ſpringing from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> by way of ordinary Generation: And it was not conſiſtent with Juſtice that he ſhould want Original Righteouſneſs, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Adam</hi>'s breach of the Covenant of Works, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not a Perſon engaged in that Covenant, either Virtually or Formally, for, as I ſaid, he came not of <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary Generation.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 5ly, He was made in the likeneſs of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103949:19"/>
ſinful Fleſh, which imports theſe two, 1ſt. A ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the common Infirmities of Mankind, ſuch as Hunger, Weariedneſs, and Mortality; And this ſhould ſweeten theſe Miſeries to Believers, becauſe we may expect his ſympathy with us under them, for he had perſonal Experience of them. Likeas this may ſweeten our Lot under them, that God gives us an Inſtance in his Perſon, that theſe Infirmities are conſiſtent with ſpecial Love, and after-happineſs, as we ſee in Chriſt's caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The Phraſe <hi>being made in the likeneſs of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fleſh,</hi> imports not only Chriſt's Subjection to the common Infirmities of our Nature, that all men are ſubject to; but it imports his lyableneſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Sufferings for our ſins, As our Soverty.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 6ly. From the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which imports the final cauſe of Chriſts Miſſion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Humiliation; That the Abolition of Sin is the End why God ſent his Son into the World to dye, which holds out the odiouſneſs and hurtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, ſeing all this ado was made for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of it. And therefore we ſhould be watchful againſt the committing of it, grieved when either we or others do commit it, and reſtleſs and painful for the mortification of it.</p>
               <p>Now follows God's Action, by which he brought about the Juſtification of the Sinner, conſiſtent with Law, expreſt in theſe Words, <hi>He, viz.</hi> God the Father, condemned, that is, puniſhed, upon a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Sentence paſt againſt Chriſt as Soverty, He condemned Sin in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>The Text holds out Three things, anent Chriſt's Sufferings, 1ſt. Their Quality, they were Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103949:19"/>
for they were not Miſeries ſent on him by God, to expreſs his Soveraignty, but the Effects of Divine Juſtice. 2ly. The Words hold out who is the Principal Author and Inflicter of them, and that was God the Father. 3ly. They hold out the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Sufferings, and that was his Fleſh or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; The Text ſays, <hi>He condemned Sin in the Fleſh,</hi> That is, in the Fleſh of his own Son; <hi>Fleſh,</hi> being here put for frail Nature.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt of theſe, That Chriſt's Suffering is a Puniſhment for ſin, Appears, 1ſt. Becauſe he was the Truth of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Sacrifices, The ſacrificed Beaſt, was ſubſtitute in the room of the guilty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the Sinner confeſt his Sin over the head of the Sacrifice. 2ly. Chriſt is ſaid to bear the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. 3ly. He is ſaid to dye in our ſtead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. 4ly. He is ſaid to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation through his Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 25. 5ly. He is ſaid to give his Life a Ranſom for many, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. 6ly. He is ſaid to bear our ſins in his own Body on the Tree, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.24. God is ſaid to make him ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and laſt.

                  </hi> 53.6.</p>
               <p>This tells us, 1ſt. That it was not only to give us a Patern for Patience that he ſuffered, or to give an Confirmation to the Truth of his Doctrine, but the main End was to ſatisfie for our ſins; And though Chriſt be God-man, yet it is not incongruous to ſay that he ſatisfyed his Fathers Juſtice for the contempt of his Father's Authority, by the violation of that Law, ſo expreſly enacted by the Father, becauſe he did reveal himſelf to the Rational World by that Conſtitution. Neither is the freedom of pardoning-Grace

inconſiſtent with this ſatisfaction of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe though Chriſt bought our Pardon, we did not buy it our ſelves, and our Pardon may well be called free, though it be given us for Chriſt's ſake becauſe the Father of Grace provided Chriſt for us.</p>

               <p>The particulars, wherein Chriſt's ſuffering did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, Are 1st, In that he was ſubject to the ſinleſs Infirmities of our Nature. 2ly. In his Subjection to the Moral and Ceremonial Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. 3ly. In his Temptations frae <hi>Satan.</hi> 4ly. In his Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the World. 5ly. In his Poverty. 6ly. In his Reproach Shame and Contempt he ſuffered from the World. 7ly. In his ſevere pains he had on the Croſs, in all the parts of his Body, and without the leaſt Alleviation of inward Joy: which many of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> had. 8ly. It conſiſted in Natural Death. Like as he had Trouble in his Soul, as appears in his Prayers, by ſtrong Crying and Tears, and by his Bloody ſweat in the Garden, and by his Outcry on the Croſs, when he ſaid, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And this ſuffering in his Soul conſiſted in his fear of being ſwallowed up of Wrath, ſee <hi>Heb</hi> 5.7, 8. which Fear was ſinleſs, becauſe he having frail Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and having a quick apprehenſion of Divine Wrath, and its unſupportableneſs to that Nature, without ſupernatural ſupport, and he at this time not reflecting on the promiſe of ſupernatural ſupport, he could not but fear the being overcome thereby. If it be ſaid, it was a ſin to him, not to reflect on that promiſed Support. I Anſwer, It was no ſin, becauſe his Mind being Finite, and being fixed in the apprehenſion of that terrible Object of Divine Wrath, it could be in no Natural Capacity at that ſame moment of time to reflect on the promiſes of Support, the which he did quickly after, when the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103949:21"/>
Mind was in its Natural Capacity to do it. 2ly. His Soul-trouble conſiſted in the want of the ſenſible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his Fathers Love, whereof he complain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> on the Croſs. 3ly. His Soul-Trouble conſiſted in that great Grief which put him in an Agony, and made him <hi>Sorrowful even to Death:</hi> And this was, for feeling the Wrath, of an Angry God, againſt ſin.</p>
               <p>From this, Firſt, We may ſee the greatneſs of the moral ill of Sin, that brought on ſuch ſharp and ſore Sufferings upon Chriſt. 2ly. We may ſee the firmneſs of the Commination of the Law, for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In Chriſt's ſevere Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ye may read the greatneſs of his Love. 4ly. Since his Sufferings were ſo extream; It commends his Carriage, as an imitable pattern under an ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lot; ſee him Exerciſing Faith, Love to God, and his People, Sympathy with God's People, as he had with the Diſciples, when he found them ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Zeal, Patience, Self-denyal and the like. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THis is the Effect of the wiſe Method, that God did take for the Juſtification of the ſinner, in a way conſiſtent with the Law: And in ſpeaking to theſe Words, as they are connected with the former verſe, we will ſpeak to theſe 3. Things. 1st. Clear what this Righteouſneſs of the Law is, and that it is a Righteouſneſs. 2ly. That Chriſt hath acted and done it. And 3ly. That it is ſurely ours, and that it is fulfilled in us.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> to clear what it is, and that it is; you muſt know that it hath two parts; its preceptive part, and it's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatory part, now both theſe are Righteous. 1st. The preceptive part, it is Righteous, if ye conſider
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103949:22"/>
either the Authority enjoining, or the Matter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined: The Authority is juſt, If ye conſider ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> obligation to God, and our dependencies on him, and if ye conſider that Infinite Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power, which qualifie him to be the ſupream moral Governour of the World. 2ly. If ye look to the matter of the Law, it is Righteous, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Creator as our God, to give him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his own manner of Worſhip, to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend in that Worſhip, to give him a part of our time, to do the Relative Duties to our Superiours, becauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our dependance on him, and benefite by them, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſign the preſervation of our Neighbours Life, Chaſtity, Goods and Name, as we do deſign the preſervation of our own, and that becauſe ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Neighbours participate of the ſame nature and ſpring from the ſame common Root of Mankind. Becauſe the good of Humane ſociety tends much to Gods Glory, To be content with our Lot, as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed be the good and wiſe God, The practice of theſe Duties are Righteous, becauſe the very light of nature approves them: The practice of the Duties of the firſt Table of the Law having a Native ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to fit a Man to Converſe with his God, in which ſtands his Felicity: And the practice of the duties of the ſecond Table of the Law, being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the preſervation of humane ſociety, clearly evinces, That that practice is Righteous.</p>
               <p>From the Righteouſneſs of the preceptive part of the Law we infer, Firſt, That every ſin has in the boſome of it, a Rebellion againſt the Authority of God. 2ly. Of its own nature, it's Unrighteouſneſs. 3ly. We ſee that every true Chriſtian with <hi>Paul,</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103949:22"/>
to the Law, and approve it as good and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Righteouſneſs of the Threatning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to the Law, the puniſhment threatned is moſt Righteous; For the Law threatens the ſinner, with Death, Natural, Spiritual, and Eternal: Now it is a Righteous thing, that no leſs puniſhment ſhould be due for ſin nor that threefold Death, becaue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God, who is Eſſentially juſt, and neceſſarly the Moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World, hath appointed it, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err. 2ly. His Deputy within us, Our Conſcience approves this puniſhment is due for ſin. 3ly. The Intrinſick evil that is in ſin deſerves it. It being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude againſt our Benefactor, Unrighteouſneſs upon the matter, and Rebellion againſt the juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our Ruler.</p>
               <p>From the Righteouſneſs and dueneſs of puniſhment by the Threatning, we infer, That we ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, when God puniſhes us for ſin.</p>
               <p>Now we come to clear, That the Righteouſneſs of the Law is perfectly to be found in Chriſt, and this ſtands upon the connection of the former verſe with this: It is expreſly ſaid, that Chriſt was put to ſuffering, <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> 1st. Then look to Chriſt's Active o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Laws Precepts; it is ſuch an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as makes the ſinner Righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. 2ly. The perfection, required by the Precepts of the Law, is to be found in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, a perfect conformity, to the preceptive part of the Law, is to be found in Chriſt, as a Baſis for our Juſtification. 3ly. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is perfect, ſtanding in a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103949:23"/>
perfect obedience to all the Commands he was under, Becauſe he is allowed to ſtay with the Father in Heaven; he could not enjoy that perfect Felicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, if he had been diſobedient to the Father in the leaſt. <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.10. This obedience of Chriſt's flows from a principle of Love to the Father. <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. <hi>laſt,</hi> it tends to a good end, <hi>viz.</hi> to pleaſe God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.29. it is conſtant and uninterrupted. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this we may ſee. 1ſt. That Chriſts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience makes him an excellent Pattern for our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 2ly. It holds out, that our Juſtification through Chriſt, hath a ſolid Baſis, it doth eſtabliſh the preceptive part of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. laſt. and 10.4. 3ly. We muſt not now ſtudy Obedience to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, ſeing Chriſt's compleat Obedience may be ſufficient matter for our Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Next, a perfect conformity to the Commination of the Law, is to be found in Chriſt. 1st. If ye look to the Extremity of his Suffering, He was obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. 2ly. The quality of his Sufferings, he bore the whole Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal:</hi> 3.13. They were the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of vindictive Wrath. 3ly. If ye look to the Effects of his ſufferings: As firſt, Perfect expiation of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. The procuring of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 4ly If ye look to the Evidences of the compleatneſs of his Sufferings: As firſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as being the abſolution of our Soverty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. 2ly. His Seſſion at God's right Hand, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Reward. ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>From the perfect conformity of Chriſt, to the Threatning of the Law, We ſee how the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Believer by the Goſpel, fully ſecures the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103949:23"/>
Beleiver from Law-Vengeance. 2ly. We ſee we are bound to do and ſuffer for Chriſt, who has fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Threatning of the Law for us. 3ly. We ſee it is very unſafe for our ſelves, and injurious to Chriſt, to judge, that either our Actions or Sufferings can come in as Partial Cauſes with Chriſt's Satisfaction to the Threatning of the Law to procure the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of Sin.</p>
               <p>We have ſpoken to the Righteouſneſs of the Law in it ſelf, As it is preſcribed, and required by the Law. 2ly. We have ſpoken to it as performed acted and done by Chriſt: We muſt ſpeak to that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs performed by Chriſt, as imputed to us, and poſſeſt by us. And Firſt, It is imputable to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the puniſhment, Born to ſatisfy the Threatning of the Law, was Born by one in our Nature; the Father puniſhed ſin in Chriſt's Fleſh, and his Fleſh was our Fleſh. 2ly. Chriſt was the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and our Legal Soverty. 3ly. We have an Myſtical and ſpiritual Union with him, we are called his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. as being born according to his Image, by the power of his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Likeas, The ſoveraign Lord, and ſupream Governour of the World declares in the Goſpel, That he accepts Chriſt's ſatisfaction to the threatning of the Law, in the place of a compleat ſatisfaction from Sinners,: Here is a ſtrong perſwaſive to invite ſinners to make uſe of Chriſt, becauſe he is in himſelf a compleat legal Righteouſneſs, and can inveſt them ſickerly and ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with it. 2ly. It calls on Actual Believers, ſeing they have a ſure pretenſion to an compleat Legal Righteouſneſs, it calls on them, I ſay, to expell the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103949:24"/>
fears of Law Vengeance out of their Mind, it calls on them to have an quiet and peaceable Conſciencece Boldneſs in Prayer, and the lively hope of Glory.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103949:26"/>
the truth is, that theſe Objects which gratify Luſt, or rather thoſe ſinful courſes, that corrupt Nature takes for to attain the Enjoyment of theſe gratifying objects, certainly tends to Death; many times the wickedneſs of men brings them to an untimeous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death, and always Mens acting of Wickedneſs encreaſeth Spiritual Death, which ſtands in the Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Carnal Acts of the carnal mind encreaſe Spiritual Death, becauſe they encreaſe in us an impotency to do that which is ſpiritually good, and they encreaſe in us a Readineſs and Ability to do that which is Evil, ſo then Sin cannot but encreaſe Siritual Death: Becauſe Spiritual Death conſiſts in an Averſion from doing good, and a readyneſs to do Evil. Likeas there is a ſtrict Connection between the ſinful courſe of the Carnal unrenewed Mind, and Eternal Death, which ſtands in the Eternal ſeparation of an Man from the favourable preſence of God, And the Intimation and Expreſſions of his ſpecial Love, and it lyes in the undergoing, to all Eternity, the Effects of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as a juſt Revenging God, puniſhing all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his Law: And that this Eternal death is ſurely connected, with the prophane courſe of a Carnal Mind. Appears 1ſt, Becauſe that the Law binds over all the Tranſgreſſors of it, to endure
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103949:26"/>
this Death, <hi>The Wages of ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6.23. Now there's non can evite the Accompliſhment of this Law-Threatning, but ſuch as are in Chriſt; and the Carnal-minded Man is not ſo, while he remains Carnally Minded. 2ly. It appears that the courſe of the Carnal minded Man tends to Death, becauſe while he is in that courſe of Life, the Goſpel and all it's promiſes are unſavoury to him, and ſo he cannot be in caſe to follow the Counſels therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for eſcaping Eternal Death.</p>
               <p>Uſe 1st. Seing that ſuch perſons are running to Death, it ſerves to reprove them that are in this caſe, that are very ſecure and fearleſs, expecting that they will go to Heaven, notwithſtanding of their wicked courſe of Life: This ſecurity of theirs may ariſe 1ſt. From their Morality, leaning to that. 2ly. From their Formality. 3ly. From their immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from preſent Trouble. 4ly. From the exerciſe of their common Gifts. 5ly. From their Carnal Policy, they make a Covenant with Death and Hell. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28. They think they have wit to eſcape the Wrath of God, let it burn never ſo hot. 6ly. This ſecurity comes from the Flattery of bad Miniſters and falſe Friends.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Uſe of Exhortation, And that <hi>First.</hi> To the Carnally minded, That they would conſider what is the danger of their Condition, and what is the remedy thereof. And 2ly. To Miniſters, and other Godly People, to pity ſuch, and do what they can in their ſtation, to prevent the danger of their Folks. A <hi>Third</hi> Uſe, is to inſtruct us in the miſerable condition of ſuch, who not only are lyable to Death, but the whole tendency and labour of their Body, and toil of their Mind, during the courſe of their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103949:27"/>
Life, while they are in that ſtate, is to involve them more and more under Eternal Death.</p>
               <p>Next Obſerve, <hi>To be Spiritually Minded is Life and Peace,</hi> and therefore the Man, that walks after the Spirit, is free of Condemnation.</p>
               <p>The Life of Grace follows on Spiritual Mindedneſs and the Life of Glory is connected with it, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. This is a ſingular advantage to have ſpiritual Life. For 1st. It is the beſt kind of Life, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is better then the Vegetative Life, the Rational is better than the Animal, and the ſpiritual Life is better then the Rational. 2ly. It is the end of Chriſt's Death, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. 3ly. It is the ſame Life that he poſſeſſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. 4ly. Tho it be obſcure to Senſe, yet it is ſure to Faith, <hi>Col:</hi> 3.2. 5ly. It is a Life from God, ſpringing from his Gracious preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It makes a Man live with God, to entertain Converſe with God, and diſpoſes him to live to God, &amp; to give him much Self-denying Obedience. Now ſpiritual-mindedneſs encreaſeth this Life, becauſe to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually-minded is vigorouſly to act this Life, and the vigorous acting of it, encreaſes it.</p>
               <p>From this we may ſee, That Chriſtians may blame their own Carnality for the want of the encreaſe of ſpiritual Life. 2ly. Since the Apoſtle, to prove that Spiritual Mindedneſs is inconſiſtent with the ſtate of Condemnation, adduces this Argument, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life attends ſpiritual Mindedneſs: from this he warrands the Chriſtian to conclude from his ſpiritual Life, that he cannot be condemned: and indeed it is a good Ground for ſuch an Concluſion, for ſpiritual Life is <hi>begun G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103949:27"/>
becauſe it is attended with this advantage, the encreaſe of ſpiritual Life: Tho the World look on ſpiritual-mindedneſs as folly, yet this again ſhould make them look on it, as true Wiſedom.</p>
               <p>The next Advantage following on ſpiritual Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is Peace, which includes in it, Peace with God, peace with our own Conſcience, and freedom from the diſturbance of Luſts: The ſpiritual-minded Man has Peace with God, becauſe he has an Union with Chriſt; he has peace with his own Conſcience, becauſe he lyes near the Communication of ſaving Light, whereby he may diſcern his Intereſt in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Priviledges. 3ly. He acquires freedom from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance frae his Luſts, becauſe Spiritual-mindedneſs leſſens a Mans inclination to Sin.</p>

               <p>There are three Things obſervable in the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1st. That the carnal and unrenewed Man is God's irreconcileable Enemy. 2ly.

the Enmity, that the carnal Man hath againſt God, (that former Aſſertion,) That to be carnally minded is Death.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt Obſervation, That the Unrenewed Man is God's Enemy, it appears, from his carriage towards Gods Law 1ſt. He contemns its Authority. 2ly.

It ſpeaks his Ingratitude, ſince he is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his Benefactor. 4ly.

It gives them a great ground of Confidence, to expect the continuance of Favour; for if Grace made them Friends of Enemies, it will much more continue towards them, when they are made Friends. 9ly. It takes off the Offence that might ariſe from the Worlds oppoſition to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for it is a confirming Argument for the Truth of the Goſpel, that it is of God, ſeing the World are Gods Enemies. 10ly.

               <p>The Apoſtle Expreſſes the Concluſion; becauſe it is of great import to unrenewed folks, to believe that God is not a friend to them; Or the Word may be taken as an new Reaſon to prove the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Theſis, which is, That ſuch as walk after the fleſh, are not free from Condemnation: And if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him, and we know that the Non-acceptableneſs of the unrenewed mans Actions to God, is well infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the oppoſition of his unrenewed Nature to the Law.</p>
               <p>The Words carry in them theſe Two Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As 1st. Obſerve, That unrenewed People, while they are ſuch, God is not reconciled to them. 2ly Obſerve, That unrenewed People, while they are ſuch, their Actions are not accepted of God, nor rewarded by him: when I deny a reward to their Actions, I do not deny but ſome of their Actions being materially Good. a temporal Reward may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, as it was with <hi>Jehu,</hi> but they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable in this Senſe, they have no Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in this life, nor Eternal Rewards in the life to come; neither will the material Goodneſs of their Actions keep them from the Vengeance of God due to them, for the Evil that is mixed with them, as appears by the 1. of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> the Threatning againſt the Houſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> for the blood of <hi>Jezriel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the 1ſt. Obſervation, That God is not reconciled to thoſe that are unrenewed, is clear, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none can be reconciled to God but thoſe that have an intereſt in Chriſt, and we can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt without the Preſence of his Spirit, and that Preſence is always a renewing Preſence.

And therefore thoſe that Chriſt reconciles to God, he muſt renew, ſeing his Salvation includes in it, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the abolition of the Power of Sin by reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

               <p>Uſe 2. To the Godly, To believe the acceptance of their ſervice; ſeing theſe that are in the Spirit, The Text ſuppoſes their ſervices to pleaſe God; this belief is neceſſary to them, to keep up their heart under the Worlds Cenſures of their good Actions and under the Godlyes Cenſures of the ſame, and under the want of Temporal Rewards for them, and under the Afflictions that may attend them for the tryal of their Conſtancy therein, They would not be diſcouraged from this belief for the ſinful imperfections that attend them, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4 and 5. See <hi>Rachabs</hi> caſe in hiding of the Spyes, God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſervice, who tho he does not approve of the Lye, yet he approves of the Faith and Affection that was in the ſervice. Neither ſhould they be diſcouraged from their after-faillings, The weakneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> Parents, in expoſing the Child to danger in the Ark of Bull-ruſhes, did not hinder God to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice their Faith in the Preſervation of the Child three Moneths. Neither ſhould they be diſcouraged from the faith of acceptance, becauſe of the difficulties that attend the doing of a good work; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the people met with in Building the Temple, In the days of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ſhould not have marred the faith of their Acceptance, in the doing of it. Neither ſhould they be diſcouraged from the faith of this Acceptance, becauſe of the Afflictions that do immediatly attend the doing of

Gods Service; which was <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> caſe, in the time of the Invaſion of <hi>Senacherib;</hi> Neither ſhould they be diſcouraged, becauſe of the groundleſs Cenſures, that the Godly paſs upon their way; This was <hi>Mary</hi>'s caſe, who was Cenſured by the Diſciples in pouring Oyntment upon Chriſt's Head.</p>
               <p>We would give ſome Directions to the Godly; Whereby they may win the more eaſily to the faith of this acceptance. As 1ſt.

A 4th. Direction is, That what they do, they would owe it to the Strength of Chriſt's Spirit, becauſe then the Action does not flow from Corruption. A 5th. Direction is, They would reflect upon the Spiritual Rewards that God beſtows upon them, to teſtifie the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance of their Service; ſuch as theſe 1st. The giving them more meanes of Knowledge, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Light, as he did to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10.6. 2ly.

               <p>The Indwelling Spirit produces Illumination, By opening the underſtanding, that they may know the Scriptures. <hi>Luke.</hi> 25.45. By taking away the Vail that is on the Mind in Reading of the Word. He proves an Spirit of Illumination, by diſcovering the Glory of God, in the face of Chriſt Jeſus, by letting us ſee, that all the perfections of the Divine Nature, do manifeſt themſelves clearly in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators Work of Mediation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 6. He opens the Eyes of Men, and lets them ſee that the way of Salvation, holden out by the Goſpel, is the moſt wiſe and and effectual way of Salvation; Theſe that want this Spirit, they look on the Goſpel as Fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. and 2.14.

By applying the Command, to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtand in awe, by applying the promiſe to outbid Temptations, by applying the Threatnings to reſtrain them from outbreaking in ſin.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, he proves a Spirit of Conſolation, by manifeſting the great Happineſs of Believers, both in this Life, and that which is to come: It is by the Spirit we take up the Reality and Excellency of theſe Priviledges, that are freely given us of God, even in this World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.

They may have the Spirit of Prayer in them, though they have not that withgate and liberty in Praying through a defect of the Gift of Prayer, which ſtands in a clearneſs of Conception of things needful, and a clearneſs of Expreſſion; if they have fervent ſingle deſires after ſpiritual good, and theſe deſires put up in the Name of Chriſt. 3ly. They would conſider that tho Believers may want ſometimes, that Peace paſſing underſtanding, that Joy unſpeakable and Glorious, the Spirits Teſtimony for their Aodption, that full and free Application of the Promiſes: Yet they may have the Comfort of the Spirit, if they have that ſupport in their Mind, and calmneſs in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as makes them cheerfully go about their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hear their Croſſes. 4ly.

by reaſon of his Conqueſt of them, of redeeming them from the Dominion of Sin and Satan, becauſe a man that wants Chriſts Spirit is under the Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany of both. 4ly.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103949:38"/>
with a Right to the great Priviledges of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, except they cordially receive Chriſt offered therein. It is true, it doth really ſeal the Truth of the free Covenant of Grace, and the cloſs Particular and condeſcending Good offered therein: but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not oblige God to give that Good to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, and will not cordially accept it. A 3d. Cauſe of the Miſtake is, They take Morality for true Grace, ſo they think their Morality evidenceth their Intereſt in Chriſt, but Chriſt tells us <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. That our Righteouſneſs muſt exceed the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> otherways we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of God. A 4th. Cauſe is, They think the great and ſole End of Chriſts Miſſion is, to free them from the Guilt and Curſe of the Law; Therefore they think, tho they be void of Chriſts Spirit, they may have an Intereſt in Chriſt, and the Goſpel, becauſe they think Chriſt is come to ſave them from Wrath, tho they take liberty to live as they will: ſo they make Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.17. The folly of thir Perſons is evidenced from this, That Chriſts Errand into the World was, to Redeem us from all Iniquity and to purify to himſelf a Peculiar People, zealous of good Works. A 5th. Cauſe of this Miſtake is, That unrenewed Folks takes the Challenges of their Conſciences to be the ſtrivings of the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fleſh, for they conclude, from having theſe Challenges, that they have the Spirit of Chriſt; tho they altogether want him: But to undeceive ſuch, they would conſider, that thoſe that have the ſtrivings of the Spirit, they do not fulfill the Luſts of the Fleſh, the External Converſation is regular,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103949:39"/>
although the inward Frame with <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. may want ſome Degrees of Perfection. Likeas, the ſtrivings of the Spirit where they are, they oppoſe heart-evils, as well as external-evils, evils againſt the Goſpel, as well as evils againſt the Moral-Law.</p>
               <p>As this Text tells us, That thoſe that want Chriſts Spirit, Chriſt has no ſuch peculiar Intereſt in them, as he has in Believers; So it plainly ſuppoſeth that all thoſe, that have a peculiar Intereſt in him, have this great Priviledge of the Preſence of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I ſhall clear 1ſt. That it is ſo. 2ly. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, by telling you what are the Cauſes, from whence the preſence of the Spirit flowes. 3ly. What are the Ends and Uſes for which God beſtows this Benefit on Believers. 4ly. We ſhall exhort the People of God, to improve this Benefite, and not to lye out in the uſe making of it. And 5ly. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that are Chriſts have the Spirit, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, We will reprove thoſe that have this Spirit, and yet notwithſtanding, queſtion Chriſts peculiar Intereſt in them, and theirs in him.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Scripture ſhews it, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Saints confirms it, that Believers have the Spirit. 1ſt. Their illumination clears it; their diſtinct, clear, near, and ſolid Views of the ſublime Myſteries of Gods Covenant, that the ſharpeſt Witts that want the Spirit reckon fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. That Illumination diſcovers it ſelf in a Preſence of the Spirit. 2. The Work of Sanctification diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it; if ye look to the greatneſs of the Change, the thorrowneſs of the Change upon the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and the whole converſation, the conſtancy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103949:39"/>
of the Change, the ſuddenneſs of it, and that it is carried over great and manifold Obſtructions, from Allurements and Terrors, from bad Counſel and bad Cuſtom, from many falſe Suggeſtions of a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart, and ſubtile Reaſonings of a tempting Devil. 3ly. The Spirits Conſolation evinceth the reality of this Gift, if we conſider how the Saints Hearts are kept up, under fightings without, and terrours within. 4. Their Devotions clears it, if you conſider their ſingle, humble, fervent, ſpiritual and confident Deſires, perſevered in, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Guilt, Corruption, Miſery and Repulſes; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch Deſires come from no other Principle, than the Omnipotent Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes of this Gift, may be 1ſt. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal moving Cauſe, is, Electing Love. 2ly. The Meritorious Cauſe is, Chriſts Satisfaction, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. 3ly. The Procuring Cauſe, is Chriſts Interceſſion, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. 4ly. The Diſpenſing Cauſe is, Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. and 15.26 5ly. The Final Cauſes and Ends of this Gift, are theſe, following. He is given 1ſt. As an Illuminator, to guide us into all Truth. <hi>John</hi> 16.13. and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in dubious Caſes, and lead us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. 2d. End is to help our Infirmity in Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. 3d. Is to comfort us in our Trouble, <hi>John</hi> 14.16 A 4th. Is to ſanctify us, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.7. A 5th. Is to be the Earneſt of our Inheritance, and to ſtrengthen our Hope thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. A 6th. End is, he is Gods Mark and Seal upon us, till the Day of Redemption, to obſtruct the Worlds Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whereby they calumniate us as Hypocrites; and to hinder us to diſpoſe upon our ſelves as we were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103949:40"/>
our own. And 7ly. That his Preſence may be a ſtanding Witneſs, in, and to the World, of the Truth of Chriſtianity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>As to the 4th. Thing, how to improve this Gift, we have by Promiſe from the Fathers Love, Chriſts Merite and Interceſſion. 1ſt. Believe, that God will give us this promiſed Mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. 2ly. We would pray for it, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. 3ly. We would obey the Spirits Motions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>penult.</hi> 4ly. Grieve not the Spirit, and meddle not with theſe ſins men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. 5ly. Savour the things of the Spirit, and have an high eſteem of Spiritual Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4.</p>
               <p>A 2d. Uſe is, ſince theſe that are Chriſts have this Gift, and none other, it reproves theſe that participate in part of this Gift, and queſtion Chriſts Intereſt in them, and theirs in him; and that <hi>Firſt</hi> on the account of their Miſeries, Croſſes and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. 2ly. On account of the Remainders of their Corruption, and ſinful Infirmities. 3ly. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of their partial Darkneſs in Spiritual Matters, for we know but in part. 4ly. Upon account of their ſtrong Temptations from Satan.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103949:40"/>
of the Priviledge of Non-condemnation; It might have been ſaid, that ſince Believers muſt dye, what benefite can be expected by them, as enjoying that Priviledge? It is Anſwered, they muſt dye, becauſe of inherent Sin; For God, to ſhew his indignation againſt all ſin, appointed Death. Likeways they muſt dye for the abolition of it, God appointing the diſſolution of our Nature to be the Method for its perfect cure; yet the comfort is, that tho the body dye, yet the Soul lives, becauſe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs: And a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Comfort is, that the Souls Life is an Pledge of the Reſurrection of the Body.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee, that Chriſt dwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls in his Peoples Hearts by his Spirit, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> And ye may Obſerve, 1ſt. That there may be Inherent Sin in thoſe in whom Chriſt dwells, though it reign not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>last.</hi> The Lord does not perfect our Cure all at once, he leaves this evil Neighbour in our Hearts, to embitter the Worlds Comforts to us: to try our Faith of Juſtification, and to call us to a vigilant and dependant frame upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, 2ly. That the Godly muſt dye; For albeit Chriſt hath removed the whole Curſe of the Law, and ſatisfyed Juſtice compleatly for all our ſins, and has the Fathers Promiſe that he ſhall free his People from all the bad Conſequences of ſin; yet a preſent total freedom, from all theſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that followes on ſin, upon their firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, is not promiſed by the Father to him, or to them: It is ſecured, that it ſhall be done in Gods time and way, but mortality is not removed from them preſently. If ye ſhall ſay, they are freed from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103949:41"/>
the Curſe of the Law in Juſtification, why then and they not freed preſently from all the effects of that Curſe? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Mortality continues on the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, not by vertue of a curſeing Law, as though it would be a Reflection upon Juſtice, if God ſhould deliver the Believer upon his firſt Faith, altogether from Mortality; But Mortality is continued by the Soveraign God, for wiſe Ends, not to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſatisfaction to Juſtice for our ſin that Chriſt hath left unmade, but becauſe God will have the whole Myſtical Body its perfection to be all at once, and he will have his People to live in this World by Faith, and therefore he makes the Mortality of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers a vail, to hide their promiſed Felicity from Senſe, And that the Mortality of Believers is not continued upon them, as the Effect of a curſeing Law, is clear from what the Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. That their Death wants its Sting: Next, we ſee Death inflicted as a Chaſtiſement upon ſome of the Godly, See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30, 31, 32 And it is clear in the Inſtance of <hi>Joſia,</hi> who dyed in peace, and yet was chaſtiſed with a violent Death, for his raſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in a War. Now God, inflicting Death upon Believers, teſtifies his Fatherly Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, but not his Juſtice againſt them as a juſt Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Affliction is ſent upon them as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the Threatning annext to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, but not as an Accompliſhment of the Law-curſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32. This is much for the Comfort of Believers.</p>
               <p>Uſe of this is, ſince Believers muſt die, They would prepare for Death, and if they would be prepared, they would make uſe of theſe Directions:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103949:41"/>
1ſt. Labour to be ſure of the indwelling Spirit, for that is the only ſure mark of an intereſt in Chriſt, they would not lean to an empty profeſſion, a great meaſure of common gifts, or meer Morality. A 2d Direction is, They would found their Title to Life, only upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and not upon their own merite. A 3d. is, They would be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dye, and therefore they would mortify their Covetouſneſs and their Security, and they would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a firm Faith in Divine Providence, whereby they may committ the diſpoſal of all their concerns and the concerns of the Church to God, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did <hi>Gen. laſt:</hi> 4th. Direction is, They would labour to have peace of Conſcience at Death; and for this effect they would beware of lying under impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency for old or new contracted Guilt. Likeas they would labour for a Teſtimony from their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they have readily accepted of the Goſpel-Offer. 2ly. They would labour to have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience witneſſing their ſingleneſs in their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at Death, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had in his ſickneſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. Likeas they would have the Conſcience witneſſing their Diligence in Duty, That ſo an entrance may be Adminiſtred to them abundantly to the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. A 5th Direction is, They would fix themſelves in the faith of the Immortality of the Soul; which Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality appears from its conception of immaterial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. 2ly. From its Oper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tions, independent on the Body, as in Extaſies. 3ly. From the Moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God in the World, by Laws and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſidered jointly with the impartial Juſtice of God, with the Miſeries of the Godly, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103949:42"/>
of the Wicked. A 6th. Direction is, We would build our ſelves up in the faith of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection of the Body.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 3ly. That the Godly have a ſpiritual life in their Soul, as appears by the ſpiritual ſenſe they have of ſpiritual things, They have an Hunger and Thirſt after ſpiritual Food: They have a ſpiritual ſigh of ſpiritual Myſteries by Faith, and they have a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritual feeling of ſin and miſery: Now this ſpiritual Life continues after Death, as appears from <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23, and 23, 43. <hi>Phil,</hi> 1, 23. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5, 1</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, that the continuance of this Life after Death, is a ſufficient comfort to the Godly, under their preſent Mortality; and theſe conſiderations may clear the ſufficiency of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: if ye conſider <hi>First,</hi> The great Good that is in it; 1st.

the Gifts and Callings of God are without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And 2ly. Becauſe the Spirit is given to them, not to be taken from them again, for he is ſaid to dwell in them by his Spirit, and to make them a perpetual Sanctuary to himſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.26. He is to be a ſpring of Eternal Life to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. The Soul that is thus poſſeſſed of the Spirit cannot miſs Eternal Life, for it is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal habitation for God, and the Spirit gives the Soul Eternal Life; now the Spirit cannot give the Soul Eternal Life, if the Body lay perpetually in the Grave.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this is, ſince the preſence of the Holy Spirit in a Believer is a ſure pledge of immortal Life, it reproves Believers that have it, that they are not more lively in their hope of Glory.</p>
               <p>A 2d. Uſe is, To Inſtruct us in the worth of this Gift, God may give and take other Gifts from us, but he gives us this Gift without Rueing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, we may loſe other Gifts, but this is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Enjoyment, there is nothing in the World that has the full ſignificancy that this Gift has, nor has its Efficacy; And therefore theſe that have it ſhould be thankful for it, and whoſoever want it ſhould be at pains to obtain it.</p>

The former Grounds upon which the Apoſtle infers this inference are ſufficiently convincing.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, That the fleſh is craving appears in theſe ſix; firſt. In that it craves Love and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 2ly. Obedience: 3ly. Awe: 4ly. Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 5ly. Spareing; And 6ly. hideing of its Nakedneſs.</p>

               <p>And 6ly.

When we attempt its Death, it makes it as it were deſpaired, and gives us more ado, whereby we are neceſſitate to believe on Chriſt, for Mortifying Grace, and forced to have a deſire to be gone to be ſure of it; and withall if we do ſpare it, it may break out, to our ſhame.</p>

courſe of Life ends in Eternal Death, as appears by the Threatning of the Law and of the Goſpel, and the Self-condemnation of ſuch Folks Conſciences.</p>
               <p>Uſe of reproof, to thoſe that are ſecure, and have their ſecurity ſpringing from misbelief of future Wrath, Falſe-Imaginations of Divine Mercy, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and ſouredneſs of Conſcience, Blinding Self-Love, and Atheiſtical Thoughts of Providence, as tho God would neither do Good nor Evil; but ſuch would remember to reflect on the Truth of the Scriptures, the hatefulneſs and demerite of Sin, and the Juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>Obſerve: 2ly. That the Mortifying of the Deeds of the Body is a moſt advantagious thing, and brings Life with it; it brings with it the Life of Juſtification, or Pardon, becauſe it's the great Pledge of Pardon, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. 2ly. It brings with it the Life of Sanctification, conſiſting in theſe Four. <hi>viz.</hi> The Eaſy, Vigorous, Cheerful, and Conſtant Exerciſe of Grace; 1ſt. It brings the eaſy Exerciſe of Grace with it, becauſe it makes a man quick-ſighted to diſcern his Duty, for Luſt blinds the mind, it frees him of theſe Luſts that makes him ordinarly ſhift the doing of his Duty. 2ly. Mortification makes him Vigorous in the Exerciſe of Grace, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.11. Becauſe the whole Heart when Mortified gets liberty to be about its Duty in the Exerciſe of Grace. 3ly. It makes him cheerful in it, Becauſe the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace is connatural to a Mortified Heart; And the mind of a Mortified Man, does more clearly diſcern the Advantage of the Exerciſe of Grace, than the mind of another, 4ly. It is uſeful for the conſtant Exerciſe of Grace, and that becauſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103949:48"/>
it keeps him from being eaſily overcome with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, 2ly, He cannot weary of it, for he finds a pleaſure in it. And 3ly. He does not ſoon ſatisfy himſelf with what he has done, becauſe he ſees many of his Imperfections therein; But 3ly. Mortification is good for the life of Comfort, Becauſe it fits a Man for diſcoveries of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. It qualifies him for hope, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. And contributes to the intrinſick pleaſure, that the New Man has in Duty. And 4ly. It brings the life of Glory with it, becauſe it tends to prepare a Man for it.</p>
               <p>From all this we may ſee 1st. The cauſe, why many Chriſtians wants the intimation of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: its becauſe they ſtudy not Mortification. 2ly. We ſee, that we need not lay the blame of the want of Sanctification, either upon Gods ſparingneſs to give us ſanctifying Grace, or upon External Temptations, ſo much as upon our own neglect of Mortifying our Luſts. 3ly. This tells us, why ſo many Profeſſors are Strangers to Comforts.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2d, Of Exhortation, if we would win ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily to Heaven, we would ſtrive to mortify Luſts, and as we would have thoſe Advantages, let us go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Duty: 1st. Labour for the diſcovery of the Evills, in the Imperfections of your Services, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. 2ly. Repent of them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8.9. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually groan under Corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. make no proviſion for Corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>laſt.</hi> And ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the promiſes of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Next, ſtudy to reflect on the prejudices you have ſuſtained by them, how oft they have brought on Judgements upon your Perſon, made you Scandalous to others, interrupted your Communion with God, broken
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103949:49"/>
your peace of Conſcience. Next, Regulate your life by the Word, having a conſtant Eye upon that as your Rule.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2d. Of Reproof, If this be ſo advantageous an Exerciſe; it reproves thoſe that lay this work aſide, becauſe they think the neglect of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is conſiſtent with Grace, but (as we were ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) it is not conſiſtent with the Life of Grace, And the total neglect of it is inconſiſtent with Grace it ſelf. 3ly. It reproves thoſe that forbear Mortification becauſe they ſee not many Evils to Mortifie, through want of Self-Examination. 4ly. Thoſe that ſpare their Sins, becauſe they think there are few free of the like of theſe Evills, they are loath to Mortify.</p>
               <p>Uſe 3d. Of Tryal, To try whether we be about this Work or not. 1ſt. The Man that is about this Work, he is glad of any actual ſeparation Providence makes between him and his Ills by Croſſes. 2ly. He is daily watchful againſt External Temptations. 3ly. He is daily porcing on the Miſchiefs that Sin does him, and Prays more for Grace againſt ſin, then to be free of Croſſes, and welcoms that Word moſt that particularly hits his Evills, and does not ſpurn at it.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 3ly. That the Spirit is the great and principal cauſe of Mortification; This is clear if ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtrength and deceitfulneſs of Luſts, it muſt require the Spirits power, in oppoſition to them. 2ly. if ye conſider, the ineffectualneſs of the means that many enjoy, without the Spirits Bleſſing. 3ly. If ye conſider that even thoſe that are weak in natural parts, they will, when they depend upon the Spirit, find great ſucceſs in Mortification, beyond others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103949:49"/>The manner how the Spirit does Mortifie, is by diſcovering the hatefulneſs of Sin, and its danger, 2ly. By applying the promiſes of the Goſpel, and ſo outbidding Corruption 3ly. By enforcing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, againſt ſin, upon the Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Uſe, If it be ſo, we ſhould uſe the means, and Pray for the Spirits Bleſſing upon them. 2ly. We ſhould not grieve the Mortifieing Spirit, by unwatchfulneſs againſt External Temptations, by want of Self-Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to diſcern our Evills, by falling into a frame of indifferency about Mortification, that ſo we deſire it faintly.</p>

to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. 4ly. He inſtructs them in the vanity of the Creature, he makes them ſee an end of all perfection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96 But 2ly. He leads them as a Comforter, and Encourager of them in their Journey, and this he does theſe three ways, 1ſt. By witneſſing their Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. 2ly. By helping them to apply the Promiſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. 3ly. By exciting their Hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. A 3d. way how he leads them is by ſtrengthening their Grace, and ſo aſſiſting them in their Duty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 16. A 4th, Way is, By exciting them to their Duty when they are laiſy: And this is done 1ſt. By bringing the Word to their Remembrance. <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.27. 2ly. By bringing their Engagements to God to their remembrance. 3ly. He excites them to their Duty, by making them obſerve the Call of Exciteing Providences. A 5th: Way is, By being a Reprover to them, diſcovering to them their ſinful Inclinations, and ſtrayings out of the way A 6th. Way is, By diſcovering unto them, and giving them a foreſight of the Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks that lye in the way, and of the manifold Temptations they may meet with in it. A 7th. Way is, By determining them in dubious caſes; <hi>Paul</hi> was bound in the Spirit, to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> tho <hi>Agabas</hi> the Prophet told him of his ſuffering there.</p>
               <p>From this, We may make an Uſe of Tryal; We may conclude that we are Gods Children, if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Operations of the Spirit in us. 2ly.

               <p>There is an other Uſe of Inſtruction from the Doctrine, It inſtructs us in the miſery of theſe that are not Gods Children, ſuch are not led by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; For <hi>to be led by his Spirit,</hi> is the alone Priviledge of Sons; and this muſt be a great Miſery to want

               <p>HEre the Apoſtle proves, that thoſe that are led by the Spirit, they are the Sons of God, by two Arguments; One is, that they have received the Spirit of Adoption, The other is, the Spirit of God, and their own Spirit witneſſeth that they are Sons. Obſerve 1ſt. That Gods People receive the Spirit of Bondage, before they receive the Spirit of Adoption. Obſerve 2ly. That the Elect People of God, that receive the Spirit of Bondage, they are allowed of God the Spirit of Adoption, 3ly.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103949:52"/>
Obſerve, That thoſe that have received the Spirit of Adoption, they never again receive the Spirit of Bondage. 4ly. The Spirit of Adoption, where it is, it is a Spirit of Liberty; it is here oppoſed to a Spirit of Bondage. Obſerve 5ly. That thoſe that receive the Spirit of Adoption, their condition is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to thoſe that receive a Spirit of Bondage. 6ly. The Apoſtle ſeems to glance at the frame of Gods People, that lived under the Legal Adminiſtration, differing it from the frame of ſuch as lived under the Adminiſtration of the Goſpel. Obſerve 7ly. That the Spirit of Adoption in Believers, prompts them to Prayer, and theſe Prayers are free and fearleſs, fervent and ſerious; and theſe Two Qualities of Prayer are included in the Word, <hi>Crying:</hi> As alſo theſe Prayers are confident and affectionate; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption makes them cry, <hi>Father.</hi> 8ly. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the Spirit of Adoption is a Benefite common to the Gentiles with the Jews. The Apoſtle, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note this, he expreſſes the homely Compellation of God, both in Hebrew and Greek:</p>
               <p>For the Firſt Obſervation, that the Elect People of God receive the Spirit of Bondage, before they receive the Spirit of Adoption; We ſhall clear it. 1ſt. By ſhewing what is meant by the Spirit of Bondage, and what is meant by the Spirit of Adoption. 2ly. We ſhall prove that God diſpenſes the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the Elect, before he diſpenſes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption. 3ly. We ſhall give the Reaſons of this Diſpenſation. And 4ly. Give the Uſes of the Point.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, by the <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> is meant, that Frame of Soul, wrought in them by Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103949:52"/>
preparing them for the ſtate of Converſion, ſpringing from a ſight of their ſtate of Bondage, while they are in an ſtate of Nature, convinceing them of their ſtate of ſlavery to Sin and Satan, and ſo bringing them under a full Conviction of their unability to relieve themſelves from that condition; Likeas, this Conviction is attended with a Grief for their former ſins, and a fear of their imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. By the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> is meant that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Soul, wrought in the Elect, becoming the ſtate of Adoption; It is wrought by Gods Spirit, through the application of Goſpel-Promiſes. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it. 1ſt. The reverential awe of God. 2ly. An affection and care to imitate God in his moral Perfections. 3ly. A kindly ſubmiſſion to his Corrections. 4ly. A lively Expectation of the Inheritance of God.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond thing propoſed, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Proof of this, that God diſpenſes to the Elect the Spirit of Bondage, before he diſpenſes to them the Spirit of Adoption, It is clear from the Experience of the Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And from <hi>Pauls</hi> Experience at his Converſion; and from the Experience of the Jaylor.</p>
               <p>For the third Thing, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Reaſons why God thus diſpenſes to his Elect the Spirit of Bondage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit of Adoption, they are theſe. 1ſt. He does this, that he may make the Myſteries of the Goſpel more credible to them; For before a Man be convinced of his Sin and Miſery, The Myſtery of Chriſts Croſs ſeems but a Fable; to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Jew Chriſts Croſs is but a ſtumbling Block, and to the unconvinced Greek it ſeems fooliſhneſs:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103949:53"/>
but to the convinced and called Man, it is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the Power of God. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2ly. He does this, to diſengage their Affections from ſin; Our hearts through long cuſtom acquire a great lyking to a courſe of ſinning, and untill our Spirits ſmart for our ſins by grief and fear, we cannot fall in a diſlike with them. 3ly. He does this, that thereby he may bring us to quite our own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and accept of Chriſt; For Pride, Self-love, and Blindneſs of Mind do all concurr to make us tenacious of our own Righteouſneſs, before the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit work this Work in us. A 4th. Is, he diſpenſes this, to make his Elect willing to ſubject themſelves to the Divine Law, as a Rule of Life; for when they are made by the Spirit of Conviction to ſmart for ſin, no terms of their freedom from ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, ſeems hard to them. A 5th. Reaſon he thus diſpenſes, is that he may bring his own to have an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> high Eſteem of Chriſt. to reckon all things but as dung and droſs, in compariſon of the Son of God. A 6th. is, he does it, that he may make the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Chriſts Croſs ſeem light to them.</p>
               <p>For the 4th. Thing propoſed, the Uſes of the Point, The Firſt is, an Uſe of Tryal; hereby ye may try if ye have had the Spirit of Bondage or no; if the Myſtery of Chriſts Croſs be credible; If ſin appear an hateful thing to you; If readily ye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſts offered Righteouſneſs; If willingly ye ſubject your ſelves to the Divine Law, as a Rule of Life; If ye prefer Chriſt to all things in your Eſteem; If ye eſteem the burthen of Chriſts Croſs light. Then ye have received the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:103949:53"/>2d. Sort of Uſes, are Uſes of Inſtruction, It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us in the Cauſe, why ſo many Men ſee ſo little of the Moral Ill of Sin; the Cauſe is, they have not received the Spirit of Bondage. 2ly. Since the Spirit of Bondage goes before the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may ſoon ſee, that if the Spirit of Bondage be a rare thing in the World, the Work of Converſion is as rare. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y. We may be inſtructed, that the Hearts of the Elect are very ſtupid under ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that a mans Convict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on of his ſin and miſery muſt be brought about by the mighty Power of the Spirit of Bondage.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes of the ſtupidity under ſin before this Work of the Spirit of Bondage are, 1ſt. A feared Conſcience, through cuſtomary ſinning. A 2d. Is Impunity, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.3. A 3d. is Proſperity in ſin, <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am become rich, there is no iniquity in me.</hi> A 4th. Cauſe is the flattery of Miniſters and Neighbours. A 5th. Cauſe is leaning to formal Services.</p>
               <p>There is a 3d. Uſe of Exhortation to Miniſters, to preach the Law; to prepare People for receiving of the Goſpel, becauſe it is the moral Mean, whereby this Work is wrought. A 2d. Uſe is, to all the Members of the Viſible Kirk, as they would deſire this neceſſary preparatory Work to be wrought in them, ſo they would conſider the Spirituality and Perfection of the Law, and examine their Life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Obſervation, <hi>Viz.</hi> That God allowes the Spirit of Adoption to theſe that have received the Spirit of Bondage; He gives them this Frame, to evidence the Reality of the Grant of Adoption;

In a word, Faith hath its fulleſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Prayer; where the ſpirit of freedom is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is Believing the acceptance of our Prayers, the prevalency of our Prayers, and the fulleſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the promiſes that are in our view. 4ly.

God Commands to endeavour to attain it. 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.11, 12. 2ly. The Saints have attained it before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Laſt.</hi> Ye ſee the experience of <hi>David</hi> frequently in the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> 3ly.

Ground is the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of Aſſurance to Gods People; Without Aſſurance they cannot win to the Love of God, which is a neceſſary Principle for Goſpel-Obedience; without it we cannot r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Without this we cannot be cheerful in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, We cannot rejoice and work Righteouſneſs. As alſo, without Aſſurance they cannot rejoice in the hope of the Glory of God; Likeas, it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, That Gods promiſes into his People are made for that end, that they may be applyed, and without this Aſſurance, Believers can have no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to apply theſe Promſes.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtaſie of Temporary Believers ſpeaks nothing againſt this Aſſurance, Becauſe true Believers have Attainments, that Temporary Believers are wholly Strangers to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. And albeit the Holy Ghoſt does diſpenſe Threatnings in the word, againſt Apoſtates, Gods method in that, militates nothing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103949:57"/>
againſt Aſſurance: And that firſt, becauſe theſe Threatnings are given out indefinitly againſt the whole Members of the Viſible Church, amongſt whom there are many Hypocrites. And 2ly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of theſe Threatnings, to beget in the Heart of true Believers, a Cautelous Fear, and abſtaining from Sins againſt Light, which ſins in their own nature have a Tendency to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie.</p>
               <p>Uſe of this ſerves, To reprove the Error of the Roman Church, which maintains, that true Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can attain to no more then a conjectural Opinion anent their ſonſhip. 2ly. It reproves the Carnal Profeſſors of the Viſible Church, who, becauſe of their being ſtrangers to the Operations of the Spirit in the Hearts of true Believers, look upon Aſſurance as an unattainable thing.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Obſervation, The way to win to this Aſſurance, it is ſet down in the Text, and it is by getting a two fold Teſtimony for our Sonſhip; The one from the Spirit, and the other from our Conſcience.</p>
               <p>The Spirit Teſtifies to our Sonſhip. 1ſt. By giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an External Revelation in the Scriptures, that penitent Believers are the Sons of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. 2ly. The Spirit concurrs with this Teſtimony, by il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating the Mind and Underſtanding, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading it of the truth of this External Revelation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. 3ly. The Spirit concurrs to this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, by being an evidence of our Sonſhip, by reaſon of his Gracious ſanctifying preſence in us: Therefore the Scripture calls him the Earneſt of our Inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1: 13, and Gods Seal on us <hi>Eph:</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:103949:58"/>
4.30, 4ly. The Spirit teſtifies our Sonſhip by giving us this Internal Objective Revelation. <hi>viz.</hi> That we are Sons, and that we have theſe true Graces in us, that are the true Marks of our Adopted ſtate; and albeit we cannot diſcern a true difference between a ſuggeſtion of the Spirit of God injecting this thought in us, <hi>That we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the Church, who hath all the Scripture-marks of an Adopted ſtate; neither is this internal Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Sonſhip to a particular Believer, a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of a new Article of Faith, not contained in the Scriptures, added to the Creed of other Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, obliedging them to believe the ſame; it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Revelation of a Truth, conſonant to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, made to a particular Believer to his comfort; And if it be ſaid, the aſſerting of ſuch an Revelation leaves men at great uncertainty, becauſe they may take Satans Suggeſtion for the Teſtimony of the Spirit. It is Anſwered, The Teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is attended with the Teſtimony of Conſcience, concluding upon rational Grounds their Sonſhip, he is ſaid here to be a Co-witneſs with our Spirits. 2ly. Where it is, it brings with it a diſpoſition and promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for Prayer: It is the Teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption, whereby we Cry <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> 3ly. It diſpoſes the Soul for Holineſs, it is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of Promiſe, that gives this Teſtimony, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>There are theſe Three or Four Ways, whereby we may win to this Spirits Teſtimony. As. 1ſt. By exact walking, God gives it as a Reward to his Obedient Children, 2ly. By being of a Goſpel-frame of Spirit, he is the holy Spirit of Promiſe, and we receive the Spirit as well in his comforting Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as in his Sanctifying Vertue, by improving the Goſpel; We receive the Spirit by the hearing of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. That is by the acceptance and improving of the Object of Faith, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103949:59"/>
of the Goſpel. A 3d. Way we receive the Spirit, is to be devout, much given to Prayer, the Spirit of Adoption prompting us to pray, is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this Teſtimony, as we ſee by thir two Verſes joined together A 4th. Way to win at it, is Labour for the conſtant witneſſing of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, teſtifying to our Son ſhip, and this is win at by ſtudying ſingleneſs and ſincerity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. See <hi>Job<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Experience, 2ly. We would labour for the grouth of Grace, for when Grace is growen, it is better ſeen than when it is in a mean meaſure. 3ly. We would labour to have all the Graces of the Spirit; for our ſhortcoming in ſome, makes us jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous we want all. 4ly. When God calls us to ſelf-denying Acts of Obedience, we would readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Gods Call; For if God take ſelf-denying Acts of Obedience for Evidences of the Truth of Grace, a mans own Conſcience may ſafely take them for a ſure Evidence of the ſame, for God ſays, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.

They participate of the ſame Spirit with him, they that have not the Spirit of Chriſt, are none of his: that ſame Spiritual Life that he has, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them; becauſe he lives, they live, <hi>John</hi> 14. And as the living Father ſent him, and he lives by the Father, ſo they that eat him ſhall live by him, <hi>John</hi> 6.57. The Glory of their Body is of the ſame kind with his, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>last.</hi> That ſame Love that the Father hath to him, vents it ſelf in ſuitable Expreſſions towards them, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>last.</hi> They are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103949:61"/>
admitted to the ſame glorious Place with him, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. That ſame light of Glory, whereby they ſee him as he is, brings them to a conformity with him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. The Reaſon of this is, their Adoption, which calls for this Participation of Glory; if Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then Co-heirs with Chriſt, and this Adoption is granted to give them a Title to this Inheritance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. There muſt be conformity betwixt the Head and the Members, but Chriſt muſt have the Preéminence, in reſpect of Degrees, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. He is the Firſt born amongſt many Brethren.</p>
               <p>This ſpeaks the great Love of the Redeemer, that is content to communicate his Inheritance with us, 2ly. It calls on Believers to make their Right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, to this excellent Inheritance. 3ly. It exhorts Believers to be content with their ſuffering Lot, ſeing they are to ſhare in his Glory. 4ly. It exhorts them to imitate him in his Obedience: it was univerſal, he did always what pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: it was conſcientious, out of reſpect to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Command. As the Father gave him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, even ſo he did, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>last.</hi> It was ſingle, done with reſpect to the Fathers Glory; he glorified his Father on Earth, he ſought not his own Glory, but the Glory of him that ſent him; It was a ſelf-denying Obedience, he humbled himſelf and became obedient to death.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 4ly. Chriſt behooved to ſuffer before he was glorified, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. Chriſt behooved to ſuffer, and ſo to enter into his Glory; the Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he behooved to ſatisfie Juſtice fully, as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of his People, before Juſtice could admit him into the Poſſeſſion of his Glory. 2ly. He behooved
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103949:61"/>
to go through the Courſe of his Obedience, before the poſſeſſion of his Reward. 3ly. The Father gives a full inſtance of the conſiſtence of his Love with a ſuffering Lot, 4ly. By this, the Father would make a diſcovery, what ſhould be the courſe of his Providence, towards his Adopted Children, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould be brought, through, many ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to the poſſeſſion of their Glory.</p>
               <p>And this tells us 1st, That we ſhould not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the ſufferings of Gods People, as tho that Lot ſignified Gods want of Love to them. or the want of a purpoſe to Glorifie them; 2ly. It reproves the Diſcontentment of Gods Children with their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lot; It is an arrogant preſumption in them, to expect that God will uſe more tenderneſs in his dealing towards them, then he hath uſed towards his own only begotten Son. 3ly. It may contribute towards the ſtrengthening the Faith of the Saints in their Extremity of Sufferings, ſeing Chriſts Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did not marr his Glory, they may expect that their Sufferings will not marr theirs. 4ly.

               <p>THE Apoſtle, in the former Verſes, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged Chriſtians to ſuffer for Chriſt, from theſe two Grounds: The one is, That their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103949:63"/>
Lot is, the way appointed by God to bring them to Glory; And the other is, That Chriſts Suffering Lot, was the way that he came to the Poſſeſſion of his Glory: He, in this Verſe encourages them to ſuffer for Chriſt; from this Ground, that there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, betwixt their Sufferings and their Glory; That there is much more ſatisfying good in their Glory, nor there is diſcouraging evil in their Croſs. This is clear; if ye conſider, That tho their Affliction cauſes Grief, yet their Glory hath in it, not only the removal of the occaſion of their Grief, but it affords them matter of Exuberant Joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, <hi>laſt</hi> 2ly. Their Afflictions do only afflict their outward Man, and their inward Man is Afflicted, by way of ſympathy; But Glory intimately poſſeſſes the Soul. 3ly. There is no Chriſtian that hath all Afflictions, but the Glorifyed Saint wants no comfort that is ſuitable to, or can gratifie the new Nature. 4ly. The Croſſed Chriſtian hath an mixture of Comfort with his Croſs, both Temporal and Spiritual, but the Glorified Saint, his Comforts are not mixed with grief, or occaſions thereof: no Death, no Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, no Crying in Heaven. 5ly. The Number of the Comforting Ingredients, that are in the Lot of the Glorified Saint, exceeds far the Number of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Ingredients, that is in the ſufferings of the Chriſtian, while he is in his militant ſtate; none can reckon up the particular good things that are in the Glorified ſtate; Comforts ſpringing from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, with Angels and Saints, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſpringing from the ſanctity of the Soul, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibility of the Body; Comforts ſpringing from Reflections on their confirmed ſtate, all theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103949:63"/>
6ly. The Evil of the ſuffering of the Saints, is but Temporary, they end with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life, as the Text ſays, <hi>but the Glory to come is Eternal.</hi>

Of Inſtruction, To let us ſee, that the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Sufferings of the Saints, are not condignally Meritorious of Eternal Life; For 1ſt, God can be a Debitor to none, the Creature owes it ſelf and all it hath to him. 2ly. The ſuffering Saint receives more Spiritual and Eternal Good from God, even in this Life, then can ſufficiently compenſe any Evil that is in their Suffering Lot. 3ly. The ſufferings of the Saints are Chaſtiſements for their Sins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. Therefore they cannot be Meritorious. 4ly. The Voluntary Sufferings of the Saints have Moral defects attending on them, they ſpring not from that degree of Love and Zeal that becomes, they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Unbelief and Impatience.</p>
               <p>This ſerves for the Humiliation of ſufferers for Chriſt, and may be uſeful to refute the Popiſh Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion anent the merit of Martyrs.</p>

That the Creature ſhall attain its ancient perfection as an attendant of that Glory, And he confirms the certainty of this Glory, from this, that the Creation will never be brought to its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vigour and Beauty, untill this Glory come, And the Creation muſt be brought to that Vigour; For <hi>nihil violentum eſt durabile:</hi> He propoſeth in the 19 Verſe (ſpeaking figura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ively) That the Creature is a patern for our Imitation, caſting us a Copy for Patience and Hope under our Croſſes; And he lays down in the 20 Verſe the Condition of the Creature, that it hath need of this Metaphorical Patience and Hope, becauſe it was made ſubject to Vanity. 2ly. He lays down the Ground of the Creatures Hope. 1ſt. Becauſe God ſubjected the ſame to Vanity in Hope, that is, he never deſigned, when he impoſed the Vanity on the Creature, to perpetuate the ſame. The 2d. Ground of the Creatures Hope is, that their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103949:65"/>
relief neceſſarly follows the Liberty of the Sons of God, becauſe Vanity was impoſed on the Creature for the Sin of Man, therefore Vanity muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moved totally from the Creature, when the Sin of Man is totally taken away; the Creature it ſelf muſt be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the Glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>In ſpeaking to theſe Verſes, I ſhall clear firſt, what is meant by the Creature. 2ly. What is meant by the Creatures ſubjection to Vanity. 3ly. How it is not willingly ſubject. 4ly. How the Creature does expect and wait patiently for its relief; And laſtly come to ſpeak practically to thoſe Graces that the Apoſtle would lead Believers to the Exerciſe of, by the ſtirring them up to imitate the Creature. And theſe are 1st. Hope. 2ly. Patience, The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth earneſtly wait for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God; The 3d. Grace that the Creature is propoſed as a Patern to us here, is the Grace of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the will of God. The 20 Verſe ſays, That the Creature is ſubject to Vanity, by reaſon of him, <hi>viz.</hi> God, that ſubjected the ſame in hope. And</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. By the Creature is here meant, the frame of the Univerſe, and Maſs of the Elements, for it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed here from the Godly, who expects Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it is incongruous to ſay, that it is meant of the Wicked, for they neither expect nor deſire future Glory.</p>
               <p>For the 2d thing, The Vanity that the Creature is ſubject to, you may take it up either Relatively or Abſolutely; The Relative Vanity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſiſts in this, that there is nothing in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can ſatisfie Mans deſires, quiet his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103949:65"/>
or put him in a quiet or ſtable condition, free of all Troubles, and enjoying all ſatisfaction; and the Spring of this Vanity, is the Creatures inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. 2ly. The Creatures periſhing Nature and Corruptibility, 3ly. The uncertain Enjoyment of the Creature, we may be taken from it, or it from us. 4ly. The incapacity of the Creature to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly poſſeſt by the Soul.</p>
               <p>Next, ye may conſider the Vanity of the Creature abſolutely, and it ſtands in that degenerate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Creature, from what it was in the ſtate of Innocence. And 1ſt. It ſtands in its Corruptibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Elements are corruptible and changeable, as to their Parts, as witneſs the changes that are made in Fire, Air, Earth and Water. 2ly. It ſtands in the defect of their Primitive Vigour, the Earth is not ſo fruitful as it was in Innocence. 3ly. It ſtands in the Creatures hurtfulneſs to man, and conſidering the noiſome Plants and Herbs brought forth by the Earth, the unwholeſomeneſs of the Air, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Influences of the Heavens. 4ly. It ſtands, in that the Creatures are but Fewel to mens Luſts. 5ly. They are ſubjected to Satan, in part to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his malice againſt Mankind, the Devil raiſed a ſtormy Wind, and deſtroyed <hi>Jobs</hi> Children.</p>
               <p>For the 3d. Thing, by the Creatures not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting it ſelf willingly to Vanity, is mean'd, that this Vanity is againſt the firſt Inſtitution and Order of God in the Creation. And 2ly.

               <p>For the 4th. Thing, that the Creature was made ſubject to Vanity by reaſon of God, the meaning

of it is, That albeit the Creatures have a natural Capacity to be more beautiful and perfect than they are, yet they bear the Vanity that is impoſed on them, by reaſon of that Obediential Subjection they owe to their Creator, every Creature keeping that Condition appointed to them by God.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. By the Creatures expectation of its liberty, is not meaned any proper Hope; but that the Creature has a tendency to its own Perfection, and God having made it perfect, in the ſtate of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, what ever Defects it has acquired ſince the Fall of Man, it cannot be perpetual</p>
               <p>We come now to ſpeak to the 19. <hi>Verſe,</hi> In which ye may obſerve theſe Two Things, <hi>Viz.</hi> 1ſt. The Creatures Hope and Patience, 2ly. The Object of both, that is the Manifeſtation of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 1ſt. That we are called to exerciſe the hope of Heaven, in Imitation of the Creature. Reaſons of it, Are 1st. It engages to Purity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. 2ly. It ſupports under outward Afflictions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.3. 3ly. It ſupports under Deſertions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 4ly. It makes folks thankful for their Mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.14. The Way to come by this Hope, is 1ſt. To live by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. 2ly. To diſcern our Regeneration, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. 3ly. To continue in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Godly, as the unqueſtionable Sign of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. And 4ly. To remember for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Experiences.</p>
               <p>For the Object of the Creatures Hope, it is ſaid to be the manifeſtation of the Sons of God; this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Manifeſtation of the Sons of God, is aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Creature, becauſe they will never attain
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103949:66"/>
to their Primitive Perfection and Beauty, till the Sons of God be Glorifyed, and untill the laſt Day, At which time, or rather the Beginning of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when there ſhall be a Manifeſtation of the Sons of God, It ſhall be manifeſted then how excellent a Dignity it is to be the Sons of God; the outward Viſible Effects of Adoption, are delayed till that day, and therefore the Redemption of the Body is called Adoption in the ſubſequent Verſes; It is true, the adopted receive the Spirit of Adoption, whereby they themſelves may know they are adopted, but that effect is not ſo diſcernible by others. 2ly. At that day it ſhall be manifeſted, who are the Sons of God, the Book of Life will be opened to the view of all, and the Children will have the Sentence of the Judge for their Poſſeſſion of this Inheritance, ſee the Proceſs of Judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 3ly. It will be made manifeſt in that day, what good Works the Children of God have done, God will bring to light the hidden Counſels of the Heart, and ſo every man ſhall have praiſe of God, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4</p>
               <p>This Deſcription of the laſt Day affords us an Uſe of Conſolation, to the Chriſtian that doubts of his Adoption. 2ly. To the Chriſtian contemned by the World. 3ly. To the Chriſtian cenſured by the World for his Hypocriſie. A 2d. Uſe is of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to exhort folks to live ſuitably to this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, ſeing its Manifeſtation is ſo certain.</p>
               <p>From the 20. <hi>Verſe.</hi> Obſerve the Vanity of all this viſible Creation, and its Inſufficiency to make men happy; And therefore Folks, 1ſt. Should not have exceſſive Deſires after it; Our Deſires ſhould not be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103949:67"/>
be content to want what God denyes. 2ly. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves theſe that have big Expectations from the World, like that fool <hi>Luke</hi> 12. who builded his large Barnes: We ſhould not expect full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mind, or quiet of Conſcience from any thing here away. 3ly. It reproves thoſe that are unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in their Enjoyments, who do not uſe the World as though they uſed it not, ſuch who look on their Injoyments as perpetual, and ſuffers their heart ſo to run out after the Worlds Good, that they turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to enjoy God, or the Priviledges of the Goſpel. 4ly. It reproves thoſe that gives way to anxious Care, about obtaining of the Worlds Good, which anxiety makes them with <hi>Martha</hi> neglect the one thing needful, and choaks the Word, and makes it become unfruitful, ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6 5ly. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves theſe that give way to Exceſs of Sorrow, when Providence ſeparates their Enjoyments from them, ſorrow is exceſſive, when it hinders them always to rejoice in God, and when it weakens their health.</p>
               <p>A 2d. Uſe of Exhortation, from the Vanity of the Creature, is, People ſhould be crucified to it; That they may win to this, they ſhould labour 1st. For Mortification of their Luſts. 2ly. They ſhould labour for a lively Faith of a better World 3ly. They ſhould obſerve the frequent Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they meet with from the Worlds Good.</p>
               <p>From the Creatures averſion to this Vanity, It is ſubject to Vanity, <hi>not willingly:</hi> Chriſtians may learn, they are allowed to have a lawful Averſion from the Croſs, which averſion kythes in their Prayers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103949:67"/>
the Croſs, and in uſing all lawful Endeavors for its removing.</p>
               <p>From the Creatures being ſubject to Vanity, by reaſon of Gods impoſing it on them; Chriſtians ſhould learn an entire ſubmiſſion to croſs Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Which ſubmiſſion kythes, 1ſt, In an grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgement of the preſent Mercies of their Lot. 2ly. In a cordial Complyance with their Duty, notwithſtanding of their Croſs. 3ly: In a believing of Gods Promiſes, made to them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of it. 4ly. In a Juſtification of Gods Way towards them, notwithſtanding of the ſame. 5ly. In a refuſing of all unwarrantable Ways for their relief.</p>
               <p>Helps to win at this Submiſſion, Are 1ſt. A full Conviction of their Guilt; a living man ſhould not complain for the puniſhment of his Sins. A 2d. Is the due conſideration of the Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Soveraignty of God. A 3d. Is, the firm belief of Divine Wiſdom, which can extract our profite out of the moſt dark and croſs Providences we can live under, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
               <p>The Text ſays, that he ſubjected the ſame in Hope; To hold out that God did not deſign to perpetuate its Vanity, but had appointed its reſtauration to its primitive Perfection. And this is ſet down here, as an Ground of the Creatures Metaphorical Hope; And from this we may learn, from the Creatures Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to ſtrengthen our Hope by the conſideration of this; That God deſigns not to keep us perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Miſery, but there is a firm Determination in Heaven for our Relief, we may put on the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Faith, and Love, becauſe, as the Apoſtle

They ſhall certainly meet with a glorious Liberty from that Bondage. 3ly. When they meet with that Liberty, the Creature ſhall then, and not till then, be liberate from their Bondage.</p>
               <p>For the 1st. Obſervation, Tho' the Godly be not ſlaves to Satan nor to Sin, yet they are under a ſort of Captivity, for while here away, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Death, and to the frailties of Nature, and to great fears that Death may have its ſting towards them; for though they be free of the ſting of Death, which is the Venome of the Curſe of the Law in it, yet they are not altogether free of the fears of the ſting of Death. 2ly. The Godly, tho they be free of the reigning Power of Luſt, yet they are not free of the ſolicitations of it, <hi>Paul,</hi> complains of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 3ly. Tho' the Godly be not Children of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and Slaves to Satan, yet here-away they are ſubject to many vexing Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from him, and therefore this preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould make us more willing and deſireous to dye, that we may be freed from this ſtate of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. And 2ly. It lets us ſee, that conſidering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that have a view of this Bondage, cannot ſend without Faith.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 2ly. That the Children of God ſhall certainly get this glorious Liberty, becauſe here it is taken for granted, and fully and clearly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Word, and therefore we ſhould als firmly believe it. There are three things that Chriſtians ſhould firmly believe as to this Liberty. As 1ſt. A total freedom from the indwelling Preſence of ſin. 2ly. A total freedom from Satans Temptations. 3ly! A total freedom from Death. I ſhall give the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103949:69"/>
Grounds, that the Chriſtian hath allowed to him, for founding his Faith and Hope, of all theſe three upon.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt; Grounds to found the Faith of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to make him believe and expect the total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of ſin, are theſe, 1ſt. Chriſt deſigned its total removeal by his Death, we cannot think that he can be fruſtrate of his Deſign, ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. 2ly. His Death did merite the crucifixion and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Old Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. 3ly. His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is a Pledge thereof ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. For the Spirit that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, did it to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, and the Believing World, that he could and would raiſe up all his Members perfectly from a Death in Sin. 4ly. The Spirits Preſence begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Work, ſays, he will perfect it. becauſe his great Deſign, when he enters into the Child of God's Heart, is not to make a partial, but a total conformity between him and Chriſt. 5ly. The Priviledge of Juſtification ſays it muſt be, for if all our guilt be pardoned, and our Remiſſion be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, according to the Promiſe of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. Where it is ſaid, that all Iniquity ſhall be forgiven, and none ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Then Corruption muſt be removed: for a loving God, and a loving Mediator will remove ſuch an hurtful Evil from Believers, ſince the ſtate of Juſtification tells, it may he done without refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on his Juſtice. A 6th. Ground of Faith, for the removal of ſin is this, that Baptiſm is the External Seal, confirming the Promiſe, for its to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal removal, and therefore its ſaid, we are buried as to our old Man, with Chriſt, by our Baptiſme <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.</p>

That God would tread Satan under their feet ſhortly. A 2d.

                  </gap>lea was, that we were Enemies to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were but juſt that we ſhould be given up to him, to delude and vex us; But now Chriſt by his Death hath deſtroyed him, that is, he hath enervate the ſtrength of his Plea, by reconcileing us to God, and therefore he is ſaid, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. to ſpoil Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, and to triumph over them on the Croſs, by ſetting at liberty their Captives. A 3d, Ground is, Chriſts Perſonal Victory over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Temptations and Perſecutions which Victory he attained in our Nature, by making uſe of the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and exerciſing the Graces of the Spirit, and by wreſtl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Prayer with the Father, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. He overcame by Faith, Love, Patience, Meekneſs, Submiſſion, and Zeal; and this Victory was given to him, to be a Pledge to him, and his Spiritual Seed that are incorporate in him, of their total Freedom from his ſeduceing and vexing Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. A 4th. Ground is, the ſtrength of Chriſts Spirit, that is ſtronger in Believers, than the Devil that is in the World.</p>

This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is neceſſary for the Saints, that their Affections may be ſet on Heavenly things; That they may be reconciled more to Death, and that they may be more Zealous for further degrees of Mortification: And therefore Covetouſneſs after the good things

of this World marr's this deſire, as alſo Anxiety and Concernment, about the future Events of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence marrs this Deſire, and again the want of the enjoyment of the firſt Fruits of the Spirit marr's it; For when we feel not the ſweetneſs of Communion with God, we cannot have an deſire after an full meaſure of it.</p>
               <p>The beſt way to excite this Deſire, is frequently to reflect on our Miſery through Original and Actual Sin, our Chaſtiſement for our Sins, our trying Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations from God, and our perſecutions from the World. The 2d: mean to excite this Deſire, is the firm Faith of the certainty, of the Excellency, and of the Eternity of the Glory to come; This vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Deſire is of great uſe to the Godly; It makes them Strangers in the World, and ſober in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Worldly Good, and ſober in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from it.</p>
               <p>The next Affection that is aſcribed to the Godly, Relative to Heaven is <hi>waiting:</hi> Importing firſt, Their expecting their Felicity. 2ly. It imports their patience, under the delay of the ſame.</p>

               <p>I add, for the ſtrengthening of Believers Hope, he has appointed the Sacrament of the Communion, for the frequent renewing the Believers Right, to the perſon of the Redeemer, and therefore the eaten Bread is ſaid to be Communion of his Body, as the drinking of the Wine is ſaid, to be the Communion of his Blood, becauſe by Gods appointment, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys a ſure Right to his Humane Nature as Crucified for us, and we know that he ſaith <hi>John</hi> 6.

Heaven is called Adoption, Becauſe, it is an Inheritance ſuiteable to the dignity of the Son's of God, and therefore we ſhould abound in the Work of the Lord, knowing that our Labour will not be in vain in the Lord.</p>

               <p>AS the Apoſtle, in the other Verſes, had comforted the <hi>Romans,</hi> by proving the excellency and certainty of the Future Glory, from the Creatures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after it, and the Believers deſire after it; ſo now he Comforts them under their Croſs, by letting them ſee, that their future Happineſs is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their preſent Miſery: And this he does
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103949:76"/>
by telling them they are ſaved by hope; which he clears by theſe two things. 1ſt. That the object of hope is neither preſenty enjoyed, nor ſenſibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Hope is not ſeen,</hi> that is, the object of Hope is not ſeen. 2ly. He clears it by deſcribing the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of hope, he ſays, it is a Patient expecting of a diſtant good; The 24 Verſe holds out the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſneſs of it; The other two Verſes hold out the nature of the Object and affection of hope,</p>
               <p>When it is ſaid, we are ſaved by hope, As it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that our felicity is at a diſtance, ſo it ſays that all the good that we can get of that diſtant felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the preſent time, is obtained by hopeing for it; and therefore if we cannot hope for it, we loſs all the Encouragement we have by it.</p>
               <p>Next, When the Text ſays, we are ſaved by Hope, it imports, that if we can hope for Heaven, it will ſave us from the Ill of the Croſs, for here he is labouring to comfort croſſed Chriſtians; it will ſave, for it keeps the Croſs from being cruſhing, becauſe it expells the apprehenſions of Wrath in a Croſs. 2ly. It keeps the Croſs from being enſnaring, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drive us from our Duty through fear, for where this Hope is, it lets us ſee, that we have more gain by our duty nor loſs by it.</p>
               <p>Uſe of this is to exhort us to hope. For 1st. This Hope is ſuitable to the Revelation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which hath brought to the Church a clearer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Heaven, than was brought under the Law. 2ly. It is ſuitable to Gods Name, which he hath taken under the Goſpel, he is called the God of Hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. 3ly. It is ſuitable to Gods Works, in raiſing Chriſt from the Dead, and communicating
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103949:77"/>

               <p>HEre the Apoſtle gives us an other Ground of Comfort under the Croſs, <hi>viz,</hi> That tho the Saints be compaſſed with Infirmities; yet the Spirit ſupports them under thoſe, and doth (as the word
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103949:80"/>
in the firſt Language imports join himſelf with them in bearing of their Burthen.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, The Saints under Croſſes have Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both Moral and Phyſical: Moral Infirmities, ſuch as Diſcontent, as <hi>Jonah</hi> had; Impatience, which <hi>Job</hi> had a ſhare of; Unbelief with <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 77, Partial Atheiſm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73, Pride with <hi>Hezekiah Iſai.</hi> 39. Paſſionate revenge with <hi>David</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Nabal,</hi> Selfiſhneſs with thoſe People that lived in the days of <hi>Hagai,</hi> who Builded their own houſes and forgot to Build the houſe of God; weariedneſs in Labour, and toil in Duty, with <hi>Moſes</hi> who wearied in the toil and labour of the Government of the People; Partial Hypocriſie with <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 1, 2ly. They are ſubject to Phyſical Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, becauſe they meet with Challenges for their old and new Sins, under the Croſſes, which makes them apprehend their Croſſes to be wrathful, and makes them fear their continueing and grouth; In the 3d, place, They are ſubject to Bodily Frailty, and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Death, which certainly contributes to make the Croſs the more uneaſy.</p>
               <p>The Saints ſubjection to theſe manifold Moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a motive to humble them, and to make them watchful, leſt they break out into groſs Transgreſſions by them: For when I ſay the Saints are ſubject to thoſe Infirmities, my meaning is not, that the tract of their life is ſpent in outward Acts, ſignifying the Predominancy of theſe ills in their heart, for the Godly Man does no Iniquity in that ſenſe, See <hi>Pſal,</hi> 119, 2, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.8. But when I ſay they are ſubjſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct to Infirmities, my meaning is, That Corruption tho it be broken in its Power in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103949:80"/>
yet it is partially Acting with their Graces.</p>
               <p>There is another Uſe, And that is, Since the Saints are ſubject to phyſical Throuble, then they need not wonder, that beſides the Perſecution they ſuſtained for the Teſtimony of the Truth, they are lyable to manifold perſonal troubles, ſince the Saints have been tryed with thoſe before them.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 2ly. That the Spirit ſupports the Saints under their Infirmities; he keeps them from deſpair under their moſt violent Temptations. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73, 23. and 73.3. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.13. The Spirit ſupports the Saints by giving them a proſpect of Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. this cures their impatience and diſcontent. 2ly. He ſupports them by diſcovering the Truth of their Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. this was the way he ſupported <hi>Job.</hi> 2ly. He ſupports them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Temptations to Sin, by diſcovering the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Sin to them, this was it, whereby he keeped <hi>David</hi> from yeilding to the Temptations of fretting againſt the proſperity of the Wicked; the Spirit did convince him, that if he gave way to that Temptation, it were upon the matter an denying of the neceſſity and advantage of Piety, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73, 17. 4ly. The Spirit keeps a man from ſinning under the Croſs, by fixing a man in ſuch thoughts as may beſt preſerve him from theſe ſins he is preſently tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; and therefore when the Spirit would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>David</hi> from deſpair, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. He fixes his thoughts on the former kindneſſes of God towards him: He called to mind the former days. 5ly. He ſupports the Saints by ſtrengthening the habits of Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. and this makes their Gracious Work more eaſy. 6ly. He applys the promiſes to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103949:81"/>
them, and ſo makes them cheerful in their duty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of their Infirmities. 7ly. He gives them acceſs to God in Prayer, as the Text after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tells us.</p>

That common Courage will not bear us through our Infirmities. 2ly, This refutes the Worlds Atheiſm, becauſe it evinceth that there is an efficacy in the Spirit, that ſupports the Saints under their Infirmities. 3ly. It bids Croſſed Chriſtians under their Infirmities be careful to obtain and entertain the Spirits preſence, by ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Legality, Worldlyneſs and Senſuality, greiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit, Repelling his motions, and quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; we ſhould Pray much to God for the Spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 17, 18. We ſhould labour to attain the Spirits preſence by the uſe of Ordinances: next we ſhould be careful to refer our through-bearing to the Spirit, and not to our ſelves.</p>

               <p>Obſerve 1ſt, That Prayer is a very ſuitable Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to Croſſed Chriſtians. 2ly. We are very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what to Pray for, or how to Pray. 3ly. This indiſpoſition for Prayer is removed by the Spirit
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103949:81"/>
And 4ly. Where the Spirit removes indiſpoſition, he helps the Chriſtian with groanings unutterable.</p>
               <p>For the 1st. Prayer is neceſſar for croſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe it is the Way to obtain Heavenly Wiſdom, to underſtand the meaning of Providence. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5. 2ly. Prayer is the Way to obtain ſtrength to bear the Croſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. In the day I cryed to thee, thou ſtrengthned me with ſtrength in the Soul. 3ly. Prayer quiets the Mind, ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. ſee <hi>Hannas</hi> caſe. 4ly. It is the Way to obtain Delivery, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. Call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee. 5ly. Becauſe under Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we are ready to be tempted by the Devil, we had need to be armed with the Spiritual Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Prayer is the Exerciſe, whereby we put on that Armour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this is, if we be afflicted, we ſhould pray, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. Motives to engage us to this Exerciſe, Are 1st. God ſends the Croſs upon us, and deſigns and expects we ſhould pray under it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. <hi>laſt.</hi> 2d. Motive is, Satan takes advantage of our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Lot, to tempt us; therefore we have need to go to God, to get ſtrength to reſiſt him. 3d. Motive is, our external Lot may occaſion a fit Diſpoſition for Prayer to us, a croſſing condition and Lot diſpoſes us to be humble, to be ſerious and penitent. 4ly. God offers us by our Croſſes, an opportunity to have an freſh Experience of his ſeaſonable Help, which may prove afterwards a Confirmation to our Faith, Uſe, be not tempted by the Devil to forbear Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er under your Croſs, for that gratifies Satan, and makes you naked and expoſed to his Temptations, let neither your former guilt, nor preſent indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103949:82"/>
hinder you to go about this Duty: When <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was under the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity, <hi>Philip</hi> even in that caſe exhorts him to pray, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, that we are very ready under Croſſes, to miſcarry in the matter of our Prayers, we know not what to pray for as we ought, ſays the Text, The Reaſons are, 1st. Our Ignorance of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns under the Croſs, and ſo we are ignorant how to comply with theſe; when God croſſes a Saint, he intends to challenge them for ſin, to excite them to their duty, to try their Grace, to give them new Experience of his Support: But the confuſion of our Mind indiſpoſes us to take up theſe Deſigns, and ſo we are unfit to pour out our Deſires to God. to comply with theſe Deſigns. A 2d. Cauſe is, our Ignorance of Gods Promiſes in his Word, which Promiſes ſhould regulate our Deſires; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are the Foundation of our Prayers, we ſhould pray for nothing but what is promiſed. A 3d. Cauſe of our Miſtake, is our ignorance of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wants, the knowledge of which affords us fit Matter for Prayer, A 4th. Cauſe is, our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and Pride of Heart under Croſſes, which prompts us more to ſeek Delivery from the Croſs, than to obtain Edification by it. A 5th. Cauſe is. our inordinate Affections to predominant Ills, which prompts us to be remiſs in our Deſires after morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace, and to entertain ſinful Intentions to improve the condition we are in, to the gratifying of theſe Luſts. A 6th. Cauſe is, Earthlyminded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſpoſeing us to prefer earthly Things to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, contrary to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:103949:82"/>Uſe of this is, 1ſt. We ſhould not be proud of our Prayers to God under Croſſes, or reckon with the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. That God is oblidged to hear us for them, ſeing we are ſo ſubject to miſtake in the Matter of our Prayers. 2ly. We ſhould not be angry at God, for not giving Returns to our Prayers, ſeing we are ſo ſubject to miſtake in the Matter of our Prayers: and we ſhould obſerve the Divine Providence, anſwering more our Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than irregular Deſires. A 3d. Uſe is, Since we are ſo ſubject to miſtake in this matter, we ſhould be much given to Meditation, and due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Heart, to conſider what is fit for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we raſhly bring forth our Deſires before God. A 4th. Uſe of Exhortation is, we ſhould labour to have fit and proper Matter for our Prayers to God, under our Croſſes, and for that effect, we ſhould i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the Saints, to pray for what they prayed for under the Croſs; we find them praying for Support under Tryals, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. We find them praying for the pardon of their ſin, for Light to know their Way, and for the Bleſſing of the Croſs. 2ly. We would labour to have Proſpect of the Deſigns of Providence, that the Matter of our Prayers may be in complyance with theſe Deſigns. 3ly. We would labour for a ſingle Intention after Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and our Spiritual Good, that our chief Deſires may run after the Communication of Gods Grace, to promote thoſe Ends</p>
               <p>Obſerve, we are not only ready to miſcarry in the Matter of our Prayers, but alſo in the Manner of our Prayers, the Text ſays, we are ignorant not only what to pray for, but how to pray becomingly,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103949:83"/>
as the Word may be tranſlated; I ſhall clear the Truth of this, by inſtanceing the many miſcarriage of People in the Manner of their Prayers And 1st. They may miſtake in the Object of their Worſhip, by preſenting God under ſome external Image, or in their fancy aſcribing ſome likeneſs to him, ſeing he is an inviſible Spirit, and we are forbidden to make any repreſentations of God, either external or internal in our Fancy; for to do this is againſt the Second Command, A 2d. Miſtake we are ready to fall in, is, We look on God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as hardly acceſſible by us, and as one that is not ſo ready to hear us as Chriſt would be, which apprehenſion Chriſt cures, by telling us, that the Father himſelf loveth us, and the Scripture cures it, by making the Fathers Love the Fountain of our Redemption: A 3d. Is, our going immediatly to God, and miskenning of Chriſt; We ſhould come to the Throne of Grace, being encouraged by his Interceſſion, ſpringing from his Sympathy with us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> We ſhould found our expectation of our Mercy upon his Merite, this is to ask in his Name, this is to go in to the Holieſt, by the New and Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Way, by his Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Self-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs obſtructs this. A 4th. Cauſe of our miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is, the want of ſingleneſs in our Intentions, to uſe our Mercy, not as Fewel to our Luſts, but as a Mean to glorify God, therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. We are deſired to draw near to God with a true Heart. A 5th. Cauſe is, our Formality, which makes us judge with the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. That the external Act of praying is obligeing to God, and meritorious with him; whereas, we ſhould lay only the ſtreſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103949:83"/>
our Mercies on Chriſts Merite, and uſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as an appointed Mean for obtaining of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 6ly. Our Stupidity and want of ſenſe of the Neceſſity and Excellency of Spiritual Mercies, makes us miſcarry in the Manner of our Prayers; it makes us faint in our deſires, and not fervent in purſueing our neceſſary Good. 7ly. Our peremptorineſs in ſeeking what we would be at without ſubmiſſion, makes us miſcarry; we ſhould be abſolute in our Deſires, but it is for what is abſolutely promiſed; in all other things we ſhould leave God the liberty of his diſpoſal. 8ly. Our unbelief makes us miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Manner of our praying, <hi>James</hi> tells us, that what we ask, we ſhould ask in Faith, <hi>James</hi> 1.3. 9ly. Preſumption is the cauſe of our miſcarriage, when we do not found our Prayers upon Promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Remember thy Word to thy Servant, upon which thou hast cauſed me to hope.</hi> A 10th. Cauſe is ſelfiſhneſs, and the want of a publick Spirit, when we pray for our ſelves, and neglect the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 17. We ſhould pray for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem Pſal.</hi> 122. 11ly. We miſcarry, when we neglect the Confeſſion of Sin, and Thankſgiving to God for Mercy, ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. Confeſſion is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſtrengthning of Faith, Thankſgiving makes way for the obtaining of further Mercy. And 12ly. Want of an firm Belief of the Power and Efficacy of Prayer, which makes us be unfrequent in it, when we get not our will at the firſt, when we are called to pray always, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. and to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Uſe is, ſince we are ſo ready to miſcarry in the manner of our praying, we ſhould be far from
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103949:84"/>
thinking, that our Acts of Devotion are meritorious before God, and we ſhould reckon, that when God hears any Prayers we put up to him, he evidences his rich Grace, in overlooking our Infirmities that ſtick to our Prayers.</p>
               <p>Obſerve The Spirit helps us to pray aright, 1ſt. Becauſe it is his inward Light, that diſcovers what is expedient for our Good, he ſets us on a right Choice, he makes us prefer Spiritual Mercies to Temporal Mercies, he makes us prefer the Mercy of the Croſs, to our Deliverance from it, he makes us prefer the Spiritual Good of our Neighbours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our own Temporal Good, he gives our heart a right ſett as to its choice. 2ly. The Spirit gives us the cleareſt view of Gods Attributes, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us, and ſo preſents the Object of Prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 3ly. The Spirit glorifies Chriſt, and enclines the Soul to give him his due, and makes the Soul acknowledge his Merit, as the ground of our expectation of Mercy, and makes the Soul look on his Interceſſion, as the appointed Mean to obtain the ſame, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. <hi>John</hi> 16.14. 4ly. The Spirit is a Spirit of Promiſe, and leads the Soul to the Promiſes of God in the Word, which are the Foundation of our Expectations of Mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.16. <hi>John</hi> 14.26. 5ly. The Spirit encreaſes a great Eſteem of Spiritual Mercies in the Hearts of the Godly, and makes them purſue with fervent Deſires, the obtaining of the ſame, <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. That thoſe that are after the Spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit. 6ly. The Spirit diſcovers a mans Evils to him, and ſo makes the Creature humble in its Addreſſes to God, he is a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103949:84"/>
convinceing Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. 7ly. The Spirit is a Spirit of Faith, and therefore he keeps up the heart, in believing under the ſenſe of Guilt, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. And this Faith in Prayer makes way for returns to it; unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief being a great Reſtraint to God's working for us.</p>
               <p>When it is ſaid, the Spirit interceeds for us, the meaning it, that our Interceſſion flows from his Influence; This Interceſſion is not like Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, for he interceeds for us, when we make no interceſſion for our ſelves, as witneſs, his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for <hi>Peter</hi> when he fell; but the Spirit is ſaid to interceed for us, when he makes us interceed, as it is ſaid in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. That we do not ſpeak but it is the Spirit of the Father that ſpeaketh in us; The Spirit aſſiſts us in Prayer, by cauſeing a fervour in our Deſires, and bringing us into a cordial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Will, he makes us groan, he makes us pray, according to the Will of God.</p>
               <p>This lets us ſee, that we are to depend on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God for his aſſiſtance in Prayer, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we cannot pray aright without him; The darkneſs of our mind as to ſpiritual Things, the diſquiet of our Conſcience, and perverſeneſs of our Will, the diſorder of our Affections, makes it impoſſible for us to pray aright without his help; And therefore in all the Courſe of our Walk, we ſhould be tender of grieving this Spirit, leſt by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, we marr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our Devotions, which are the great Mean of our intercourſe with God.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, That under Croſſes the Saints may be very indiſtinct, as to their Prayers, they have groans
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103949:85"/>
unutterable, that is, they have ſuch Deſires, as that they cannot give an perfect and explicite Account of; The Text ſays plainly, That they know not what to pray for as they ought, their Faith may be up and down in their Prayers, as witneſs <hi>Davids</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the Pſalms, their Petitions may be upon the matter inconſiſtent, and yet they do not know: many a deſire had <hi>Job</hi> to God, that he would take away his life, and yet undoubtedly he had his own deſires for delivery; many a time they are forced to ſiſt in a Petition for help in the General, without condeſcending to particular Requeſts, becauſe they are ignorant what is expedient for them, but all the irregular deſires of the Saints in ſuch a caſe does not come from the Spirit but only the lawful Deſires that are mixed with theſe irregular Deſires, theſe are called, the Senſe and Meaning of the Spirit, which God approves of, in the next Verſe.</p>
               <p>Now, theſe confuſed Prayers of the Saints, they ariſe from various Cauſes; 1st. From dark Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, this was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe: When men know not the Cauſe, why God afflicts, nor the Ends which he intends to bring about by the Affliction, it is no wonder then they be indiſtinct in their Prayers, they know not what to ſeek of God in this Caſe. 2ly. When men are under the Apprehenſions of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent great Trouble, cauſeing a fear that they may be overcome by the Trouble, the Creature is at a ſtand, and knows not what to deſire; even innocent fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Nature, while it is ſeiled upon by theſe great Fears, the Mind is not free at the time, to have the actual uptaking of what is fit to be deſired or expected of God, for the finite Mind is detained
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103949:85"/>
in the Contemplation of the greatneſs of the Trouble that is coming on them, ſee Chriſts Words, <hi>John</hi> 12.27. 3ly. When Corruption is tumultuating in the Heart, and Grace fighting againſt it, the Spirit luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Fleſh, and the Fleſh againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; it is no wonder the Soul be troubled, with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tydes of contrary Deſires. 4ly: While the Soul is troubled with ſad Challenges of Conſcience for ſin, that vexation of mind, cauſed by theſe Challenges, makes the Creature unfit to take up the particular ſtate and condition of their Soul, ſo that they cannot have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Petitions to God about their condition, and therefore <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 38. When he fears Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukeing of him in Wrath, all that he wins to is, <hi>All my deſire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee,</hi> Pſal. 38 9.</p>
               <p>This ſpeaks out, what ſad Condition the Saints may be in ſometimes, when they are under this confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; They would not conclude that they are in an unrenewed ſtate; on the account of this condition, neither would they reckon that all of their Prayers they put up to God in this condition, are refuſed by him, for God obſerves what is regular in their Deſires, and accepts it, tho it be mixed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny irregularities, as the next Verſe tells us, and this is an Evidence of the great Favour and Grace of God to his own; and this tells us, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of Prayer ſprings more from Divine Favour, than from its own abſolute and intrinſick Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Obſerve next, that in the ſad conditions of the Saints, they are called to fervency in Prayer; this is neceſſary, if they would imitate Chriſt in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103949:86"/>
and if they would imitate the Saints Practice, according to the Scriptures. And 3ly. The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Prayer is neceſſary for the prevalency of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as <hi>James</hi> tells us, that the effectual fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Righteous avails much with God; if men would win to fervour in Prayer, they would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be under the fulleſt conviction of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and uſefulneſs of the Mercies prayed for.</p>

                  </gap> Interceſſions are made for the Saints, for their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Eternal Good, whoſe Felicity God intends to bring to a Perfection. A 4th. Cauſe is, that this Interceſſion made by the Spirit, is according to the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103949:86"/>
Will of God, that is, according to his Promiſe, for the Spirit excites no deſire in a Saint for any good but what is promiſed of God. 2ly. Thir deſires are according to the revealed Will of God, which is the Rule of Duty, and agreeable thereto, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires excited by the Spirit are all lawful Deſires. 3ly. Thir Deſires are according to Gods Will, becauſe attended with ſubmiſſion to his diſpoſeing Will.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 1ſt The Deſignation that God gets in the Text, he is called the Searcher of Hearts, and one, that by ſearching, perfectly knowes the Heart; man by Reflections can but know his Heart imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, for the Luſts of his Heart are deceitful, and darkens his mind, that he cannot ſee all the evil that is in his Heart perfectly; and the number and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the evils, that is in the Heart of the beſt marrs the mind of man from taking up the good that is mixt with theſe evils. Next Satan does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know what is in the Heart, he only can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture by the external Converſation and Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Body what is in it, but God has the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of it, he framed it, and therefore knows it. 3ly. The Heart of Man, as to its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, depends on Gods Influences, the Heart of man is in the hand of the Lord, and he turneth it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he will. 3ly. The internal Acts of a Mans Heart and Soul; is regulate by the Divine Law, and the Sum of the Law is to love the Lord with all our Heart, alſe well as to give him external Service, and therefore he being Judge of them, he muſt know them: In a Word, his Immenſity and Omniſcience makes him perfectly know all the Good and al the Evil that is in the Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:103949:87"/>Uſe of this is firſt, to exhort Folks to look well to the Heart, that it be right, for God knows it; we ſhould look to this, that the Heart hate the Ill and love the Good. 2ly.

               <p>Uſe 1st. This lets us ſee the difference betwixt Gods working on Mens Spirits, and Satans work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them; Satan can only perſwade, but God can determine. 2ly. we may ſee the great power of God, in the power of converting Grace; It is compared to the Power that raiſed Chriſt from the Dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. 3ly. It ſays, we need not deſpair of the Converſion of the worſt. 4ly. It ſays, that the Converted may believe that they ſhall perſevere, notwithſtanding of the oppoſition made to their perſeverance; becauſe that ſame powerful Grace that converted them at firſt, can make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere.

That we might with boldneſs employ him in all his Offices, as one we are ſo nearly related to. And 5ly. That there might be acceſs to conform us to his Image, As the Text ſays, that is, to ſhare with him in his priviledges here, and his Glory hereafter. And firſt we ſhare with him in his Natural Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by our Adoption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. 2ly. We ſhare with him in his Juſtification, he was juſtified by his Reſurrection, as our Soverty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 <hi>laſt.</hi> And we are juſtified through him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. He receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit from the Father as Spirit of Life, and we receive that Spirit from him, <hi>Jo·</hi> 14.19. And 6.57.

This ſpeaks out the Fathers Love, that advances us to partake of thir priviledges with Chriſt, and it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us to be content with his Lot in this World, and to imitate his Virtues.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, That Chriſt hath the preheminence, in reſpect of priviledges over all his Bretheren: He is the Natural Son, we are the Adopted Children; he received the Spirit above meaſure, we by meaſure; the Fountain and fulneſs of Life is in him, we have but a ſhare of it; he was juſtified by his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Obedience, we by his; he got acceſs to the Fathers Glorious preſence by vertue of his own

               <p>Obſerve, That Chriſt poſſeſt with thir priviledges evidences himſelf to be Gods firſt born and Heir: what priviledges I have named do teſtify, that he is the Son of God, ſo that after Chriſts Exaltation, to deny hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as thir Priviledges teſtify, that he is the Natural Son of God, ſo they teſtify that he is the Heir of all things; he is called here the Firſt-born.

               <p>OBſerve here, the Apoſtle clearing, That the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, according to purpoſe, or the Predeſtinate Folks, their Afflictions muſt tend to their Good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this Argument, that Calling, Juſtification and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103949:96"/>
Glory are the certain effects of Predeſtination, And therefore God in his Wiſdom muſt order Afflictions, ſo as they muſt have a certain tendency to bring them to Glory at laſt.</p>
               <p>Obſerve here, All the predeſtinate Folks are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually Called, And therefore this ſays firſt, That none will win to Heaven but thoſe that are Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Called, for Calling here goes before Glory, and ſuch as are Predeſtinate to Glory, are Predeſtinate to Calling. 2ly. It ſays that the firſt clear diſcovery of Predeſtination is Calling, A Man cannot know his Election by any other evidence then by Calling. 3ly. It ſays that this is a ſure evidence thereof. 4ly. We ſee that Calling being the effect of Predeſtination, and it being an irrevocable purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. That Calling muſt as to its effect be irreſiſtable. 5ly. We ſee that ſince Calling is the effect of Predeſtination, the Foreknowledge of our Calling cannot be the cauſe of it, and therefore our foreſeen Faith cannot be the cauſe of our Election. And 6ly. Seing we ſee the Apoſtle proving that the Called according to purpoſe, are to be conformed according to Chriſts Image, that is, they are to ſhare of his priviledges and Glory, he proves this I ſay, by that ſure Link that Predeſtination puts between their Calling and Glory, which tells us that all Effectually Called do ſhare of Chriſts Priviledges, and ſhall after ſhare of his Glory.</p>
               <p>The Text ſays, Whom he Calls he Juſtifies, this ſays there are none Juſtified till they be Called, and therefore the Antinomian Errour is reproveable, who ſay the Elect are juſtified from Eternity, Elect <hi>Paul</hi> before Converſion, was a Child of Wrath even as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103949:97"/>
others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. 2ly. This ſays, That preſently upon their being Called they are Juſtified, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Juſtification is not delayed till they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in Good Works to the end of their Life, or elſe how ſhould they rejoice in the hope of the Glory of God while they are in time. 3ly. If the Called Folks be juſtified, then they are in a ſtate of Friendſhip with God, and therefore there is no Wrath in their moſt ſevere Lots. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7. And they may with freedom uſe acceſs to the Throne of Grace. 4ly. If the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led be juſtified, It ſays their Afflictions muſt tend to their Good, becauſe when they know that Sin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, they cannot but be ſure that God will bleſs their Croſſes to them, and not make them a Curſe 5ly. If Called Folks be juſtified, they ſhould have peace in their own Conſcience, they may well be humbled for Sin, they ſhould not have an Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fear of Hell for it. 6ly. If the Called be juſtified, their Obedience ſhould flow more from Love to God then from diſtruſtful fears.</p>
               <p>Now I clear that the Called are juſtified, That is, they are indemnified as to the puniſhment for Sin threatned by the Covenant of Works, and they have an unqueſtionable Title to Life; the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a right to Chriſts Obedience and Suffering; For the Father gives Chriſt to them for Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 30. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. <hi>laſt.</hi> And Chriſt ratifies the Gift of his own Conſent, and ſeals his own gift and the Fathers Gift, by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper. Now that the Called Man is juſtified appears, becauſe the Called have Faith, and the Goſpel-Promulgation ſecures, that all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are juſtified. 2ly. It appears that the Called
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103949:97"/>
Man is juſtified, becauſe God gives him of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and we know that he gives his Spirit to none, but to ſuch to whom he is reconciled. 3ly. The Called Man is juſtified, becauſe he is Juſt, and that upon the account he has a ſure intereſt in a perfect juſtifying Righteouſneſs. It is a juſtifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if ye conſider, 1st. The compleatneſs of his Obedience and Sufferings. 2ly. If ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That that Obedience and Suffering was for us, and not for himſelf. 3ly. If ye conſider, that the Father appointed it to be ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>last.</hi> 4ly. If ye conſider, there were Grounds for this Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts ſibneſs to us, and his conſent it ſhould be ſo. From this we inferr, that the Called, ſince they are juſtified, may bear the Calumnies of the World, and live in the Hope of the ſentential Juſtification of the Judge at the laſt Day, ſeing they are Legally juſtified by Law, and that Law of his own Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, All the juſtified ſhall be glorified, this Glory ſtands as to the Body in its Clarity, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, Spirituality, and Power; As to the Soul, it ſtands in its Light, in its Life, in its Communion with God, and in its Joy and Comfort ſpringing from all theſe. That Light is full and immediate, we ſee no more through a Glaſs darkly, but face to face: It is Eternal, our Sun will no more go down; that Life it is a Life on, from and to God; it is full and abundant, there is a River of Waters of Life in Heaven; it is eternal as to its duration; that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we have with God is immediate, without Ordinances, there is no Temple in the New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Rev.</hi> 22. It is conſtant without interruption,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103949:98"/>
we are made Pillars of the Temple of God, <hi>Rev</hi> 7: 10. The Joys that follow thereon, are full an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſatisfying, conſtant and laſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>last.</hi> Now this Glory, all the Juſtified ſhall poſſeſs it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the linking of Calling Juſtification, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Glory together, and they are linked together by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Predeſtination, Chriſts Merite, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Application. 2ly. It is ſure by the nature of Juſtification, it being a Right to Life, alſe well as Immunity from Wrath. 3ly. It appears from San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which is a Preparation for Glory, and a Pledge of it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. It appears from their Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. It appears from this, that the Goſpel is the Rule of Judgement; the Word that Chriſt ſpeaks, ſhall judge them at the laſt Day, <hi>John</hi> 12. It appears from the neceſſary Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in the Judge. And Laſtly, it appears from the Truth of God, and the Truth of his Promiſe.</p>
               <p>From this we infer, that the Juſtified do ſhare of Chriſt's Priviledges here, ſuch as acceſs to God, ſeing they are to ſhare of his Glory hereafter, and partial Conformity with Chriſt in this World ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures our total Conformity with him in Glory in the other. 2ly. This ſays that the juſtified are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, ſeing Sanctification muſt go before Glory, and it is Glory begun. 2ly. It ſays that the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied are ſure of perſeverance, ſeing they that endure to the end muſt be ſaved, and none but they. 4ly: That ſince Glory is connected with Juſtification, we ſhould hope for Heaven, wait for Heaven, and work out our Salvation with fear and trembling. 5ly. We ſhould ſubmit to the Croſs, ſeing this condition
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103949:98"/>
is certainly abiding us. 6ly. We ſhould never be jealous that the Croſs will tend to our prejudice, but believe it will tend to our profit, ſeing God deſigns to bring us to Glory, for Grace muſt reign through Righteouſneſs into eternal Life. And 7ly. Ye would try your ſtate to Juſtification, as ye would try your right to Glory.</p>

It was the Fathers Juſtice did purſue him; And that conſideration is comfortable to us, and ſignificative of the Fathers Love, that Juſtice did forbear to puniſh us, and did inſiſt in the purſuit of him, 2ly.

Since the Father delivered him to Death out of Love to us for our Salvation, there is no cauſe to ſtumble at this Providence, or ſtrengthen Atheiſm thereby; If Gods deſigns in this Providence, and his Hand be overlooked, it ſeems a ſtrange thing for ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be given up to the will of Men, but if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Providence be throughly conſidered, there needs none ſtumble at it. 4ly. if Chriſts Sufferings were ordered by the Fathers Providence, then all the Sufferings of his People muſt be ordered by the ſame providence. 5ly, We ſee in this Providence Gods Hand Chriſts Hand, and the Hand of the Wicked Inſtruments: God was Juſt, becauſe he was imputatively Guilty; Chriſt kythed his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſubmitting to all that was inflicted on him, tho' he did not actively take away his own Life, but the Inſtruments were Wicked, becauſe they did it to ſatisfy their Malice.</p>

Chriſts Death may well be a ground of freedom from this fear becauſe 1st. It was the Puniſhment threatned in the Covenant of Works againſt our ſin, and he never having been a tranſgreſſor of that Covenant, (for he never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally tranſgreſſed it,) neither could <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion be imputed to him, becauſe he ſprang not from him by the way of natural Generation, I ſay, he being thus Innocent, his Death behooved to be a dying in our ſtead. 2ly. This Death may free us of this fear, becauſe he endured the Spiritual Death, threatned in the Old Covenant, he took it off us, and laid it on himſelf; he ſuffered in his Soul alſo well as in his Body, as Witneſſeth the Hiſtory of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which ſhews us that his Father withdrew his Comforts from him, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And likewiſe it tells us, his Soul was ſubjected to Trouble, to Soul-Grief, Fear and Agony. 2ly, His Reſurrection is a good Ground to ſecure us againſt this Fear, becauſe it is the Fathers abſolution of him as our Soverty. 3ly.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Since this is caſeable, Gods People would be comforted under this Providence, by theſe Grounds 1ſt. It is an honour, that they are to co-witneſs with Chriſt to the Truth. 2ly. Truth will receive no Damnage by this, it's more cleared and confirmed; the Church receives no damnage by it, it's more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and enlarged; the Godly receive no damnage by it, for they are born up, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.14, 15. The Lord takes this way, for to chaſtiſe their ſin, and that tends in the hinderend for their honour, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103949:111"/>
he lets them not want comfort, and by this they have a great evidence of the ſoundneſs of their Grace,</p>
               <p>Next, From this Citation, that we are killed all the day long, There is imported, 1st. That Perſecutors Malice is not ſoon ſatisfied, the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Saints irritates their Malice, and former Acts of perſecution gives the Devil acceſs to hurry them to more, and they fooliſhly dream, that a continued Perſecution will reach their end. 2ly. We ſee, that God may permit the Perſecution to laſt a long time, for the filling up of the number of his Witneſſes. And 3ly. We may ſee that the Lords People may ly under an uninterrupted Perſecution for a while, to force them to Self-denyal, and Heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for when Perſecution relents, they begin to make the World their Home again.</p>
               <p>Next, It tells us, that Perſecutors, when they inflict the greateſt Miſeries upon the Lords People, they do it with great Contempt, they count them as Sheep for the ſlaughter. Their Power makes them proud. 2ly. The Saints mean condition in the World, makes them contemn them. 3ly. The Pretences they have for the juſtneſs of their Perſecution makes them think light of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe,</hi> Saints would bear this contempt, and would comfort themſelves with this, that in Gods ſight their Blood is precious.</p>
               <p>Obſerve next, That the People of Gods Tryals, tempts them to quite their love to Chriſt; it appears, becauſe, unſound Profeſſors quite their Love under ſuch Diſpenſations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12. They are ſtrong Temptations to break our Love, becauſe, it's uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual with us to judge of Chriſts Love, by his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

favourable Diſpenſations towards us, as alſo they tempt us to caſt away our confidence, and ſo they tend to weaken our Love.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> Is, that we ſhould fortifie our Love to Chriſt, under theſe Diſpenſations of Affliction, becauſe it is much put at, and this may be done by living by Faith, and upon the Hope of Heaven, and by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Self denyal to our Eaſe and Intereſts in the World. 2ly. By this ye may know, whether your Troubles or Afflictions hurt you, or benefite you, whether they do cruſh or encreaſe your love; Encre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Love hath Zeal with it, for the Publick Good, Repentance for formerly committed Guilt, and much Longing after Communion with God; when Love is weakened by Croſſes, it makes us diſlike the Lords Way, becauſe of the Croſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for the laſt thing, That over all theſe Croſſes the Saints are more than Conquerours, It will appear if ye conſider the Advantage that the Church has in general, of all thoſe Afflictions and Perſecutions. 1ſt.

               <p>But 2ly. Private Chriſtians are more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours in their Perſecutions; if ye look to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they meet with under that Diſpenſation. As 1ſt. They are more purged from ſin, <hi>Dan</hi> 10.35. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4. Their Faith is more eſtabliſhed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. Greater affection to the Means of Grace, <hi>Ibid.</hi> More of the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>last.</hi> They are more weaned from other Helps, and lean to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.8. Their Love is warmed to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7, 8. They have a more Publick Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. And 2ly. As their Advantage is greater, ſo Satan is much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of his intendment by Perſecution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he intends to ruine the People of Gods Faith, but that fails him; to make them rue their Religion, and others be hardened in their rejecting of it, and ſo does that fail him alſo; and likeways that of his, to make the Saints Life bitter with Perſecution, but the ſweet Joy they meet with, makes him get a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment there. The Reaſon why the People of God are more than Conquerours is, becauſe of the influence of Chriſts Life upon them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9.</p>
               <p>From this, that they are ſaid to be more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, We may ſee, that the People of God have their own difficulty in this Conteſt, and no wonder becauſe of the greatneſs of their Afflictions, that they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103949:113"/>
are without Interruption, and of long continuance and without the appearance of an outgate, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.27. They are chaſtiſements for Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. They ſurpriſe them, as they did <hi>Job,</hi> they irritate our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, therefore called Temptations, they are ſuch Croſſes as readily we would never choiſe therefore our Self-denyal is moſt tryed with them where there is an conqueſt, there there hath been a conteſt. This tells us, that the Chriſtians Life is not idle, but a fighting Life under the Croſs, it is much to the Chriſtian to overcome his Unbelief Impenitence, Selfiſhneſs.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2d. Of Conſolation, Albeit the Chriſtian hath his own difficulty in this Fight, yet he is more than a Conquerour, that is, his Victory is not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, but manifeſt; for albeit he has his own ſin of Unbelief and Impenitence, yet the <hi>Devil</hi> is evidently diſappointed, and this Victory cannot be loſt again, it is a ſure continuing Victory; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſcaith the Church, or the People of God may receive by a particular Aſſault from a Croſs, yet it is very ſure, they ſhall have the full and abſolute Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the cloſe.</p>

               <p>HEre the Apoſtle brings in his own perſwaſion of Gods Love in Chriſt Jeſus, that others may imitate him; for this perſwaſion is for Imitation, as appears by his making the conſtancy of Gods Love not a peculiar priviledge to himſelf, but common to him with others, ſee Verſe laſt, He propoſes I ſay this perſwaſion of Gods Love in its conſtancy, to clear, that Believers need not fear the want of Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to make them overcome all their Tribulation; conſtant Love, will make conſtant Aſſiſtance for conſtant Victory.

               <p>And firſt, In that the Apoſtle ranks this in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, It tells us, That the Apoſtle ſuppoſe it's a great difficulty to overcome the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Contentments of this life; And this will appear to be true, if ye conſider, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> theſe Contentments have a ſenſible preſent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, which makes us prefer them to the thing of another life, which are to come, and cannot be ſeen, but believed. 2ly, The Contentment they offer is ſuitable to our Corruption. 3ly. At the firſt view they offer Happineſs, as they did to <hi>Solomon</hi> 4ly, We are under neceſſity to uſe theſe Content<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, and readily the uſe of them enſnares us, and the neceſſity of our uſing them makes us forget our ſelves, when our heart is too much taken away by them. 5ly, We would willingly have Happineſs to ly in them, as appears by our trying them after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, <hi>Solomon</hi> tryed Wiſdom again and again, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2, 12, Our deſire that Happineſs ſhould be in them, makes us hardly believe that it is not in them. 6ly, The Contentments of this life are very various; and our deceitful heart, tho we have experience of the emptineſs of ſome, yet it bids is try others, this made <hi>Solomon</hi> turn himſelf from one
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103949:116"/>
thing to another. 7ly, There are many Folks that are drawen away with the Contentments of this life, and that makes the Temptation hardly overcome. 8ly. We have the eaſy opportunity of enjoying them, and that proves a great ſnare to us; they may eaſily be had by ſome, whereas ſpiritual Comforts require more diligence to obtain them. 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y. The heart of Man muſt be defended by ſpiritual Enjoyments againſt this ſnare, and many times the Chriſtian lyes out of theſe, partly through Gods Deſertions, and partly through his own Sin, Miſ-belief, Lazineſs, and unconſtant purſuit of them.</p>
               <p>Uſe, Wonder not then that this temptation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo many away with it. 2ly. It ſays to the Rich, that they ſhould be afraid, for they are in the midſt of Temptation, 3ly. It ſays to the Poor, that they ſhould be Content with their Poverty, becauſe they want the temptation, and not to repine. 4ly. It exhorts all to be ſober-Minded, and thoſe that ſtand under this Temptation to be humble, ſeing it is ſo dangerous. 5ly. Seing it is a Temptation that is ſo hardly overcome, we would try whether we be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by it or not. And 1st. We muſt try, whether we make uſe of theſe Contentments to ſatisfy our heart under want of Communion with God. 2ly. We would try, whether or not we are ſo well pleaſed with them, as we will deſire to live in the World perpetualy, and make it our home. 3ly. Whether we uſe them as helps to ſerve God, or rather as fewel to our Luſts.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 2ly. That God has provided ſufficient ſecurity againſt the temptation of the Worlds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments: As appears 1ſt. If ye conſider, that he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103949:117"/>
has clearly revealed a Heaven, and an other Life, and has given them the ſecurity of a promiſe for it, <hi>Heb</hi> 11, 13. 2ly, He has given them the firſt fruits of the Spirit to make theſe taſteleſs to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4, 7. 3ly Ordinarly he keeps them from this Temptation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He ſets up a Light in the Mind, that diſcovers the Vanity of all theſe Contentments to them.</p>
               <p>Uſe, this tells us, that when the People of God are overcome with this Temptation in leſs or more, they may blame themſelves and not him. 2ly. It ſays that we ſhould be thanful to God for theſe things, that he gives us as ſecurities againſt this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: And for the firſt fruits of the Spirit, our ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Croſs, and the fears of coming Croſſes we ſhould be thankful. 3ly. Since he his provided thir ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Securities for us, let us uſe all means to preſerve us from the ſcaith of this Temptation. And for this effect, build up your ſelves in the Faith of the Truth of the Goſpel. 2ly: Meditate much on the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Good therein offered. 3ly. Conſider much the vanity of all theſe Enjoyments, Conſider their unſuitableneſs, emptineſs, and inconſtancy, and how frequently ye have met with Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them. 4ly. Be buſie at your Duty, that ye may not be enſnared by Idleneſs. 5ly.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103949:117"/>
Take head to your Heart, in the very firſt purſueing of theſe Contentments, that it be not over eager; Regulate your Converſation, more by the word, then by the Example of others; Meditate much on Old-Age. Death, and Judgement, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.8, 9.10, 11. And laſtly, Labour to live in the Enjoyments of Goſpel-Comforts.</p>
               <p>Motives to perſwade to the uſe of theſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Are 1st. The Eager purſuit of the Worlds Contentments loſes our Time, and makes us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect our Duty. 2ly. It is an Sin, that breaks our peace with God. 3ly. It wears out the thoughts of God, Death and Judgement, out of our Heart. 4ly, It makes Spiritual Content, and Fellowſhip with God, appear leſs excellent in our Eye. And 5ly. It makes our Croſs more intollerable, when it comes on us.</p>
               <p>The next thing that the Apoſtle ſays, that ſhall not ſeparate us from the Love of God, is Angels; And by Angels ſome here mean, Good Angels; not that theſe can endeavour to ſeparate us from the Love of God, but by way of ſuppoſition, that tho they would, yet they could not effectuate it; For we may ſuppoſe things, that will never be to clear an Truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1, 8.

His Enmity appears by his wronging their Goods, as in the inſtance of <hi>Job;</hi> it appears by his tempting them to Sin. And that theſe Temptations come from him, and not ſo much from Corruption. Appears 1st. From the nature of them; they are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch Sins, as ordinarly our Corruption will not prompt us to, without him; ſuch as unnatural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, inhumane Cruelties, denying of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Verities. 2ly. It appears from the impetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, they are ſo frequent; and come in ſo thick, that they cannot well be reſiſted, 1 <hi>Chor.</hi> 21.4.</p>
               <p>But, becauſe Satans Enmity here ſpoken of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mainly meant of his Temptations to draw us to Sin, therefore I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat as to theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, that the Love of God may be commended, and that in its conſtancy, as making the Saints more than Conquerours over them. And Firſt, I ſhall hold out the ſubtilty of them, and that in theſe Three. 1st. His Subtilty appears in the timeing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103949:118"/>
of them. 2ly. In the manner of their Conveyance. 3ly. In the External Baites, he holds out; to make them forceible.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, He times his Temptation when we are out of our Duty, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.12. 2ly. When we are not watchful, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. 3ly. When we preſume, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.33. 4ly, When our Armour is off us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 13. 5ly. When we have got a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe then we are moſt ſecure, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. His Subtility appears as to the manner of the Conveyance. 1st, If ye conſider the Inſtruments he makes uſe of to tempt us, They are perſons either that we love entirely, as our neareſt Relations; as he tempted <hi>Adam</hi> by his Wife, and <hi>Job</hi> by his; or he makes uſe of. Godly perſons to tempt us, that they may be leſs ſuſpect, as he tempted <hi>Job</hi> by his Godly Friends to queſtion his Integrity, and Chriſt by <hi>Peter</hi> not to ſuffer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. He tempts many Folks to Errour, by making uſe of Godly Folks, ſometimes to propagate Errour. 2ly. His Subtilty appears in this, that he tempts many Folks to Sin under colour of neceſſity, as he tempted Chriſt to work a Miracle, to ſtanch his Hunger, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. Next he tempts them to Sin under Colour of Duty, as he tempted the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to Rigour, againſt the Inceſtuous Perſon under colour of Zeal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 11. 3ly, He tempts them to great Sins, upon the account, that the matter of the Action is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, tho the Principle from which, and the end to which, makes it a grievous Sin, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From the nature of the Temptation, his Subtilty appears. As 1st. He ſends theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on us, as have the advantage of the Lot that we
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103949:119"/>
are under; he tempts us to Impatience and Deſpair under Adverſity, and to the denying of our Grace as he tempted <hi>Job:</hi> he tempts us to Senſuality, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our Neighbours under Proſperity, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Pride under manifeſtations of Gods Love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 8. 2ly. If ye conſider that he ſuites the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Predominant, he tempted the Covetous <hi>Judas,</hi> with Money; he tempts the Ambitious with Honour, and the ſenſual man with ſenſual pleaſure 3ly. His Subtilty appears, in that he tempts People to leſſer Sins Firſt, And then to greater; gradually to bring them to a defection, and e're he bring the People of God to Commiſſions, he will tempt them to omiſſion of Duty. 4ly, His great Subtilty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, that he frames his Temptations to make them miſbelieve Threatnings, that he may draw them to the actual contempt of Gods Law; This he did with <hi>Eva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Uſe is, If Satan be ſo ſubtile, we would labour to be in caſe to reſiſt his Temptations. And 1st. Let Grace never be out of Exerciſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11. 2ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be very Watchful, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 8. 3ly. Pray much, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 18 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 8. 4ly, Be acquaint with his Devices, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 11. 5ly. Let the Word of God dwell Richly in you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4 <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 17. 6ly. Reſiſt him in the beginning, <hi>Ja.</hi> 4, 7, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 10.</p>
               <p>Obſerve 2ly, That tho Satan in his Temptations be ſtrong and ſubtile, yet the Chriſtian may be ſure of Victory. 1st. If ye conſider, that he is a foiled Enemy, <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 15. 2ly, The Victory of our Head over him is a good pledge of our victory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 3ly. Chriſt has an Experimental Sympathy with the People of God in theſe temptations. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 22.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:103949:119"/>
4ly. He interceeds for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 32. 5ly. Chriſt is ſtronger then he, 1 Jo: 4, 4, And there is a ſufficiency of Grace in him, to bear them through 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 5, 10. 6ly. There is a promiſe of Victory given to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20.</p>
               <p>Uſe, If they be ſure of Victory, the tempted Saints would not fret againſt this their Lot of being troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the <hi>Devils</hi> temptations; And that they may be reconciled to this Lot, conſider the Advantages of it. As firſt, It cures their preſumption, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 32 2ly, It prevents their Pride and puts them to Prayer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 8. 3ly, It helps them to an Experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al skill to ſuccour the tempted. 4ly. It gives them experience of the Power and Wiſdom of God, who can make them, that are Witleſs and Weak, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſtrong and Wiſe <hi>Devil.</hi> 2ly If the Victory be ſure, it ſays they ſhould not be diſcouraged under temptation from Satan, but fight Manfully.</p>
               <p>The next thing, the Apoſtle gives an defyance to, is things preſent, by which he means preſent Croſſes in his Lot; which tells us, that the Chriſtian readily ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wants ſad Croſſes in his Life.
