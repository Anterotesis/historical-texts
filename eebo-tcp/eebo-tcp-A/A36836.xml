            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OUR firſt Converſation and Diſcourſe having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
what you ſee, it happen'd that the diverſity
of Judgements, which was paſt upon it, has been
the ſubject Matter of this ſecond, in which I ſaid,
that the Cenſors of my writing were divided into two <hi>Claſſes,
viz.</hi> into thoſe who condemned the Matter and the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, and into them, who highly approved of both, but
they would rather I had more enlarged my ſelf upon ſome
Conſiderations to bring the Parliament to the re-uniting of
Conformiſts and Non-Conformiſts, without which we
muſt neither hope, nor expect that the Papiſts ſhould leave
off the deſign that they have had in hand for theſe ſo many
years, of bringing Popery into <hi>England,</hi> by ſuch wayes, as
it even gives one a horrour but to mention. The Reſult of
our ſecond Converſation was, that we fell upon ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
which might give much ſatisfaction to the Cenſors
of the latter <hi>Claſs,</hi> who find no other fault in my Writing,
but that I was not more prolix in thoſe things I have told
you of. 'Tis a Subject, upon which, you, who have frequent
Converſations with Parliament Men, of greateſt merit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency,
ought eſpecially to inſiſt upon: Tell them then, that
in truth both you and I have found the laſt, and, I hope, ſhall
find theſe ſucceeding Members to be filled with theſe two
good deſigns, whereof the one is to oppoſe themſelves to
that which the Papiſts have long been projecting. <hi>Viz.</hi> To
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59266:3"/>
bring Popery into <hi>England,</hi> whatſoever it coſts them, and
rather than fail or miſs of their project<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make uſe of
Sword, Fire, and Poiſon, and to Maſſacre thoſe that ſtand in
their way to hinder them; and not ſo much as to ſpare the
ſacred Perſon of the KING, (who is the Lords anointed,
and whom he hath hitherto preſerved as the Apple of his Eye,
and whom, I hope and pray he will long continue among
us) and thoſe of the Royal Family, if they are any obſtacle
to their deſigns: You and I, I ſay, ſhall find them ſtrongly
engag'd in the ſaid deſign and reſolution of bringing it to a
happy ſucceſs, by the eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſuch a manner, as may perpetuate it, and tranſmit it to
Poſterity, without any further diſturbance or perplexity,
and which may be inviolably faſtened to the crown of both
this, and all our other Kings, that ſhall come after him. The
other deſign is to procure in the Civil State, Peace, Liberty,
and Riches to the People, in putting bounds to <hi>Monarchical
Government,</hi> which altho it be the moſt excellent in the
World, hath a natural inclination to that which is Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>BUT neither you nor I have as yet found, that thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Men have thought upon putting the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
on its true and ſolid foundations, whileſt we ſaw them
reſolved to make it deſcend to Poſterity, in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and poſture in which they find it at this day, without
any Change or Alteration, and in that perpetual variance and
diſcord between the Conformiſts and Non-Conformiſts, and
with all the Corruptions and Abuſes, which are known to be
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> tho the confirmation and conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Poſture of the Church be incompatible with the
deſign of vigorouſly oppoſing the bringing in of Popery into
<hi>England,</hi> and this Truth, that <hi>I</hi> have delivered is indiſputable:
to wit, that the Papiſts will be alwayes in the attempt, hope,
and expectation of getting in, and making to be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59266:3"/>
the Roman Catholick Religion in the Kingdom, whileſt
that ſuch diviſion of Parties ſhall continue, with as much, if
not more, diſtance, animoſity, and hoſtility from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
to the Non-Conformiſts, as is found between <hi>Rome,</hi>
and one of theſe two Parties: And whileſt there ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſo great a nearneſs and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with her as to Ceremonies, and exteriour Government.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE to remove theſe obſtacles, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the re-union of theſe two Parties ſo heated one againſt
another, and which makes, <hi>ut dum ſinguli pugnant, omnes vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur,</hi>
and will make that the Oppoſitions to the deſigns of
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall never be vigorous, there muſt be ſome means of
Re-union found out, by repreſenting to the Parliament ſome
Conſiderations, and afterwards by propoſing to them ſome
Overtures grounded upon thoſe Conſiderations, and which
tend to the Re-union and Satisfaction of both Parties.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſideration is, that, as in the time of King
<hi>Edward the ſixth,</hi> the Reformation, or the transferring the
Roman Catholick Religion to that of the Proteſtant, was
to be made in a Kingdome, where of ten perſons, nine of
them had ſtrong Inclinations and good Affection to Popery,
the firſt Reformers, who were all of them ſincere perſons,
and had the fear of God before their eyes, I ſay, they were
neceſſarily obliged to manage the ſpirits and tempers of
men with all the prudent caution they could; and though
their work was abſolutely to change the doctrine of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they did, and not to retain the leaſt
Nail, or ſeed of it that may any wayes grow again; but to
baniſh out of <hi>England</hi> all the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Hereſies and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Idolatries; becauſe that was a thing might be done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly
and without noiſe; ſo as that the people, who
are moſt commonly ignorant in theſe matters, might not be
ſhockt at it: Yet on the other hand they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
almoſt all the Government and exteriour ſervice of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59266:4"/>
and the practice of their Ceremonies, whereof a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
would have cauſed no doubt great commotions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And in truth the people, who penetrate the leaſt into
matters of belief, took no notice that they had taken away
Tranſubſtantiation, ſo long as they kept up kneeling at the
Table of the Lord, and retained the outward face of Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
of Ceremonies, obſervation of Feſtival dayes, of Faſts,
and of Lent, which are things that moſt affect the people,
which they eaſily ſwallow, and wherein they make their
greateſt part, if not their whole of Religion to conſiſt: So
that the Tranſition of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Proteſtant Religion was
made without noiſe, or ſo much as the peoples being alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the loſs of their old Religion, which they did only
reform, (as they ſaid) taking away ſome of the Abuſes that
had ſtollen into it: This was apparent in the Inſurrection
that broke out in <hi>Cornwal</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the attempt to baniſh the Maſs; but which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
appeaſed, after they had informed the <hi>Male-Contents</hi>
that they had made no other Alteration in the divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
than onely the tranſlating of the Maſs into Engliſh.</p>
            <p>THEN we are next to obſerve, that though theſe holy
perſons, who firſt ſet their hands to the work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
retained ſeveral of the practices and Ceremonies of
<hi>Rome,</hi> for the reaſons aforeſaid, yet it was a thing far from
their thoughts to be willing to have the Infallibility of <hi>Rome</hi>
be according to their firſt reſolutions accounted unalterable,
as if what had been once Eſtabliſhed, ſhould not need
to be touched over again, ſince they only deſigned to give
the firſt draught (as it were) of the Reformation, adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the poſture of <hi>England</hi> in their time, not to what they
could have wiſhed, but to what they were able to do: for
as we learn by ſome Letters of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> the
firſt Reformers did promiſe themſelves much, that their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
would go from thoſe firſt Rudiments of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59266:4"/>
to that which ſhould be a more perfect and exact work
when the people ſhould be more illuminated, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Proteſtants ſhould be greater: <hi>Et ſic à talibus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimentis</hi>
(ſayes <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Engliſh men,
where he calls thoſe Rudiments <hi>tolerabiles ineptias) incipere
licuit, ut doctos tamen proboſque &amp; graves Chriſti Miniſtros;
ultra eniti, &amp; aliquid limatius &amp; purius quaerere conſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
foret.</hi> The firſt Reformers acted in that manner as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
carry themſelves in the firſt Eſtabliſhments of States
and Kingdomes, wherein the Legiſlators do not propoſe to
make a perfect Model of Government, which neither can,
nor ought to ſuffer a change from good to better: And ſo
it is in the firſt Invention of Arts, as of Paper, Printing,
concerning Navigation, Painting, or any other curious
work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which it is never to be expected, that one
ſhould attain the height of perfection at one daſh or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,
and where oftentimes, what the firſt Inventors have
projected, is not practicable by thoſe that come after
them.</p>
            <p>BUT thoſe who have ſucceeded the firſt Reformers,
have not trod in their good ſteps, nor have they been influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Intereſts of Heaven, but by thoſe of this World:
As five, or ſix hundred perſons of the Clergy, the Biſhops,
Deans, and Canons, have got into the poſſeſſion of two
thirds of the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues, they are now become
Zealous Oppoſers of the work of a more perfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and block up all the Avenues to all attempts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the Benefices more equally than they are, and which
are enjoyed by a very ſmall inconſiderable number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
They labour to perſwade <hi>thoſe that have the rule over
them,</hi> that what the Non-conformiſts call but a breaking
forth, or rude Eſſay of Reformation, in the time of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
and <hi>Ridley,</hi> was a perfect work and Maſterpiece, which
ought not to be medled with any more, unleſs by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59266:5"/>
affinity with <hi>Rome:</hi> Above all they labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
into the minds of theſe Crowned heads, that the
KING at the head of the Convocation, and even by his
ſole Power and Authority can give Laws to the Church
independantly on His Parliament, and ſo by that means to
continue an Eccleſiaſtical Empire ſeperate from the Civil,
and to make it reſt upon that ſmall number of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
which poſſeſſes the two thirds of Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.</p>
            <p>TO be ſhort, as the Succeſſors of <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi>
ſaw, that the deſign of thoſe glorious Martyrs could not
take its effect, but by depriving them of their Empire,
and of all their fat Benefices, they have acted juſt quite
contrary to what they had in their Eye to be brought to
paſs: for inſtead of getting further and further from the
Doctrine and practices of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have been alwayes
advancing more and more to them; whereas the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
in retaining ſome of the Ceremonies of <hi>Rome,</hi> did
principally intend by that nearneſs of affinity with it, to
draw over thoſe of that Communion to their own; and
not to impoſe them with rigour on the Proteſtants; thoſe
who have come after them, have turned a means of Peace
and Reconciliation, into an Apple of diſcord, diviſion,
and Schiſme: Whereas the firſt Reformers had pulled down
the Altars, theſe have ſet them up again: Whereas thoſe
above all things aimed to reſpect the Churches beyond
Sea, and to keep a ſtrict Union and Friendſhip with them,
their Succeſſors have baniſhed them both from their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
and Communion, and have turned <hi>Calvin</hi> into redicule,
and fanaticiſme. Their Animoſity is ſo far carried out againſt
the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Henry Dodwell</hi> has maintained to
Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> that the Reformed Churches in <hi>France</hi> had better
by much have kept in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
than be governed as they are without Epiſcopal ordinations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59266:5"/>
AS to the Overtures to a Re-union, it is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Wiſdom of the Parliament, that they will do
all, that their firſt Reformers would have done, if they were
alive at this day, for a perfect eſtabliſhment of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, againſt the attempts of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they
will act the Reverſe to what the Succeſſors of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
have practiſed, which has been continually to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and bring obſtacles to the good deſigns of both KING
and Parliament, who would have made, no doubt, before
this time a Reformation of the Abuſes of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
As when the Houſe of Commons has made (what they
have oft attempted) preparatory Acts, to give bounds to
the immeaſurable Juriſdiction of the Biſhops, to give them
Aſſiſtants, to take away the plurality of Benefices, and to
reduce Chapters to a better paſs and uſage than they are at
this day, which nouriſhes onely idleneſs and ſloth. And
when in the 13. year of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was a Statute made,
which obliged Miniſters onely to ſubſcribe to the Articles
concerning Doctrine; the corrupt party of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> alwayes rendred fruitleſs and inſignificant, all theſe
fair Overtures of Union, and even have trampled upon the
Models propoſed by the good Biſhops <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> and
with heat and tranſport oppoſed the Eſtabliſhment of that
excellent Model, which our gratious KING <hi>CHARLES</hi>
the II. propoſed at the time of his Reſtauration to the
Crown, and which it could be wiſhed, that the Parliament
would again take into their ſerious Conſideration, as the
onely remedy to re-unite both Parties, and to ſettle the
Proteſtant Religion upon its firm and natural Baſis, and
render it impenetrable to all the deſigns and attempts of the
Papiſts.</p>
            <p>THIS Model is ſo much the more excellent, as it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
upon that of the People of God, among whom the
Church and Republique were Synonimous terms: and the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59266:6"/>
Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction was not diſtinct from the Civil: for
the Sacrificers, as ſuch, were not inveſted with any Juriſdiction.
<hi>Naturaliter Sacerdotibus,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Grotius de Imperio ſummarum
Poteſtatum, cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3.) <hi>nulla jurisdictio competit, quare etſi
Sacerdotes habuerunt juriſdictionem, non habuerunt ut Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
ſed ut Magiſtratus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND it is therefore to be hoped and expected from the
Wiſdome of the Parliament, whoſe deſigns have been of
late vigorouſly ſeen to oppoſe Popery, that they would
baniſh this Maxim of a Collaterality of Iuriſdictions, which
eſtabliſhes it mightily in the world. Methinks it is ſo much
the more Erronious, as it was diſputed againſt in the year;
1641. By the Author of an Excellent book, the title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, <hi>The Heritage of Biſhops</hi> (and who it is thought was a
Biſhop) for he there expreſsly denyes their right of Suffrage
and voting in the houſe of Peers: as you may ſee by his
words, pag. 22. <hi>Dogma eſt pontificium, quod regimen Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticum
eſt diſtinctum à civili, &amp;c. That opinion which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes
the Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction from the civil is a pure
piece of Popery: It is affirmed by</hi> Bellarmine <hi>(libr. de Pontifice
cap.</hi> 5.) <hi>with an accent of ſo much the more aſſurance, as it is
not conteſted, neither by the Proteſtant Doctors, nor by thoſe
of Rome, this is what that Cardinal affirms from a pure motive
of intereſt, that ſo he might exalt the power of the Pope above
that of KINGS and Princes, and that ſo he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
the Clergy from their ſubmiſſion to the Secular Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> agrees with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 11. Sect
1. &amp;c. But let it not diſpleaſe them, though this opinion be the
Idol of all the world, and it hath run through all places; and
though not only in England, but elſewhere the Eccleſiaſtical
Courts are diſtinct from the Civil; yet I do boldly maintaine, that
this opinion and this Practiſe is not approved of by God, and is
contrary to the antient practiſe under the legal Oeconomy, and is
the cauſe of the introduction of Popery into the world, and of
the diſorders that have ſince come by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59266:6"/>
AGAIN this Model of Government made by the KING,
or by his Parliament, is ſo much the more conſiderable as
it hath an harmonious concurrence with that of the firſt
Reformers in <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere, when they made
but one body of the Church and of the Republick, and did
put Eccleſiaſtical power into a meer mockery and illuſion,
and excommunication they made of it a fantaſme, unleſs
both were ſubordinate to the Civil power: Such were
<hi>Zuinglius, Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Martyr, Bullinger, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,
Gualterus,</hi> and thoſe who ſucceeded them, the two
Biſhops <hi>Wilſon and Andrew, Richard Hooker, Dr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,
Cameron, Tilenus, Rivet, Vedel, Maccerius, Des-Marets,
Maſtrezat,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gaches</hi> in his Sermon at the ordination of
Mr. <hi>Sarrau,</hi> Mr. <hi>Muſſard,</hi> and a hundred others.</p>
            <p>AS to the other overtures for the eſtabliſhing of good
Religion and good order in the Church, it is not neceſſary
to ſpeak of them in particular and retaile, ſo long as thoſe
who ſet at the helme of affaires know that the Reformation
muſt begin by that of the Univerſities, baniſhing out of
thoſe Schooles all the Doctrines and perſons infected
with the Hereſies of <hi>Rome, Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Socinus;</hi> and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into their places ſuch as were in them about twenty
years ago, or the very Individual perſons if they are yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>IT is to be wiſhed alſo that theſe Sages of the Parliament
would well conſider.</p>
            <p>1. THAT the firſt Legiſlators never made Laws to the
people until they had before hand throughly weighed, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their diſpoſitions were likely to receive them, and the
number of the perſons, either who would in all probability
ſubmit voluntarily to them, or who poſſibly might be extream
averſe to thoſe laws.</p>
            <p>2. THAT as it is altogether unreaſonable, nay impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to impoſe upon the Scotch people the Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59266:7"/>
the Liturgy, and the Ceremonies of <hi>England,</hi>
for which fourſcore and nineteen of a hundred have an
Averſion, the honourable Members of Parliament, would
do well to take the ſame meaſures in their debates and
practices as to Reformation, that they have a deſign to do
in matters of Religion; and ſince of ten perſons in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that have a love and kindneſs for the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
there are two thirds of them that cannot away
with the Epiſcopal Government, in that manner as it is
at this day eſtabliſhed, at leaſt the Liturgy and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
it would be to act contrary to Reaſon, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
diviſion, diſorder, and animoſities, if they did continue
the impoſition of them.</p>
            <p>3. THAT this was the thought of <hi>Mounſieur de Thou</hi>
in his Preface to <hi>Henry the fourth,</hi> that it was to ſin againſt
Reaſon, and the Peace of the Kingdome, to think of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to bring thoſe of the Reformed Religion to the
Communion of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the onely conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their great number ought to perſwade the KING
to give them as much Religious, as Civil, liberty.</p>
            <p>4. THAT as to <hi>England,</hi> it ought alſo to be the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of its Legiſlators: For it hath it hath been that of
all the great men both within, and out of <hi>England;</hi> of a
<hi>Burleigh,</hi> a <hi>Walſingham,</hi> a <hi>Bacon</hi> Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> a <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
and a <hi>Hollis.</hi> It has been likewiſe the Opinion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
themſelves, and of Strangers that have come over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England,</hi> and have made an exact ſearch and inquiry
into the humours, the genius, and number of thoſe people
that adhere to the reigning Religion, and of thoſe that
are contrary to it: My Lord <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi>
ſpeaks of the Prelates as of perſons that have loſt their
Senſes, to ſet upon the Perſecuting of thoſe that are much
more numerous than themſelves. <hi>They would be puniſhing for
Conſcience, where above half of the Nation is openly of a perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59266:7"/>
contrary to theirs; and three fourths of the remaining parts,
care not a Fiddle-ſtick for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SORBIERE <hi>in his Voyage into</hi> England <hi>ſayes,</hi> the
Churches are built after the Proteſtant way, and are only great
Auditories, with Galleries particularly for the uſe of preaching,
and ſome ſmall Cantle of the Liturgy; For the people have an
averſion for it; and the Religion which is at this day received
from the State is the leaſt followed. <hi>in pag.</hi> 58. <hi>he ſayes;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Presbyterians are thoſe that have re-eſtabliſhed the
KING upon his Throne; and it is that for which they now
reproach him, being ſo perſecuted as they are.</p>
            <p>ABOVE all the <hi>Italian</hi> Hiſtorian <hi>Siri</hi> is expreſs in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<hi>di Currenti tempi; La puritana cice che profeſſando il Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſmo,
nella ſua rigida &amp; para forma, conſtituiſie la parte l'altre;
&amp; che con odio ſempre implacabile alla Religione Catholica.</hi> The
meaning is, that the Puritans are that part of the people,
both the moſt holy, and the moſt numerous, as alſo the
moſt powerful, and moſt rich, and that have the greateſt
averſion to the Roman Catholick Religion: All theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
and all theſe teſtimonies, are they not ſufficient
to perſwade our Legiſlators to make a Reformation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
to the great number of the Puritanical people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and who exceed the others not onely in number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but alſo in purity of Doctrine, and exactneſs of Life and
Manners?</p>
            <p>BUT the incongruity of making the Eſſay of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the time of KING <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, to paſs
for a full and compleat Maſter-piece, that ought not to be
touched again, is no leſs, than when the tenth part of the
people of <hi>England,</hi> and the thouſandth part of the Proteſtants,
would fain paſs for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true Proteſtants in <hi>Europe,</hi> which ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for the holy, pure, Orthodox, and viſible Church of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon the Earth, at leaſt, which ought to have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59266:8"/>
the right hand of excellency before all the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
from Popery, to which belong the Succeſſion of
Pulpits ſince the Apoſtles, the purity of Doctrine, and
holineſs of life, only for this reaſon, becauſe it poſſeſſes the
Epiſcopal Ordination: for it is much after this manner that
the Doctors, <hi>Stillingfleet, Tillotſon, Floyd,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Durel,</hi>
ſpeak of it: When they inveſt five or ſix hundred of the
Beneficed Miniſters with the name of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
This is indeed no better than a piece of refined faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
<hi>No-ſence,</hi> to affirme, that the firſt draught of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
ought to paſs for a perfect worke, that muſt admit
of no hand to come over it again, and give it the laſt live
touches; and that a handful of perſons in a Corner of the
world, moved and actuated by ſuch Intereſts, as <hi>I</hi> am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to name, muſt needs be, above all others in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the little flock of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALSO this opinionative humour of rejecting ſince the
time of KING <hi>Edward the ſixth,</hi> all the overtures of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the reformation again, is not an effect, neither of
the wiſdome of Heaven, nor even of that of this world,
and of perſons that have but the leaſt reaſon and common
ſence, who know that it hath been the practiſe of all ages,
and of all the ſucceſſors of the firſt Legiſlators, who being
ſenſible that thoſe have not been able to foreſee in the
firſt Eſtabliſhing of Laws, the inconveniencies which may
ariſe from them, are forced many times to repeale ſome of
the firſt lawes, or at leaſt to make ſome change and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of them. This is what the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi>
have alwayes done; but this is what the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has never been willing to do.</p>
            <p>YOU expect it may be, that I ſhould paſs from thoſe
that approve of my writing to them that condemn it, but
it would be labour loſt to attempt the Cure of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
or the giving them any ſatisfaction, unleſs they do
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59266:8"/>
convince me of a lie, or that I have mak'd or diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by ſome ſiniſter interpretation, the opinions of thoſe
great men whom I alledge: Unleſs we can do that, I ſhall
remain conſtant in that opinion, that thoſe who condemn
my writing are as much under the Tyranny of prejudices,
as thoſe who ſpeak againſt my <hi>Iugulum cauſae,</hi> and my <hi>Faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus;</hi>
as if they were pernitious pieces that tend to the ruine
of the Church of God, to the ſubverſion of all good order,
and which are the production of a perſon that is moved by an
evil ſpirit, or at leaſt, that is a ſeer of contentions, and
an Enthuſiaſt: For theſe are the <hi>Ideas</hi> of my perſon, and of
my writings, quite contrary to thoſe that one of the great
men in the Proteſtant party has conceived both of me and
them: He has not indeed forbad me to name him, but he
has not likewiſe given me the permiſſion to do it, ſo that
it will be a very Innocent Action to produce here a fragment
of the Letter he wrote to me, which is dated from <hi>Paris</hi>
the 28 of March, 1679.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT was my happineſs to have a little Book written by you,
and intituled <hi>faſciculus,</hi> &amp;c. fall into my hands ſome weeks
ago; I read it, and when I had done, went through it again
with an extream pleaſure, and great advantage: I diſcovered
in it important truths, which I was, I muſt confeſs, ignorant
of until then. To do you juſtice, I muſt acknowledge that it
is you, who have put the laſt hand to the Reformation, which
remained imperfect and unfiniſhed without your generous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,
and which being deſtitute of your illuminations, has
not made any progreſs for this hundred years. You are the
firſt that hath diſcovered the Myſtery of Iniquity at the root
and bottome, and who ſhow to all that will not be longer blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by intereſts and prejudices, the infallible means to ruine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
and to downfal the Beaſt. Before you had taken the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59266:9"/>
hoodwink from my Eyes, I thought Excommunication was as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly
grounded upon the holy Scripture, as any of our Articles of
Faith, eſpecially when I heard our Miniſters, ſay with ſo much
aſſurance; in the name and Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, I excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
&amp;c. But I ſee by the ſolid and unanſwerable refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that you make from the principal paſſage upon which
they pretend it is ſtrengthened and ſupported, nothing to be more
vain than what they alledge to eſtabliſh that fantaſme, as you
call it truely well. I thought, Sir, it was my duty to teſtifie my
acknowledgements to you, and to thank you moſt heartily for the
good Office you have done me: <hi>Ingenui eſt pudoris fateri per
quos profeceris.</hi> Aſſure your ſelf, Sir, that I will not hide this
Talent, I have received from you in a Napkin: But I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to the utmoſt of my power and intereſt to make known
theſe truths that you have diſcovered, and to gain you Proſelites:
May you alwayes keep firm againſt the Perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT thought it to be an Action very Innocent to Print
the Letter of this great man, whileſt I do not name him,
and he is not known by any of my Friends: Yet I had not
made it publick, if my Age of Seventy four years did not
convince me, that if I ſhould ſtifle during my Life this clear
evidence of my good cauſe, by ſo eminent an Authority,
it might in all probability remain in the Grave of ſilence with
me to the Reſurrection: And my new thoughts by way of
an Eſſay towards an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory might alſo run the
ſame riſque. This conſideration hath carried me to add to his
Letter the Arguments of all the Chapters of my Book, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the ſatisfaction of him, whom I find ſo agreeing with
my Sentiments, than for that of any other perſon: That ſo if
God gives me any longer time to live, he may have farther
profit, and draw from me thoſe pieces that go to the making
up of my Hiſtory, to which he may give a run in the World
with greater facility.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. OF the Origine of Church Power from the time
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> and of
its progreſs even to the time of the Decretals; that it is
the true Myſtery of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. A Continuation of the ſame matter a little more
exact, even to the Council of <hi>Calcedony.</hi>

from the Council of <hi>Calcedony</hi> down to the time of the
Introduction of the Decretals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. Another Diſcourſe about the ſame matter: that
the Decretals have made the Pope the Head of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Power, and have given him an Empire over Kings and
Nations, and do yet continue the poſſeſſion thereof to
him; and though the falſity and cheat is diſcovered even
by the Romaniſts themſelves, yet it is not in the Power of
that to ſhake it.</p>
            <p>

a more exact manner. That the Decretals have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
the Pope to be Governour in Chief of the Catholick
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. Tho the Pope be an earthly Prince, not only in
his own Territory, but alſo in the ſtates of others, and he
may by a juſt title keep an Empire over them, and have the
priority of them; yet it is not by the poſſeſſion of that
earthly Empire, either over them, or in his own Territory,
that he makes himſelf conſiderable in the World, but it is
by this deceit and illuſion of Words <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi>
under the mantle of which he conceals his earthly
Empire.</p>

               <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. A Reſolution of that Queſtion, Why the Popes
do prefer the poſſeſſion of their Empire by frauds, tricks
and impoſtures, under the diſguiſe of thoſe words <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual</hi> power, to the poſſeſſion which they

in the ſame manner as Princes poſſeſs theirs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. Of Religious and Civil Adorations: Of thoſe
which the Popes did formerly give to Emperours; and of
that which Emperours and Kings give to him now at this
day. Of the ſin that is in it: that the preſence of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
power, doth make thoſe Adorations and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of the Foot to be criminal, but its abſence makes them
Innocent.</p>

of thoſe, and poſſeſſes the ſame Empire.</p>

or power Eccleſiaſtical.</p>

who, confeſſing the Popes, immediately after the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Decretals, to be infamous and Abominable
perſons, draws from thence an Argument to exalt ſo much

and Perpetuity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. A touch of ſome conſiderable Legends and

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59266:11"/>
Eccleſiaſtick above the Civil; and to juſtifie the
Power of the Popes to diſpoſe of Empires and Kingdomes,
and to depoſe Emperours and Kings: By which a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be made of the entire piece of the Annals, and
of the ſincerity of the Author in all his work. In a word,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. That the preſence of the Eccleſiaſtical power
in the world ſubmits to the Pope, reaſonably and natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Civil power, and juſtifies the Excommunication and
depoſition of Kings and Emperours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. That the Hypotheſis of an Eccleſiaſtical power
is more reaſonable according to the practices of <hi>Rome,</hi> than
the manner in which the Proteſtants have uſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. That the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> is nothing elſe but
the people's adhearing to the Pope; with an examen of

and before the Introduction of the Decretals, the Pope
was not acknowledged Governour in cheif of the Catholick
