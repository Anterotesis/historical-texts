            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PRAYSE OF
King RICHARD
the THIRD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Princes are naturally ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that Ambition makes
them to effect their desires, rather
then to affect the equitie of their
designes, may more truly then
safely be auowed. For all of them,
I thinke, were the record of their
actions indifferent, might be taxed of this vice. But
this excuse cleares not the accused; yet it testifies,
that Princes erre against nature, if they aspire not.
We hold (not without reason) that if the bill of the
Plaintiffe bee stuffed with friuolous assertions, that
the complaint fauoureth more of malice, then of
wrong. Why should not the same Axiome bee a
motiue to cleare this wronged Prince, whose accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
lay to his charge the anguish his Mother felt,
when he came into the world? then which accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what can be more friuolous; it being a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereditary to all women, from the first? His
being toothed, as soone as borne, seemes to me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:5263:4"/>
a blessing, then any imputation, as being a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of his future worthinesse, and as all Nurses will
confesse, an ease of much paine and danger. But
he was crook-backt, lame, il-shapen, il-fauoured. I
might impute that fault to Nature, but that I rather
thinke it her bounty: for she being wholly intentiue
to his minde, neglected his forme, so that shee infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a straight minde in a crooked bodie, wherein
shee shewed her carefull prouidence. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
the care to keepe those parts well formed,
with-drawes mens mindes from better actions, and
drownes them in effeminate curiositie. His lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
turned to his glory; for with those imperfect
limmes, hee performed actions most perfectly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.</p>
            <p>How rightly his Father<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rich.</hi> D. of Yorke, father of <hi>Edw.</hi> the fourth <hi>George</hi> D. of Clarence, &amp; <hi>Rich.</hi> the third.</note> claimed, his brother
<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Edw.</hi> E. of March, eldest sonne of R. D. of Yorke, after K. by the name of <hi>Edw.</hi> the fourth.</note>obtained the Scepter, is sufficiently knowne,
and therefore superfluous and impertinent: and
also how his brother dusked his right, (if right)
by abrogating the oath, which he sware at Yorke,
that his comming in armes was only for that Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<note n="c" place="margin">For the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Yorke, as his right, fro his father D. of Yorke.</note>But to dilate how variable, and inconstant
the people of those times were, shall be more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and effectuall, that knowing their inconstancie,
their traditions (like themselues) may the lesse bee
beleeued: so light-headed, so foolish, so irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as their opinion (for what else are the thoughts
of Ignorance but opinion) made them breake
their oath to their Prince,<note n="d" place="margin">K. <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth.</note> and to such a Prince
as they did not shame to dislike, onely because
hee was too good. Him they abandoned, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
after restored; not as desiring, (being guilty of
their owne fault) but onely that it stood with the
<pb facs="tcp:5263:4"/>
liking of <hi>Warwicke</hi> the child of their loue.<note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rich. Neuile</hi> Earle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, sirnamed the King-maker</note> If then
they were such, (as indeede they were) and that
those relations wee haue, must come from that
people, it were better (I thinke) to bury their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
then refute their obiections, were not our
age, apt to erre, infected with this folly.</p>
            <p>For his brother <hi>K. Edward:</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">K. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.</note> though his vices
seem not to adde vertues to this condemned Prince,
yet questionlesse they doe; making all his ill-estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
actions of an other nature. Hee obtained the
Crowne, but rather fortunately, then wisely, were
not all wisedome thought folly, to which <hi>Fortune</hi>
lends not successe. For I thinke, Lust, or if you will
terme it Loue, could not more haue preuailed with
the most licencious creature, then at once to breake
the bonds of amity, discretion and policy; and all
to enioy a woman, in respect of his heighth, base: a
widow,<note n="g" place="margin">Lady <hi>Eliz. Gray,</hi> widow of Sir <hi>Iohn Gray</hi> Knight, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward married to K. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.</note> and of his enemy, without bringing him
either alliance, or riches; proppes most pertinent
to his new-erected buildings. Wherein, besides
his breach of regall discretion, with his chiefest
friend the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> whom he had sent into
<hi>France,</hi> to treate of marriage betweene him and the
Lady <hi>Bona,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Lady <hi>Bona,</hi> Neece to the French King <hi>Lewes</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Lewes</hi> D. of Sauoy.</note> (wherein being deluded, hee became
his mortallest enemie) his abuse to God was more
abominable; being before betrothed (as his owne
mother constantly affirmed) to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth
Lucy:</hi> in testimony whereof hee had layde such
earnest,<note n="i" place="margin">For he had got her with child.</note> as should haue bound any common
man, much more a King, to performance. How
soone the wrath of God followed this his irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inconstancie, his being driuen from the <hi>Seate-Royall</hi>
into exile; the birth of his sonne in a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;
<pb facs="tcp:5263:5"/>
(hauing no place else of freedome in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
kingdome) the miserie of all his partakers
sufficiently testifie. In which generall misery, who
did more truely follow him? Who more faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ayded him, then his now disgraced Brother?
Whereas his other Brother<note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>George</hi> D. of <hi>Clarence,</hi> seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d brother of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> the 4.</note> 
               <hi>Clarence</hi> not onely
left him, but ioyned in marriage<note n="l" place="margin">Hee married <hi>Isabell,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Richard Neuill</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwicke.</hi>
               </note> with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his principall enemie, and holpe to expulse
him: with what loue, what constancy, his indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
his aduenturing his life to restore him, doth
witnesse.</p>
            <p>Neuer was he noted all the life of K. <hi>Edward,</hi> to
thirst after the Kingdome; neuer denyed hee any
commandement of his Prince, but performed all
his employments discreetly, valiantly, successfully.
The suspition of helping his Brother <hi>Clarence</hi> to<note n="m" place="margin">He was drow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in a Malm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey butt in the Tower.</note>
his end, was but a suspition, since the kings old dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
awaked by a new Prophesie, was vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
the cause; if otherwise (when he after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him) hee would haue misliked of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> it
being naturall to sinne; but vnnaturall, to ease o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of their crimes. For the killing of the Heire
of the house of <hi>Lancaster</hi> at <hi>Tewksburie,</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">

               </note> (if so)
seemes to mee, rather the effect of loue to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then crueltie to the Prince: for he was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
yea, the chiefe and principall enemie of the
contrarie faction. Yet it cannot be proued the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Richard,</hi> but that it was an act wished by the
King to be done, and executed in both their presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the <hi>Marquesse Dorset,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The death of <hi>Henrie</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">The death of <hi>Henrie</hi> the 6 in the Tower.</note> the 6. in the Tower, can
no way belong to him, since the same reason that
<pb facs="tcp:5263:5"/>
cleareth his Brother, fitteth him; hee being able, if
desiring his death, to haue effected it by a more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
hand. And indeed this accusation hath no
other proofe, then a malicious affirmation. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(more truely) did suppose that hee dyed of
meere melancholie and griefe, when he had heard
of the ouerthrow of his friends, and slaughter of
his sonne. But if it were true, though it spots him
with bloud, yet it confirmes his loue to his Prince;
which loue was so coldly requited, as might haue
mooued a true louer of Rewards more then of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
to haue altered his indeauors, whether it were
a iealousie of the Nobilitie of his blood, or of the
height of his spirit, whether the abundance of
affection to bee led by a woman, or that hee was
defectiue in all brotherly affection, certaine it is, he
rather imployed him, then rewarded his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Contrary, the Queenes kindred, daylie to
rise, meerely without desert, but that they were of
her kindred; and their basenesse being thus sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exalted, not only to plucke from him promotions,
due to his deserts, but to enuie the Duke, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with him; how insupportable it must be to so
magnanimous a spirit, whose memorie beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their vnworthinesse, his owne worth, any
like spirit may imagine.</p>
            <p>Thus continued this vnequall contention, vntill the
King, sent for before the great<note n="a" place="margin">The death of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> the 4.</note> King of Kings, to
make an account of his greatnes, left his body, to
testifie the worlds folly in contending for Worlds,
when one little part of the earth must contain them.<note n="b" place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> son to K. <hi>Ed.</hi> the 4.</note>
His successor at that time very yong, was wholy pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed

<pb facs="tcp:5263:6"/>
had great reason to feare, being euer his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
enemie, and now most strong, by being most
neerely allied to this Prince: Therefore iealous of
his own preseruation, of the safety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale,
and of the ancient Nobilitie, with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and iustice hee executed them, whom, if he had
suffered to liue, were likely enough to haue beene
the destruction of him, it, and them. But the deed
accomplished, stirred vp no little feare in the Queen-Mother,
and her faction: For the Queenes taking
Sanctuarie with her younger sonne<note n="d" place="margin">Richard <hi>D. of</hi> Yorke, <hi>younger son of</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Richard</hi> Duke
of <hi>Yorke,</hi> without any cause that hee knew, draue
<hi>Gloucester</hi> to suppose that they doubted of their
right, and put him in possibility of obtaining his
owne: wherein by ambitious<note n="e" place="margin">Hen. Stafford <hi>D. of</hi> Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> 
               <hi>Buckingham</hi> he was
assisted, who then related to him afresh the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Marriage of his Brother, that being vnlawfull,
consequently his children were bastards, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the Crowne was lawfully his; to which

Though perhaps an earthly spirit would not haue
beene mooued with these motiues, but rather haue

was likely to bee gouerned by his Mother, and her
kindred, the <hi>Protectors</hi> mortallest enemies, men of
meane birth, not inured to gouernment, such as were
likely to destroy the ancient <hi>Peeres,</hi> to fortifie their

to defend the people from being wasted, and
oppressed by the ambition and tyrannie of new vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
Statists, and to respect his owne preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
rather then others. For well hee saw hee
could not liue, vnlesse hee were a King; that there
was no safety, but in Soueraigntie. Should I put
thee in choyce (condemning Reader) whether thou
wouldest not be, rather then be a King; thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
perhaps answere no: but that answere should
proceede, rather from the knowledge of thy want

how do our Chroniclers report it for truth, were not

to accord differing writers, and to picke truth out of

gaping after preferment, supposing some such

was bold to set his <hi>Rethoricke</hi> to sale, to publish his

the Sermon (as that is yet vnproued) was
that an offence to make the people so publikely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his right; yea, to prostitute his cause to
their iudgements? for charging his Mother with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie,
was a matter of no such great moment,
since it is no wonder in that sexe: And surely he had
more reason to aduenture her fame, then his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
because of two euils it is wisedome to chose
the least. If it were true, it was no iniustice to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it; and what could be expected from his, but
true Iustice, who was so impartiall, that hee would
not spare his owne mother? if vntrue; good faith,
he was therein too blame, and her innocencie the
more meritorious; but certaine it is, the people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
<pb facs="tcp:5263:8"/>
his right: for he was crowned<note n="f" place="margin">The Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of K. <hi>Richard</hi> the third.</note> with such

(the onely marke our iudgements may or can
leuell at) we must determine them so contented, as
no actions which might testifie the satisfaction of
their mindes, were omttted: surely, if euer the vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
multitude did any thing iudicially, it was in
receiuing this Prince, whom his chiefe disgracers
cannot but acknowledge for valiant; then who was
more meet to restraine domesticke, to subdue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
seditions? For these ciuill dissensions had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wasted and made desolate this populous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
discreete hee was and temperate, (two so rare
and excellent qualities, as hee that truly possesseth
them, meriteth the possession of a Diademe:) for in
these vertues, ioyned with that <hi>Cardinall</hi> vertue <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
(wherof also he had a very large portion) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
the soule of <hi>Soueraignty,</hi> which whosoeuer
wanteth (be he a while neuer so powerfull) his owne
greatnesse so crusheth him, that he forfeiteth all in a
moment: most liberall he was, desiring rather to
want, then to suffer worth vnrewarded: and this <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie</hi>
is the onely true Nurse, and fosterer of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
vertue vnrewarded being vnsensible, our flesh
being gouerned, aduised, yea mastered by our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
this worthy, this Princely ornament some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators
haue sought in him to deface, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;
that his liberality to some, proceeded from his
extortion from others: but euen those cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him to haue been politicke and wise; then is it
likely that a Prince of his wisedome and policie,
could not discerne betweene the worthy and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy?
<pb facs="tcp:5263:8"/>
And to take from vndeseruers, to bestowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deseruers, must bee acknowledged a Vertue.</p>
            <p>He was neither luxurious, nor an <hi>Epicure,</hi> not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to any riot, nor to excesse, neither in apparell,
nor play: for had he been touched with any of these
vices, doubtlesse they which obiect lesser crimes,
would not haue omitted these: then (without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion)
hee was largely interessed in vertues, (their
contraries) but those (through malice) are either not
registred, or (if registred) so infamed, as if all his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
had a vicious intent: yet to acknowledge the
vertues of the vicious, is such a right, that what <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian</hi>
willingly omitteth them, therein becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vicious himselfe. But in all that I haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
among tee vulgar obserued:
<q>Calpatur factum, non ob alaud, quam exitum:</q>
they approue, or disproue all things by the euent;
which though sometimes it proueth like the cause,
yet it is more often gouerned by the will of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
prouidence. And surely, but that the gracious
goodnesse of God, to manifest the weaknesse of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
policy, ouerthrew his designes, tooke from
him his Kingdome; and contrary either to mans
hope, or our merit, vnited by a blessed and happy
coniunction<note n="a" place="margin">The two dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting factions of Yorke and Lancaster, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth to <hi>Eliz.</hi> eldest daughter to <hi>Edw.</hi> the fourth.</note> the two dissenting factions, to the true
establishing of sweete peace and prosperity of this
desolate kingdome: for, otherwise, had he liued to
haue left Issue to haue succeeded him, such might
haue beene his and their merits, that <hi>Fame</hi> would
haue been no more iniurious to him, then to his
Predecessors, the fourth <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> whose
reignes were polluted with much more royal bloud:
for he omitted nothing, that in wisedome, or true
<pb facs="tcp:5263:9"/>
policie might secure himselfe, or establish peace, or
good lawes in this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>His Statutes are extant; what can be found in
them not becomming a King? what, not befitting
the seruice of God? the worship of Religion? the
good of his Countrie? yea, I haue heard of some,
accounted both good Lawyers, and good Statists;
that in those three yeares of his gouernment, there
were more good Statutes for the weale-publike
inacted, then in 30. yeares before. He was no taxer
of the people, no oppressor of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, though
he came to manage an Estate, whose treasure was
exceedingly exhausted; no suppressor of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
to satisfie either licentious humors, or to inrich
light-headed flatterers. But (alas) who robbes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
but ingratitude, detraction, and malice? what
a curse is it to <hi>Mortalitie,</hi> that no fashion of life, no
merits, no regards can free Princes from discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
in their life, and infamy after death?
who is it that heares of any one so endued, so loden
with vertues, that iudgeth him not happy? yet he
is defamed; and by whom? euen by those, for
whom hee cared, laboured, and omitted nothing
that might profit, committed nothing that might
preiudice them.</p>
            <p>This, the charge and commandement that hee
gaue presently after his coronation, to the Lords
and Gentlemen (whom hee sent home into their
Countries) that they should in their Countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see
Iustice duly administred and impartially, (that no
wrong, nor extortion should bee done to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects)
doth testifie; this, his lawes, and all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
approue: yet neither the care of his Country,
<pb facs="tcp:5263:9"/>
his lawes, nor actions, are thought to be sufficient to
pleade his equity and innocency: for malicious
credulitie rather embraceth the partiall writings of
indiscreet Chroniclers, and witty Play-makers, then
his lawes, and actions, the most innocent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
witnesses.</p>
            <p>It is laid to his charge (as a maine obiection)
that hee was ambitious, let vs examine the truth
of this accusation. Was he ambitious, who was
onely content with the limits of his own Countrey,
who sought to bee rather famous for instituting of
good Lawes, then for atchieuing great conquests?
No, no, he wanted nothing to make him an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
Prince, but that hee was not ambitious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
for had hee imitated that worthie King
<hi>Henrie</hi> the 5. who, in a like vnsettled estate, led out
the Nobility and people, to make warres vpon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
enemies, to make conquest of France, and to
embrue their Warlike swords (lately bloudied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
one another) in the bloud and bowels of
strangers: he might (perhaps) haue had a fortunate
successe: For he wanted not the like title, he was no
lesse valiant, no lesse politicke. So might hee haue
re-conquered that kingdome, and those Territories,
which by the pusillanimity of some of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
were giuen away, and lost, &amp; (peraduenture)
so busied the stirring heads of the Nobility and
people, that they should haue had no leysure to
thinke vpon any Innouation or part-taking at home:
so might he happily haue secured himselfe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
the bounds of his conquests beyond any of
his Ancestors. What lets or obstacles could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from those glorious enterprises? His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
<pb facs="tcp:5263:10"/>
were warlike, trained vp in armes; somewhat
too much exercised in bloud, because it was in their
owne. His neighbours, the French, were gouerned
by<note n="h" place="margin">Lewes the 11.</note> a king, who had some policie, but so little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that he would rather yeild to any Capitulation,
then heare the sound of an aduersarie Drumme. So
that his people, being vnured to warres, were easily
to be conquered by that Nation, which had so often
beaten them in the height of their daring.</p>
            <p>The Scots, their colleagues, he had already been
victorious ouer: his name among them was grown
terrible. For in the time of his Brother hee wanne
from them many Castles, and Holds. But princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
he conquered<note place="margin">Barwick won from the Scots by <hi>Richard</hi> the third.</note> Barwik, the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Towne vpon their frontiers a piece of speciall
importance, either to make easie our entrance into
that kingdome, or to keep them from inuading ours:
so that I cannot iustly accuse him of any crime so
much, as that his ambition stretched not farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
To iustifie his aduersaries accusation, in
this time chanced the death of his two young<note n="d" place="margin">The death of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> &amp; <hi>Richard</hi> D. of Yorke in the Tower,</note>
Nephewes in the Tower, whose deaths promising
quiet to him, and wholly imposed vpon him, how
truely, I haue reason to doubt; because his accusers
are so violent, and impudent, that those vertues
(which in other men are imbraced, for which they
are esteemed as Gods) they impute to him rather
to be enamellers of vices, then really vertues: His
Humility they terme secret pride: his Liberality,
Prodigality: his Valour, crueltie and bloudthirsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
yet in these dayes, their partiall opinions are
thought to be of validitie sufficient, to make proofe
of any imputation: But if it were so, that their
<pb facs="tcp:5263:10"/>
deaths were by him contriued, and commanded,
the offence was to God, not to the people: for the
depriuing them of their liues, freed the people from
dissension. And how could hee demonstrate his
loue more amply, then to aduenture his soule for
their quiet? But who knoweth, whether it were not
Gods secret iudgement, to punish the Fathers trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
in the children? and if it be so, complaine
of their Fate, not <hi>Richards</hi> crueltie: (for in these
fatall things it fals out, that the High-working pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
make second causes vnwittingly accessarie to
their determinations) yet, in policie, Princes neuer
account Competitors (how young soeuer) inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
since the least colour of right prouokes inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating
humours to stirre vp sedition, which (once
kindled) threatens the subuersion, both of Princes
and Subiects.</p>
            <p>And if some wise, and politike Princes haue
imprisoned, and put to death, such as haue been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
their heires and successors, because some facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heads, (weary of good gouernment, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for authority by alteration) haue sought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
them before their times; (as commonly,
giddy-brained people doe more reuerence the Suns
rising, then his fall) had not King <hi>Richard</hi> great
reason to depriue them of their liues, who were not
to succeede him, (but in many mens iudgements)
had most right to bee invested before him with the
Diademe? And (indeed) the remoouing such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of ciuill warres in a well-ruled Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
is most profitable, most commendable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no crueltie, but pitty, a iealousie of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and a zealous regard of their owne safeties.
<pb facs="tcp:5263:11"/>
And (indeed) if we duely consider, how much the
duty we owe to a Countrey, exceedes all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
since in it self it containes them all, that for the
respect thereof, not onely all tender respects of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
or whatsoeuer other respects of friendship, are
to be layd aside; but that euen long-held opinions,
(rather grounded vpon a secret of gouernment,
then any ground of truth) are to be forsaken: since
the end, whereto any thing is directed, is euer to be
of more noble reckoning, then the thing thereto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected;
that therefore the weale publike is more
to be regarded, then any person or Magistrate that
thereunto is ordained, the feeling consideration
hereof moued King <hi>Richard,</hi> to let principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes the good estate of so many thousands,
ouer whom he had reigned, rather then so to hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke
himselfe with affection, as to suffer his Realm
to run to manifest ruine.</p>
            <p>If any man shall obiect, that his course was
strange, and vnlawfull: let him know, that new ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
require new remedies; and for him there
was no remedie, but this one. Then if for this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hee ought to be condemned, it is for indiscretion
in the managing; for as safely might hee haue had
the Realmes generall consent, in disposing of their
liues, as of their kingdome. Had hee held a secret
execution best, hee might haue effected it more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly:
but hee rather chose a middle way, content
to let the people know it, holding their knowledge
equall with their consents: And it should seeme,
the people, (though they were at that time very
factious) yet approued thereof: for wee find not
that in any action, either inward or outward, they
<pb facs="tcp:5263:11"/>
shewed any dislike. And (truely) such is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the thoughts, the actions, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of Princes and Subiects, that I hold no
subiect sufficiently iudiciall, to censure them: their
courses so vnlike, that what is meete, expedient in a
Prince, in a lower fortune is vtterly vnmeete, vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.
Therefore let no seruile condition aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to condemne them, since all such eyes lose their
facultie, if they but gaze against the Sunne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.
It is sufficient for vs to know how to obey;
this Nature commandeth and exacteth of vs: but
to search into the actions of our Commanders, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
more curiosity, then honestie: Nay, though
we would, we cannot: for our knowledge extends to
things equall, or inferiour; those aboue vs, in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
are comprehended onely by faith; in terrene
matters (if superating our estates) they are onely
snatched at by supposition. And this our Lawes
approue, which appoint euery man to bee tried by
his Peeres; shall then the head, the director of ciuill
policie, the anointed Maiestie of a King, be barred
from the right, allowed to subiects? No (surely) it
is preposterous, most vnlawfull to condemne a king,
if not found faulty by a<note n="a" place="margin">A King not to bee condemned, but by a lury of Kings.</note> Iury of Kings. Were
man in his innocencie, this aduice were not lost: but
beeing nousled in misusing of his malicious
tongue, euer to condemne others, neuer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
themselues, it is (as they will be for their
abuse) perpetually lost; No more then for
them.</p>
            <p>Let vs yet further cleare this wronged Prince:
It is constantly affirmed (say our Croniclers) that
hee first noysed, after, contriued the death of
<pb facs="tcp:5263:12"/>
his wife:<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Anne</hi> Wife of K. <hi>Richard</hi> the 3. daughter of <hi>Ri. Neuill</hi> E. of <hi>War.</hi> &amp; wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> son to <hi>Henry</hi> the 6.</note> and that it was bruited, before it
was effected, thereby with her sorrowes to confirme
the report. This euidence they adiudge pregnant,
and effectuall enough to condemne him: did Fame
neuer lye? What are more generally receiued for
vntruths, then flying reports, seeing no creature
sensible will giue credit to Fame, or take her word,
without a surety, whom they may assuredly know to
bee credible? But constantly (say our Croniclers)
could their words bee so constant, whose actions
were the very stage of inconstancie, who opposed,
deposed kings at their pleasure, and (to make sure
to be no worse then they were) swore allegeance
to two<note n="c" place="margin">To <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. and <hi>Edward</hi> the 4.</note> Princes at once, and with both broke theif
Othes? But I will spend no more time, in prouing
the vanitie of these Croniclers, since their owne
pen contradicts it selfe; first, shewing the affections
of this people to be mutinous, and after, approuing
them: for certaine it is (but vncertaine, that the
King caused it) that such a rumour there was, and
that it made a great impression in the Queene, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
(as women are euer fearefull) this propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
relation to be the forerunner of her end: which
bewailing to her husband, hee fought with all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to remoue that melancholy fantasie. What
more could hee doe to testifie his loue, to cure her
passions? But how absurd is it to thinke or imagine,
that the king contriued her death? Where, if hee
had pleased to marry elsewhere (for that is made
the cause) hee might and would haue vsed a more
safe meanes by a diuorce; did not the French king

            <p>After her death, being desirous to reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to all such, as held themselues offended (as at
his Coronation hee had done with <hi>Fogg</hi> a meane
Attourny, who had highly offended him) he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to win the one sort with benefits and rewards,
and freely pardoned the others misbehauiors and
offences: hee had no cause to feare <hi>Fogg,</hi> therefore
feare was not the cause. No, it was a worthy, a
kingly humility, that would rather abate of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
then to haue it stained with the bloud of so
meane a vassaile, for a crime committed against
himselfe, yet was hee guilty of counterfeiting his
Royall hand and Signet, and of a most vntrue and
infamous libell: therefore how falsely do our Croni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers

prooue, that euer he reuenged any iniury what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb facs="tcp:5263:13"/>
committed particularly against himselfe. For
the good and safety of his kingdome and people, he
was zealous, hee was feruent: for, onely for their
peace, for their quiet, hee was content to suffer his
neerest kinsmen, his dearest friends to be executed;
so now with the mother Queene he laboured recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
he often solicited it, at the last he effected
it: This rare, this excellent worke of <hi>Christianity,</hi>
this true cognisance of a <hi>Religious Queene,</hi> our <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niclers</hi>
defame, and impute it to her as an horrible
crime: such is the obstinate errour of mankinde,
that, when hatred is by God absolutely prohibited,
they dare say and maintaine the contrary: but (were
not they thus corrupt, partiall, gouerned wholly
by affection, not truth;) their Histories would be the
wisest guides, making men that are young in yeeres,
olde in iudgement, making experience most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious)
most cheape: For Knowledge, Iudgement,
and Experience are dearely purchased, when wee
must wander into infinite errours, ere we can be
perfect in our way; nay, they were most deare, were
they had with no other expence, but growing old
before we enioy them, waxing rotten, ere they grow
ripe. The end and scope of this reconciliation was,
to vnite himselfe in marriage with his<note n="d" place="margin">The Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> eldest daughter to <hi>Edw.</hi> the fourth, after wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth.</note> Neece:
a contract (no doubt) inconuenient, and prohibited
the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> but amongst <hi>States-men</hi> it is like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
infinite good, both to Prince and people. It is
an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience, most conuenient, nothing strange,
because vsuall, and accustomed amongst Princes:
tolerated, yea allowed by their receiued Oracle of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity;
the <hi>Pope,</hi> who considering the cause, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispenseth with the <hi>Consanguinity.</hi> It is granted
<pb facs="tcp:5263:13"/>
that this desire of marriage was mentioned by this
King, in respect of the publike peace; to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the Mother, in exalting the daughter, for
the deiecting of the Sonnes, and to auoid the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of much of the peoples bloud, which was likely
to be spilt, if his <hi>Neece</hi> should marry elsewhere: as if
(sayour <hi>Chroniclers)</hi> the first could not be established,
the latter auoided without this <hi>Platforme</hi> of <hi>Policie;</hi>
No, had not Gods secret working bin beyond mans
wisest apprehension, it could not: for well he knew
the head-strong obstinacy of this people could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be kept in awe by a man, therfore impossible to be
restrained by childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: this made him dispossesse them
of their Kingdom, &amp; (peraduenture) of their liues:
for had they been suffered to liue, they would euer
haue bin the fire-brands of new seditions; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thought it more conuenient, they should be
quenched with their owne blouds, then with the
blouds of infinit numbers of the people; yet to make
satisfaction for this wrong, (if it were a wrong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
the disturbers of the common good) hee was
contented and much laboured to marry their Sister,
his Neece: but he is therefore adiudged ill: why?
because his accusers would be reputed good, though
(without doubt) he was a good Prince, and they all,
or the most part of all, euill, phantasticke, and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
people. And euen at this day, though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
&amp; succesfull gouernment of our later Princes,
hath somwhat altered their natures, &amp; bettered their
conditions; yet it were a lesse difficult quest to finde
one good man, then many. But it pleased not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<hi>Ordainer of marriage</hi> to permit that coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but rather to set a <hi>Period</hi> at once to his kingdome
and life.</p>

About the time of the plotting of this mariage, the
iudiciall <hi>Buckingham,</hi> (not thinking himselfe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
regarded) grew discontent, and got the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
fauour to retire himself into the Country; where
(no doubt) his fantastick melancholly would soone
haue vanished (being a man more happy in the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of his Father, then in the legacie of Nature,
discretion, or iudgement) had not the Prisoner cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Iaylour: namely,<note n="a" place="margin">This <hi>Moreto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> was after in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth Archbishop of Canterbury, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall and Lord Chancellor of England.</note> 
               <hi>Moreton, Bishop of Ely</hi>
(committed by King <hi>Richard</hi> to his custodie) who
finding this Duke discontented, more desirous to
inflame his griefes, then to redresse them, with his
fiery wit so wrought vpon the Dukes combustible
matter, that suddenly he brought him to kindle a fire
of rebellion, and to take vp armes against his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne:
this K. <hi>Richard</hi> soone hearing, he prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him as an enemy, and so laboured (what by his
owne wisedome, what by his especials) that within
a while he tooke his head from<note n="b" place="margin">The death of <hi>Henry</hi> Stafford D. of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham beheaded at Shrewsbury.</note> his body, for being
no better able to aduise him in his proceedings: was
it a fault to punish periury in him, who had sworne
true allegeance? then the executing of law is a sin;
if so, let transgressors be accounted innocent, and
Magistrates and Iudges guilty of transgression. And
had this been the action of some other Prince, it had
been good, iust, necessary; but being his, it is censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the contrary: so that sinne is not sinne, nor ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
accounted vertue, by their owne natures or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
but are made vertues or vices, by the loue or
hate that is borne to the committer: such is our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
vnderstanding, as they rather confound all
things, then by distinguishing them to make choice
of the worthiest; for let a Noble-man be popular, if
<pb facs="tcp:5263:14"/>
he haue an ill face, it is termed warlike, his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse
is termed good fellowship, his slouenliness,
humility, his prodigality, liberality; thus is vertue
suppressed, and forced with her own titles to adome
her mortallest aduersaries. But, to returne to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
King had not his mercy exceeded his cruelty,
his safety had been better secured, and his name not
so much subiect to obloquy: for though he cut off
the head of a mighty Conspirator, yet he suffered the
conspiracie to take so deepe root, that (in the end)
the branches thereof ouertopped his glory, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uershadowed
his greatnesse.<note n="c" place="margin">

well knew; yet mercy, loue, lenity so preuailed

could he do lesse then let her vnderstand, that hee

Vsurper (as that he could not be now, standing after
the death of his Nephewes in the same ranke, that
<hi>Edward</hi> the fourth his brother did) yet his equity in

should and ought to haue tempered the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:5263:15"/>
of his most malicious enemies, with no lesse
mercifull gentlenesse he vsed her husband, (and that)
at such time as her sonne was already landed, and
made claime to the kingdome: for hee onely tooke

               </note> the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> as an hostage, and
then suffered him to go into the Country to leuie his
forces: so farre was he from bloud and cruelty, as,
though he knew his alliance to the contrary faction,
a motiue, sufficient to make him (as indeed hee
did) incline to their ayd, though hee might iustly
suspect him, and could not haue wanted colour to
haue beheaded him (as being father-in-law to his
Competitor) yet he only detained his sonne in his
Campe; and when hee had assured notice of his
Fathers disloyall reuolt, yet he suffered the Hostage
of his loyalty to liue: an euidence effectuall enough
to testifie, that he desired rather to settle, then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
the quiet of this Land; that he laboured
to win the hearts of his subiects, rather with meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
then cruelty; what Prince could haue done
lesse? Nay, what King would not haue done more?
since both the effect, and the present feare, are both
such inward tormentors, that it is hard to determine
which is most grieuous: so opposite, so contrary to
the nature of a Prince (borne, not to feare, but to be
feared) that it is most iust, most naturall, to remoue
such a terrour; but now<note n="e" place="margin">Henry <hi>the</hi> 7.</note> the <hi>Heire of Lancaster</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to challenge the Crowne, what did the
King? Did his spirits faile him? Was his magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
courage daunted? No, he then gathered
new spirit, he new steeled his courage, he withstood
him with the height of fortitude; protesting rather
to dye valiantly, then to liue lesse then a King. With
<pb facs="tcp:5263:15"/>
what a <hi>Roman-like</hi> spirit did he resist fortune? being
ouerthrowne, how Heroically did he encounter with
death? This our detracting <hi>Chroniclers</hi> cannot but
acknowledge: for so high, so powerful was his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity,
that (in spight of malice) it preuaileth, and
(like the Sunne) breaketh thorow the misty clouds
of his aduersaries slaunders: was it a fault to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>Lancastrian</hi> heires claime? then those are
faulty, who being in possession of lands, to proue
good their title, prosecute suites, and are ouerthrown
by the lawe: for the sentence of iudgement makes
them to perceiue that to be an errour, which before
they imagined none. Besides, he knew well, that his
kingdome &amp; life had both one period, to which life
he was perswaded his Competitor had no right, and
therefore he would neuer be guilty of such a sinne (as
wilfully to betray it) till he which had lent it him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
repayment.</p>
            <p>Had his life, his actions been most abominable;
yet (like a slaue) to haue yeelded his throate to the
execution, would haue been an imputation beyond
all other imputations: but could he as openly haue
manifested his other vertues, as he did his valor and
policy, the worlds opinion had been otherwise, and
I neither had taken such paines to defend his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
nor in some weake iudgements to endanger
mine owne. But surely he did couragiously and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
withstand his enemies, with great expedition
rallying his forces, and performing all things with
wonderfull celerity, he went to encounter the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his quiet.</p>
            <p>It is reported, that, the night before the day of
battaile, he dreamed a most<note n="a" place="margin">K. <hi>Rich.</hi> dream the night before the battaile of Bosworth.</note> dreadfull and horrible
<pb facs="tcp:5263:16"/>
dreame, which by our Chroniclers is interpreted to
be a testimony of his wicked and tyrannous life. Did
not <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> is the life of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, Dion</hi> and <hi>Brutus.</hi>
               </note> before he attained the Empire, dreame
that he knew his owne Mother carnally? had not
both <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> the figures of terrible spirits
represented vnto them, the night before their end?
and yet these were reputed good men, and louers
and protectors of their Countrie; and because king
<hi>Richard</hi> dreamed with some terrour, must his life of
necessitie be euill? O vaine! O friuolous obiection!
but they hold this dreame to be a compunction of
his conscience: happy Prince to haue so indiscreete
slaunderers; for how could they more truly witnesse
his integrity? since onely they which reuerence and
feare God, are indued with that inquiring consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which censureth their actions: for they which
are giuen ouer to a reprobate sence, are insensible
of that good Angell, which seeketh by telling vs our
faults, to make vs repent our sinnes past, and to bee
wary, lest we commit any more.</p>
            <p>Surely, I thinke, his conscience (like a glasse) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
before him the figures of all his actions;
which he faithfully examining, humbly craued par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for his misdeeds: and so hauing made atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with God, like a deuout Penitentiary setled his
minde, he went with alacrity to the bloudy Court,
where the cause of his life was to be tryed: where
his sword being his Aduocate, pleaded most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly.
In all which tumult, he failed neither in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
nor in execution, but boldly encouraged his
Souldiers, both by word and example.</p>
            <p>There is extant in our Chronicles, an<note n="a" place="margin">The Oration of K. <hi>Richard. Holliniheds</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Oration,
which at that time he made to his Souldiers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:5263:16"/>
he confesseth his errors, and desireth pardon of all
the world, as he hoped his repentant teares had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
mercy of God.</p>
            <p>What a Saint-like thing was this, for a King, to
craue forgiuenesse of subiects? for a Generall, to
humble himselfe to his Souldiers? What could it be
but the effect of a more diuine, then terrene vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing?
If (like the common fashion of men) he
would haue put his affiance in humane assistance,
and neglected his God, he might (in common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
haue promised himselfe the victory: being dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in forces, and nothing inferior, either in valor or
policy; but hee acknowledged and confessed the
power of the most powerful: he knew that it was not
the multitude of men, but God, that giueth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
And therefore hauing first made peace with
his owne soule, he humbled himselfe, and asked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of those, ouer whom he had gouernment: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no gouernment to be so perfect, wherein some
good men are not offended.</p>
            <p>This was the effect of his compunction; to put
him in remembrance, that Princes are mortall, and
that his being a King, bound him to a more strict
reckoning, then one that enioyeth a lesser Farme.
Now whether this mercifull remembrance of God
disgraceth him, iudge ye that haue grace. But now
(both battailes being ioyned) what did this valiant
King? Did he onely stand to giue directions to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
No, he did rigorous execution with his sword
vpon his enemies.</p>
            <p>Did he, when he perceiued some of his Subiects
disloyally to reuolt, and that his forces were put to
the worst, thinke vpon yeelding or flight? Though
<pb facs="tcp:5263:17"/>
by some of his faithfullest seruants he was counsai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to flie, and for that purpose presented with a
Horse of wonderfull speed, yet hee would not: for
hauing been inured to conquest, he scorned to yeeld:
hauing been a King, he would not die a vassall; and
therefore, because the garland was a Crowne, the
prize a Kingdome; victory, Maiestie, and perpetual
renowne the reward, this Lyon-hearted King cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
charging his speare, ran into the Battalion
of his aduersaries; where, with his owne hands hee
slew the stout<note n="a" place="margin">S. <hi>Wil. Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Standard-bearer to <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. slaine. He was father to <hi>Charles Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> after crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted D. of Suff. by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8.</note> Sir <hi>william Brandon,</hi> Standard-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of his enemy: he ouerthrew the strong and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Sir <hi>Iohn Cheney,</hi> and singled out his Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour:
who beeing the most Heroick and valiant
Prince of those times, yet had doubtlesse been slaine,
had not he been rescued by S. <hi>William Stanley,</hi> who
came happily with three thousand men to his res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue,
who on all sides encompassing King <hi>Richard,</hi> so
assayled him, that though he did more then a man,
though his Sword acted wonders, yet beeing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by so great a multitude, hee was there man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
slaine; not ouercome, for hee conquered the
betraiers of men in danger, passion, and feare.</p>
            <p>Thus lost he both kingdome and life, but nothing
diminished his interiour vertues: When the adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
punishment is performed, our Laws do account
the offender as cleere of the crime, as if he neuer had
committed it. Why should this common benefit be
denied a King, since if guilty, his bloud made resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and being dead, his royall body was dispoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of all kingly ornaments, left naked, and not only
vnroyally, but inhumanely, and reprochfully drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
Yet neither can his bloud redeeme him from
<pb facs="tcp:5263:17"/>
iniurious tongues, nor the reproch offered his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
be thought cruell enough, but that we must still
make him more cruelly infamous in Pamphlets and

with other Princes; iudge truely of all their
actions, their forme of gouernment, and their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and ordinances, the vpholders, the strength,
the sinewes of gouernment; and thou shalt find him
as innocent of cruelty, extortion, and tyranny as the
most; as wise, politike, and valiant as any: if so,
censure him, his actions, his ordinances, according
to their deserts, and this Treatise of mine as a
charitable well-wishing to a scandalized
and defamed king.</p>

And why then should men here on earth thinke
skorne of this name, which is well brooked by stars
of the first magnitude, and Goddesses of the fairest
beauty? But because <hi>Deriuations</hi> doe many times
<hi>driue words out of fashion,</hi> and a notation of names is
of all the Artificiall Arguments in Logick, one of the
weakest, lest, by seeking to lift the Pasty by one end,
we marre all; let vs fasten vpon some thing more
materiall, and from the originall of the word, come
to the beginning of the thing.</p>
            <p>Amongst those rich treasures, which <hi>Christopher
Columbus</hi> brought home into Spaine, after his disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of the Indyes, one of the chiefest was the <hi>Pockes;</hi>
For in his Fleete (amongst other fraught) were waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ouer certaine Indian Women, with whose hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
conuersation the <hi>Castilians</hi> came home plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnished with this holy contagion: Holy I call it,
because the cure of it is that, which they call <hi>lignum
sanctum,</hi> or <hi>Guaiacum;</hi> Holy, for the place, where it
is healed, which is the Hospitall; called by the
French, <hi>Maison-Dieu,</hi> &amp; holy, because they are great
helpes to make them that haue them, Saints. For,
whosoeuer shall behold the outward mortification
of a pocky companion, the delicacie of the tone of
his voyce; his pale and meagre face; his wanne
colour; and his whole body broken and disioynted,
that a man may shake all his bones together in his
<pb facs="tcp:5263:19"/>
skinne; and lastly, shall see him wholy made a very
picture and painted table of repentance; hee may
see sufficient tokens (at least wise) of apparant holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
for you neuer see fat panches, and plumpt
cheekes, and idle fellowes euer admitted into the
schoole of repentance; nor into the Stewes the
workehouse of Courtizans; nor in the Hospitall
and Lazer-house of the <hi>Pock-rotten</hi> aduenturers.</p>
            <p>Among the three Capitall enemies which with
fire and sword doe assaile the soule, the greatest of
them, which is the flesh, is wholy subdued by the
<hi>Pocks:</hi> because by them it is made vnable to exercise
any vnlawfull act. Is there any thing in the world
that doth more open the gates to holinesse, then
to take away the occasions of sinning? and what is
there that hath more efficacie to withdraw a man or
a woman from occasions of euill, then this holy lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie?
for if a woman know that a man hath the
<hi>Pocks,</hi> she flies from him as a ragged sheepe from a
bramble-bush. Againe, what greater token of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
can there be in a man, then to haue a sense
and feeling of his sinnes? Now who is he that doth
suffer greater griefe and paines for his sinnes, then
he that hath the <hi>Pocks?</hi> Who are more franke and
more bountifull in gifts then such men? for a <hi>Pock-master</hi>
was neuer accounted a pild paltry fellow. For
as when wee see a Black-moore crosse the street, we
say, speaking by the contrary, There goes <hi>Iohn Blanco:</hi>
or when we see a common woman, wee likewise say,
There goes a <hi>good one:</hi> so we call this holy infection,
the <hi>peeling disease,</hi> vnderstanding that such a one will
part with his very skinne.</p>
            <p>All other aches and paines haue some enemy
<pb facs="tcp:5263:20"/>
that may destroy them; or by a bill out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
shop, like a writ of Remoue, they may be
dislodged; but the <hi>Pocks</hi> haue made their peace
with all drugs and confections, there is not found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Phials and Gally-pots any simple, or
syrop so powerfull, that can disturbe the <hi>Pocks</hi> out of
their possession: whence it is plaine, that it is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and abusiuely called an infirmity: for the word
<hi>infirmitie</hi> argueth and importeth want of firmenes;
whereas the <hi>Pockes</hi> are so farre from not beeing
firme, that to him that hath once caught them, they
continue so firme, so stable and so well settled; that
they neuer forsake him, but accompany him to his
graue; and I thinke, into Purgatory too, because no
lenitiues, or purgations, can either asswage their
paine, or driue them out; surely so good a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
goes to Hell.</p>
            <p>They that set out the worth and greatnesse of that
excellent Poet <hi>Homer,</hi> ascribe it much to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that hee drew his beginning from many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Islands, as <hi>Smyrna, Rhodos, Colophon</hi> and the
like: how much greater is the honour of this sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
gangren of the <hi>Pocks,</hi> which deriues his descent
not from Ilands and Citties, but from great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Prouinces. Some call it the <hi>Neopolitane
disease;</hi> others the <hi>French euill;</hi> some the <hi>scab of
Spaine,</hi> others the <hi>Indian Sarampion or tetter,</hi> and
<hi>ring-worme;</hi> Others that speake with some reuerence
and respect to these Lady-mistresses, they feare to
vsurpe their proper name; they do not say plainly to
a man, You are a <hi>Pockie-knaue,</hi> but rather <hi>Vous auez,</hi>
sir, <hi>ye are</hi> pepper'd; and indeed such is the dignity
and greatnes of this malander, that they speake of
<pb facs="tcp:5263:20"/>
it, after the stile of Kings and Dukes and Grandes,
in the plurall number. For whereas we commonly
call blaines and sores in the singular number, <hi>the
scurfe,</hi> or the <hi>scabbe,</hi> or the <hi>Winchester goose,</hi> these are
all saluted in the plurall number, the <hi>Pocks,</hi> as if they
should stile themselues <hi>nos bubones, &amp; pustulae Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canae.</hi>
And well doth this stile agree vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they deale royally and nobly with their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants;
for whereas in Princes Courts they that are
suiters, do not see an end of their pretensions in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares, and when all comes to all, they seldome
reape the fifth part of what they sued for: these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
do soone dispatch all that negotiate with them,
or plead at their barres, wonderfully well prouided
for.</p>
            <p>Now let not any man obiect as an inconuenient,
that the <hi>Pocks</hi> do peele all those that are of their fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
&amp; liuery, &amp; make them as bald as an egge: for
if we consider it, they do vnto them no therein small
benefit: For looke what proportion the leaues beare
to the Tree, feathers to a Bird, the same haue the
haires and the bush-naturall to a man, that is, they
are giuen both for an ornament and a defence; for a
couering and for comlinesse.</p>
            <p>And seeing that Nature doth do trees a fauour, in
making them to shead their leaues, and Fowles to
moulter their feathers, that so she may dight them
and cloath them yeerely with new; shee doth not
deale so with men, but leaues them to themselues, to
effect it by their own industry and prouidence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
when they are disposed to moulter and to doe
off their perriwigs or perruques, the <hi>Pocks</hi> in this
case is Natures agent, which doth maintaine her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb facs="tcp:5263:21"/>
with that which is most delicate in that subiect,
such as are the thin lockes of the head, the daintines
of the eye-liddes and the eye-browes; the venerable
beards, &amp; the most valiant mustaches: for neuer any
timerous and white-liuered cowards haue the <hi>Pocks,</hi>
but the most foole-hardie aduenturers are admitted
into this corporation.</p>
            <p>It is a rule infallible, that men are vsually such as
are those with whom they conuerse. And who are
they (I pray you) that are most hanted with the Pocks
but noble Lords, Caualiers, and men of high pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage?
The plow-swaine or day-labourer neuer
knew that there was any such thing in the world as
the Pocks; such is their miserable ignorance; nor
yet the Porters or Carre-men are greatly troubled
with this Luggage in their owne persons, neither
doe they euer descend so low as to chare-maids and
Tankard-bearers. But you must seeke for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the lusty gallants, and gay Ladies that ruffle
it in silkes, and outward brauery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore
may it please thee to be aduertised, gentle Reader,
whosoeuer thou be that standest vpon complement;
that whensoeuer thou shalt salute such a Ladie or
Caualier in the street, by vailing thy bonnet, know,
that by that obeysance thou dost homage to two
Grandes and great personages at once, one to the
party principall that is obuious to thy eye, the other
to the Pocks which he carrieth about him.</p>
            <p>How doth the world dote vpon Astrologers and
Starre-gazers, that can foretell and diuine of things
to come, whether they bee the writers of the
Greeke <hi>Menologies and Calenders</hi> of the Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
variation of dayes; or Prognostications of the
<pb facs="tcp:5263:21"/>
changes of the Moone: or dayes Almanackes for
the alteration of the weather? Whereas there is no
Astrologer more vveather-wise then a Pock-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or whose predictions are more certaine: for, if
there be any change of weather or season appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
presently the intrinsecall Accidents that
cleaue to his bones &amp; sinews, do giue him a perfect
notice of it, in that he feeleth an ache in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missure
of his ioints, and his bones doe euen rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in his skinne.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto, that men thus affected (or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
rather) haue this great priuiledge aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, that although they be in vassallage, and
slaues by condition, yet are they obserued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
as absolute Lords; and are serued of euery
bodie, whereas they serue none but God, whom
by the <hi>Pocks</hi> they are brought to remember. And
see, I pray you, to what a Lordlinesse they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced,
in that not onely their persons are in a
manner sacred, and may not be approched, but at
a certaine distance; but whatsoeuer is about them,
and belongs to their necessary vse, cannot safely be
touched of any man, as if they were some holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;
For no man dares to lye in their bed, or to
weare their clothes, or to drinke in their cup, or to sit
in their chaires; men willingly withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from these things, as from vessels consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this great Idoll of the Bubositie.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, it is not greatly to be maruailed at; that
the <hi>Pocks</hi> haue attained to so high a pitch and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
of excellency, considering that the same
act and operation, and the same instruments which
Nature imployeth to produce a man, which is the
<pb facs="tcp:5263:22"/>
noblest of her creatures; the same are also the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerature
causes of the <hi>Pocks;</hi> I meane, the great and
honourable <hi>Pocks:</hi> for those other pushes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations
that arise in the body, of cold, or from
an ouer-heated and exulcerated liuer, are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
pocks, but pouts and pimples. So then, this
reason being considered, the <hi>Pocks</hi> may very iustly
take state vpon them, and stand vpon <hi>puntillos</hi> of
honour, and out-braue a man to his face and say,
that they are issued from as good Parents as he. And
surely it seemes no lesse; for as they that are nobly
borne, the better to shew their greatnesse and to
maintain their state, they liue retiredly in the inmost
and remotest roomes of their house: so do the <hi>Pocks,</hi>
out of the same rule and reason of State, keep resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the very bones and the marrow of him that
hath them; which is the reason also why for their
birth and honourable ranke, they finde place and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
in <hi>Loues Court,</hi> into which nothing is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but what sauoureth either of greatnesse or of
goodnesse, as braue, resolute and determinate men;
gallant and faire women; free discourse; wanton
witty Poems, and plenty of great <hi>Pocks.</hi> And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what greater token can there be of a Noble Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then to shew thankfulnesse to those that haue
suffered any thing for their sakes, or done ought to
procure their good? in which kind of retribution
the <hi>Pocks</hi> are no way deficient. For whereas the nose
in the purchase of the <hi>Pocks</hi> doth suffer a kind of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and hurt by the arrosion of its gristle; to make
it ample amends and satisfaction; the <hi>pocks</hi> doe
make the nose the trumpet, or horn-pipe of their
owne prayses; whose gracefull tone varied Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
<pb facs="tcp:5263:22"/>
vpon the musicks and halfe-notes of snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
and snorting, is much like the vntamed voice
and braying of <hi>Silenus</hi> his hobby-horse.</p>
            <p>Now if there be any man so ill an husband, that
amongst other things of his owne getting and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
hath not been so happy, as to become owner
of the <hi>pocks;</hi> let him blame himselfe for an vnthrift,
that hath mis-pent his time; and say, that hee is
without them, because they are not within him: or
with the Spaniard, that <hi>hee wants them, because he is
not worthy of them:</hi>

            <head>THAT IT IS GOOD
to be in DEBT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are fallen into that dotage of
the World, in which, the worst
things doe ouertop the worthiest,
sence doth besot the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
drinke ouercommeth the
braine, and the eye beguyleth
and misleadeth the sight. And therefore in tender
commiseration of mankinde, I will endeuour to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
their iudgement in a Paradox, then which there
hath none more intricate, been discussed and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uassed
among the Stoiks in <hi>Zenos</hi> porch, that is, That
it is better for a man to liue in debt, then otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordiar ab ouo,</hi> I will begin from the egge, that your
concoxion may be the easier. In the whole course
and frame of Nature, we see that nothing is made
for it selfe, but each hath a bond of duty, of vse or of
seruice, by which it is indebted to other. The sunne
by his splendor to lighten all the world; by his
warmth and heate, to cherish and comfort each li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and vegetable thing. Yea, man himselfe is so
framed of God, that not onely his Countrey, his
Parents and his friends claime a share in him, but
he is also indebted to his dogge, and to his Oxe, to
<pb facs="tcp:5263:25"/>
teach the one to hunt for his pleasure, the other to
labour for his profit: so that <hi>quicquid habet genij, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genij,
moris, amoris,</hi> the abilities of his spirit, the
affections of his mind, he hath them for others, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as for himselfe; nay the more for others, by
how much hee desireth to be the greater Lord ouer
others. Let him but looke into himselfe, and see
how his constitutiue parts are debters each to other,
the soule doth quicken and giue life to the body, the
body like an <hi>Automaton,</hi> doth moue and carry it selfe
and the soule. Suruey him in his parts, the eye see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for the foote, the foote standeth for the hand,
the hand toucheth for the mouth, the mouth tasteth
for the stomacke, the stomacke eateth for the whole
body, the body repayeth backe againe that nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which it hath receiued, to al the parts, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the retriments by the <hi>Port-Esquiline;</hi> and all
this in so comely an order, and by a Law so certaine,
and in so due a time, as if Nature had rather man
should not haue been at all, then not to be a debter
in euery part of him; which hath made me resolue,
that to whomsoeuer I meane to bee a friend, I will
striue to be in his debt: and what can I do lesse? for
to him that doth mee a good turne, I am bound to
returne him the greatest pleasure; which I can no
way do, but by being in his debt: for what content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will it be vnto him, when I shall repay him his
owne againe? The Alchymists, who promise to
themselues to turne Tin into siluer, and Copper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
gold, how will they bee transported out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with ioy, if they should but see a happy issue
of their attempt? How much more a Creditor,
when hee shall recouer a desperate debt? It is like
<pb facs="tcp:5263:26"/>
the ioy of a Father that receiues his lost Child.</p>
            <p>Againe, he that is in debt, hath this great priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
aboue other men, that his Creditors powre
out hearty prayers for him, they wish that hee may
liue, and thriue and prosper, and grow rich, and all
for their owne aduantage. They seeme to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for their debtors, that they may not lose their
principall with the interest, for their money is their
life, witnesse those Vsurers of France, who, when
they heard that the price of Corne was fallen, went
and hanged themselues for griefe.</p>
            <p>What a command doth the debtor gaine ouer his
Creditors? He becommeth in a manner their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
to whom they cap, crouch, and kneele, as if
they did owe him all suits and seruices, and are as
ambitious of their fauours, as they who in Rome
did canuas the people for their voices to attaine the
greatest offices: but here is their cunning: <hi>Laudant
vt Leadant,</hi> they praise them, that they may prey v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.
And therefore, you braue gallants and spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts,
who find by your wofull experience, that no
whip giues a shrweder lash then the label of a Bond
or Obligation, with a <hi>Nouerint vniuersi Skinner</hi> and
<hi>Lacy.</hi> Whensoeuer you fall into the Mercers books,
neuer take care, or make conscience of paying your
debts, for by that meanes you shall keepe your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
in awe, and shall haue him wonderfull courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and officious, and obsequious towards you, and
a great mint-master of faire words.</p>
            <p>Without <hi>debt</hi> and <hi>loane</hi> the Fabricke of the world
will be disioynted and fall asunder into its first <hi>Chaos.</hi>
The beauty of the Starres, what would it be but vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and deformity, if the Sunne did not <hi>lend</hi> them
<pb facs="tcp:5263:26"/>
light? The earth would remaine vnfruitfull, if shee
did not <hi>borrow</hi> refreshing dewes from the watery
Signes and Planets. The Summer is pleasant, and
promiseth great hopes of plenty, but it is, because it
<hi>taketh vp much vpon trust,</hi> from the friendly and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
temperment of the Elements. And to say
the truth, there is nothing good or great in the
world, but that it <hi>borroweth</hi> something from others
to make it great, or <hi>lendeth</hi> to another to make it
good. And therefore I maruaile why Antiquity,
who made <hi>Mildew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. AErugo.</note> 
               <hi>Feauer,</hi> and <hi>Scuruinesse</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses,
did not matriculate <hi>loane</hi> and <hi>debt</hi> among the
rest.<note place="margin">2. Febris.</note>
               <note place="margin">3. Psora.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Elements who are linked together by a
league of association, and by their symbolizing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
doe barter and truck, borrow and lend one to
another, as being the Bursse, and Royall-Exchange
of nature: they are by this traffique and intercourse,
the very life and nourishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all sublunary bodies,
and therefore are called <hi>Elimenta quasi alimenta,</hi>
whose happy concord &amp; coniunction hath brought
forth those, whom the World for the good done to
mankind, hath esteemed gods, as <hi>Bacchus</hi> the great
Vintner, <hi>Ceres</hi> the Meale-mother, <hi>Flora</hi> the Tutty-maker,
<hi>Vertumus</hi> and <hi>Pomona</hi> Costard-mongers.</p>
            <p>Now, if euery man would render and repay in
full waight, that which by due debt he oweth and
hath borrowed from others, <hi>Saturnes</hi> golden age
would returne againe, in which there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of metals, but gold and siluer were all one
Oare, and made the yelke of the earth, Natures
great Egge, neither did <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> bound
out, and apportionate Lands and Lordships, by
<pb facs="tcp:5263:27"/>
meare stones, and diuersity of Tenures of sockage
and focadge; since when, <hi>Qui habet terras, habet guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
and the King of heauens peace hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbd
amongst men: but then all things were all
mens, as necessitie did allot and award, who was
then the onely iudge and arbitrator, competently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
to euery man, that which he stood in need
of.</p>
            <p>With what dearenesse haue both gods and good
men countenanced and graced debtors? To whom
<hi>Diana</hi> the great goddesse of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> granted her
Temple for a Sanctuarie, to keepe them out of
<hi>Bagwell: Pigeon-houses.</hi> Or if they were caught, <hi>Solon</hi> by
a solemne Law inacted, would not haue their bodies
to be fettered or manacled amongst malefactors, but
that they should enioy their liberty throughout all
the Parkes and Purlues of the prison, or to speake
more mildly, of their restraint &amp; indurance: For the
Prison is built Purgatory-wise, after the <hi>Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> with a <hi>Limbus</hi> and <hi>Tullianum.</hi> The
dungeon is the Deuils pinfold and the very suburbs
of Hell, where varlets, roarers, and stilettostabbers
are let downe, as the proper food that stuffes that
great greedy maw. The next roome is the Lollard
of trunck-hosed famulists and separatists, who after
they haue been rowelled in the neck, to cure them of
the Megrim of the head, they are by the gentle flame
of this Stoue, and the heate of their owne zeale,
made to sweat out their contumary and other pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
humors. The vpper skirt and stage of this
building, is the Garret of expencefull wasters, game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and vnthrifty debtors, where though they liue
robbed of their liberty, as they rifled others of their
<pb facs="tcp:5263:27"/>
money. Yet is it their great happinesse, that being
glutted, as it were, with an Apolausticke voluptary
life, they haue an easie ouverture made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue
and practick life of Vertue. Who euer
liued more like a Souc'd-gurn-head amongst men,
then <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick, barrelling himselfe vp in
his tubbe like a Kegge of Sturgion? Yet was the
happinesse of his contented life enuied of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Monarchs, who hauing made their throats the
through-face and the cullenders of meats &amp; drinkes,
found an ouergorged belly, to be Wits clog, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
sepulcher, Lusts Arsenall, the Magazin of lewd
practices, and the Nurserie of all vices: all which
prouocations are defalted by <hi>Debts</hi> wants and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
            <p>And lastly, the Lumbards, Vsurers, and Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who are the Bedles of Beggars, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Tetters vpon the body politike of the
Common-weale, who turne the Calends and new
Moones, and the Festiuall dayes of quarter-gaudies,
into the Octanes of disaster and Doomes-day rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings,
when any of these come to Heauen, there
is a wonderment amongst the Angels, and they cry
out with S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gurman</hi> of <hi>Alfarache, fruta nueua, fruta

are become the Popes cannonized and beatified

            <p>Farewell then, <hi>Vlpianus, Modestinus,</hi> and other
pettifoggers of the Law, Sollicitours, and mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of causes, who account being in debt a kind of
