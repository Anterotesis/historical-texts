            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arvel</hi> of <hi>Marvels,</hi> for that is the <hi>Character</hi> given you by a certain sort of Impertinent People who love mischief; Mischief your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Medium, which like a rich vein runs through the heart of all your Syllogismes, to the utter impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verishing of their Consequences; for, from a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous medium (as unfledg'd a Logician as you are) you may Cock-sure, inferr, there must necessarily follow a vile consequence.</p>
            <p>But, how defective soever you are in your <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes,</hi> you make ample satisfaction; nay, you su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42469:3"/>
in your <hi>Dilemma's,</hi> they are as surprizing as a <hi>Welsh-hook,</hi> with Pull her to her, push, her from her; of like a Rope and Butter, if th'one flip, t'other will be sure to hold. Your Similitudes are most apposite and unparallel'd, <hi>V. G.</hi> even as a Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow goes rumble-dee, rumble-dee, so my Lord Mayor owes me Five hundred pounds. Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are without example; for Quibbles you are the very word-pecker of word-peckers, and for Rhetorical flourishes (like a <hi>Whisler</hi> before a Morris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance) you carry it away from them all with flying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colours, your Workes being most artificially set forth and beautified with choice pieces of Poetry, like a Cow-turd stuck with Gillyflowers, most dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously inter-woven with Natural Experiments; most richly embroidered with Theological Notions; most magnificently Tapestry'd with Reasons of State, hanging down in Clusters like bunches of Grapes; and most prodigiously stuff'd with Witty Conceits, thicker than Cloves in a Gammon of Bacon at <hi>Easter.</hi> Your Stile is for the most part smooth and insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet happily diversified here and there with Jirks and short Girds, as if you had a spice of the String<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halt: although in your Clauses and Parentheses you are as unhoopable as if you stood with one leg at <hi>Dover</hi> and the other at <hi>Calais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to make up more roundly to you, and to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate your Metaphysical parts, were not compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Odoriferous, I would play you off, for Cases of Conscience and Knotty points of Divinity, to <hi>Hugh

Peters</hi> himself: Yea, you have with the same Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical Devotion, as liberally communicated your Spiritual Talent, yet I would not advise you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Precedent too far, left you fall again into the Clutches of Father <hi>Gregory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mum's</hi> the Word, you understand me. As for your Morality I am unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to harp too much on that string; thou Man of <hi>Morals</hi> seek severity elsewhere, I dare not be thy caution. I must confess it is enough to throw any man into a Fit of the Staggers to reflect upon your Confidence: that you who have been your self first Graduated at <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> and afterwards Civiliz'd in <hi>Barbary</hi> (your own Writings are sufficient Evidence:) that you, to whom railing is as natural as habitual, a property belonging to you (<hi>quarto modo</hi>) should have so cauteriz'd a Conscience as to brand your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary without having the least regard to his Function, with Petulancy, want of Humanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this you modestly term onely a competent stock of Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Nature, which you alwayes carry about you, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to self-preservation, left you should be found <hi>felo de se; risum teneatis Amici</hi>? Is not this a pleasant companion?</p>
            <p>How it tickles my fancy to think what a general Jubilee there would be, and how unmercifully it would edifie with your Party to see you set Doctor-<hi>Cathedraticus</hi> in a Cucking-stool, Lording it over your Female-Auditory, the Water-<hi>Nymphs</hi> of <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> Magisterially maintaining your polemical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Debates, &amp; <hi>tanquam ex Tripode,</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42469:4"/>
your Oracles concerning the Power of Princes; the Liberty of the Subject; the Authority of the Magistrate; the Obedience of the People; the Duty of the Prelates and Pastors unto their Flock; <hi>cum multis aliis</hi>: And, when you have tired your Auditors as well as your Readers, with your frequent Tautologies upon the same subject, 'tis but shifting your leg in your Gallop (left you fall into a Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot) and changing your Text, all will do well I'l warrant you.</p>
            <p>Y'faith never leave them so (like Sir <hi>Martin Marral</hi>) when ones hand's once in there's no giving over, one Lesson more on the Lute, and then let them ring the Bell, vociferat, and proclaim unto them, with Mouth as wide as Oyster-womens, who stand gaping at you like their Oysters, that now they are to expect Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies. Preach unto them the Wonders of the Deep, and in Confirmation of your Doctrine, let them see that you can at the very first plunge descend Doctor-<hi>Dodypole,</hi> and rise up again sous'd <hi>Gurnet</hi>: This Metamorphose will doubtlesly work with them like the shavings of an Elder stick scrap'd upwards and downwards. Yet, for all that, before you can have shak'd your eares, they will have re-setled their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, and then they will set out their Throats afresh, and be bauling for a new Frolick, gratifie them once more with a Cast of your Office, convince them that you can out-dive <hi>Gretorix,</hi> play me the Dy-dapper featly, dive me below Bridge, and rise up again <hi>visa vis de Lambeth,</hi> that your Adversary may see, <hi>mal-gre</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42469:4"/>
all his endeavours, you still bear your head above water; nor can all the water in the <hi>Thames,</hi> though at spring-tide cool your courage, no more than it can wash your foul-mouth clean; <hi>dico hoc sobria tristitia</hi>: I must unbutton my bosome, it is a very foul Mouth indeed, I speak not in the least to flatter, but as it is really my opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mais a la Guerre, a la Guerre,</hi> Summon forth the Foe to a Sea-fight, let him know you came not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fish for <hi>Todpoles, Allons courage de Tripas Corazon</hi>; he shall find you <hi>per Mare per terras semper idem, in utrumque paratus.</hi> What though you are neither Flesh nor Fish, nor good Red-herring, your Adversary is not <unclear>us'd</unclear> to Otter-hunting, never fear him Man, let him come if he dare: Oh happy if he come not, he shall soon be taught what it is to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any of the Race of <hi>Dametus</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus may you, by these heroical atchievements, dub your self Metropolitan Knight-Errant of this Age, <hi>sileant Miracula Memphis</hi>; no more let the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous relations of Monstrous Whales be read, their coming up the River will seem to portend little, when so stupendious a Cods-head as yours has been seen as high as <hi>Lambeth</hi>; 'Tis you will be the <hi>stupor mundi,</hi> and <hi>swell our Almanacks</hi> with strange Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks.</p>
            <p>And now, Marinated Sir, having thus generously maintained your Amphibious valour, <hi>Hixius Doxius</hi> reconveigh your self ('tis done in the twinckling of a Bedstaffe) unto the sweet Society of the Sisters of

            <p>You'l find them so tenderly officious, that both the fore and hinder part of a Shift shall be at your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for the rubbing your Politick Pragmatical Pate. But, what think you now of a comfortable impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? I am afraid in this, critical minute you would be found <hi>minus habens,</hi> and when once a man pleads <hi>non solvent,</hi> it is high time to put up his Pipes and go to sleep: And so for a while I will leave you to your rest; but, when you have been well rub'd and scrub'd, and sub'd, my dainty fine Don, we'l play tother party at Tennis, or Bandy a Ball or two and part fairly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonjour, bonjour</hi> Monsieur; What, infected with your Adversaries disease, a dull lazy distemper? <hi>a Cheval, a Cheval,</hi> I hope I have not wak'd you too early, you'l be froward all the day after, <hi>Naturam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellas furca licet</hi>; well now we are upon <hi>Terra firma</hi> again, What shall we be at next? not Controversy I beseech you, <hi>Pruritus disputandi scabies Ecclesiae.</hi> Besides, I believe you are no more a slave to Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion (here I confess my self a Plagiary) then you are to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies: and, when once such mushrome Monsieurs as you (I speak onely as to your Politick Capacity) for I know you are a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42469:5"/>
descended from the <hi>Stand-ups</hi> by your Father, and the <hi>Stradlings</hi> by your Mother: When such Mountebanks shall Pirk up upon the Stage, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to impose upon <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> we need not consult Mr. Conjurer <hi>Lilly</hi>; there would be no star Y'faith for the Gentry and Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> no more than there would be for the Clergy. That Parish must needs be well Govern'd where the Devil is Constable, I confess my self as to the Politicks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Yet, it may be worth your observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that though by the Act of Oblivion our sins were forgiven us, yet we are not warranted by it to forget our selves: The Parish-Priest ought to remember that once he was a Clerk. It is not now as when <hi>Andreas</hi> liv'd. Is it possible you should be such a Goliah as you make your self? that, like a Fly in a Dung cart you raise such clouds of dust, that to allay them there must be summon'd in the whole <hi>posse Archidiaconatus</hi> of a Province. Is it <hi>side dignum</hi> that the whole <hi>posse-Comitatus</hi> of the County should be on foot, and that there should not be one Man found who dare cry Boh to a Goose. <hi>Aotos Perros con es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos huessos.</hi> If you impose at this rate, you will come to put false Nine-pins upon us at last. Sure you imagine that in this Iron Age men have Estrich sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, and can digest any thing, otherwise you would not hold forth such bold <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> as that there can be a Calumny-Office erected, and you not the sole Monopolist; or, that to be your Antagonist is the most dexterous, cheap, and legal way of <hi>Simony.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42469:6"/>
These are, I profess, Mysteries not calculated for my Meridian, they leave me groveling in the dark. I am so thick-scull'd I cannot apprehend, that to be your Antagonist, should qualifie a man for a Paritor, much less advance him to a fat Benefice. 'Tis luck is all, Winter or Summer, should it rain Benefices, 'twere a Noble to Nine pence, not one would fall on my head; yet, give me leave to tell you, it has been broken before now (by some Gifted with your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) and so has many an honest Man's besides for the same sin, <hi>viz.</hi> taking Unsanctity'd courses, stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the wayes of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> this was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of that Age) and treading in the forbidden paths of Allegiance; but let's be merry and wise, let's hear no more of those stories; you will tell us you have had new Lights enough to lead us out of that <hi>Cimmaerian</hi>-darkness, had we had but so much Grace as you to follow our late Reformers; Ho Ball ho, I thank you for your love, there's Money for your Mutton. I hold it as dangerous to follow an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> as to Dance the Cushion-Dance, a man may break his shins before he is aware; Play with me but hurt me not, <hi>via trita, via tuta.</hi> Well, plain dealing's a Jewel, whoever denies you to have a great share of Wit, may celebrate his own Festival on <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents</hi>-day, and wou'd be shrewdly suspected to want Pig sawce himself (Braines and Sage:) But, that a man may have Wit, and yet a Fool have the keeping of it, is no Modern <hi>Philosophy, verbum sapienti: Ergo</hi> this concerns not you Mr. <hi>M.</hi> However, let me hint
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42469:6"/>
thus much unto you by the way, when ever <hi>Nokes,</hi> You or I undertake to Act a serious part, should we be so jocund to dance the Hay after it, 'twere as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable as the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, there would be a <hi>Galli-crista</hi> alwayes in the middle; but, 'tis too late to think of dancing now, let me re-mind you, Friend, you have had your Nap already, and I begin to feel sand in my Eyes; wherefore, you will tie me to you with the Cables of intollerable tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if you will give me leave to rest,</p>
