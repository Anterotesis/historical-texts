            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</note> Possibly he that is iudged, may haue that strength of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>charity</hi>; that though rash vncharitable censures lie thicke in his way, he can lightly skip ouer all those stumbling blockes, and scape a fall. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had such a measure of strength; <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 4.3.</note> 
                     <hi>With me it is a very small thing,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I should be iudged of you, or of humane iudgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. If our iudging light vpon such an obiect, it is indeed no <hi>scandall</hi> to him: but that's no <hi>thankes</hi> to vs. Wee are to esteeme things by their <hi>natures,</hi> not <hi>euents:</hi> and therefore we <hi>giue</hi> a scandall, if we iudge; notwithstanding he that is iudged <hi>take</hi> it not as a scandall. For, that <hi>iudging</hi> is in it selfe a <hi>scandall,</hi> is cleere from ver. 13. of this Chapter; <hi>Let vs not therefore,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, iudge one another any more, but iudge this rather, that no man put a stumbling blocke, or an occasion to fall in his brothers way.</hi> And thus wee see foure maine Reasons against this iudging of our brethren. 1. We haue no right to iudge; and so our iudging is <hi>vsurpation.</hi> 2. We may erre in our iudgements; and so our iudging is <hi>rashnesse.</hi> 3. We take things the worst way when we iudge; and so our iudging is <hi>vncharitable.</hi> 4. Wee offer occasion of offence by our iudging; and so our iudging is <hi>scandalous. Let not him therefore that eateth not, iudge him that eateth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so I haue done with my Text in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vse of it:<note place="margin">§. 17. Application to the case in our Church.</note> wherein we haue seene the two faults
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17131:19"/>
of <hi>despising,</hi> and of <hi>iudging</hi> our brethren layd open; and the vglinesse of both discouered. I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to make such Application, as I promised, both of the <hi>case</hi> and <hi>rules</hi>; vnto some differences, and to some offences giuen and taken in our Church in point of <hi>Ceremony.</hi> The Case ruled in my Text was of <hi>eating,</hi> and not <hi>eating:</hi> the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which some maintaine in our Church, are many in the particular; (as of <hi>kneeling,</hi> and not <hi>kneeling; wearing,</hi> and not <hi>wearing; crossing,</hi> and not <hi>crossing. &amp;c.)</hi> but all these, and most of the rest of them, may be comprehended in grosse vnder the tearmes of <hi>conforming,</hi> and not <hi>conforming.</hi> Let vs first compare the cases; that hauing found wherein they agree, or disagree, we may therby iudge how farre Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> aduice in my Text ought to rule vs, for not <hi>despising,</hi> for not <hi>iudging</hi> one another. There are foure speciall things, wherin if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this our Case with the Apostles; in euery of the foure we shall find some agreement, and some disparity also: 1. The nature of the <hi>matter:</hi> 2. The abilities of the <hi>persons:</hi> 3. Their seuerall <hi>Practice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things: and 4. Their mutuall <hi>carriage</hi> one towards another. And first, let vs consider how the two cases agree in each of these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">§. 18. Agreement betwixt the two Cases.</note>First, the <hi>matter</hi> whereabout the <hi>eater</hi> and the <hi>not-eater</hi> differed in the case of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> was in the nature of it <hi>indifferent:</hi> so it is betweene the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>conformer,</hi> and <hi>not-conformer</hi> in our Case. As there <hi>fish,</hi> and <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>hearbes</hi> were meerely indifferent; such as might be eaten, or not eaten without sinne:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17131:19"/>
so here <hi>Cap,</hi> and <hi>Surplis, Crosse,</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> and the rest, are things meerely indifferent; such as (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their own nature) may be vsed or not vsed without sinne; as being neither expresly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor expressely forbidden in the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>persons</hi> agree. For as there, so here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> also; some are <hi>strong in faith,</hi> some <hi>weake.</hi> There are many, whose iudgements are vpon certaine and infallible grounds assured and resolued, and that <hi>certitudine Fidei,</hi> that <hi>Cappe,</hi> and <hi>Surplis,</hi> and <hi>Crosse,</hi> and the rest, are things lawfull, and such as may be vsed with a good Conscience. There are some others againe, who through <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> or <hi>preiudice,</hi> or otherwise weakened in their iudgements; cannot (or will not) be perswaded, that these things are altogether free from supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatrie: nor consequently, the vse of them from sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>practice</hi> of the persons are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As there, the <hi>strong</hi> did vse his liberty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the assurance of his knowledge (<gap reason="foreign">

what was threatned, (though not presently,) is yet <note n="e" place="margin">4. Kin. 10.10.</note> at last performed; yet where is his <hi>Iustice</hi> the while, (being a <note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.17.</note>

of this Scripture.

                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath excellently taught vs, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betweene <hi>colours</hi> that arise from <hi>passion,</hi> and from <hi>complexion.</hi> The one, hee saith, is scarce worth the name of a <hi>Quality</hi> or <hi>Colour</hi>; because it scare giueth <hi>denomination</hi> to the subiect wherein it is. If <hi>Socrates</hi> be of a pale, or an high-coloured <hi>complexion,</hi> to the question [<hi>Qualis est Socrates?</hi> What a like man is <hi>Socrates?</hi>] it may bee fitly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered (saith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> that he is a <hi>pale</hi> man, or that he is an <hi>high-coloured</hi> man. But when a man of another complexion, is yet <hi>pale</hi> for <hi>feare,</hi> or <hi>anger,</hi> or <hi>red</hi> with <hi>blushing</hi>; wee doe not vse to say, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can wee say properly, that he is a <hi>pale</hi> man, or a <hi>high-coloured</hi> man.

There is no better way to come to that knowledge, than by these two Notes; <hi>Vniuersality,</hi> and <hi>Constancy.</hi> First for <hi>Vniuersality</hi>; Physitians say of <hi>heate,</hi> and <hi>sweat,</hi>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:17131:158"/>
and such like things, <hi>Vniuersalia salutaria, partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia ex morbo.</hi> If a man be hot in one part, and cold in another; as if the <hi>palmes</hi> of his hands burne, and the <hi>soles</hi> of his feet be cold; then all is not right: but if hee be of an indifferent <hi>equall heate</hi> all ouer, that is held a good signe of health. Then for <hi>Constancy</hi> and Lasting; If the heate come by <hi>fits</hi> and <hi>starts,</hi> and <hi>paroxysmes,</hi> leaping eftsoones and suddenly out of one extreame into another, so as the party one while gloweth as hot as <hi>fire,</hi> another-while is chill and cold as <hi>ice,</hi> and keepeth not at any certaine stay; that is an ill signe too, and it is to be feared there is an <hi>Ague</hi> either bred, or in breeding: but if hee continue at some reasonable certainty, and within a good mediocrity of heate and cold; it is thought a good signe of health. As men iudge of the state of their <hi>bodies</hi>; by the like rule iudge thou of the state of thy <hi>soule.</hi> First, for <hi>integrity</hi> and vniuersality. Is thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> thy <hi>Obedience,</hi> thy <hi>Zeale,</hi> thy <hi>Hatred</hi> of sinne, other graces in thee <hi>Vniuersall?</hi> equally bent vpon <hi>all good,</hi> equally set against <hi>all euill</hi> things? it is a good signe of Grace and Sanctification in the heart. But if thou <hi>repentest</hi> of one sinne, and <hi>persistest</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if thou <hi>obeyest</hi> one commandement, and <hi>breakest</hi> another; if thou art <hi>zealous</hi> in one point, and <hi>coole</hi> in another; if thou <hi>hatest</hi> one vice, and <hi>louest</hi> another: flatter not thy selfe too much; thou hast reason to suspect all is not found within.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">§. 25. <hi>with sundry Reasons ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>;</note>Now the <hi>Reasons,</hi> why God should thus out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reward the outward workes of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; are: <hi>First,</hi> the manifestation of his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Goodnesse:</hi> that wee might know how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hee is to <hi>cherish</hi> the least sparke of any <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> in any man, be it <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>morall,</hi> or what euer other goodnesse it be; that he might thereby encourage vs, so to labour the improuement of those good things in vs, as to make our selues capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of greater rewards. <hi>Secondly</hi>; his <hi>Iustice</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in measuring vnto sinners and Hypocrites <hi>exactly</hi> according to the measure they mete vnto him. They <hi>serue</hi> him with <hi>graces,</hi> which are not true graces indeede: he <hi>rewardeth</hi> them with <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,</hi> which are indeede not true blessings. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what they must doe to God; and therefore they affoord him a little <hi>temporary obedience,</hi> and there is all the <hi>seruice</hi> he shall haue from them: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what God will doe for them, and in requitall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth them a little <hi>temporary fauour,</hi> and there is all the <hi>reward</hi> they must looke for from him. Here is <hi>Quid pro Quo</hi>: They giue God the <hi>outward work,</hi> but without any <hi>hearty affection</hi> to him: God giueth them the <hi>outward benefit,</hi> but without any <hi>hearty affection</hi> to them. For want of which <hi>hearty
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:17131:165"/>
affection</hi> on both sides, it commeth to passe, that neither is the outward worke truely <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, nor the outward benefit truely <hi>profitable</hi> to them. A <hi>third</hi> reason of Gods thus graciously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> dealing euen with Hypocrites, may be assigned, with reference to his owne deare <hi>Children</hi> and chosen; for <hi>whose good</hi> especially (next vnder his <hi>owne glory</hi>) all the passages of his diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence both vpon them and others are disposed in such sort as they are: as for whose <hi>comfort,</hi> this manner of proceeding maketh very much and sundry wayes; as I shall by and by touch in the <hi>Inferences</hi> from this Obseruation:<note place="margin">§. 26. <hi>And infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences thence</hi>;</note> whereunto I now come, because it is time I should draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>first</hi>; by what hath bin already said a way is opened for the clearing of <hi>Gods Holinesse</hi> in these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his proceedings. If sometimes he temporally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hypocrites; it is not either for their <hi>owne</hi>; or for their <hi>workes</hi> sake, as if he either accepted their <hi>Persons,</hi> or approued their <hi>Obedience.</hi> No: it is but <hi>Lex Talionis</hi>; he dealeth with them, as they deale with him. They doe him but <hi>eye-seruice</hi>; and he giueth them but <hi>eye-wages.</hi> Indeede God can neither be <hi>deceiued,</hi> nor <hi>deceiue</hi>: yet as they would deceiue God in their <hi>seruice,</hi> with such <hi>obedience</hi> as falleth short of true obedience; so they are deceiued in their <hi>pay</hi> from him, with such <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> as fall short of true blessings. And all this may well stand with Gods both <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Secondly</hi>; it appeareth from the premises, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Gods thus dealing with wicked and vnsanctified
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17131:166"/>
men, in thus rewarding their outward good things, giueth no warrant nor strength at all, eyther to that <hi>Popish</hi> corrupt doctrine of <hi>Meritum congrui,</hi> in deseruing the <hi>first grace</hi> by the right vse of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalls</hi>; or to that rotten principle and foundation of the whole frame of Arminianisme, [<hi>Facienti quod in se est, Deus non potest, non debet denegare gratiam.</hi>] We know, God rewards his owne true and <hi>spirituall graces</hi> in vs, with increase of those graces here, and with glory hereafter: wee see, God rewardeth euen false and outward &amp; <hi>seeming graces,</hi> naturall and morall good things, with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and temporall fauours. And all this is most agreeable to his infinite both <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>; and may stand with the infinite <hi>Puritie</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of his nature. But this were rather to make God an <hi>vniust</hi> and <hi>vnholy</hi> God; to binde him to reward the outward and <hi>sinfull</hi> workes of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, (for the best <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>morall</hi> workes without Grace are but such,) with true <hi>sauing Grace</hi> and inward sanctification. Other <hi>Inferences</hi> and vses more might bee added: as <hi>viz. thirdly,</hi> for our <hi>Imitation</hi>; by Gods example to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and to commend, and to cherish euen in wicked men, those <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>morall</hi> parts that are eminent in them, and whatsoeuer <hi>good thing</hi> they doe in outward actuall conformity to the reuealed will and law of God. And <hi>fourthly,</hi> for <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to such, as doe not yet finde any comfortable assurance that their obedience and good workes are true and sincere; yet to goe on, and not to grow <hi>wearie of well-doing:</hi> knowing that their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17131:166"/>
is not altogether in vaine; in as much as their workes (though perhaps done in Hypocrisie) shall procure them <hi>temporall blessings</hi> here, and some abatement withall (I adde that by the way) of stripes and euerlasting <hi>punishment</hi> hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But I passe by all these and the like <hi>Vses</hi>; and commend but one more vnto you: and that is it which I named before as one Reason of the point obserued, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Comfort</hi> of Gods deare children and seruants; and that sundry waies.<note place="margin">§. 27. <hi>especially for Comfort to the Godly.</hi> 1. <hi>against the prosperitie of the wicked</hi>;</note> 
                     <hi>First,</hi> here is comfort for them, against a <hi>Temptation</hi> which often assaulteth them, and that with much <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>danger:</hi> arising from the sense and obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>prosperitie</hi> and flourishing estate of the wicked in this world. We may see in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and elsewhere; how frequently and strongly <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 37. &amp; 73</note>

                     </note>Againe, here is a <hi>second Comfort</hi> for the godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>temporall afflictions:</hi> and it ariseth thus.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:17131:192"/>

                     <hi>one generation passeth, and another commeth</hi> after it, there is not <hi>another</hi> City, or Nation, or People than there was before, but <hi>the same.</hi> If then the people of the same land should <hi>in this generation</hi> bee visited with any such <hi>spirituall iudgement,</hi> as is the remoueall of their Candlesticke, and the want of the Gospell, for the sinnes and impieties of their Ancestors in some <hi>former</hi> generations: yet this ought no more to bee accounted the punishment of <hi>one</hi> for <hi>another</hi>; than it ought to be accounted the punishing of <hi>one</hi> for <hi>another,</hi> to punish a man in his <hi>old age</hi> for the sinnes

                     </note>Againe secondly; the <hi>want of the Gospell,</hi> is not properly a <hi>spirituall,</hi> but rather a <hi>temporall</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wee call it indeed sometimes a <hi>spirituall Iudgement,</hi> as wee doe the free vse of it a <hi>spirituall Blessing:</hi> because the Gospell was written for, and reuealed vnto the Church, by <hi>the spirit</hi> of God; and also because it is the holy ordinance of God, and the proper instrument whereby (ordinarily) the <hi>spirituall</hi> life of <hi>Faith</hi> and of <hi>Grace</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed into our soules.

                     <hi>spirituall blessings,</hi> which are immediately <hi>wrought</hi> in the soule by the spirit of God, and can neuer be <hi>lost</hi> where they are once placed, and are <hi>proper</hi> and peculiar to those that are borne againe of the spirit: and all those on the contrary, which may bee subiect to <hi>decay,</hi> or are <hi>common</hi> to the reprobate with the elect, or may turne to the <hi>hurt</hi> of the receiuer, are to be esteemed <hi>temporall</hi> blessings, and not spirituall. And such a
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:17131:193"/>
                     <hi>blessing,</hi> is the outward <hi>partaking</hi> of the word and ordinances of God: the <hi>want</hi> thereof therefore consequently, is to be esteemed a <hi>temporall</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather than spirituall. So that, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this instance, still the former consideration holdeth good: that God sometimes visiteth the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children with <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi>; but neuer with <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>eternall</hi> punishments.</p>
                  <p>Now, if there could no more bee said to this doubt, but only this; it were sufficient to cleere <hi>Gods Iustice:</hi> since wee haue beene already instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that these <hi>temporall iudgements</hi> are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> the punishments of sinne.<note place="margin">§. 15. <hi>Temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren though not properly</hi>;</note> For as <hi>outward blessings</hi> are indeed no true blessings <hi>properly</hi>; because <hi>Wicked</hi> men haue their portion in them as well as the Godly, and they may turne (and often do) to the greater <hi>hurt</hi> of the soule, and so become rather <hi>Punishments,</hi> than Blessings: so to the contrary, <hi>outward punishments</hi> are no true punishments <hi>properly</hi>; because the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> haue their share in them as deepe as the Wicked, and they may turne (and often doe) to the greater <hi>good</hi> of the soule, and so become rather <hi>Blessings,</hi> than Punishments.</p>
                  <p>If it be yet said; But why then doth God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them as <hi>Punishments,</hi>

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:17131:199"/>
farre as it reacheth:) they tell him the <hi>one</hi> cause, the <hi>occasionall</hi> cause, the <hi>outward euident</hi> cause: [Alas, Sir, he rode such a iourney, such a time, got wet on his feete, and tooke cold vpon it; and that hath brought him to all this.] That is all they are able to say to it: for other cause they know none. But by and by after some suruiew of the state of the Body, hee is able to informe them in the <hi>other</hi> cause, the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>originall</hi> cause; whereof they were as ignorant before, as he was of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward one: and hee telleth them the cause of the malady is superfluitie of crude and noisome <hi>humours,</hi> rankenesse of <hi>bloud,</hi> abundance of <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi> tough <hi>fleame,</hi> or some other like thing within. Now if it be demanded, which of these two is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>cause</hi> of his sicknesse? The truth is, that <hi>inward antecedent</hi> cause within, is the very cause thereof; although perhaps it had not bred a feuer at that <hi>time,</hi> if that other <hi>outward occasion</hi> had not beene. For by that <hi>inward hidden</hi> cause the body was <hi>prepared</hi> for an ague: only there wanted some <hi>outward</hi> fit <hi>accident,</hi> to stirre and prouoke the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> within, and to set them on working.

God punisheth the <hi>sonne</hi> for the <hi>fathers</hi> sinne: but with <hi>temporall</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not <hi>eternall</hi>; and with those, perhaps so as to redound to the <hi>fathers punishment</hi> in the son. Perhaps, because the sonne <hi>treadeth</hi> in his fathers steps; perhaps, because he <hi>possesseth</hi> that from his father, to which Gods curse adhereth; perhaps for other <hi>reasons</hi> best knowne to God himselfe, wherewith he hath not thought meet to acquaint vs: but what euer the <hi>occasion</hi> be, or the <hi>ends</hi>; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more for the sons owne <hi>personall sins,</hi> abundantly deseruing them.</p>
                  <p>And the same resolution is to bee giuen to the other <hi>two doubts</hi> proposed in the beginning:<note place="margin">§. 32. <hi>applied also to the rest.</hi>
                     </note> to that, Why God should punish any <hi>one</hi> man for <hi>another?</hi> and to the third, Why God should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the <hi>lesser</hi> offender for the <hi>greater</hi>? In which, and all other doubts of like kinde, it is enough, for the clearing of <hi>Gods Iustice,</hi> to consider: that when God doth so, they are first only <hi>temporall punishments</hi> which he so inflicteth; and those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly no more, than what the sufferer by <hi>his owne</hi> sinnes hath most rightfully deserued. All those other considerations, as that the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> are but <hi>one body,</hi> and so each may feele the smart of others sinnes and stripes: that oftentimes wee haue giuen <hi>way</hi> to other mens sinnes, when wee might haue <hi>stopped</hi> them; or <hi>consent,</hi> when wee should haue <hi>withstood</hi> them; or silent <hi>allowance,</hi> when wee should haue <hi>checked</hi> them; or perhaps <hi>furtherance,</hi> when wee should rather haue <hi>hindered</hi> them: that the <hi>punishments</hi> brought vpon vs for

our fathers or other mens sinnes, may turne to our great spirituall <hi>aduantage,</hi> in the humbling of our <hi>soules,</hi> the subduing of our <hi>corruptions,</hi> the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our <hi>care,</hi> the exercising of our <hi>graces:</hi> that where <hi>all</hi> haue deserued the punishment, it is left to the discretion of the <hi>Iudge,</hi> whom he will picke out, the <hi>Father</hi> or the <hi>Sonne,</hi> the <hi>Gouernour</hi> or the <hi>Subiect,</hi> the <hi>Ring-leader</hi> or the <hi>Follower,</hi> the <hi>Greater</hi> or the <hi>Lesser</hi> offender, to shew <hi>exemplary iustice</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he shall see expedient. I say, all these, and other like <hi>considerations</hi> many, though they are to be admitted as <hi>true,</hi> and obserued as <hi>vsefull</hi>; yet they are such, as belong rather to Gods <hi>Prouidence</hi> and his <hi>Wisedome,</hi> than to his <hi>Iustice.</hi> If therefore thou knowest not the very particular reason, why God should <hi>punish</hi> thee in this or that <hi>manner,</hi> or vpon this or that <hi>occasion</hi>; let it suffice thee that the <hi>Counsells</hi> and purposes of God are <hi>secret:</hi> and thou art not to enquire with scrupulous <hi>curiosity</hi> into the dispensation and courses of his <hi>Prouidence,</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it hath pleased him either to <hi>reueale</hi> it in his <hi>word,</hi> or by his manifest <hi>workes</hi> to <hi>discouer</hi> it vnto thee.

this ground, that Christ hath made them <hi>free.</hi> In this passage of the Chapter, the Apostle occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally correcteth this errour: principally indeed as the present Argument led him, in the particular of <hi>Marriage</hi>; but with a farther &amp; more vniuersal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to all outward <hi>states</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of life. The summe of his Doctrine, this.

                     <hi>Generall Calling</hi>; is that wherewith God calleth vs, either <hi>outwardly</hi> in the ministery of his <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>inwardly</hi> by the efficacy of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> or iointly by both, to the faith and obedience of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and to the embracing of the <hi>Couenant</hi> of grace and of mercy and saluation by Iesus Christ. Which is therefore termed the <hi>Generall Calling,</hi> (not for that it is of larger extent than the other, but) because the thing whereunto we are thus called, is <hi>one</hi> and the same, and common to all that are called. The same <hi>duties,</hi> and the same <hi>promises,</hi> and euery way the same <hi>conditions.</hi> Here is no difference in regard of Persons: but <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4.4.5.</note>

that our Apostle (as the streame of his Argument carryed him) here taketh the word in a much <hi>wider</hi> extent; as including not only such <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall courses</hi> of life as refer to imployment, but euen all outward <hi>parsonall states</hi> and conditions of men whatsoeuer, whether they haue such referencce, or no: as we may say, a man is called to <hi>Marriage</hi> or to single life, called to <hi>riches</hi> or pouerty, and the like.</p>

                     </note> concerning the <hi>Qualitie</hi> of a right Calling: and pointed out some speciall <hi>offenders</hi> against each of them. And now me thinkes I see the <hi>Vsurer</hi> hugging himselfe, and clapping his sides, that hee hath come off so fairely: surely his <hi>Calling</hi> is absolute good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none of these <hi>Rules</hi> could fasten. But it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede with the <hi>Vsurer</hi> in this case, as with the <hi>Drunkard.</hi> If the <hi>Drunkard</hi> should aske me against which of the <hi>ten Commandements</hi> hee offended; I confesse I could not readily giue him a direct punctuall answer: Not that he sinneth not against any; but because hee sinneth against so many of them, that it is hard to say against which most. He sinneth against the <hi>sixt</hi> Commandement, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempering his <hi>body</hi>; he sinneth against the <hi>seuenth,</hi> by enflaming his <hi>lust</hi>; he sinneth against the <hi>eighth</hi> by making waste of the good <hi>creatures</hi> of God. Right so is it with our <hi>Vsurer</hi> in this Case: Hee would pose me, that should aske me the Question, which of these three <hi>Rules</hi> fetcheth-in the <hi>Vsurer,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Calling.</hi> Verily, I cannot well tell which most; I thinke euery one of the three may: howsoeuer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the three, I am sure I haue him. If <hi>Vsury</hi> be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> simply <hi>vnlawfull</hi> (as most of the learned haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,) then the <hi>first Rule</hi> hath him. I should be very tender to condemne any thing as simply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, which any euen imaginary conjuncture of

circumstances would render lawfull; and would chuse rather by an <hi>ouer-liberall charity</hi> to <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 4.8.</note> 
                     <hi>couer a multitude of sinnes,</hi> (if I may abuse the Apostles phrase to that sense) than by a too <hi>superstitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint</hi> make one. Yet the Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> are so expresse, and the grounds of <hi>Reason</hi> so strong against all <hi>Vsury:</hi> that when I weigh these on the one side, and on the other side, how nothing all that is, which I euer yet saw or heard alleadged to the contrary; I cannot find in my selfe chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie enough to absolue any kinde of <hi>Vsury,</hi> with what cautions or circumstances soeuer qualified, from being a <hi>sinne.</hi> But I will suspect mine owne and the common iudgement herein, and admit for this once <hi>(dato, non concesso,)</hi> that <hi>Vsury</hi> bee in some case <hi>lawfull,</hi> and so our <hi>Vsurer</hi> escape the <hi>first Rule</hi>; which yet cannot be, till his <hi>teeth</hi> be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> knocked out for biting: But you must knock out his <hi>braines</hi> too, before he escape our <hi>second Rule.</hi> I dare say, the most learned <hi>Vsurer</hi> that liueth (and they say some learned ones are <hi>Vsurers)</hi> will neuer be able to proue, that <hi>Vsury,</hi> if it bee at all <hi>lawfull,</hi> is so lawfull, as <note n="b" place="margin">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> on the one side, so on the other side all our <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>defects,</hi> which might disable vs more or lesse for any emploiment, are to bee duely weighed and considered of: and the one laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other; that we may know how to make as neere as wee can a <hi>iust estimate</hi> of our strength and sufficiency. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is the safer way to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>vnderualue,</hi> than to <hi>ouerprize</hi> our selues: lest ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly confident, we affect a <hi>Calling</hi> aboue our <hi>strength</hi>; which were to <hi>flye</hi> with <hi>waxen wings,</hi> and to owe the world a laughter. Be we sure of this: if God haue not <hi>gifted</hi> vs for it, he hath not <hi>called</hi> vs to it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in the iudging of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <pb n="452" facs="tcp:17131:232"/>
wee should haue a regard to the outward <hi>circumstances</hi> of <hi>times</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and the rest. Those <hi>gifts,</hi> which would haue made a sufficient <hi>Priest,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> in that dearth of learning, and penury of the Gospell; now the times are full of knowledge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, would bee all little enough for a <hi>Parish-Clarke. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly,</hi> some thing would be yeelded to the iudgements of <hi>other men</hi> concerning our Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. It is either secret <hi>pride,</hi> or base <hi>faintnesse</hi> of heart, or dull <hi>sloath,</hi> or some other thing, and not true <hi>modesty</hi> in vs: if being excellently gifted for some weighty emploiment in euery other mans iudgement, wee yet withdraw our selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> from it with pretensions of vnsufficiency. <hi>Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and lastly; let vs resolue on that course, (<hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus;)</hi> not only for which we are <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently</hi> fit, but for which we are <hi>absolutely</hi> fittest. A good Actor it may bee could very sufficiently act any part in the play; represent the maiestie of a <hi>King,</hi> or the humour of a <hi>Swaggerer,</hi> or the prankes of a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or any thing: but yet if hee be notedly excellent at some part rather than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he would not willingly be put from that, to act another. <hi>Ergo histrio hoc videbit in scenâ, quod non videbit sapiens in vitâ?</hi> Shame we to let these men be wiser in their generations, than wee in ours.
