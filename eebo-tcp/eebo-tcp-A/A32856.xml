         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>JOHANNES CAMILTONUS,</hi>
and professed himselfe to have been

title of this booke was, <hi>De <unclear>studiis</unclear> Iesuitarum abstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioribus,</hi>
concerning the more secret and reserved pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises

having taught this Discoverer to speake our

against them, I dare boldly say, even your selves
being my Judges when you shall have read this small
tract, that the same course hath beene taken by these
common <hi>Incendiaries</hi> for breeding a disturbance, and
bringing all things into a confusion both in our Church
and State, that was then projected, and since then acted
upon <hi>Germany.</hi> Nor doe I thinke, but it is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowne to your Honours and grave Wisedomes, that
the same wheele of mischiefe, that wrought all the woes
<pb facs="tcp:94330:3"/>
of <hi>Germany</hi> since the yeare 1618. hath for some yeares
last past, <unclear>bin</unclear> set also at worke in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland:</hi> witnesse all the factions and fractions in
Church and State, the disturbances and discontents

betwixt the Clergie and the Clergie, betwixt the
Court and City, and betwixt the King and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
yea, even betwixt the two Crownes of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> all which have received their birth and
breeding from the devilish designes of those sonnes of
division, the Society of <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and beene fomented
almost to a perfect flame by their Agents, and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
their deluded Disciples of this Nation, and
had undoubtedly broken out, and produced in short
time, the like effects among us, that they have done in
<hi>Germany,</hi> had not Almighty God in meere mercy to
this Nation, and in his Divine compassion to his poore
Church in <hi>England</hi> thus ready to perish, stept in to our
rescue, by his blessed hand of providence stirring up the
spirits of our noble Peeres to represent to his sacred
Majestie the eminent danger, and gratiously inclining
his Royall heart to hearken thereto, and so that we may
say with the <hi>Psalmist, Ps. 118. 23. This was the
Lords doing, and it is marvailous in our eyes.</hi> And
the same God, if it be his blessed will, in his owne time,
by his owne meanes, perfect that good worke of mercy,
which he hath so gracioussy begun for us of this Land
and Nation, by rooting out from amongst us that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall
brood of <hi>Inigo Loiola,</hi> that our eyes may see it,

them, to read and take notice of the words following in
the place before-cited, yet, thus saith the Lord of Hosts,
<hi>They shall build up, but I will destroy, and men
shall call them the border of wickednesse, and the
people with whom the Lord is angry for ever:</hi> And
your eyes shall see it, and men shall say the Lords name

And to speake truly what I thinke, I must confesse that
I have conceived an hope of a long time, that this yeare
1641. which compleateth the Century since that Society
had their Bull from the Pope, under protection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they have wrought so much mischiefe, would shew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world an apparant alteration in the body of that
Monster, the Society of <hi>Jesuites.</hi> A point which I am
the rather induced to beleeve, because I have been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified

became Protestants. That booke also is to be seene,
and if it please this Honourable House to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it, shall be published also in <hi>English,</hi> for

how they could forbeare

the <hi>Iesuites:</hi> It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that one <hi>Iesuite</hi> when he looketh upon another
doth not straight way burst forth into a laughing

such impostures practised upon the people. I speake
not touching your simpler sort of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> from
whom these more reserved and closer practises of
the Society are altogether concealed, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94330:6"/>
they are not held wise enough (for sooth) to
be acquainted with them, or that they are thought
too devout to entertaine them, or else in regard of
their short continuance in that Society: for all
such are so kept short through severity of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
that not one of them, <unclear>except</unclear> he be wondrous
quicke of sent, can ever smell out in the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
what knavery is therein practised under a shew
of Holinesse. My discourse onely toucheth the
prime and principall fellowes of that Society, their
<hi>Regents, Fathers, Provincials,</hi> and <hi>Generals;</hi> all
which, are so universally and joyntly tainted with
all manner of wickednesse, but especially with
Whoredome, Covetousnesse, and Magicke, that
indeed any reasonable man may thinke it little lesse
then a Miracle, if a <hi>Iesuite</hi> of this ranke meeting
such another upon a sudden, and beholding, as it

will undoubtedly nominate, if they shall but dare
in the least manner to lift up their tongues against
mee, or to contradict what I have written. And
howsoever at this time I passe over things briefly,
and doe onely (as it were) give you a first draught
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94330:6"/>
thereof, I doe purpose in due time (God assisting
me) to doe it more largely and compleatly, with
expression of all and singular circumstances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
appertaining.</p>
            <p>First of all then, at your entrance into any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Iesuites;</hi> especially, if it be <unclear>scituated</unclear> in or
neere unto any large, and populous, and rich place.
But alas, why doe I say, if it be built there (seeing
they have no Colledges in any poore, meane, or
obscure place) At your first entry I say into such a
place or Colledge, take principall notice of the
Porter of their Gate, and him you shall find to
looke like unto the picture of a very <hi>Charon,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Cerberus;</hi> For the most part you shall observe
him to be a man of very great yeares, or if hee bee
younger, he is a fellow of most approved trust and
secrecy. And this is the man, if any such there be,
who is well skilled in all the mysteries of the <hi>Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
Caball,</hi> or reserved <hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this fellowes keeping is <unclear>great</unclear> store of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
both for Men and Women of every degree and
calling. And with this apparell doe the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
habit themselves according to the quality that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one findeth himselfe ablest to personate, and
so practice wonderfull Impostures in the World.
For at sometimes being habited like <hi>Souldiers</hi> very
gallant, they walke in the streets and highwayes
<hi>Whoring</hi> and <hi>Swaggering</hi> in the publike Stewes.
At other times in the civill habites of <hi>Citizens,</hi>
professing themselves to be of the reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they pry up and downe and listen in Innes, in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94330:7"/>
Play-houses, in Tavernes, upon the Exchanges
and in all places of publike meetings, wheresoever
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here is any frequent resort, what the people speak
up and downe concerning them, what consultations
are abroad, what matter of Action is set a soot in
any part. Another while, like Doctors of <hi>Physicke,</hi>
or of the <hi>Civill Law,</hi> with great Rings on their
fingers, avowing and purposely professing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be Papists; wheresoever they know any
of the Common sort that is wealthy and hath sons,
they devise some cause of businesse with them, and
insinuate themselves into their acquaintance by
strange fetches, and in Conclusion doe advise them
to bring up their sonnes in some Schoole or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> affirming that themselves have
beene educated by them, and that they have so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
under them, that (God be thanked) they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had cause to repent thereof: And sometimes
againe apparelled like Noblemen, and compleatly
attended, they cause Coaches to be provided abroad,
and frequent the Courts of Princes, as giving atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon Ambassadours of forraigne States, and
serve as Intelligencers to vnlocke the Cabinets of
great Potentates.</p>
            <p>Nay further, I have knowne them to make shew
of being banished persons, and to crave collections
amongst Protestant Divines, purposely to learne
under-hand what such men write against them: yea
such were those men for the most part, who so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
deluded so many Reverend men in many
places by <unclear>sinister</unclear> waies under that habit, furthering
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94330:7"/>
the <unclear>designes</unclear> of their Society, aud breeding distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
in the reformed Congregations: of whom,
to the end that all honest-hearted Ministers may be
more wary, I shall tell you hereafter, what projects
at this day the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have a foot to this purpose.</p>
            <p>But in the meane while perhaps you will say unto
me, whereto, I pray you, serveth so much womens
apparell, or what is their end in depositing so much
in the keeping of the Porter of their gate? Attend,
and J will tell you: No Pander, that ever <unclear>TERENCE</unclear>
or PLAUTUS mentioned in their Comedies, was so
nimble at the trade of winning pretty wenches, as
are the <hi>Iesuites</hi> at this day, but especially that Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their gate, whom I mentioned but now.</p>
            <p>For, that which the Confessors themselves are
not able to wring out of them by Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
in their Churches and Chappels, this fellow
knoweth how to winne from them by flattering
speeches, with wonderfull pleasing and delightfull
toyes, especially if he meet with a poore widdow,
or any such silly woman which sendeth her child
to the Colledge now and then for an Almes; or
with some Laundresse, or Spinster; for be she <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
or <hi>Netrix,</hi> hee will make her a <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etrix.</hi>
Whom so soone as this base Pander hath once but
allured to come to his net, although her apparell be
never so old and tattered, yet he hath gay Gownes
enough in store, with accoutrements suitable,
wherewith he can make her both tricke &amp; trimme,
which when he hath done, he knoweth how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
her through many secret passages and by-waies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94330:8"/>
to his <hi>Venerable</hi> Masters, the Fathers of the <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And yet he never doth this in the day time, but
neere upon the shutting in of the Evening, and then
they make away the whole night in Ryot and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with Revelling and Dancing, the younger sort
and Novices of the Society being kept farre enough
from Discovery thereof.</p>
            <p>For they have for the purpose certaine Vaults
framed like Chambers, and roomes under ground
as had those ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> who first devised
their Stewes in Vaults, whose inclination to all
carnall lasciviousnesse was so great, and so bruitish;
that the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> fearing the just anger of
their Gods for the same, utterly suppressed those
<hi>Lupanaria</hi> or publike Stewes.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the Iesuites Porter of their
Gate: onely I must not forget to tell you this one
thing, that if any party who by chance shall come
to the sight of such and so great a Wardrobe, doe
demand with admiration, what is the end or use of it,
answer is made unto them, that it is the Wardrobe,
reserved purposely for acting of Playes: but that is
the least part of their intention to my knowledge.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when thou entrest into any of their
Churches, make account that thou walkest under
an heaven of Iron: Bloody <hi>Mars</hi> is over thine
head, not that Prince of peace; below thee is tho
very pit of Hell, and a shop of Tormenters.</p>
            <p>J now doe relate in good earnest, what mine own
eyes have seene; At <hi>Prague</hi> in <hi>Bohemia</hi> upon the
roofe of their Churches are thousands of Iron Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
Whips, and fire-bals, such as the <hi>Bohemians</hi> use,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94330:8"/>
upon the sides are placed pieces of Ordnance, vvith
a great number of Musquets and Harquebushes,
with Pikes and Halberts. In the middest, where the
Arches meet, are great heapes of huge Bullets of
stone. And the like preparation have they also made
at <hi>Cracovia.</hi> Nor doe I make question, but that
upon due search their Colledges in other places,
would appeare as well provided.</p>
            <p>But some man may perhaps make question. To
what end Religious men should make such prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or what need there can be so to doe? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
the matter at the first sight astonished me, and
my best understanding was exceeding strange: but
thus standeth the case.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> know well enough, that the courses
which they have taken formerly, and now every day
doe take, are so indirect and turbulent, as m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>keth
them odious, to all such as they live amongst; yea,
to very Papists themselves, at least to the wiser sort
of them, in respect of many things which they have
done both tumultuously, and wickedly, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they have got footing in the least manner. For
they have no regard of any, they spare not to roote
up the very <hi>Catholiques</hi> themselves, so that they
may pleasure the <hi>Popes</hi> Holinesse therein, though
it were with the betraying of their Countries, and
setting the whole Christian world in a Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And therefore because they are in daily feare to
be massacred by those among whom they live, they
make this provident and timely prevention by
Warre-like preparation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94330:9"/>For indeed, they are afraid (as J my selfe have
heard them confesse) lest it might befall unto them
as unto the Knights <hi>Templers,</hi> who notwithstanding
they were forward enough to serve the Pope at all
times, and as good Catholiques as could be wished
in the matter of Religion; yet, for their too much
Ambition and Covetousnesse, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
insupportable, they were by consent of all
<hi>Christian</hi> Princes, and not without approbation
from the Pope himselfe, put to the Sword all at an
instant, and utterly rooted out almost in a moment;
as sometimes were the <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> those very <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi>
in effect, among the Heathen, served through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Italy,</hi> and the Provinces adjoyning.</p>
            <p>Now the reason, wherefore they doe make
choice to lay up their Armes and munition in their
Churches, is onely this: For if when any Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or rebellious tumult ariseth in a Province, the
Papists come thither to helpe and assist them, by
this meanes they have Armes for them in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
upon a suddain: but if any who are of contrary
Religion come thither to doe them wrong, or to
steale any thing from them, they have munition &amp;
stones above head, to destroy them withall before
they be aware. And is not this (I pray you) the ready
way to make <hi>the House of Prayer, a <unclear>Den</unclear> of Theeves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet by your patience, if you will but attend,
J shall relate things more strange and horrible then
these, in respect whereof, the things I have related
hitherto, may well seeme tolerable, I may almost
say Innocencie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94330:9"/>Under the Pavement of their Church at <hi>Gratz,</hi>
and else-where, to my knowledge, are Vaults and
buildings under ground; whereunto, there is no
way but by staires, and steps; Here have they hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up (like to that <hi>Cacus</hi> whom <hi>Virgil</hi> speaketh
of) all their prey and treasure, and doe obscurely
conceale a world of wealth: so professing poverty,
not onely with publike consent, but also with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
pleasure, suffering the same with admirable
patience, and cursing to the pit of Hell, all such
as are poore against their wils, as unworthy of so
blessed a Crosse.</p>
            <p>But as for this their treasure, for the most part
it is so contrived, that it is buried directly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
under their greatest and chiefest or
most eminent and highest <hi>Altar,</hi> and so they shall
be sure that when they Chant Masse, they shall <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
to MARS above head, and to MAMMON be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>Now furthermore, in their Vaults under ground
they maintaine a very strange <hi>Library,</hi> of Cords,
Halters, Rackes, Swords, Axes, Iron-pincers,
Stockes, Torches, Pillories, and severall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Torture, wherewith and whereunto poore
wretches being tyed fast, are joynt by joynt torne a
sunder, as many as fall into the hands of these Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
who are farre more cruell in this kind, then
MEZENTIUS or PHALARIS ever were.</p>
            <p>Nor are they without a Divels coate, and a long
steeple-crown'd hat, with blacke feathers, a jagged
doublet cut and flashed, breeches puffed out and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94330:10"/>
bagged like bellowes, downe to their anckles, such
as would even make a man affrighted to looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
            <p>But perhaps, he that readeth this Relation, will
wonder to what end Religious persons, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
themselves the <hi>Disciples</hi> and followers (as
they would have all men to beleeve) of our most
meeke Saviour JESUS, should make such provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I will resolue you this question also, if you
please to attend.</p>
            <p>With such instruments as these, doth the <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
captivate the understanding of their Disciples,
unto Jesuiticall obedience. For if in the least mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they get any hint of suspition, against any of
their Novices, that he will not be constant, or that
he desireth to escape from them, and that he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to betray the secrets of their Society, they clap
up such a fellow, in a faire paire of Stocks, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
macerated him a long time with hunger, and
cold, and want of all bodily comforts; at the last,
they make an end of him, with some exquisite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and killing torments. I doe not belye them.
I write nothing but a truth. There was at <hi>Gratz,</hi>
about three yeares agoe, a young man named JACO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BVS
CLVSSEVS, a youth of an excellent and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
wit; this man did they lay hands upon, and
miserably tormented him, by whipping and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
for a matter of no moment, and because <unclear>he</unclear>
told them plainly, that he would renounce their
<hi>Society,</hi> and complaine publikely (if ever he got li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty)
for this and other such wicked dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94330:10"/>
wards him, they clapped him up into such a Prison,
under ground, as aforesaid, from whence hee was
never seene to come out againe alive.</p>
            <p>Nor did any of us that were Novices, make
question, but that he was made an end of, with most
exquisite torments.</p>
            <p>Which unparallel'd piece of tyranny, I purpose
in due time to divulge to the whole World, with
relation of all circumstances, being the thing which
the poore wretched <hi>Clussaeus,</hi> had a purpose to
have done himselfe, if he had not been hindered and
prevented by death.</p>
            <p>I shall withall make publike unto the World,
another such piece of Villany, committed by the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> of <hi>Fulda</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> upon the body of one
MARTINUS, whom they stole away most basely
from his Parents, who are yet living at <hi>Milten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
or <hi>Milberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how many women thinke you, have beene
devoured and eaten up in the same Gulfe? How
many young Children slaine? How many young
men, that have beene sole Heyres of very large and
ample Patrimonies, have beene made away by
them? I doe not say, J thinke, but J beleeve, and
am firmely perswaded, so often as shrikes, and
cryes, sighings, and most woefull lamentations,
were heard in the night season, the hearing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
would put a man into a cold sweat all over,
and make his hayre stand on end, though our
simpler Novices, beleeved them to bee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94330:11"/>
the Soules of some lately departed, it was nothing
but the shrikes and mone of children lately mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
or then a murthering.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that the extreame and Divelish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> may be in nothing defective, they
are accustomed divers times, in those their Vaults
under ground, to make the Divell very sine sport:
putting on terrible disguises, they cause some of
their Novices to be called downe to behold their
Tragedy, upon whom they will rush suddainly
with an horrible yelling noyse, to make tryall,
(forsooth) of their courage and constancy.</p>
            <p>For if they find any to be timorous and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
they admit not such a man to the secrets of
<hi>Magicke,</hi> as accounting them cowardly and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
but appoint them to some of the inferiour
Arts: but such as appeare to be of bold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted
Spirits, they take especiall notice of them,
and reserve them for serious imployments.</p>
            <p>And yet they are not alwaies successefull for all
this, as appeared by that which happened at <hi>Prague</hi>
in the yeare 1602. For whereas there were five
principall <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who being habited as Devils
made sport with their youth. If so fell out, <hi>that
there was found to be a sixth in their company, before
they were aware, and he questionlesse was a Divell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
who catching up one of the personated Divels in
his Armes, gave him such a kindly unkind embrace,
that within three dayes after, he dyed of it.</hi> The fact
was common talke at Bake-houses, and Barbershops,
and at every table discoursed upon, all over <hi>Prague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94330:11"/>And yet for all that, the rest of them, as nothing
amazed with this <hi>Tragicall event,</hi> dare still in an
height of obstinacy, proceed in that most ungodly
and Divelish study of Magicke.</p>
            <p>Now amongst that whole Society, the prime man
for a Magician, is a <hi>French Iesuite,</hi> whom the King
of <hi>France</hi> himselfe, had in so high estimation, that
he admitted him not onely to his Princely table,
but also to familiar conferences in private; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whom, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselves did make their
boast, that he had a glasse made by Art-Magicke,
wherein he could plainly represent unto the King,
whatsoever his Majesty desired to see: insomuch,
that there was nothing so secretly done or consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon in the most private roome of any Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or Nunneric of other <hi>Orders,</hi> which he could
not easily and instantly discover, and disclose, by
helpe of this his Inchanted, or rather Divelish
glasse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And indeed it was by the Art and meanes of this</hi>
Magitian Iesuite, <hi>that their Society was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
that they should be able to draw on their side,
one of the most potent Princes of the Empire, albeit a
Protestant: for asmuch, as he was observed to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
delighted in the Study of Magicke.</p>
            <p>Now, as for those whom they take in as Novices
to be instructed in this way, they expound unto
them those nine hundred Propositions, which Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
Earle of <hi>Mirandula</hi> published at <hi>Rome:</hi> as
also the Booke of <hi>Iohannes Tritemius,</hi> together

Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whom they affirme to have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the Art <hi>Magicke,</hi> and thereby to have
understood such high Revelations and profound
Mysteries.</p>
            <p>Yea, they blush not to affirme, that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was
an excellent Magician: Nor doe they sticke to say,
<hi>that even our blessed Saviour</hi> CHRIST IESVS <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
was a most absolute and perfect Magician,</hi>
as mine owne eares have heard it oftner than once
or twice related by some of that Societie, and such
as I am able to nominate.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>Iesuites</hi> Church: onely,
take this direction along with you; Those Vaults
and Roomes under ground, which I mentioned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now, those secret Conveyances and <hi>Circean</hi>

the Quire or Cloister, not where the people doe

            <p>And now when thou shalt passe from their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into their Study (for I will say nothing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
their Parlour, or Chambers, Refectories, or
places of Recreation, instruction of Novices who
are newly admitted, and the trayning up of other

bound up in Leather or Parchment with fillets of
Silver or Gold: and as for such whereof there is
daily use, they are layd in order upon Deskes,
fastened with chaines upon a long table.</p>
            <p>But as for the inner <hi>Library,</hi> that is onely reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for the Fathers of the Society: it is free for
none but them to goe in thither, and to borrow
thence what bookes they thinke good. Those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
bookes, are onely free for the <hi>Iuniors</hi> of the
<hi>Societie,</hi> nor may they take a sentence out of the
rest without speciall leave obtained from the
Regent.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in this first Library, are no Heriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
bookes (as they call them) but onely the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of most approved Authors and <hi>Catholickes</hi>
all: For they hold any other unworthy to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

            <p>Looke therefore upon thy left hand, and there

(as they tearme them) standing all in Mourning for
the faults of their Authors, bound up in blacke
Leather, or Parchment blacked over, with the very
leaves thereof dyed in blacke.</p>
            <p>Of these, not one of the Fathers themselves may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94330:14"/>
make choyse or use, without leave obtained from
the Regent before-hand: but your inferiour, <hi>Iesuits</hi>
and younger Novices, may not be so bold, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the sight of any one of them, except he will <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>fore-hand, with all virulencie and bitternesse, raile
upon, and disgrace the Author, whom he desireth
to see, by some infamous Libell, and scurrilous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyricall
verse, or writing.</p>
            <p>In the middest of these severall <hi>Libraries,</hi> is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a Study, being divided into many Seates distinct,
and separate one from another, with a blew cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
<hi>on the right side whereof, sit the Fathers; on
the left, the under-Graduates; who have already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
some Degrees upon them.</hi> The other Novices,
or <hi>Fresh-men</hi> (as wee call them) sit mixt with the
fellow-Commoners, <hi>that they may take notice of
them, and every man in his turne, beate into them
by continuall discourses, the sweetnesse and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Order of Iesuites; especially, into such as
are of the richer sort, or wealthy heires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will say no more at this time, as touching their
Studies, but I will describe briefly, the manner of
the Visitation, which every Provinciall maketh;
because it is a point, which as I thinke, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that I ever read or heard, hath beene never
hitherto divulged by any.</p>
            <p>Now every <hi>Provinciall</hi> taketh his Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Province, or Kingdome rather, which
is committed to his charge, and oversight. His
place is to visit the severall Colledges, to take an
account of their Revenues, and over-see their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94330:14"/>
exactly and punctually: to take notice,
what Noble personages commit their Sonnes to
the tuition of the Society, and how many they are
in number? Whether there be not yearely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Schollers, as also of their meanes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewes?
Whether there be any converted from
<hi>Lutheranisme,</hi> and how many such?</p>
            <p>If there be no such thing, or if the Popish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
have lost ground, or if there be any decrease
of their wealth, he sharpely reproveth their sloath
and neglect, and chargeth strictly, that they make
an amends for the wrong they have done, and losse
they have received in this case. But if they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirred
themselves bravely, and converted (as they
call it) or rather perverted many Soules to Popery,
if they have beene frugall, and scraped wealth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he praiseth them very highly, and extolleth
them to the skyes. Moreover, he demandeth what
is the opinion of the Neighbouring <hi>Hereticks</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them? What be the projects of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
What meetings they have? How many? And
where? What they consult upon? What they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to doe? Whether the Hereticall Princes (as
they tearme them) delight to live at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad?
To whom they resort most frequently?
What is the severall disposition of every one of
them? In what things he is observed to take most
delight? Whether he take any care of his people
or not? Whether he be a Religious Prince or not?
Or rather, whether he be not a man, who delights
to take his pleasure in drinking, Wenching, or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94330:15"/>
Hunting? Whether he have any Catholickes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, or that are neere unto him? What
the people report abroad, concerning their owne
Princes? Whether the Churches of the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
be full of resort, or not? Whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of those Churches, be learned and diligent
men in their place and calling, or otherwife lazie
Lubbers, and unlettered? Whether the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Divinitie thrive, in the Neighbouring Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>Heretickes?</hi> Whether their Divines
maintaine frequent Disputations, and against whom
principally? What bookes they have published
of late, and upon what Subject?</p>
            <p>To these, and sundry such questions, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and the rest of the Fathers doe answer pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
he doth wonderfully commend their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and vigilancy.</p>
            <p>If he find them defective in answering to these
or any such demands, hee reprooveth them
sharpely, saying: what meane you my Masters,
doe you purpose, like lazie companions, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> How doe you suppose
your slothfulnesse in these waighty affaires, can
bee excused before his <hi>Holinesse?</hi> How is it,
that you presume to take these places upon you,
and to manage them no better? What or whom
are you affrayd of? Why doe not you buckle
up your selves better to your businesse, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
your places like men? These things (if
you had beene such men as you ought to bee) had
not beene to doe now. These things should have
beene done long before this time. Doe you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94330:15"/>
the incredible watchfulnesse of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
and can you be lazie? And with these
or the like speeches, hee whetteth them on to
their duty.</p>
            <p>At the last, he enquireth as touching the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
fellow-Commoners, Novices, and the rest,
how many they are in number? How much every
one hath profited? To what study or delight each
one is inclineable? Whether there be any one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them that is scrupulous, or untractable, or
not a sit subject to be wrought upon? For he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgeth
every such an one sitting to be removed
from the study of Divinity; except, he have bin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well exercised in the Disputations in Schooles,
and have a very great and good conceit of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
beaten into him. Moreover, hee enquireth
if they have any one in the Colledge, who can be
contented, for the advantage of the Catholicke
cause, to undertake any laudable attempt, and to
spend his blood in the cause, if at any time necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shall seeme to require it.</p>
            <p>And at last, he sendeth away all these informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being sealed up, unto the Father Generall
at <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom, they are immediately made
knowne to the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe and his Conclave of
Cardinals: And so by this meanes, an order is
taken, that there is no matter of Action set on
foote, nothing almost consulted upon, throughout
the whole Christian world, which is not forthwith
discovered unto the Pope, by these traytors, that
lurke in every state and Kingdome. Also, it is not
to be omitted, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are translated by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94330:16"/>
their Provinciall, from one Colledge to another,
and that for the most part once in three yeares, that
so the Provinciall out of their severall discoveries,
may attaine to unlocke all the secretest Cabinets
of the Prince and State, where he doth reside.</p>
            <p>In the last place, I will adde, in stead of a Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,
some strange and wonderfull devices of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi>
which being but of late newly hammered in
the forge, they have carnestly endeavoured, yea,
and at this day doe labour, tooth and nayle to put
in practice by publike consent, for an Jnnovation
to be made both in the Church and State through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. To this end, their
chiefe and onely ayme is, how to set the Princes of
the Empire together by the eares, and by taking
off some of the Principall Doctors of the Church,
to bring the tyranny of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> into <hi>Germany.</hi> Concerning which
very project I have heard the Provinciall DHL-RIO
himselfe, discoursing sometimes, whose plots and
Machinations, were such as follow. In the first
place (saith he) care and paines must be used, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange
the affections of the Princes of the Empire,
one from another.</p>
            <p>Now the meanes (said he) to effect that, is to
worke upon their contrariety of opinions, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion: And for this end let the Emperor
be incited to make a Declaration, that he will not
grant liberty of Conscience in matters of Religion,
except there shall first be a restitution made of
such goods, as were taken from the Clergie upon
the treaty at <hi>Passa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> for this is a point whereat
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94330:16"/>
they will sticke assuredly, and deny it.</p>
            <p>Let the Emperour thereupon send his Princes,
and demand the same of the Cities of the Empire.
They will either obey or deny: if they consent and
obey, all is well: if they refuse, let him proclaime
them Rebels, and expose them to be seized upon by
the next neighbouring Princes, but still let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be so carried, that he be sure to oppose a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
and a <hi>Calvinist,</hi> the one against the other.</p>
            <p>Moreover, some device must be found out, <hi>that
the Duke of Bavaria may fall foule either upon the
Elector</hi> Palatine, <hi>or upon the Duke of</hi> Wittemberg,
<hi>for then may the Emperour be easily wonne to proclaime
him Traytor whom the Duke of</hi> Bavaria <hi>shall distaste,
and all meanes taken away of making <unclear>pacification</unclear> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Papist or Calvinist for them;</hi> besides,
thereby will be raised unreconcileable divisions in
the Empire, never to be quenched before an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
be made for the accomplishment of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
For the further ripening of which Designe,
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> unbethought themselves further of this
<hi>Stratagem.</hi> Jt will follow (say they) necessarily,
when any City of the Empire shall be proclaimed
rebellious, <hi>that every severall Prince will be more
ready and willing to serve his owne turne upon the
spoyle thereof, then to admit any other that shall be
emulous of the same <unclear>booty</unclear> to preveot him.</hi> This for
the Generality. More particularly yet, meanes
must be sound out, to set the Princes of <hi>Saxony</hi> at
difference, that their strength and power may bee
broken, or at least weakened.</p>
            <p>Now that may bee most conveniently effected
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94330:17"/>
thus: first, if the Administration of the Primacy of
<hi>Magdeburg,</hi> which now is vacant, be given to the
<hi>Bavarian</hi> Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> neither the Marquesse
of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> nor the Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
grant their consents thereto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if that succeed not according to our
desires, there must be some cause pretended, why
the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> either doth seeme worthy, or
ought to seeme worthy to be removed from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectorall
dignity. For, if in times past, the Princes of
the Empire cast downe <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> from the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi>
Throne, because they had adjudged him a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent
Prince: surely the Emperor may take as just
an occasion, to remove, from the Electorall Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who is drunke every day.
And in this respect, let his <hi>Imperiall</hi> Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
and conferre that Dignity, upon the house and
family of the Dukes of <hi>Weymar.</hi> And because these
Princes are yet under age, let the Administration of
that Electorship, be committed to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swicke,</hi>
a learned and vigilant Prince. This project
being once set a foote, cannot chuse but beget insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
distractions, throughout all <hi>Saxony,</hi> so shall it
come to passe, that they shall wast and weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
one against another, and by that meanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
utterly unable to withstand a common foe,
when he shall come upon them.</p>
            <p>And as for the Marquesse of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and
them of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> let meanes be used to move the
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who is the Emperours kinsman, to
covenant with his vncle the King of <hi>Swethland,</hi> that
they two shall invade and divide <hi>Prussia,</hi> and <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94330:17"/>
the same: which thing the Marquesse of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
will oppose with all his powers. Now as
concerning the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> he must be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and solicited daily to divide the inheritance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with his vncle <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> and to resigne the
government of <hi>Hertsfield</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Wirtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg:</hi>
if he refuse to doe so, let him be proclaimed
Rebell, and let his inheritance be assigned unto his
uncle <hi>Lodowicke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, as for the Duke of <hi>Wittemberge,</hi> and
the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> they two may with ease be set
together by the eares, if the Duke be commanded
to make restitution of some Religious houses, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
upon his refusall be proclaimed Rebell,
and some neighbouring Monasteries be assigned to
the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and amongst them one espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
which he hath bin observed to have aymed
at long agoe.</p>
            <p>And these be those killing projects of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
which I have heard from their owne mouthes, not
without admiration even to astonishment, and they
have many more of like sort, all vvhich J doe not at
this present remember.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there hath beene a Consultation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> to send abroad some bold <hi>Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi>
who by Poyson or by the Pistoll, may cut off
the principall Doctors of the Reformed Churches,
fellowes who are so absolute Masters in that trade
of Poysoning, that they are able so to infect Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Saltsellers, Basons, Kettles, pots, and Caldrons,
and such like vessels of ordinary use; that albeit
they shall be ten times over washed and wiped, yet
shall they retaine the power and infection of most
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94330:18"/>
deadly and speeding poyson. Wherefore, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
advise all godly and Religious Governours and
Ministers of the Church, that hereafter they be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and cautelous how they trust any, but such as of
whose fidelity they have had sufficient tryall.</p>
            <p>And these things could never have fallen within
compasse of mine understanding, nor ever did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such time as I heard them from the Principals
and Heads of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> together with
many other particulars, which I held my selfe
bound in Conscience to reveale to the world, for
the good of my Country, and of the Church of
CHRIST: which although J have for the present
onely given you as in a rude and first draught; yet
I purpose (God willing) in due time, to expresse
the same at large, painting them out in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
with circumstances of time, place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

by this time thou art able to discerne
the face of the times, and of thy selfe
to make a true parallel betwixt <hi>Germany</hi> and us, and
dost see evidently the foot-stops of that mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which, by the contrivements of the pragmaticall
Society of <hi>Jesuites,</hi> hath for many yeares beene set at
worke amongst us. As there the foundation of their
worke was laid in working upon their diversities in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and seconded by advantage taken upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
humors of the Princes, propounding to each one
some such ends as his nature most affected: so may I
truely say they have done here also. To what other end
was the pestilent Doctrine of <hi>Arminius</hi> introduced,
wherely to make a party that might prove strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

with those erronious points, but to the same end?
And can we chuse but thinke that <hi>Sosinianisme</hi> crept

               </gap>; most men thought it might yet be 4. moneths,

I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and looke on the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they are white already unto Harvest: Or, if I
may not say they are, because Gods gracious hand of
providence hath disappointed their hopes, yet I assure
my selfe that any man of ordinary understanding will
confesse, that within the space of this yeare last past, our
Land was already white to their Harvest, The Kings
Majestie was wrought to an evill opinion of his people,
the Commons were grown discontented with the present
Government, two adverse Armies were lodged in our
Land, and all this with a new whole Army of evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
brought on by the secret contrivements of
our Adversaries, and on all hands the way was so
prepared, Altars set up and Priests enough in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is that nothing was wanting to ripen their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
for the sickle, but a Proclamation for setting up
publique Masse in all our Churches: which things when
I seriously considered, and now of late looking againe
upon the Regions, I discerne what an alteration God
hath begun to worke amongst us by the pious endeavors
of this happy Parliament, I cannot but take up that
saying of the Psalmist, <hi>Ps. 124. 1, 2, 3. If the Lord
had not beene on our side,</hi> may England now say; <hi>If
the Lord had not beene on our side, when men rose
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94330:19"/>
up against us, they had then swallowed us up quick,
when their wrath was kindled against us, Then the
water had drowned us, and the streame had gone
over our Soule;</hi> If the plots of the pacificant <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>
had once set up the bridge of reconciliation,
whereon the Protestant and Papist should have met,
and the trap doore had taken effect, <hi>then the swelling
waves had gone over our Soules indeed: But praised
be the Lord vvhich hath not given us as a prey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their teeth; Our Soule is escaped even as a bird
out of the snare of the Fowler, the snare is broken
and we are delivered,</hi> So that we may truly say as the

the name of the Lord which made both Heaven and
Earth.</hi> And now what remaineth for us to doe but
this? By daily &amp; earnest prayer, to begge a blessing upon
our gracious Soveraigne, the Kings Majestie, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the high and honourable Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that
God will be graciously pleased to finish, by their happy
consultations and pious endeavours, that good worke of
