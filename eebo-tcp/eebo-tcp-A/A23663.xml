         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>Reader,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heology is the Doctrine of the
Kingdom of God: A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is a State of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Government is by
Laws: He therefore that will
understand any thing in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
must understand the
Laws of God: And though there be many
inferiour Particles, distinguished from the
<hi>weighty things</hi> of <hi>the Law,</hi> which few do
clearly understand, yet is it necessary that we
know in general, what <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> it is
that we are under, and also that we know
the most important parts: If we understand
not the Law of Tything <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi>
we must not be ignorant of <hi>Iudgment, Mercy</hi>
and <hi>Faith,</hi> Matth. 23. 23.</p>
            <p>They that tell us we are now under no Laws,
do tell us thereby that we are under no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment,
and consequently that <hi>God,</hi> and out
<pb facs="tcp:55859:3"/>
Redeemer Jesus Christ, is not the Governour
of <hi>Believers.</hi> And he that knoweth that the
Name [GOD] doth signifie the Divine
Relation to Man, as well as the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
will know that this is to deny a <hi>God,</hi> and
to deny <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and rather to be called
<hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> than <hi>Antinomianism:</hi>
Even they that had not the <hi>written Law</hi> of
<hi>Moses,</hi> had a Law of Nature, partly written
out upon their hearts: And Christians have
both the Law of Nature Extrinsick, and the
<hi>written Law</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and both (acccording
to the various measures of Grace) written
out upon their hearts, that is, received by
<hi>knowledge, Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>readiness</hi> to
<hi>obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they that know that we are under a
Law (as those in Heaven, even Angels are)
yet do not all well understand what Law it
is, and on what terms the World, or the
Church are governed, and must be judged.
That the first Law of <hi>Natural Innocency, as alone,</hi>
or <hi>as to the Promissory part,</hi> or as to <hi>threatning
without mercies</hi> or <hi>remedy,</hi> is it that any part
of the Earth is now governed by, or under, is
an intolerable Errour: God promiseth not
sinners everlasting life on condition they be
no sinners: That Promise ceased by a Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Subjects capacity</hi> without any more
ado, or possibility of reviving it. Nor doth
God deal with any people according to the
<pb facs="tcp:55859:3"/>
               <hi>sole threatning</hi> of that Law, without <hi>mercy,
dispensation,</hi> or <hi>remedy.</hi> The Law of <hi>Grace</hi>
was as truly made with <hi>all men in Adam,</hi> Gen.
3. 15. as the Law of <hi>Innocency</hi> was. Though
the Serpents <hi>Seed</hi> be mentioned in it, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth
not that any were such as then in
the <hi>Loins</hi> of lapsed <hi>Adam,</hi> but as consequently
they <hi>would become such</hi> by <hi>rejecting</hi> and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Grace, and so contracting a further Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.
If Man, as in <hi>Adam's</hi> loyns, then was
the <hi>Serpents Seed,</hi> then all God's Elect should
be such, and so be <hi>bruised,</hi> and not <hi>saved</hi>
by Jesus Christ: For all then were really
alike in <hi>Adam.</hi> And to say, that God's <hi>meer
Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> without any real
inherent difference existent, or foreseen, is
the reason of denominating, some the <hi>Seed of
the Woman,</hi> and some the <hi>Seed of the Serpent,</hi>
is an unproved fancy, and irrational corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word of God.</p>
            <p>All men therefore in lapsed <hi>Adam</hi> were at
once under the guilt of Sin, and also under a
remedying Law of Grace, so far as that it is
enacted and offered, to save those that receive
it. It saved not <hi>Adam</hi> himself meerly by the
<hi>making</hi> of it, till by <hi>Faith</hi> he had received it.
And no doubt but as the Covenant of Grace
to us extendeth to the <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>their Seed,</hi>
so did the Covenant of Grace to <hi>Adam;</hi> for it
was the same as was made to all the faithful
before Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Incarnation. The case of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb facs="tcp:55859:4"/>
being obscure, clearer Truths are not to
be reduced to it: And whether <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>
as they were both born in Original Sin, so were
both pardoned upon their Covenant-Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God by their Parents, and <hi>Cain</hi> after
lost his <hi>Infant-state</hi> of Grace (as <hi>Davenant,
Ward,</hi> &amp;c. think Infant Grace may now be
lost) or whether <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> neglected
that Dedication of <hi>Cain</hi> to God which was
needful to his Sanctification, or whether God
past him by, and denyed him Infant-Grace of
his <hi>meer will,</hi> I leave to Mens enquiry, and
various judgments; (The controversie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
Children now, as well as then, and
the difficulties every way are not small) But
of these things I am past doubt:</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Cain</hi> was not the <hi>Serpents Seed</hi>
meerly for Original Sin, and as born of <hi>Adam</hi>
(as <hi>Abel</hi> was also) nor did God <hi>make him</hi> the
<hi>Serpents Seed</hi> by Reprobation; but that he
made himself so by superadded Sin against the
Redeemer and Law of Grace.</p>
            <p>2. That all Mankind are still under this
Law of Grace, further than they forfeit the
benefits of it by sins against it.</p>
            <p>3. That most Writers, if not most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
do greatly darken the Sacred Doctrine,
by overlooking the Interest of Children in
the actions of their <hi>meer Parents,</hi> and think
that they participate of no guilt, and suffer
for no Original Sin, but <hi>Adams</hi> only; and
<pb facs="tcp:55859:4"/>
bring the Doctrine of Original Sin it self into
doubt, by laying all upon Covenant-Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and denying, or overlooking the <hi>Natural
Proofs:</hi> Doubtless, through Scripture it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
that God usually judgeth the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of new sinners to new punishments, and
promises and threatnings are made (since the
Covenant of Innocency ceased) to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and unbelievers, or wicked, with their
Seed: For we may well say that the Seed of
<hi>Cain, Cham, Nimrod, Ishmael, Esau, Saul, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,
&amp;c.</hi> had more Original Sin than what they
had from <hi>Adam.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 35. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
the matter. It was not in vain that
<hi>Ezra, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> confessed their forefathers
sin, nor doth our <hi>Liturgie</hi> pray for the dead,
but the living, when it saith [<hi>Remember not
Lord, our offences, nor the offences of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
neither take thou vengeance of our
Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of this Treatise beginning at
the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> doth it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who thought
meet to call the <hi>Iews</hi> to no higher Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
than the Case in hand (about the
Non-obligation of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law to the <hi>Gentiles)</hi>
did require. But this denyeth not, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the same Law of Grace in the main
to have been made to all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<hi>Noah,</hi> and to have been in force to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
before it was renewed to <hi>Abraham;</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:55859:5"/>
that to him and his Seed there were
many great priviledges added, above the rest of
Mankind, upon his extraordinary obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Faith.</p>
            <p>Of how great importance it is to have a
right understanding of the difference between
the Law of Innocency, and the Law of Grace,
and in it, the Promise made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<hi>Noah,</hi> and that to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the peculiar
Mosaical Law and Covenant, and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
Edition of the Law, or Covenant of
Grace by Christ Incarnate, a true Student of
<hi>Theology</hi> may easily discern: Wherein I hope
the Reader, will find that (among the many
late Treatises on this Subject) the Authour
here hath done considerable service to the
Church of God. Of which Subject I have
written long ago so much my self, and am at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to make it yet more plain, that I
need not here tell you what is my judgment;
only, lest any who know not how to stop in
Mediocrity, should be tempted by <hi>Socinians</hi> or
<hi>Papists,</hi> to think that we countenance any of
their Errors, or that our Differences in the
Point of Justification by <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Works,</hi> are
greater than indeed they are; and lest any
weak Opiniative persons, should clamour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceably
against their Brethren, and think to
raise a name to themselves for their differing
Notions; I shall here give the Reader such
evidences of our real Concord, as shall silence
that Calumny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55859:5"/>
Though some few <hi>Lutherans</hi> did upon
peevish suspiciousness against <hi>George Major</hi>
long ago, assert, that [<hi>good Works are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation]</hi> And though some few
good men, whose zeal without judgment doth
better serve their own turn than the Churches,
are jealous, lest all the good that is ascribed to
Man, be a dishonour to God; and therefore
speak as if God were honoured most by saying
the worst words of our selves; and many
have uncomely and irregular Notions about
these matters; and though some that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to sidings, do take it to be their godly
zeal to <hi>censure</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> the more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Sort, when they most grosly erre
themselves: And though too many of the
people are carried about through injudicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and temptations, to false Doctrines and
evil lives; yet is the Argument of Protestants
thus manifested:</p>
            <p>1. They all affirm that Christ's <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
with his <hi>Holiness</hi> and perfect <hi>Obedience,</hi> are
the Meritorious Cause of the <hi>forgiving Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi>
and of our <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Iustification</hi>
thereby, and of our right to Life Eternal,
which it giveth us. And that this price was
not paid or given in it self immediately <hi>to us,</hi>
but <hi>to God for us;</hi> and <hi>so that</hi> our <hi>foresaid</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
are its effects.</p>
            <p>2. They agree that <hi>Christ's Person</hi> and <hi>ours</hi>
were not <hi>really</hi> the same, and therefore that
<pb facs="tcp:55859:6"/>
the same Righteousness which is an <hi>Accident</hi>
of one, cannot possibly be an Accident of the
other.</p>
            <p>3. They all detest the conceit that God
should aver, and repute a Man to have done
that which he never did.</p>
            <p>4. They all agree that Christ's <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and
<hi>Merits</hi> are really so effectual to procure our
Pardon, Justification, Adoption, and right to
the sealing gift of the Holy Ghost, and to
Glory, upon our Faith and Repentance; that
God giveth us all these benefits of the New
Covenant, as <hi>certainly</hi> for the sake of Christ
and his Righteousness, as if we had satisfied
him, and merited them our selves: And that
thus <hi>far</hi> Christ's Righteousness is <hi>ours</hi> in its
effects, and <hi>imputed</hi> to us, in that we are <hi>thus
used for it,</hi> and shall be <hi>judged</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>5. They all agree that we are Justified by
none but a <hi>Practical</hi> or <hi>working Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And that this Faith is the <hi>Condition</hi> of
the Promise or Gift of Justification, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</p>
            <p>7. And that <hi>Repentance</hi> is a Condition also;
though (as it is not the same with Faith, as
Repentance of <hi>unbelief</hi> is) on another apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal
account; even as a <hi>willingness to be
cured,</hi> and a <hi>willingness to take one for my Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,</hi>
and to <hi>trust him in the use of his Remedies,</hi>
are on several accounts the Conditions on
which that Physitian will undertake the Cure,
<pb facs="tcp:55859:6"/>
or as <hi>willingness</hi> to return to <hi>subjection</hi> &amp; <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acceptance</hi> of a <hi>purchased parden,</hi> and of the
<hi>Purchasers</hi> love and future <hi>Authority,</hi> are the
Conditions of a Rebels pardon.</p>
            <p>8. And they all agree that in the first instant
of a Mans Conversion or Believing, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into a state of Justification before he hath
done any outward works: And that so it is
true that <hi>good Works follow</hi> the <hi>justified,</hi> and <hi>go
not before his initial Iustification:</hi> As also in the
sense that <hi>Austin</hi> spake it, who took Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for that which we call Sanctification, or
Conversion.</p>
            <p>9. And they all agree, that justifying Faith
is such a receiving affiance, as is both in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
and the Will, and therefore as in the
<hi>Will</hi> participateth of some kind of love to the
justifying Object, as well as to Justification.</p>
            <p>10. And that no Man can <hi>choose</hi> or <hi>use</hi>
Christ as a <hi>means</hi> (so called in respect to his
own intention) to bring him to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath not so much love to God, as
to take him for his <hi>End<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> the use of that means.</p>
            <p>11. And they agree that we shall be all
<hi>judged according to our Works,</hi> by the Rule of
the Covenant of Grace, though not <hi>for our
Works</hi> by way of <hi>Commutative,</hi> or <hi>Legal proper
Merit.</hi> And <hi>Iudging</hi> is the <hi>Genus,</hi> whose <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
is <hi>Iustifying</hi> and <hi>Condemning:</hi> And to be
<hi>judged</hi> according to our <hi>Works,</hi> is nothing but
to be <hi>Iustified</hi> or <hi>Condemned</hi> according to
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55859:7"/>
12. They all agree, that no Man can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<hi>merit</hi> of God in point of <hi>Commutative
Iustice,</hi> nor yet in point of <hi>Distributive,</hi> or
<hi>Governing Iustice,</hi> according to the Law of
Nature or Innocency, as <hi>Adam</hi> might have
done, nor by the Works of the Mosaical
Law.</p>
            <p>13. They all agree, that no Works of Mans
are to be <hi>trusted</hi> in, or <hi>pleaded,</hi> but all excluded,
and the conceit of them abhorred.</p>
            <p>1. As they are feigned to be against, or in
stead of the free Mercy of God.</p>
            <p>2. As they are against, or feigned, instead
of the Sacrifice, Obedience, Merit, or Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Or as supposed to be done of our selves
without the Grace of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>4. Or as supposed falsly to be perfect.</p>
            <p>5. Or as supposed to have any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disclaimed
merit.</p>
            <p>6. Or as materially consisting in <hi>Mosaical</hi>
observances.</p>
            <p>7. Much more in any Superstitious Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>8. Or in any evil mistaken to be good.</p>
            <p>9. Or as any way inconsistent with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the freely pardoning Covenant. In all
these senses, Justification by Works is disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all Protestants at least.</p>
            <p>14. Yet all agree that we are Created to
good Works in Christ Jesus, which God hath
<pb facs="tcp:55859:7"/>
ordained that we should walk therein, and that
he that nameth the Name of Christ must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from iniquity, or else he hath not the Seal
of God; and that he that is born of God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not, that is, predominantly. And that
all Christ's Members are holy, purified, zealous
of good Works, cleansing themselves from
all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, that they might
perfect holyness in God's fear, doing good to
all Men, as loving their Neighbours as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
And that if any Man have not the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, nor
without holiness can see God.</p>
            <p>15. They all judge reverently, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
of the Antients that used the word <hi>[Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of good Works]</hi> because they meant but a
moral <hi>aptitude for the promised Reward, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Law of Grace through Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. They confess the <hi>thing</hi> thus described
themselves, however they like not the name of
Merit, lest it should countenance proud and
carnal conceits.</p>
            <p>17. They judge no Man to be Heretical for
the bare use of that word, who agreeth with
them in the sense.</p>
            <p>18. In this sense they agree, that our Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-obedience
is such a necessary aptitude to
our Glorification, as that glory (though a free
gift) is yet truly a <hi>Reward</hi> of this <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. And they agree that our final Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by sentence at the day of Judgment, doth
<pb facs="tcp:55859:8"/>
pass upon the same Causes, Reasons, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as our Glorification doth</p>
            <p>20. They all agree that all faithful Ministers
must bend the labour of their Ministry in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and private, for promoting of Holiness and
good Works, and that they must diifference
by discipline between the obedient and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient.
And O! that the Papists would as
zealously promote Holiness and good Works
in the <hi>World,</hi> as the true serious Protestants do,
whom they factiously and peevishly accuse as
enemies to them; and that the <hi>Opinion, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting</hi>
and <hi>name of good Works,</hi> did not cheat
many wicked persons into self-flattery and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
while they are void of that which they
dispute for. Then would not the <hi>Mahometans</hi>
and <hi>Heathens</hi> be deterred from Christianity, by
the wickedness of these nominal Christians that
are near them: Nor would the <hi>serious practice</hi>
of that Christianity which themselves in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
profess, be <hi>hated, scorned,</hi> and <hi>persecuted</hi>
by so many, both Protestants and Papists; nor
would so many contend that they are of the
true Religion, while they are really of no
Religion at all, any further than the <hi>Hypocrites</hi>
Picture and Carkass may be called Religion.
Were Men but resolved to be serious <hi>Learners,</hi>
serious <hi>Lovers,</hi> and serious <hi>Practisers,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their knowledge, and did not live like
mockers of God, and such as look towards the
life to come in <hi>jest</hi> or <hi>unbelief,</hi> God would
<pb facs="tcp:55859:8"/>
vouchsafe them better acquaintance with the
true Religion, than most Men have.</p>
            <p>Having prefaced this much, for the rest I
refer thee to the perusal of this Treatise, which
will give thee much light into the nature of
the Gospel, and especially help thee to the

TWO COVENANTS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He mistake of the unbelieving
<hi>Iews,</hi> about the true import
of Gods Promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and of the Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> was a principal cause
of their rejecting Christ and
his Gospel, and their own
salvation thereby. To rectifie which mistake,
the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> used various reasonings,
according to the various Errors contained in
it. In which reasonings of his, <hi>there being
some things hard to be understood;</hi> there were
others again which probably mistaking
the Apostles reasonings against the Jew-Jewish
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55859:10"/>
Notion of Justification by Works, ran
into a contrary extream, thinking they might
be saved by Faith without Works; as on the
contrary the incredulous <hi>Iews</hi> thought they
might be saved by Works without Faith.
And if many in our dayes had not run into
somewhat alike extream through a misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
also of the Apostles writings, labour,
and pains would not have been so necessary, as
now they are, to rectify their mistake, and to
prevent it in others. To the end therefore
that the plain Truth may the better appear,
touching Gods promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Apostles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
about these; I shall very briefly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
these seven things.</p>
            <p>1. To open the Nature and Design of Gods
promise to Abraham. <hi>And to shew</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For what ends the Law was added to the
promise.</p>
            <p>3. By what Faith and Practice, the Iews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law were saved.</p>
            <p>4. That the Law contained a Covenant, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The grand mistakes of the unbelieving
<hi>Jews,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s counter arguings, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both the Law and the Promise.</p>
            <p>6. The mistake of some pretended Christians
in the Apostles days, touching the Doctrine of
Iustification by Faith without Works.</p>
            <p>7. That the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55859:10"/>
               <hi>James</hi> about Faith and Works, in reference to
Iustification, do not differ. <hi>I shall begin with

               <head type="sub">The Nature and Design of Gods Promise
to Abraham.</head>
               <p>I Shall endeavour to open the Nature and
Design of Gods Promise to <hi>Abraham:</hi>
Which <hi>Promise</hi> is also called the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
Act. 3. 25. Gal. 3. 17. In doing of which, these
eight things will come under consideration.
1. What the nature of this Promise is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
2. What the design of it is. 3. What
are the special benefits promised. 4. What
the extent of it is. 5. The security given by
God for the performance of it. 6. That this
Promise was conditional. 7. What the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of it was. 8. What we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by Gods accounting <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith to
him for Righteousness.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 1.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the nature of it in general.</hi> This
Promise I take to be of the same nature with
that which in the Gospel is called the New
Covenant. It's true indeed they greatly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in the Administration, the one being but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55859:11"/>
general, implicite, and obscure; and the other
more particular, express, and perspicuous.
But though in this they differ, yet in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
nature they agree in one, and are the
same. For, 1. This Covenant, as delivered
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was <hi>confirmed in Christ</hi> as well
as the Gospel afterwards, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. and that's
a Character of the New Covenant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28.
2. The Gospel is said to have been preached
to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Promise that was made
him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. 3. He was justified by Faith;
which he could not have been, but by vertue
of a New Covenant: And it was by Faith in
the Promise made to him by God, by which
he was justified: Which two things suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
it necessarily follows that that Promise
was of the nature of the New Covenant.
4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues against the erroneous <hi>Iews</hi>
in his Epistles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi>
the necessity of Evangelical Faith unto justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
now under the Gospel, from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
being justified by Faith, and from God's
setting him forth for a pattern and example
to all after-ages, of his justifying both <hi>Iews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon the condition of believing.
The strengh of which arguing seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon this supposition; That the Promise,
by the belief of which <hi>Abraham</hi> was then justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the Promise in the Gospel, by the
belief of which men are now justified, do both
agree, and are one in the general nature of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55859:11"/>
them. And upon these grounds, and under
this notion of the Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to discourse of it.</p>
                  <p>But when I consider for what reason he <hi>that
is least in the Kingdom of God,</hi> is said to be <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Iohn the Baptist</hi> (though not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
himself, nor any of the Prophets were
greater than he) and when I consider like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how ignorant the Apostles were for a
time, touching the necessity of the Death and
Resurrection of Christ, notwithstanding the
many plainer Revelations thereof in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
than we find <hi>Abraham</hi> had; I cannot I
confess think that <hi>Abraham</hi> had or could have
a distinct notion of all that was contained and
implyed in the Promise, as now it is opened
and unfolded in the Writings of the New
Testament, it does appear was wrapt up in
it. And therefore though I think I may well
found a Discourse of the New Covenant upon
the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it is now
explained in the New Testament, yet I would
not be understood to suppose <hi>Abrahams</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
or Faith to have then been commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to the Promise as it is so explained.</p>
                  <p>Supposing then the Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
to be the New Covenant it self in a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Edition of it than afterward came
forth. I shall now a little further consider
what it was, and what the New Covenant is, &amp;
ever hath been, in the general nature of it, since
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55859:12"/>
it first commenced. And it is a new Law or
Covenant, made by way of remedy against the
rigour and extremity of the Law of Nature,
under which Man was created. For the Law
of Nature, the Law of Gods Creation, as well
as his instituted Law in <hi>Paradise,</hi> being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and impossible to be kept inviolable by
Man in his lapsed state, by reason of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
impotency, and the pravity of his Nature
derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> he must inevitably have
sunk and perished under the condemnation of
it, unless there had been a new Law instituted
to supercede the procedure of this Law against
him, in its natural and proper course. If Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
had been attainable by Man in his lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
state, without this remedying Law of
Grace, there would have been no need of
a New Covenant. <hi>If there had been a Law
given which could have given life, verily righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
should have been by the Law,</hi> Gal.
3. 21. But there was no such Law given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this new Law. Nor could the Original
Law be repealed for the relief of faln Man, it
being founded in the Nature of God, and the
nature of Man, as he was created after Gods
own Image; and is no more changeable, than
the Nature of good and evil are changable.
And therefore, as I said, there was a necessity
that Man must have perished under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Law of his Creation, as the
lapsed Angels did under theirs, unless a Law
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55859:12"/>
of Indemnity had been Enacted. But
God whose tender mercies are over all his
works, to the end so great and considerable a
part of his Creation, as Man is, might not be
wholly lost and undone to all eternity, out of
his infinite compassion, mercy, and love, did
constitute a new Law or Covenant for mans
relief (which well may be called the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Grace</hi>) against the rigour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the first Law.</p>
                  <p>Which new Law was in some degree,
though but obscurely, made known to Man
not long after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, or else there would
have been no ground for that Faith which we
are assured was in <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
But it was doubtless somewhat more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to <hi>Abraham</hi> than to any before, and at
last compleatly established and published by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ the Mediatour of it, who was <hi>given
for a Covenant to the people.</hi> And this new
Law in the last edition of it under the Gospel,
is variously denominated; being called the
<hi>Promise,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi>
the <hi>Law of Liberty,</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the <hi>Grace of
God,</hi> or <hi>the Word of his Grace.</hi> And so we
come</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 2.</head>
                  <p>To consider <hi>what the design of God was in
this New Covenant or Promise unto Abraham.</hi>
Next to his own glory, it was to recover the
Humane Nature from its degenerate state, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55859:13"/>
a state of holiness, to that likeness to God in
which Man was at the first made, and therein
and thereby to a state of happiness, both
which were lost by the fall. Holiness, love,
and goodness, as they were once the glory and
happiness of Man before he lost them, so are
still perfective of his nature. And therefore
it is impossible in the nature of the thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
Man to happiness, without recovering
his nature to a conformity to God in these;
or for Man to be perfectly happy, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not perfected in them. Sin is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
and sickness of the Soul; and it's as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a sick man to enjoy the pleasure of
health, as it is for the sinful and corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man, while such, to enjoy the pleasure,
which the humane nature did naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
or was capable of enjoying in its inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and purity. But when the nature of
Man is once recovered to perfection in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
holiness, love, and goodness, it will
then be matter of unspeakable delight to
him to love God, Angels and Men, and to
do the will of God in every thing. It is so to
the holy Angels: And it was so to our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour, who counted it as his <hi>meat and
drink,</hi> to be <hi>doing</hi> the <hi>will of his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And to what degree the nature of man
is here in this world, restored towards its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
perfection, to the same degree it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of pleasure and delight to him to act holily
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55859:13"/>
and righteously, and to be doing good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

joy to the Iust to do judgment,</hi> Prov. 21. 15. It
is a pain to a man to act contrary to the bent
and inclination of his nature, by compulsion
or fear. And therefore unless the corrupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nature of Man were changed, Heaven would
not be Heaven to him, in case he were there.
Those Divine and Heavenly exercises which
are there the unspeakable delight of Saints
and Angels, would be his pain and torment, as
being contrary to his nature; And the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of that state, as having not what will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the unsatiable lusts of mans corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
would not be such to him, but add rather
to his anguish. For, as it would be a torment
to a Man to be in extremity of hunger and
thirst, and to be without Meat and Drink,
and all hopes of any to satisfie him: So will
it be a grievous torment to the corrupt nature
of Men in another morld, to retain their
lusts and the violent cravings of them, and
yet to be without all hope of having where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to satisfie them (which yet is like to be
the condition of men in Hell.) Here mens
unnatural lusts are not such a torment to them,
because they can make provision to satisfie
them, or live in hopes so to do; and in the
mean while drown the noise of them by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
But in Hell it will be quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
And therefore its easie to imagine that
the torment which will arise from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55859:14"/>
of mens natures there, will be unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
great, besides the piercing sence of the
happiness they have lost, and the other intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
pains which they must indure; and
therefore as whoever hath not his nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in this World, is never like to have it
renewed in another; so without renewing of
it, it is impossible he should be happy there.
<hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the
Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 3. That is, he cannot
enjoy it, and why? It is not only from Gods
Decree, or established Law to the contrary
that he cannot, but also from the utter incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of his Nature, as corrupt. Wherefore all
<hi>the Vessels of Mercy are</hi> such as God <hi>aforehand
prepares unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9. 23. They are
such as are <hi>made meet to be partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1. 12. Such
as <hi>God hath wrought for the self same thing,</hi>
2. Cor. 5. 5. So that, as I said, there is a necessity
in the nature of the thing, that if God would
design the Restoration of the Nature of Man
to happiness, that in order thereto he should
design a Restoration of it to holiness, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he hath. <hi>He hath chosen us to salvation,
through sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 13.
And therefore the end of Christs great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
for the Redemption and Restauration
of Man, is described, by his <hi>saving his people
from their sins:</hi> By his <hi>redeeming them from all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>niquity, and purifying to himself a peculiar
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55859:14"/>
people, zealous of good works.</hi> By his <hi>washing
and sanctifying of them, that he might present
them to himself a glorious Church not having
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this was the design of Gods promise
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> appears, in that at the very first
it was propounded to him by way of Motive,
to quit the Idolatry of his Fathers, and the
evil customes of his Countrey (for they served
other Gods, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 24. 2.) <hi>Get thee out of thy
Countrey, and from thy Kindred, and from thy
Fathers house; and I will make of thee a great
Nation, and thou shalt be a blessing, and in thee
shall all the Families of the Earth be blessed,</hi> Gen.
12. 1, 2, 3. In which God had a farther design
than to reform <hi>Abraham</hi> only: His design in
him, and by him, was to set on foot the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the World, and the recovering
the Nations thereof from the dregs of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
into which they were sunk. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God said unto him, <hi>Thou shalt be a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi>
And this he designed, not only in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him a numerous Issue, and making them
a great Nation, whose Education in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the true God was founded in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
but also in making both him and them
eminent examples of his special favour in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight of the Nations, by which they might
see how much better it was to serve the God
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> than the Gods of the Nations:
And thereby to invite and draw them from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55859:15"/>
their Idolatry, Superstition, and Ungodliness,
to worship and serve the true God. And God
in promising to <hi>Abraham,</hi> both the Messias in
his Seed, and also that he would <hi>bless them
that should bless him, and curse them that should
curse him, and that his Seed should possess the
gate of his enemies;</hi> had, it should seem, this in
design, <hi>viz.</hi> to encourage and quicken them
to a holy life, <hi>Luke 1. 72, 73, 74, 75. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the mercy promised to our Fathers, and to
remember his holy Covenant: The Oath which he
sware to our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he would
grant unto us; that we being delivered out of the
hands of our enemies, might serve him without
fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all
the days of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But besides all this, considering that the
Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
as it was then exhibited, (as I have
shewed before) the benefits therein promised
had a proper tendency in them, to restore Man
again to a likeness to God in the Moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of his Nature. For the <hi>great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promises</hi> contained in the New Covenant
as such, are given for this very end, <hi>that by
them we might be partakers of a Divine Nature,</hi>
the glory whereof is knowledge, purity and
charity, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. And for God by such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to make overtures unto Man of love and
good-will, and of desires of reconciliation, is
the direct way and method of recovering faln
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55859:15"/>
Man from a state of enmity against God, to a
mind reconciled to him, to think well of
him, to love him, and delight in him. For
<hi>we love him because he first loved us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 19.
<hi>And God was in Christ reconciling the World to
himself,</hi> and how? by <hi>not imputing their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
to them;</hi> but being willing, upon their
repentance and returning to their duty, to
forgive them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. God useth the
same way of overcoming mans enmity against
him, which he hath taught us to use to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
mans enmity against us; and that is, by
<hi>overcoming their evil with our good,</hi> Rom. 12. 21.
<hi>David</hi> dealing so with <hi>Saul,</hi> though a bitter
enemy, melted him into tears, and made him
cry, <hi>Is this thy voice, my son David?</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 16.
And, <hi>to whom much is forgiven, the same person
loveth much,</hi> Luke 7. 42,—47. And if God by
these methods do once recover Mans love to
him, he will quickly recover him to his loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and duty, of which, Love is the proper
Source and Spring. <hi>If a man love me, he will
keep my words,</hi> Joh. 14. 23. Now that God's
promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> did contain expressions
of wonderful grace and love, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what is most apt to beget in Man a love to
God again, and all the desirable effects of it,
will appear, if we consider the special bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
comprehended in that Promise; Which is
the third thing now to be considered.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55859:16"/>
                  <head>Sect. 3.</head>
                  <p>The special benefits contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were such as these.</p>
                  <p>1. It contained <hi>a Promise of the Messias,</hi> a
promise of sending Christ into the world, and
that he should come of his Seed: <hi>In thy Seed
shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed,</hi> Gen.
12. 3. and 18. 18. and 22. 18. which Seed is
Christ, as is said, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. And in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of sending Christ, were implyed the
things he was sent for, the things by which he
should bless the world, as his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and what else pertained to his
Mediatory Office; because these are the things
by which the Nations of the Earth became
blessed in him, which was the thing expresly
promised. That such things were implyed
in the promise, appears not only by the reason
of the thing, but also from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<hi>Acts 13. 32, 33. We declare unto you
glad tidings, how that the Promise which was
made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the
same unto us their Children, in that he hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up Iesus again.</hi> I do not say that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
from a Promise that was but so generally
expressed as that was, could apprehend in
particular what the <hi>Messias</hi> should both do and
suffer, though they were wrapt up in it. He
apprehended so much by it in general, that
God would send the <hi>Messias</hi> into the World,
and that he would send him upon such terms,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55859:16"/>
as that his coming should be matter of great
benefit to the world. <hi>Abraham</hi> had such a
prospect of this, though at that distance, as
made him rejoyce and be glad: So saith our
Saviour himself, <hi>Iohn 8. 56. Your Father</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
<hi>rojoyced to see my day; and he saw it,
and was glad.</hi> And the promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
as it was a Promise of sending Christ to be the
Saviour of the world, was expressive of the
greatest love. <hi>For in this was the love of God
manifested towards us, because God sent his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Son into the world, that we might
live through him. Herein is love, not that we
loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his
Son to be the propitiation for our sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.
9, 10. A Propitiation for our sins: That is,
one that by his Death hath procured favour,
having taken off that sore displeasure which
God by his Law had declared against all the
transgressors of it. For the wise and just
God, did not think the righteousness of his
Government, and the honour and reputation of
his Law would be sufficiently salved, and his
great hatred of sin sufficiently manifested,
without some considerable satisfaction given
for the dishonour done to Him and his Law
by Mans transgression. And yet that this
might not be exacted at the hands of the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in executing the curse of the Law on them
themselves; he was most graciously pleased
to accept of the sufferings of his own dear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55859:17"/>
Son, instead of what the sinners themselves
were to have undergone. <hi>He hath redeemed
us from the curse of the Law, being made a
curse for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>Christ suffered for sins,
the Iust for the unjust,</hi> or in their stead, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 18. Upon account of which undertaking
of Christ for us, all the benefits of the Covenant
do accrue to Man. What ever is required of
Man by way of condition of his acceptation
with God, becomes accepted to that end, upon
account of Christ's suffering. And His Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
in Heaven, through which all our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
(though otherwise imperfect) performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
become acceptable to God, and rewardable
by him, is made in the virtue of it. For the
whole Covenant it self is founded in the Blood
of Christ which he shed for the remission of
sins. Therefore it is called <hi>the New Testament
in his Blood,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. And his blood, <hi>the
Blood of the Everlasting Covenant,</hi> Hebr. 13.
20.</p>
                  <p>2. It contained a <hi>Promise of Iustification or
remission of sin through Christ, unto all that should
so believe, as thereupon to repent of their former
folly, and become sincerely obedient for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
For that is necessarily implyed in the
Promise of blessed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ess to the Nations in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Seed; it being impossible men should be
blessed without Remission of sin, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in removing the curse of the Law, in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55859:17"/>
remitting the penalty. <hi>Blessed is the man whose
iniquity is forgiven, and whose sin is covered,</hi>
Psal. 32. 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us that this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the New Covenant, was declared to
<hi>Abraham</hi> in the Promise, <hi>Gal. 3. 8. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
foreseeeing that God would justifie the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
through Faith, preached the Gospel before
unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all Nations
be blessed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It contained in it tacitly, <hi>a Promise of Divine
assistance unto men in their endeavours to fulfil
the condition of the Promise.</hi> For God in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
blessedness to the Nations through <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
Seed, therein promised all that was
absolutely necessary for him to vouchsafe to
make them blessed, and without which they
could not be blessed. And if so, then he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
implicitly promised to assist the endeavours
of men to perform the condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
without the assistance of whose grace
they cannot savingly believe, repent, and obey.
And so it should seem the Old Testament-Church
understood Gods subduing of sin, as
well as his pardoning of sin, to be comprized
in the Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Mich. 7. 19, 20.
<hi>He will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt
cast all their sins into the depths of the Sea: Thou
wilt perform the truth to Iacob, and the mercy
to Abraham, which thou hast sworn to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
from the days of old.</hi> And Christ his
turning men from their iniquities, which he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55859:18"/>
doth accomplish by appointing them means, &amp;
by assisting them in the use of them to that end,
is part of the blessing contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was so reckoned
by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 3. 25, 26. <hi>Ye are the children
of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God
made with our Fathers, saying unto</hi> Abraham,
<hi>And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth
be blessed. Vnto you first God having raised up
his Son Iesus Christ, sent him to bless you, in
turning every one of you from his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It implicitly, or somewhat obscurely
contained in it <hi>a Promise of eternal Life.</hi> I
say, implicitly; For I do not find that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life was expresly promised to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
But yet that was expresly promised him, from
which the hope of eternal Life might well be
inferred: As first, Blessedness through his
Seed, the <hi>Messias:</hi> And secondly, That God
would be a God to him and his Seed. For
blessedness is a happiness that runs parallel
with the duration of Man's immortal Soul.
And God's Promise of being a God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
carried in it a Promise of a happiness wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of God to bestow, such as everlasting Life or
happiness is. <hi>And therefore he was not ashamed
to be called their God</hi> (meaning <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi>
and <hi>Iacob) because he had prepared for
them a City;</hi> meaning that in so doing, he
had answered that title of relation of being
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55859:18"/>
their God, and done like himsel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16.
And upon these and the like Revelatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of
of God's mind to him, <hi>Abraham looked for a
City which hath foundations, whose Builder and
Maker is God, and a heavenly Countrey,</hi> Heb. 11.
10, 16. If <hi>Abraham</hi> did but use his reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these Promises, as he did about reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
God's Promise, that in <hi>Isaac</hi> his Seed
should be called, with his command to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
him, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17, 18, 19.) he might discern
eternal Life in them, though but very obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in comparison of what is now revealed in
the Gospel, by which <hi>Life and Immortality is
brought to light,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10. But how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
soever a future happiness was promised
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet promised it was, for which
we have the testimony of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3. 18.
<hi>If the inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of
Promise: But God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi>
He was here proving against the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical
<hi>Iews,</hi> and Judaizing Christians, that
Justification unto Life, was to be had by the
Promise, and not by the Law; by Faith, and
not by works of the Law; <hi>that the Iust should
live by Faith,</hi> as <hi>vers.</hi> 12. And therefore by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
here, which he saith God gave to
<hi>Abraham</hi> by Promise, he doubtless means e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life, which elsewhere he calls <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of eternal Inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9. 15.</p>
                  <p>Consider now, how God carryed on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of restoring Man by the promise of those
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55859:19"/>
benefits. For if expressions of the greatest
Grace and Love in God to Men, is the way to
beget in them a love to God again, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
that, to beget all the desirable effects of
Love; (which are no less than a sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in Man's Nature and Life to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law) And if the giving of great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promises, is the way of recovering Man
again to a participation of the Divine Nature,
(as I have shewed it is) then the Promise of
God to <hi>Abraham</hi> which was expressive of the
greatest Grace and Love, and contained in it
Promises, than which there are not materially
greater, nor more precious, was a wise and
graciovs contrivance of God, to recover Man
to a likeness to himself, wherein the glory and
perfection of his Nature did first consist.</p>

Covenant was restrained) but even to all
Nations of the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and 22. 18.
which shews it to be of the same nature with
the general Promise in the Gospel, though it
was not so intelligible then, as it is since made
by the Gospel. But God we see, <hi>so loved the

                  <p>Consider we in the next place, <hi>the security
given by God, for the performance of his Promise
to Abraham and his Seed.</hi> For because men
knowing how ill they have deserved from
God, having made themselves enemies to him,
would be apt to question whether there were
indeed so much love and good will in God to
them as the greatness of his Promise did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
Therefore God, to remove all jealousie
of this nature, and to give them the greatest
security and assurance he could, of the reality
of his intentions, and of his heart and good
will towards them, he confirmed his Promise
by an Oath, <hi>swearing by himself, because he
could swear by no greater.</hi> And this he did, that
they to whom the Promise did extend, <hi>might
have strong consolation</hi> from God, such as might
work in them strong and vigorous affections

which he was wrought to an entire resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>The next thing I have to shew, is, <hi>That this
Promise of God to Abraham, was conditional.</hi> If
the Promise of sending Christ was absolute,
yet the actual collation of the great benefit
of Remission of Sin, and eternal Life by him,
was not promised but upon condition of
Faith and Repentance, as appears by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
frequent explanation of the the general
Promise. <hi>Abraham believed in the Lord, and
it was counted unto him for righteousness,</hi> Gen.
15. 6. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had not believed God, he
had not been justified notwithstanding the
Promise. So that this Justification depended
as well upon his performing the condition of
the Promise, as upon the Promise itself. And
when God said to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me,
and be thou upright, and I will make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with thee,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. The Lord made
<hi>Abrahams</hi> upright walking before him, the
condition of his keeping, as well as making
Covenant with him. Besides, it is apparent
that God made Circumcision to be the
Covenant to be kept on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55859:20"/>
Seeds part, as the condition of what God had
promised on his part, <hi>Gen. 17. 4, 7, 10. As
for me, my Covenant is with thee, &amp;c. Thou shalt
keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed
after thee in their generations.</hi> And <hi>this is the
Covenant which ye shall keep between me and
you, every Man-child among you shall be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.</hi>
By which is to be understood, not so
much Circumcision in the flesh, as in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
as I shall shew anon.</p>
                  <p>And the truth is, it would not suit with
God's end and design in his Covenant, of
restoring Man to the rectitude of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(mentioned before) to do it without
Man's endeavours in the use and exercise of
his natural faculties of Understanding and
Will, as he is a rational Creature and free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
For God works that change in Mans
nature, designed in his New Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
not meerly Physically, but Morally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
1. By proposing great and important
Truths to his mind and understanding, and
in assisting this natural faculty, in considering
how his happiness is concerned in that which
is proposed, in case it should prove true, and
in considering likewise what reason there is
to believe that it is true, and in discerning the
truth of it upon consideration. And 2. By
proposing Motives to the Will to incline it to
follow the dictates of the enlightned mind,
and by assisting the Will to be governed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55859:21"/>
So that Man himself is not wholly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
in this change, or what goes to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it; but is so far active in it, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate
what he doth by God's assistance, to
be his own act. So that the Man is said to
believe, to repent, to obey, when he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
repent, and obey: For so he is every
where in Scripture said to do. God doth not
repent in Man, but Man repents through his
grace and assistance. And therefore God's
grace, and Man's indeavours in working this
change, are very consistent. <hi>Phil. 2. 12, 13.
Work out your own salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
For it is God which worketh in you both
to will and to do of his good pleasure.</hi> If Man
do but what he can do, through the assistance
of God's common Providence (in whom we
live, and move, and have our being) God is
most ready, through his good pleasure, or out
of the goodness of his will and pleasure, to
work in him both to will and to do savingly,
to carry the work quite thorow. Otherwise
if there were nothing that Man could do in a
way of common Providence towards his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
why should he be exhorted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to do that, which yet will not be done
to effect and quite thorow, without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of God's Grace and good Spirit. The
co-operation of God's grace with Man's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
in this change in the nature of Man,
which is necessary to his salvation, is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55859:21"/>
that lies very fair and plain in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And therefore men are called upon
to <hi>make themselves new hearts,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31.
<hi>Make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit,
for why will ye dye, O house of Israel?</hi> And
God is said to make them new hearts also,
<hi>Ezek. 36. 26. A new heart also will I give you,
and a new Spirit will I put within you.</hi> Men
are called upon <hi>to circumcise their own hearts,</hi>
Deut. 10. 16. And God is said to circumcise
the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. Men are required <hi>to
cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the flesh
and Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. And they are also said
to be <hi>washed and sanctified by the Spirit of God,</hi>
1 Cor. 6. 11. Men are commanded to repent,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. And God is said <hi>to give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
2 Tim. 2. 35. Acts 5. 31. It is by
reason of this co-operation of God's assistance,
and Man's endeavours, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
himself as he doth once and again, <hi>Gal.
2. 20 I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless
I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than
they all: Yet not I, but the grace of God which
was with me.</hi> He doth not by these last words
so deny what he had said in the former, as if
he had not spoke true, for he speaks the same
thing in effect in another place, without any
such correcting himself, as here he useth, 1 <hi>Cor.
3. 9. For we are labourers together with God.</hi>
And therefore by his so correcting himself,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55859:22"/>
saying, Not I, but the grace of God which was
with me, he only intends to magnifie Gods
grace, as having the principal stroke in the
work. It is a phrase of like import with that,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. For <hi>even that which was made
glorious, had no glory in this respect, by reason of
the glory that excelleth.</hi> So mans indeavour
though it be somewhat in it self considered,
yet comparatively, and in respect of the work
of Gods grace by his Spirit which excels, it is
nothing. Therefore in fine, as men are said
<hi>through the Spirit to mortifie the deeds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
Rom. 8. 13. So they may be said through
the same Spirit, to believe, repent, obey; that
is, through the assistance of the Spirit, who
is said to help our infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</p>
                  <p>Considering then that there is promise of
Divine assistance to Man, using his endeavours
in doing what he may, and can do towards
the performing the condition of the Covenant,
we may well conclude, that there is no Man
under the Gospel, doth perish, but through
his own fault and neglect. It is true, God
doth sometimes for special reasons meet with,
and convert sinners with a high hand of
grace, whil'st they are pursuing their sins in
a full career, and using no indeavours at all
towards their own salvation, as he did <hi>Saul</hi>
before he was <hi>Paul.</hi> But such extraordinary
instances, are no Rules to us by which to judge
of God's ordinary proceedings in converting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55859:22"/>
men: Nor hath the Lord put men in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
by any promise of his, of their being
converted after that manner, and upon such
terms. And therefore it will in no wise be
safe for any man to expect to be converted by
such extraordinary workings of grace, and to
neglect to do what he can do, and what God
requires he should do, towards his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
                  <p>There are many things which men may,
and can believe and do, without any superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
grace, and by vertue of God's common
grace. It is no Supernatural Act to believe
the Being of God, and the Immortality of
the Soul or future state: Or to know that we
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inners against God, and consequently
that we stand in need of his mercy: Nor is it
a Supernatural Act for a man to desire the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
happiness of his own Nature or Being;
or to hear the Word of God which directs the
way to that happiness; no more than it is to
hear any other Doctrine that only pretends to
do so. Nor is it a Supernatural Act to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Doctrine of the Scriptures with as
much seriousness, as men do or may, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of any other Books. Nor is it a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Act to consider how we are concerned
in the Doctrine of the Scriptures, in case it
should prove true: No more is it a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Act seriously to consider the strength and
force of those Reasons that tend to perswade
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55859:23"/>
men to believe that Doctrine to be true: Nor,
under the natural desires which men have to
be happy in another world, is it a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Act for them to pray to God to direct
and assist them in the use of means, that they
may be happy. These I take to be no Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Acts in men, For though the depraved wil
of Man needs special or Supernatural grace to
do these so seriously and effectually, as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to true Sanctification, yet in some sort
and measure they may be done by common
help. And if men would but go thus far (as
they can) out of a real desire to be happy,
I should make no question but that the Spirit of
God would yield them his assistance to carry
them quite through in the work of conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And whether our Saviour doth not by
the hearers, resembled by the good ground,
mean such men as before their conversion
have some such working of heart about their
future state, as doth incline them to hear and
consider what with any fair probability may
be said about the way to be happy in that
state, and not to hear out of curiosity, or for
fashion-sake, or to carp; I submit to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>It is doubtless then mens inconsideration,
carelesness and negligence in those things
which they do believe, and which they can do,
that undoes them. It is <hi>because seeing they
see not, and hearing they hear not,</hi> which is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55859:23"/>
the reason <hi>why more is not given, but rather
that taken away from them which they had.</hi>
That is, The reason why God with-holds
his special grace, and many times withdraws
common grace and assistance from men, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though they have understanding and
considering faculties, which they could if they
would use and imploy about their being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in another world, as well as they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their happiness in this, yet they will not,
though they are frequently called upon, and
excited thereto: Whereas those that <hi>take heed</hi>
or <hi>consider what they hear,</hi> and how they are
concerned in it; <hi>to them more shall be given:</hi>
God wil come into such with supernatural aid,
<hi>Mark</hi> 4. 24. And therefore God, to put
men upon a holy necessity of complying with
his grace, in acting diligently towards the
working out their own salvation, hath wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made the obtaining of the great benefits of
the Covenant, remission of Sin, and eteternal
Life, conditional, so that men can have no
farther assurance of pardon of sin and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than they are sure they sincerely indeavo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r
to perform the condition on their part, upon
which they are promised. Wherefore we
are greatly concerned to be awakened by such
sayings as these; <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait
gate: So run that ye may obtain: Vse all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to make your calling and election sure:
Work out your salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55859:24"/>
Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being
left us of entring into his rest, any of you should
seem to come short of it.</hi>

                  <head>Sect. 7.</head>
                  <p>I come now in the next place to shew, <hi>What
the condition of the Promise to Abraham was.</hi> In
short it was a <hi>practical Faith.</hi> And under
this Head, I shall endeavour, 1. To give some
account of the nature of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
2. To describe Faith. And 3. To
shew reason why Faith is made the condition
of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>1. The condition of the Promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
was <hi>Faith,</hi> and (as I shall after shew)
a <hi>practical Faith.</hi> For that was it upon
which the great blessing of the Covenant, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
was conferred upon him, with the
consequent benefits. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. it is said of
<hi>Abraham, that he believed in the Lord, and he
counted it to him for righteousness.</hi> But St. <hi>Paul</hi>
reciting this Scripture, saith, <hi>Abraham belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God,</hi> and it was counted to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<hi>Rom. 4. 3. Gal.</hi> 3. 6. If there be any
difference between believing God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in God, it seems to be this. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God, is to believe him upon his Word,
to believe all that to be true, which he saith
when he hath once spoken it. But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God, is first, to believe him to be such
an one, of such a Nature, as neither will, nor
can at any time speak any thing but what is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55859:24"/>
true: It is to believe him to be <hi>a God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lye.</hi> For all true Faith, as <hi>Abraham's</hi> was,
is founded in the Nature of God. <hi>Abraham</hi>
did primarily believe in God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed his sayings, of what nature soever
they were. And secondly, to believe in God,
is to believe that he can, and will perform
whatever he promised, how unlikely soever
the thing in its own nature otherwise be. And
this was the nature of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Comment upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.
20, 21. <hi>He staggered not at the Promise of God
through unbelief, but was strong in Faith, giving
glory to God; and being fully perswaded, that
what he had promised, he was able also to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi>
He gave to God the glory of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Being, of his truth and faithfulness
in his Promises, and of his power and ability
to perform what he had promised, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
its utmost improbability in nature.
And <hi>therefore,</hi> or for this reason, <hi>his Faith was
imputed to him for righteousness,</hi> as we are told
in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. And so it should seem
it is not the believing of any one particular or
single Promise, that is counted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
otherwise than as it is an instance of
Faith in God in general, in reference to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he doth say or shall declare. Which may
be the reason why Faith is said to be counted
to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteousness, as well when he
had not the <hi>Messias</hi> in the Promise as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55859:25"/>
Object of his Faith, but somewhat
else, as when he had. The Promise, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of which was counted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for
righteousness, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. was a Promise of
a numerous issue, [<hi>So shall thy Seed be</hi>] <hi>viz.</hi>
as numberless as the Stars. But that which
produced a belief of this particular Promise,
would, and doubtless did produce in him a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Promise of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and of every
other Promise and Word of God, and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his mind, so far as understood by him, &amp;
that was a habitual belief of God's Truth, and
Faithfulness, Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dom, Power, and Goodness;
his fixed belief in God. And so a believing
God's threatnings so as to use means to escape
them, is (it should seem) counted to one for
righteousness, as well as the belief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
as growing upon the same Root. Thus
<hi>Noahs</hi> believing God's threatning to bring a
Deluge upon the World, and his obedience to
God's command in the preparing an Ark for
the saving of his house, was that, or at least
one instance of that Faith, <hi>by which he became
Heir of the Righteousness which is by Faith,</hi> Heb.
11. 7. It was this general Faith in God that
made <hi>Abraham</hi> so complyant with every
intimation of his will and pleasure. By it he
forsook his own Countrey and Kindred at
God's command, to go he knew not whither,
but depended on God's after-direction in that
case, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8. By it he was ready to offer
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55859:25"/>
his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> in whom the Promises were
made: And he had such a firm belief in God's
Promise, that in <hi>Isaac</hi> his Seed should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that he concluded that God would raise
him from the dead when he had sacrificed him,
rather than fail in the least of making good his
Promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17, 18, 19. He had such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in God, that is to say, in his Wisdom,
Goodness, Truth, and Power, as wrought him
to an entire resignation of himself to God's will
and pleasure. He believed God to be so good &amp;
so wise, as not to put him upon any thing but
what should be for his good in the issue: And
so true and powerful, as to promise nothing
but what he could and would perform. In a
word; this his belief in God, made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all his Promises, and obey all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
                  <p>2. Come we next to some <hi>description</hi> of that
<hi>Faith,</hi> which is the condition of the Promise,
or Covenant of Salvation: Wherein I shall
have respect to the nature of saving Faith in
general, in reference to all Ages of the Church,
and also to the Christian Evangelical Faith in
special. Faith strictly taken, is an assent unto
the truth of any Proposition upon the credit
of the Speaker. But saving Faith is of a more
comprehensive nature than is a meer assent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the truth of any one Proposition. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
saving Faith is sometimes described
by an assenting to the truth of one single Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55859:26"/>
yet then it implies the belief of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, and such a belief as draws in the
Will to act according to the import and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of the thing believed. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
The belief of this Proposition [<hi>That
Christ Iesus is the Son of God</hi>] by which
Faith is sometimes described, doth include in
it a belief of the truth of his whole Doctrine,
both concerning God's Grace, and Mans Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Will's concurrence as to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in it. For, if he be the Son of God,
then he cannot lye or deceive in any thing he
hath said. And again, the belief of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
[<hi>That God raised Christ from the Dead</hi>]
by which Faith is also described, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9.
includes in it a belief that all that Doctrine
which he taught, is undoubtedly true: For if
it had not, God would never have wrought
such a Miracle as to raise Christ from the dead
to confirm it. The belief then of such single
Propositions, include a belief of the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel, which is the Proper
Object of the Christian Faith, and for that
cause is frequently stiled <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>the Faith,</hi>
in the New Testament.</p>
                  <p>But if we respect the nature of Faith in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as answering the different degrees of
God's Revelation of his Will in several Ages
of the World, both under the Gospel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
I do not know how better to define it
than thus: Faith is such a hearty belief
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55859:26"/>
of God's Declaration concerning his own
Grace, and Man's Duty, as doth effectually
cause a man to expect from God, and to act
in a way of sincere Obedience, according to
the Tenour and Import of such a Declaration.
Or, if you will take in the belief of God's
threatnings against sinners, into the definition;
then it will be thus: Faith is such a hearty
belief of God's Declaration concerning his own
Grace and Displeasure, and Man's Duty, as
doth effectually cause a man to expect from
God, and to act in a way of sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
according to the Tenour and Import of
such a Declaration. Faith thus defined, we
have already seen exemplified in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
who is the great Exemplar of believing, and
the Father of Believers. And that it was his
belief of God's Promise, or Declaration of
grace and favour to him, as it was practical
in producing Repentance, Self-denial, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Obedience, by which he was justified and
made happy, appears farther, not only in that
it's said by St. <hi>Iames,</hi> that his Faith wrought
with his Works, and was made perfect by
them, and that he was justified by Works, as
well as by Faith (of which more anon) but
also in that it's said, that <hi>he received the sign of
Circumcision</hi> (which was the Condition
upon which God covenanted with him to be
his God, and upon the same terms to be the
God of his Seed) <hi>a Seal of the Righteousness of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55859:27"/>
the Faith which he had while he was yet uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised.</hi>
For supposing (which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied)
Circumcision to be an outward Sign of
inward Grace, of the Circumcision of the
Heart, consisting in Mortification, or a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
change of the Heart, which is the effect
of Faith, his Circumcision as such, was a Seal
of confirmation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that it was upon
his former so believing God upon his Promise,
as thereby to be induced to leave the evil
Customs of his Countrey, and his Countrey it
self, with his Kindred, &amp; his Fathers house; that
God would be his God indeed: In which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
was implicitly promised, all that would
make him eternally happy. And God's further
design of giving to <hi>Abraham</hi> this Covenant
of Circumcision, as a Seal to assure him the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the benefit wrapt up in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
upon the terms aforesaid, was, that he
might be the Father of all them that believe,
whether literally circumcised or not; that is,
that he might be a great Example and Pattern
to all others, of obtaining the same benefits in
the same way, and so might be a means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
others to believe in God, and to obey
him, as he had done; to be a great Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to propagate the kind of new Creatures,
of Men renewed to God, to the end they might
be blessed as he was. This, or somewhat
to this effect, is doubtless the meaning of <hi>Rom.
4. 11, 12. And he received the sign of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55859:27"/>
a Seal of the Righteousness of the Faith
which he had, being yet uncircumcised: That he
might be the Father of all them that believe,
though they be not circumcised; that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
might be imputed to them also: And the
Father of Circumcision to them who are not of
the Circumcision only, but also walk in the steps
of that Faith of our Father Abraham, which he
had being yet uncircumcised;</hi> and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
but that as Heart-Circumcision under
the figure of Literal-Circumcision, was toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Faith, made the condition of the
Covenant then; so Spiritual Baptism, which
is a death unto sin, and a living unto God, is
under the Figure of Water-Baptism, joyned
with believing, as the condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Salvation: now, <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that
believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which St. <hi>Peter</hi> having spoken of <hi>Noah's</hi>
Ark, saith; <hi>The like figure whereunto Baptism
now saveth us; not the putting away of the filth
of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
towards God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. Now as it was in
<hi>Abraham,</hi> such a belief of God's Declaration of
Grace and Favour, as did effectually induce
him to love and obey God, by which he was
justified, so (I shall shew afterwards) it was
the very same kind of Faith, working after the
same manner, by which the Saints under the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> were saved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55859:28"/>But Faith, as Evangelical and Christian, is
such a hearty assent and consent unto God's
Declartion in the Gospel by his Son, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ himself, and his Grace and Favour
towards Men by him, and concerning their
own duty, as causeth a man to expect from
God, and to act in a way of duty, according
to the Tenour of such a Declaration, and his
own concerns in it. And Faith, thus defined,
is fully agreeable to the Tenour of the Gospel:
<hi>Mark 16. 15, 16. Go ye into all the world, and
preach the Gospel to every Creature: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
and is Baptized, shall be saved.</hi> He that
believeth What? Why, he that believeth that
Gospel which was to be preached to every
Creature. Which Gospel contains a Declaration
of God's Grace, &amp; Man's Duty, &amp; of his Wrath
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
Men. For, 1. It declares from God that he hath
given his Son Jesus Christ to be the Saviour of
the World, by being a Propitiation for the
sin of it, in becoming a Sacrifice to expiate sin.
2. It declares that God upon account of his
Sons giving himself a Ransom for all, hath
made, and doth establish a New Covenant
with the World, to pardon, and eternally to
save as many as shall believe in his Son, and
repent of their sinfulness, in changing their
Minds, and reforming their Lives, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
new men, in yielding sincere obedience
to the Precepts of the Gospel. 3. It declares
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55859:28"/>
that <hi>those that believe not, shall be damned,</hi>
and such as repent not shall perish, and that
the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom
of God. This summarily is that which the
Gospel declares concerning God's grace and
displeasure, and Mans duty.</p>
                  <p>Now it is the Practical belief of all this,
that is the saving Faith. It is not the bare
belief that God hath given his Son to be
the Saviour of the World, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
for the sin of it: Nor is it a bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
that he will for Christ's sake pardon and
save as many as truly repent and amend their
lives, and become new Creatures; unless they
so believe all this as seriously and heartily to
Repent themselves of their former folly, and
to return to their duty in new Evangelial Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
For otherwise, for a Man barely to
believe all this, and not to act according to his
own concerns in it, will be so far from being
a believing to the saving of the Soul, as that
it will rather plunge him the deeper in destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for living and acting contrary to his own
light and belief, as <hi>holding the truth in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
the wrath of God being revealed from
heaven against all such,</hi> Rom. 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>A man of this practical Faith which I have
described, eyes as well the condition upon
which the saving Benefits are Promised
through Christ, as the Promise it self of those
benefits; and expects the enjoyment of those
benefits upon God's Promise and Christ's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55859:29"/>
no otherwise than as he with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of God's grace, is careful to perform
the condition. Which belief of his, makes him
as careful to perform the condition in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his own duty therein, as ever he
hopes to enjoy the promised pardon of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ, and to escape the damnation
threatned against those who perform not the
condition. So that a Man by this Practical
Faith, belives one part of God's Declaration
in the Gospel as well as the other, and his
own duty to be as well necessary to his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
as the condition appointed by God,
as the Grace of God, through Christ, it self is
upon another account: And by this belief he is
effectually moved, as well to act in a way of
duty to God, as to expect mercy from him;
considering how his happiness is concerned in
both, when he hath the whole of God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
in all the parts taken together, in
prospect, as the Object of his Faith.</p>
                  <p>When he hears that <hi>God so loved the World,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believes in him, should not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life.</hi> When he hears that <hi>God hath set
forth Christ to be a Propitiation through Faith
in his Blood:</hi> And when he hears again, <hi>that God
was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself,
not imputing their trespasses unto them;</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
all this to be true, as coming from God
that cannot lye, and accordingly is incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55859:29"/>
to hope in God's mercy, and is comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby. But then when he hears again,
that <hi>except we repent, we shall all perish;</hi> that
<hi>except a man be born again, he cannot see the
Kingdom of God:</hi> That <hi>without holiness, no
man shall see the Lord;</hi> and that <hi>the pure in
heart shall see God: That not every one that
saith Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven, but he that doth the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven:</hi> That <hi>the Lord Iesus
shall be revealed from Heaven, with his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Angels in flaming fire, to render vengeance
to all those that know not God, and which obey
not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> But
that <hi>he is the Author of eternal Salvation to all
those that obey him.</hi> I say, when he hears all this,
he as verily believes this part of Gods Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Gospel, to be the faithful and true
sayings of God, as he accounted the other to
be. And accordingly, doth as seriously, and
sincerely set upon the work of Repentance,
and as carefully useth God's appointed means
for the changing of his Heart, and renewing
of his Nature, for <hi>the purifying of himself as
God is pure;</hi> and doth as carefully obey all the
Precepts of the Gospel; as he hopes upon the
account of Christ's sufferings and God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
to be pardoned and saved; as believing
that those Benefits are neither promised, nor
can be obtained, but in this way of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Condition. And I doubt not to say,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55859:30"/>
this practical Faith, as it respects God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
touching Mans duty, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with his own Grace in Christ, is, where the
Gospel comes, the only saving justifying
Faith.</p>
                  <p>3. Come we now to shew Reason why
Faith is made the Condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>It is of Faith that it might be of Grace,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. It is that the
Grace of God to miserable Men, might the
more shew it self. For so it doth, not only in
promising unspeakably great things through
Christ to Man, who is not only un-deserving,
but ill-deserving also; but also in that these are
promised upon such a possible practicable easie
condition as Faith is, considering the means
and assistance promised by God to work it:
And considering also that the Promise is made
to the truth, unfeignedness and sincerity,
and not to perfection of Faith, Repentance,
and new Obedience in their utmost degree.
So that Christ might well say, <hi>my Yoke is easie,
and my Burden light,</hi> Matth. 11. 30. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the old way of promising the Inheritance
on the Law terms, would have been to have
promised it upon impossible conditions, as
the case now is with fallen Man. And if God
should Promise never so great things to Man,
in his impotent and miserable state, upon an
impossible condition, he would have been so
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55859:30"/>
far from manifesting abundance of Grace,
Compassion, and Love to him in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that he would rather have seemed to
insult over him in it. And therefore if the
Promise should have run upon the Law-terms
and not of Faith, it would utterly have fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
God's design of manifesting his grace to
Man, and of recovering Man's Love and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to him thereby. <hi>Rom. 4. 14. If they which
are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void,
and the Promise made of none effect. But it is
of Faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the
Promise might be sure to all the Seed, not to that
only which is of the Law, but to that also which
is of the Faith of Abraham,</hi> ver. 16.</p>
                  <p>2. This may be another reason why such
a Faith as I have described, is made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Covenant of Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it best answers God's design in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
of renewing the nature of Man in
Holiness and Righteousness, and by that means
restoring it to happiness. For, by Faith Men
are born of God, or made the Children of
God. <hi>Gal. 3. 26. Ye are all the Children of God
by Faith in Christ Iesus.</hi> Joh. 1. 12, 13. <hi>As
many as received him, to them gave he power to
become the sons of God, even to those that believe
on his Name. Which were born, not of blood, nor
of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,
but of God.</hi> Now to be born of God, or, which
is the same, to be made the Child of God, is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55859:31"/>
to have ones Nature restored to the likeness of
God, in which Man was first made, and is the
same thing with that wich is called <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
and a being <hi>born again,</hi> and <hi>a
new Creature.</hi> Which new Creature, or the
nature of Man renewed by Faith, is also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>new Man, which after God, is created
in righteousness and true holiness,</hi> Ephes. 4. 24.
To be born again, is to have the faculties of
Mans Nature restored to a rectitude in their
motions and operations in reference both to
God and Man, to be restored to their proper
moral use for which they were made. It is
in a word, that which is called a being <hi>made
partakers of a Divine Nature.</hi> For those which
are begotten of God, are begotten in, or to his
likeness. Men can adopt those which are not
their natural Children to inherit their Estates,
but they cannot adopt them to a participation
of their Moral Endowments. But God adopts
his Children to a participation with him in
the Inheritance, by adopting them to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of the Moral perfections of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that is, to a consimilitude to him in
them.</p>
                  <p>And this we say is done by Faith; that is,
by Faith in God, and by Faith in his Word.
For, in order of Nature, God is first believed to
be a God of Truth, before his Word is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be the Word of Truth. And the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditableness
of his Word depends upon the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55859:31"/>
knowledge or belief of the fidelity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And this Truth of God and of his
Word, is the immediate Object of Faith. By
Faith, a Man believes that to be true which
God reveals or declares as his Mind and
Will, let the Import of it be what it will.
But then this Faith operates upon the Will
and Affections, according to the Tenour and
Import of that which is revealed. If it be
matter of sad import, it works a hatred to him
that threatens it, and a fear of the thing
threatned, if it be apprehended to proceed
from an enemy. And this is the effect of
the Faith of Devils, who believe, and hate
God, who believe and tremble, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 19.
But if that which is revealed by God, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Man, betoken unspeakable love &amp; good
will in God to Man, and matter of the greatest
benefit to him, as a proof of such love, then
it worketh love to him that expresseth such
love (<hi>for Faith worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.)
and a longing desire after the promised bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
And as the Soul grows more and more
in love with God, because of his love; in love
with his blessed Nature and Divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
such as are his Love, and Goodness,
Truth, and Faithfulness, Purity and Patience,
Mercifulness, and readiness to forgive, which
render him altogether lovely; so it contracts
a likeness to God in these upon the Soul, and
so changes and renews the Moral habit and
constitution of the Soul, and consequently of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55859:32"/>
the whole Life. There is an aptness and
promptness in men to imitate that in others
(and so in God) for which they love them.
And frequent imitating Acts, beget habits,
Custom changing Nature. And hence it is,
that through Faith we are made partakers of
a Divine Nature. <hi>We all with open face, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as in a Glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same Image, from glory to glory,
as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. This
beholding the glory of the Lord, is by Faith,
(<hi>For we walk by Faith, and not by sight,</hi> 2 Cor.
5. 7. and by it <hi>Moses saw him who is invisible,</hi>
Heb. 11. 27.) And the <hi>medium</hi> by which
this Prospect is taken, is the Gospel,
by which the Lord in his lovely Perfections
is now openly revealed: And Faith being
from time to time busied in beholding of, and
conversing with these Perfections, it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
the Soul into the same Image or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>from glory to glory</hi> (that is gradually) <hi>as
by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> that is, through the
co-operation of God's Spirit with Mans Faith.
<hi>To comprehend the breadth, length, depth, and
heighth, and to know the love of Christ which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
knowledge,</hi> is the way to be <hi>filled with all
the fulness of God,</hi> by transcribing all his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
perfections upon the Soul, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.
18, 19.</p>
                  <p>And it is by virtue of their Relation to
Christ, and being thus begotten and born
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55859:32"/>
of God, and made partakers of a new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
conformable to God's, that Men can with
confidence call God Father: This blessed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of God's Spirit, is the Spirit of Adoption,
by which they cry, Abba, Father. And it is
this new Nature that is the Spring and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of a good Life, of all Pious and Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions. As it is said of God, <hi>Thou art
good, and dost good;</hi> so it is true of all those
that are born of him. <hi>A good Man out of the
good treasure of his heart</hi> (thus renewed)
<hi>bringeth forth good fruit: The Tree being good,
the Fruit will be good.</hi> And as this new Creature
groweth up to strength and maturity, so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of good, and acting worthily, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
natural and pleasant to him in whom it
is. To such an one <hi>the Commandments of God
are not grievous,</hi> but he will be able in some
good measure to say, <hi>I delight to do thy will,
O God, yea thy Law is in my heart.</hi> And for
sin, it being contrary to this new Nature, there
is a kind of Moral Impotency in him in whom
it is, to commit sin: <hi>He cannot sin, because he
is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. Or if such an one
be overtaken in a fault, it will work a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
in the Soul, just as that will
in the stomach, which a Man hath eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
against which he hath an antipathy in
Nature. But as for such as perform Religious
Duties, and do things materially good, only
by the strength of Extrinsecal Motives, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55859:33"/>
not froman inward Principle of this new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or love to the things themselves; to
such those actions, being unnatural, become
grievous and burdensome, and will be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in no longer, than those Motives conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in their strength.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="8" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 8.</head>
                  <p>The last thing I proposed to consider about
God's Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is, <hi>What we are
to understand by God's counting Abrahams Faith
to him for righteousness.</hi> And I take it to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
thus much: That God in a way of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
grace, or by virtue of a new Law of
grace and favour which was established by
God in Christ, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.) that is, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to what Christ was to do &amp; suffer in time
then to come, did reckon his Practical Faith
to him for Righteousness; that is, that which
in the eye of that new Law should pass in his
estimation for Righteousness, subordinate to
Christ's Righteousness, which procured this
Grant, or Law. For otherwise Faith, neither
as it is the condition of the Promise of Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sin through Christ, nor as it works
Repentance for sins past, or sincere Obedience
for time to come, is Righteousness in the Eye
of the Original Law. For that accounts no
Man that hath, though but once transgressed
it, to be Righteous either upon the account
of anothers suffering for his sin, or his own
Repentance or sincere imperfect Obedience;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55859:33"/>
but curseth every Man that from first to last
continueth not in all things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in that Law. But it is as I said, an
Act of God's special Favour, and by virtue of
his new Law of Grace, and as it is established
in Christ, that such a Faith as I have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
comes to be reckoned, or imputed to a man
for Righteousness, and through God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
it for Righteousness, to stand a man in
the same, if not in a better stead, as to his eternal
concerns, as a perfect fulfilling of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Law from first to last would have done:
Christ's Righteousness being presupposed the
only Meritorious Cause of this Grant or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                  <p>And thus indeed the Faith which I have
described, is a Man's Righteousness in the
Eye of this new Law, because it is Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
all that is required <hi>of him himself</hi> to make
him capable of the Benefits promised by it,
which as it is now revealed, is the Gospel.
Justification is a Law-term: And no Man
shall be justified in Judgment, or upon Tryal,
but he that is just in the Eye of this new Law
of Grace, as every one that rightly believes,
repents, and sincerely obeys, is, because that is
all that it requires of a Man himself to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
and Salvation. And yet every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Justification will be all of Grace, because
the Law by which they are Justified, is wholly
of Grace, is wholly a Law of Grace, and was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55859:34"/>
Enacted in meer Grace and Favour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Man, that was utterly undone by the
fall.</p>
                  <p>There are two things which I conceive do
constitute and make up the Righteousness of
the Law of Grace (presupposing all to be
procured by the purchase which Christ hath
made) first, the Righteousness which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the <hi>forgiveness of sins;</hi> and secondly,
the Righteousness of <hi>sincere Obedience.</hi> And
in reference to both these, Faith is imputed
for Righteousness, by virtue of the Law of
Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Faith as practical is imputed to a
Man for Righteousness, as it is that, and all
that which is required of him himself by the
Law of Grace, to entitle him to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which consisteth in the remission of
sins through Christ. Now that remission of
Sinnes is part of the Righteousness which
is by Faith, is evident from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7, 8.
Where the Apostle to prove that a Man's Faith
in God who justifyeth the ungodly, is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him for Righteousness, he citeth a passage
out of <hi>Psalm</hi> the 32d, <hi>Even as David also</hi>
(saith he) <hi>describeth the blessedness of the man to
whom God imputeth Righteousness without Works,
saying, blessed are they whose iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and whose sins are covered. Blessed is
the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</hi>
The Righteousness imputed in this sense, doth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55859:34"/>
consist in the non-imputation of sin. Not to
impute sin, is not to reckon a Man not to have
sinned; but it is to deal with him not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the demerit of his sin, it is to pardon
him for Christ's sake upon his penitential
Faith, and not to punish him for his sin; and
this by vertue of a new Law, or Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity,
or Covenant of Grace. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
pardon of sin is obtained for Man by
Christ his suffering for sin, (<hi>In whom we have
redemption through his blood, the forgiveneess of
sins,</hi> Ephes. 1. 7. and though God, <hi>for Christ's
sake doth forgive us,</hi> Epes. 4. 32.) yet the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
collation of this great Benefit, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
but upon condition of Man's Faith.
<hi>Him hath God set forth to be a Propitiation;</hi> but
it is <hi>through Faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. <hi>By
him all that believe are justified from all things,
from which ye could not be justified by the Law
of Moses,</hi> Acts 13. 39. and 10. 43. Although
Christ is the Propitiation for the sins of the
whole World, (1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 2.) yet that saying
of Christ must and will will take place; <hi>If ye
believe not that I am he, ye shall dye in your
sins,</hi> Joh. 8. 24. and that also, <hi>Mark 16. 16.
He that believeth not, shall be damned.</hi> So that
Faith is imputed for Righteousness, partly
as it is the Condition upon which pardon of
sin is granted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55859:35"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Faith is imputed for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which is practical, or productive
of sincere Obedience, without which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it is not a fulfilling of the Law of Grace as
a condition of the promised Benefits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
cannot justifie a Man in the Eye of
that Law. For</p>
                  <p>First, Repentance, and likewise forgiving
men their injuries (for instance) are such
Acts of Obedience, as without which a Man
cannot be pardoned; and if not pardoned,
then not justified. And therefore Faith is not
imputed for Righteousness, unless it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, No <hi>Faith is available</hi> to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but such as <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.
Which to say is all one, as to say, no Faith
is imputed for Righteousness, but such as
worketh by <hi>keeping the Commandments of God,
and fulfilling the Law;</hi> for that is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of love, both to God and Men,
1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 3. Rom.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Abraham</hi> who was set forth by
God for a Pattern of his justifying Men by
Faith, was Justified by such works as were the
fruits of his Faith, and not only by his Faith
which was the Root of them: And therefore
his Faith as practical, was imputed to him
for Righteousnss: And such must be the Faith
of all others that shall obtain Justification up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their believing as he did, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 21, 22, 23.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55859:35"/>
                     <hi>Was not Abraham our Father justified by Works
when he had offered Isaac his Son upon the Altar?
Seest thou how Faith wrought with his Works;
and by Works was Faith made perfect. And
the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
believed God, and it was imputed to him for
Righteousness.</hi> Where note these four things.
1. That <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith wrought with his
Works about the same end, as a Condition of
obtaining it, to wit, his Justification. 2. That
by his Works his Faith was made perfect, to
wit, in its aptitude by God's Institution, to
justifie him, without which it would not have
reached that end. 3. Note further, that it
was his Faith as it wrought with his Works,
and as it was compleated and made perfect by
them, that was imputed to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
4. Note, that in the Imputation of
his Faith for Righteousness, as it was thus
accompanied with, and perfected by Works,
was the Scripture ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>illed which saith, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
believed God, and it was imputed to him
for Righteousness.</hi> And if so, then the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Works, together with Faith, of
which St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks here, is a Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before God, and not before Men only, and
to a Mans own Conscience: For of such a
Justification doth the Scripture in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6.
speak, which is here cited by St. <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor doth this, that Faith accompanied with

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55859:36"/>
all derogate from the Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Christ in reference to the ends for
which they serve. Because the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and all the parts and terms of it, both
Promises of Benefits, &amp; the Condition on which
they are Promised, are all founded in Christ
his undertaking for us, and all the Benefits of
it accrue to us upon our Believing and Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon his account, and for his sake. <hi>We
are in him, who of God is made unto us Wisdom,
Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>For which cause also he is called
the Lord our Righteousness.</hi> Not as if his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Obedience to the Law, was so formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imputed to us, as that we should be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have kept the Law in his keeping of it,
(which hath been the Opinion of some) for
if that had been so, there would have been no
more need that Christ should have suffered for
us, than there was that he shoud have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for himself who had no sin, for neither
should we, if we had perfectly kept the Law
in him, or in his keeping of it.</p>

               <head type="sub">For what Ends the Law was added
to the Promise.</head>
               <p>I Now come to shew in the next place, <hi>for what
end the Law of Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es was added to the Promise.</hi>
And before I do this in particular, I shall note
only in general, that it was not added to cross
or confront the Promise, or God's Design in
it, but to be subservient to it, <hi>Gal. 3. 21. Is
the Law then against the Promises? God forbid.</hi>
For it is not to be thought that God would
prevaricate in his Design, so that when he had
once made a new Law of Grace for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of faln Man, he would yet afterwards
give any Law but what should one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
subserve to the same end, if Men do not
deprive themselves of the intended benefit by
perverting it. And therefore to be sure, God
did not intend to revive the Old Covenant of
Works made with <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> in the after
promulgation of the Law of Nature (which
we call the Moral Law) already broken. He
did not therein come to demand his full debt
of Innocency in Mans broken and bankrupt
condition, or to let him know that he would
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55859:37"/>
without any other condition than perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<hi>cast him into prison, until he had paid the
utmost farthing.</hi> For if he had, then the Law
indeed would have been against the Promise,
which declares quite otherwise. It is true,
the Law of Nature as it is a perfect Rule of
Natural Righteousness, founded in God's
Nature and Man's Nature, doth of it self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
perfect innocency, and can require no
less, being suited to the Nature of Man in its
perfect state. But when God brings this Law
forth, and sets it before Men that are now faln
from that state, as he doth in the promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, it is to let them know indeed what
they once were, and from whence they are
fallen, and how unhappy their condition now
is, according to the Tenour and Terms of
that Law, and that it would have continued
so for ever, if God had not made a new Law
of Grace, to over-rule that Law; and to let
all know that they shall still remain in that
condition that wilfully exclude themselves
from the benefit of the Law of grace, by not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Condition of it: and not to let them
know, they should have no better terms from
him than that Law affords them, nor to make
their perfect keeping of it the condition of
their Justification. But the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
taken in all its parts, was rather given
as an Appendix to the Promise, both as a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55859:37"/>
Rule of the material part of that Obedience,
which God would now require of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
in conjunction with their Faith in the
Promise, and as a Motive to that Obedience:
This in general.</p>
               <p>The Question is put, <hi>Gal. 3. 19. Wherefore
then serveth the Law?</hi> And the Answer
there is, That <hi>it was added because of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
until the Seed should come.</hi> And it
was added because of transgression in more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
than one.</p>
               <p>1. It was added to discover Sin, to make
that known to be Sin, which was so of it self,
and in its own nature before the promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law. For by reason of that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Wound which Man got in his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by the Fall, and by reason also of a
Progressive Degeneration in Mankind, the
Natural Sense of Moral Good and Evil, was
to a great degree worn out of the minds of
Men. For the repairing of which decay, a
promulgate Law (the ten Commandments)
answerable to the Law of pure Nature in the
Spirituality of it, was set on foot in the
World. And by this Law came Sin and Duty
to be more clearly known than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Rom. 3. 20. By the Law is the knwoledge
of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known Sin but by
the Law: For I had not known Lust, except the
Law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:55859:38"/>
2. The Law was added, not only barely
to make known that to be Sin, which was so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>of
it self before, but to set it out in it's Colours,
to make it known in the horrid nature and
consequence of it, that Men might be the
more afraid to have to do with it. <hi>The Law
entred that the offence might abound:</hi> That is,
that by that means it might be rendred the
more Criminous and Demeritorious: That
<hi>Sin by the Commandment, might become exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sinful,</hi> Rom. 5. 20. &amp; 7. 13.</p>
               <p>3. The Law as it discovered Sin, and made
it more criminous, and the people the more
sensible of guilt, and more apprehensive
of their obnoxiousness to punishment, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to set off so much the more, the Glory,
Beauty, and Desirableness of God's Grace in
the Promise of pardon and Salvation, <hi>Rom.
5. 20. The Law entered that the offence might
abound: But where Sin abounded, Grace did
much more abound.</hi> By how much the more
Sin appeared Sin, and was enhanced, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated,
and rendred manifestly mischievous
by a Promulgate Law; by so much the more
grace appear'd to be Grace, in all its Glory, that
brought deliverance from it, <hi>Rom. 5. 21. That
like as Sin hath reigned unto death</hi> (viz. <hi>by
the Law,</hi> that being the strength of Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 56.) <hi>Even so Grace might reign through
Righteousness unto eternal life through Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us
Christ our Lord.</hi> After Christ came, the rest
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55859:38"/>
which he gave, was so much the more sweet
to these <hi>Iews</hi> who received him, by how
much they had been weary and heavy laden
under a Spirit of bondage before.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>The Law</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) was our
Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we
might be justified by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 24. That
is, It was a lower sort of Institution accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the weak and more imperfect
state of the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, until afterward it should
deliver them over to a more perfect Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
under Christ. Parents first teach their
Children to speak, and after put them to
School to learn Letters, Syllables, Words, and
Sentences, the use and design of all which they
do not understand while they are Children, as
they do when they come to be Men. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to this hath God dealt with his
Church in the World, beginning with a lower
and more imperfect sort of Instruction, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and promises, and so proceeding to
those that are higher and more perfect, and
so by certain gradations, to lead on, and build
up his Church to a more perfect Spiritual and
compleat state of Faith and Holiness; <hi>To all
the riches of fulness of understanding of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of God, of the Father, and of Christ,</hi> Col.
2. 2. And thus the Law as a Schoolmaster,
had a double end and use: The one respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time then present: The other that
which was then future and to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:55859:39"/>
The then present use of it was twofold
also.</p>
               <p>1. To reclaim and restrain them from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Customs of the Heathen, to which
they were addicted, in which respect also it
<hi>was added because of transgression.</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Worship, stood in divers Superstitious
Rites or Ceremonies: And because the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
were adicted to a bodily Worship like
theirs, (for they said, <hi>let us make us Gods to
go before us,</hi> Exod. 32. 1.) and were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
thereby of being drawn to Worship their
Gods, therefore to prevent this (as Parents
put their Childeren to School, partly to keep
them out of harms way) the Lord by way of
condescention to their childish humour, did
ordain a Worship consisting much in bodily
exercise, and Instituted divers Laws, <hi>which
stood in Meats and Drinks, and divers Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and carnal Ordinances, until the time of
Reformation;</hi> till he should by sending his
Son, appoint more excellent Laws for reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both them and the rest of the World. <hi>Lev.
18. 3, 4, 5. After the doings of the Law of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
wherein ye dwelt shall ye not do; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the doings of the Land of Canaan whither I
bring you shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk
in their Ordinances. Ye shall therefore keep
my Statutes and my Iudgments: Which if
a Man do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e shall live in them,</hi> Ezek. 20.
6.—11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:55859:39"/>
2. The Lord did Institute diuers Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Laws for tryal and exercise of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in those lesser things for a time, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such as they were as yet best capable to
receive, thereby to lead them on to higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Obedience afterward. These many
Ceremonies which they were obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
were not things of any Natural or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
goodness, but only made use of by
God for a present turn, which when that was
served, they (as to practise) were of no
value, but became <hi>beggerly Elements.</hi> But
yet while they continued commanded of God,
their obedience in the use of them, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable,
as well as their obedience to any
other Laws.</p>
               <p>The other end and use of the Law as it was
a Schoolmaster, respected the time then to
come. For the high Priesthood, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Law, as they were Types of what
Christ should be, do, and suffer as Mediatour,
were of great use to the <hi>Iews</hi> after Christ had
suffered, and was risen again, and ascended
into Heaven, to facilitate both the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and belief of the Mystery of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Christ.</p>
               <p>1. To facilitate the knowledge thereof, and
to beget in them a right <hi>Notion</hi> of these things
in Christ, by which forgiveness of sins, and
acceptance with God, is obtained on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
For those who had long seen and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55859:40"/>
known the effect of Legal Sacrifices, as how
they did procure Legal impunity for offences
committed, God accepting the life of a Beast
that had not sinned, instead of the life of a Man
that had, might soon come to understand from
that by parity of reason, that God would
much more accept of his own Sons offering
himself in Sacrifice for us, so as to excuse us
from suffering eternal punishment for our sin.
<hi>For if the blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and the
ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the unclean, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
to the purifying of the flesh; how much
more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to
God, purge your Conscience from dead works to
serve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 13, 14. And so
the High Priests entring into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
in the behalf of the people, with the blood
of the Sacrifice, and burning Incense there,
doth greatly assist the mind in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Nature of Christ's Intercession for us
in Heaven, in virtue of his Bloodshed for us on
Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>2. The Law in the Typical Nature of it,
was of great use to the <hi>Iews,</hi> to facilitate and
strengthen their belief in Christ; and so were
the Predictions of the Prophets in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with it: for these and the accomplishment
of them in Christ, did so answer each other,
as in Water Face answereth to Face, that
those who believed the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55859:40"/>
had a great advantage by means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to believe in Christ. And therefore our
blessed Saviour when he would satisfie his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
touching himself, that he was indeed
the Christ, and of the necessity of his death,
(which death occasioned at first a staggering
in their Faith) <hi>beginning at Moses and
all the Prophets, he Expounded to them in
all the Scriptures, the things concerning himself,</hi>
Luke 24. 27. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to
Christianity, as the chiefest way to effect it;
<hi>he Expounded to them, and testified the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, perswading them concerning Iesus,
both out of the Law of Moses, and of the Prophets,
from morning to evening,</hi> Acts 28. 23. <hi>Had
ye believed Moses</hi> (Saith our Saviour to
them) <hi>ye would have believed me; for he wrote
of me: But if ye believe not his Writings, how
shall ye believe my words,</hi> Joh. 5. 46, 47. And
thus in both the forementioned respects, the
Law was a Schoolmaster indeed to bring them
to Christ, that they might be justified by
Faith.</p>
               <p>5. The Law was given to the Jewish Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not only for their behoof and benefit, but
also for a general good to the World: That the
Nations round about, hearing of such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Laws, &amp; perceiving how happy and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
those people were, so long as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them; might thereby be invited to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55859:41"/>
quit their Idol Gods, and to <hi>take hold of the
Covenant, and to joyn themselves to the people of
the God of Abraham,</hi> even as it came to pass
in such as were Proselited. And upon this
account it seems to be, that the Psalmist pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus: <hi>God be merciful unto us, and bless us,
and cause thy Face to shine upon us: That thy
way may be known on Earth, thy saving health
unto all Nations,</hi> Psal. 67. 1, 2. and concludes,
<hi>ver.</hi> 7. that if God should so do, his fear
would be propagated through the World:
<hi>God shall bless us, and all the ends of the Earth
shall fear him,</hi> Deut, 4. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Keep therefore
and do them, for this is your Wisdom, and your
Vnderstanding in the sight of the Nations, who
shall hear all these Statutes, and say, surely
this great Nation is a Wise and an Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people. For what Nation is there so great,
that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord
our God is in all things that we call upon him
for? And what Nation is there so great, that
hath Statutes and Iudgments so righteous, as all
this Law which I set before you this day?</hi> To
them were <hi>committed the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom.
3. 2. They were committed in trust to them
as Feoffees for the World, to communicate
the knowledge of God and of his Laws to the
Nations; to carry on further the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World begun in their Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and which was Promised to be more
compleatly effected by the <hi>Messias,</hi> in that all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55859:41"/>
Nations of the Earth should be blessed in him.
And as God's Judgements on the <hi>Iews</hi> for
breaking his Laws, was Admonitory to the
Nations about them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 24,—28. So
his famous Deliverances wrought for them
upon their Repentance for breaking his Laws,
made God known abroad to be a great favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of such as repent of their worshipping and
serving other Gods, and such a one as could
and would save, deliver and bless them that
turned to him to serve him only. Which
seems to be his meaning when he saith he <hi>will
be sanctified before the Heathen, when he should
gather them from among the people where they
were Captives,</hi> and that <hi>the Heathen should
know that he was the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 20. 41. &amp; 36. 23.
And by this means be brought them to fear &amp;
worship the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Psal. 102. 13, 15.
<hi>Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion; So
the Heathen shall fear the Name of the Lord;
and all the Kings of the Earth thy glory. When
the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion, they
said among the Heathen, The Lord hath done
great things for them,</hi> Psal. 126. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>6. The whole Law was given to be a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Instrument of governing the <hi>Israelites</hi>
(according to that state of their minority)
as a peculiar Republick, of which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was the Soveraign Legislator. But of this
more afterward.</p>

the Iews under the Law were saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And doubtless what ever it was, it became
available to that end, upon the account of
what Christ was to suffer, when he should
come. For, as I shewed before, that God's
Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed (by
virtue of which the faithful then were saved)
was <hi>confirmed in Christ;</hi> was established with
them in reference to what he was to do and
suffer as Mediatour afterwards, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. And
<hi>by means of his death, there was Redemption for
the transgressions that were under the first Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Heb. 9. 15. And the Sacrifices and
Priesthood, were <hi>a Figure for the time then
present,</hi> of what Christ should afterwards do
and suffer, and for what end.</p>
               <p>But when I say so, I do not say that all that
were saved, did understand so much. For
we see the Apostles of Christ, though they did
believe him to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi>
expected, yet they did not understand or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that he should suffer death as a Sacrifice,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55859:42"/>
till he told them so: Nay the thing was so far
from their thoughts, as that they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
him when he plainly foretold them
of his death, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 32. And if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
touching the resemblance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Priesthood of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> and the
Priesthood of Christ, was not in the Apostles
sense, <hi>Meat</hi> which <hi>Babes</hi> in Christanity could
well digest in their understandings, but was
<hi>Meat for strong Men,</hi> Heb. 5. 10.—14. we may
well guess by that how little the <hi>Iews</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Typical and Spiritual sense of those
Types about which they were frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant;
and wherefore it's said that the least
in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than <hi>Iohn</hi>
the <hi>Baptist,</hi> though he was so great, that there
was none greater before him. Hence we may
see, that one Reason why those <hi>Iews</hi> were all
their life time under a spirit of bondage to fear,
was the great Obscurity of the Declaration
of God's purpose of Grace to the World
through Christ, and the Way and Method of
Salvation by him. <hi>Moses was but a servant
for a Testimony of those things, which were [af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter]
to be spoken,</hi> and so declared afterwards,
as that the Typical meaning of them might
be understood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5. In the mean while,
as touching those things, <hi>they were shut up
unto the Faith which should [afterwards] be
revealed,</hi> Gal. 3. 23. It is said of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
whereof <hi>Moses</hi> was one, <hi>that not unto
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55859:43"/>
themselves, but unto us they did minister the
things which are now reported unto us, by
them that have preached the Gospel to us,</hi> 1 Pet.
1. 12. Add we to all this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8. where
having spoken in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of the High Priests
entering alone into the Holy of Holi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But as obscure as this way was, as to what
was to be done and suffered in particular by
the <hi>Messias,</hi> yet they had some general Grounds
of Faith and Hope, that upon their Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and sedulous endeavours to walk in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55859:43"/>
all the Commandments and Ordinances of the
Lord, they should obtain remission of their
sins, and a future happiness in another
World. Among which Grounds these were
not the least:</p>
               <p>1. They had the knowledge of the Promise
of Blessedness to all Nations in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
Seed, and of the Promise of those other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
which were Promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his Seed.</p>
               <p>2. They had an addition of several other
Predictions concerning the <hi>Messias,</hi> both by
<hi>Moses</hi> and other Prophets, that perhaps
were somewhat more express, such as in <hi>Deut.
18. 16. Isa. 53. Dan.</hi> 9. and others. These
Promises and Predictions, put them in great
expectations of Special Benefits by the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>
and wrought in them a longing after his
day. Upon which account our Saviour said
to his Disciples: <hi>Blessed are your Eyes, for they
see, and your Ears, for they hear. For I say
unto you, that many Prophets and Kings, and
Righteous Men, have desired to see those things
which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear
those things which ye hear, and have not heard
them,</hi> Mat. 13. 16, 17. Luke 10. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>3. They had large significations from God
of his special favour to them above all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as in chusing them to be his peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and in declaring himself to be their God;
in giving visible Signs of his Presence among
them, and excellent Laws &amp; Promises to them,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55859:44"/>
and sending his Prophets amongst them, and
working many wonders for them, and casting
out the Nations before them to make room
for them, and the like, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6, 7, 8. and
26. 18, 19. <hi>Psal. 147. 19, 20. Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>4. They had express Declarations from God
of the goodness of his Nature, and of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
towards Sinners, and of his readiness
to pardon such as should repent and return to
their duty in loving him, and keeping his
Commandments. As for instance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.
6, 7. <hi>The Lord passed before him, and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
long-suffering, and abundant in goodness
and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
iniquity, trangression and sin.</hi> And when
he delivered them his Law, with the greatest
terrour and astonishment to them, yet even
then he assured them that he would shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to thousands <hi>of them that love him, and keep
his Commandments;</hi> as in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.
And in case of their miscarriage
to the drawing down of Gods Judgements
upon them, he bespeaks them thus: <hi>When
thou art in tribulation, and all these things are
come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou
turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient
to his voice: (For the Lord thy God is a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God,) he will not forsake thee, nor forget
the Covenant of thy Fathers,</hi> Deut. 4. 31. and
30. 1, 2, 3. Levit. 26. 39, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55859:44"/>
From all which Grounds, the faithful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, had such a hope and confidence
of pardon of Sin, and of a future happiness
in another life, upon their Repentance and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Obedience, as did effectually induce them
to have good thoughts of God, to love him,
and to endeavour to please him, by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto all his Commandments. This
made him say, <hi>Psal. 130. 4. There is forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</hi> And
under <hi>this hope</hi> and confidence, <hi>the twelve Tribes
did instantly serve God day and night,</hi> and
grounded this Hope of theirs upon <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made of God unto their Fathers,</hi> as St. <hi>Panl</hi>
tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And indeed it was the unanimous Faith of
the most eminent among them from age to
age, that God had both made, and would keep
a Covenant to shew mercy to those that love
him, and keep his Commandments, or that
walk before him with all their heart: For
that they looked upon as the Condition of
God's Promise of shewing Mercy. This we may
see in <hi>Moses, David, Solomon,</hi> and in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Deut. 7. 9. <hi>Know therefore that the Lord
thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth
Covenant and Mercy with them that love him, and
keep his Commandments.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Psalm
103. 17, 18. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from
everlasting to everlasting to such as keep his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and to those that remember his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55859:45"/>
to do them.</hi> And thus <hi>Solomon,</hi>
1 Kings 8. 23. <hi>And he said, Lord God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
there is no God like thee, who keepest Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and mercy with thy servants, that walk
before thee with all their heart.</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> in his
9th Chap. 4th ver. <hi>O Lord, the great and
dreadful God, keeping the Covenant and Mercy,
to them that love him, and to them that keep his
Commandments.</hi> And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> likewise, Ch.
1. 5. <hi>I beseech thee, O Lord God of Heaven, the
great and terrible God, that keepeth Covenant
and mercy for them that love him, and observe his
Commandments.</hi> This we see was the serious
and constant Profession of the Faith of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God in those times. And in this
Faith and Practice doubtless it was, that they
lived, and dyed, and were saved.</p>

and of a different nature from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <p>Besides the general Promise which God

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aanites—to
his Seed.</hi> In order to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of which Promise, after he had brought
them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he united them under
himself as Head, in one Political Body, by a
Political Covenant, <hi>Exod. 19, &amp;c.</hi> which is
the Covenant I am now to discourse of. In
which discourse I would, 1. Shew in what
respect the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is said to contain a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55859:46"/>
Covenant of a different nature from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
2. Prove that it did contain such a different
Covenant. 3. For farther Illustration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it in its parts, and their relation one to
another. 4. And in what respect this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is called the first Covenant, when as
the Covenant of Grace was made before
it.</p>
               <p>1. In what respect the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is
said to contain a Covenant of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Covenant of Grace made with
<hi>Abraham.</hi> The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> comes under a
twofold consideration. 1. As in conjunction
with the Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which it
was annexed, it made up one entire Law, by
which the <hi>Israelites</hi> were to be governed and
directed in the way to eternal life: And in
this Conjunction, the Promise was the Life
and Soul as it were of the Body of the <hi>Mosaic</hi>
Law properly taken. And in this sense as the
word Law signifies the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or five
Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> (which contain the Promise
as well as the Law) it is sometimes used in
the New Testament, <hi>Gal. 4. 21, 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 14.
34. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. And in this sense doubtless we
are to understand the Law upon which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
bestowed so many glorious <hi>Encomiums</hi> as
he did, saying, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,
converting the Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 19. 2. We are
to consider the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as given at <hi>Sinai,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55859:46"/>
in a stricter sense, as it was an <hi>Instrument</hi> or
<hi>Rule</hi> of Government in the Commonwealth
of <hi>Israel.</hi> The Law, in the former sense of
it, promised eternal life (though but obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
to those that did believe its Promises, and
sincerely obey its Precepts. In the latter sense,
it promised only temporal Blessings to those
that strictly observed it in all the parts of it;
and threatned those with temporal calamities
that did not. The same Laws materially, of
this Political Covenant, related to both the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.
As eternal Life was promised in
the Covenant of Grace, upon condition of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
obedience to those Laws, as an effect of
Faith in the Promise; So those Laws, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Promise, were, as I may so
say, Evangelical. But as temporal benefits on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were promised in that Covenant upon
condition of strict obedience to those Laws;
and as those Laws were enjoyned under tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
penalties as they were Commonwealth-Laws;
so that Convenant, containing those
Laws, was Political, and in this Political re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
it was another Covenant. If the Law
of God, and the Law of Man command or
forbid things materially the same; yet if the
one command or forbid them under pain of
damnation, and the other only under tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
penalties; these Laws are not formally
the same. The Commonwealth of <hi>Israel</hi> had
no Commonwealth Laws, but what God
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55859:47"/>
himself gave them, the which Laws they
also covenanted with him to observe; by
which Covenant they were united under him
as Head of that Political Body. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they would needs choose them a
King like other Nations, God told <hi>Samuel,</hi>
saying, <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they
have rejected me, that I should not reign over them,</hi>
1 Sam. 8. 7. <hi>Ye said unto me</hi> (said <hi>Samuel</hi>)
<hi>nay, but a King shall reign over us, when the Lord
your God was your King,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 12. I conclude
then, that as the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did serve to
this Political end, so it was a distinct Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and different from the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>2. Let us see how this may be proved to
be a Covenant so distinct and different, as I
have said, from the Covenant of Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And to this purpose these
things are considerable.</p>
               <p>First, They are called the <hi>two Covenants,</hi>
by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 4. 24. And if they are two,
then there is a real difference between them,
else they would be but one and the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They bear distinct denominations,
the one is called the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi>
and the other, the <hi>Second</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> Heb.
Chap. 8. &amp; 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There were some sins pardonable
by one of these Covenants, which were not so
by the other; and that shews that they were
quite of a different nature. The Murder and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55859:47"/>
Adultery which <hi>David</hi> was guilty of, was not
pardonable according to the terms of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Covenant, if there had been any Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Power on Earth to have executed that
Commonwealth-Law; and yet according to
the terms of the Covenant of Grace, they were
pardonable upon repentance, and upon those
terms were pardoned unto him. The like
might be said perhaps of <hi>Manasseh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The unbelief of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in not
<hi>Sanctifying God in the eyes of the Children of
Israel,</hi> was according to the terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, pardoned as to the eternal
penalty, but yet was not wholly pardoned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the terms of the the Political Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as to temporal punishment: For the Lord
told them that for that cause <hi>they should not
bring the Children of Israel into the Land of
Canaan,</hi> Numb. 20. 12. And in reference to
this case, the Psalmist saith, <hi>thou wast a God
that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance
of their inventions,</hi> Psal. 99. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Covenant of Grace never
ceaseth, but it is of perpetual duration through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Generations; and therefore is called
the <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. But this
<hi>Mosaical</hi> Political Covenant, is <hi>vanished</hi> long
since, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. by which also it appears to
be a Covenant effentially different from the
other.</p>
               <p>3. For a farther Illustration of the nature
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55859:48"/>
of this Covenant, we will consider it in its
parts, and in the relation which those parts
bear one towards another. And in general,
it did consist of two parts. 1. Of Laws;
and 2. Of the Sanction of those Laws: The
Laws likewise were of two sorts. 1. Laws of
Duty. 2. Laws of Indemnity.</p>
               <p>1. Laws of Duty. And in them we may
consider, 1. What those Laws were. 2. What
manner of obedience to those Laws it was
which would free men from the penalties of
them, and entitle them to the Promises of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
annexed to them.</p>
               <p>First, The Laws of Duty, of which this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
did in great part consist, were those
which pass under the various denomination of
Moral, Ritual or Ceremonial, and Judicial.
Some of which Laws, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Decalogue
especially and almost wholly) for the matter
of them, were natural, that is, such as were
founded in the nature of Man, forbidding
things which of themselves were evil, and
commanding things which in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were good, and might be discerned to
be so, by Man in his pure Naturals, and in
great part since the degeneration of his nature,
whether they had been expresly forbidden, or
commanded, or no. But these Laws became
part of the Political Covenant, only as they
were expresly and externally declared to the
<hi>Iews</hi> by a Promulgate Law. For if this had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55859:48"/>
not been so, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could not have been said
to be <hi>without the Law,</hi> as they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14,
11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21. For they had the force and <hi>effect
of the Law in their hearts,</hi> and were in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<hi>a Law unto themselves, Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15.
But because the Decalogue, as well as the other
Laws, was delivered to the <hi>Iews</hi> only, and to
none else, from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> therfore they only
(and Proselytes that joyned with them) were
said to be under the Law, and all the rest
<hi>without Law.</hi> And therefore is the giving of
the Law reckoned to the <hi>Iews</hi> among their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Priviledges, <hi>Rom. 9. 4. Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20.
And in this sense only as the Decalogue was
a part of the Political Law, can the <hi>Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ingraven in Stones,</hi> be said to be <hi>done away,</hi>
as it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. For so much
of it as was a Copy of the Law of Nature, or
is by Christ incorporated into his Laws, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in force to all men.</p>
               <p>The other Laws of which this Covenant
did consist, were Arbitrary, the force of which
did wholly depend upon Divine Institution:
And such were the Laws Ceremonial; and a
great part of those we call Judicial.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That obedience which would
be sufficient to secure a Man from the penalty
of the Political Law, and to entitle him to
the Promised Reward annexed thereto, was
no less than a strict Obedience to it in all the
parts of it. For it is written, <hi>Cursed be he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55859:49"/>
that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to
do them:</hi> And <hi>all the people shall say, Amen.</hi>
Deut. 27. 26. And this extended to Heart-obedience,
and Heart-sinning, as well as to
the outward act, commanding <hi>love</hi> to God,
forbidding to <hi>covet,</hi> as under the Heart-search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Political Soveraign, who reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the final Judgement and Execution,
even in temporal respects, in many cases.</p>
               <p>2. Laws of Indemnity (of which also this
Covenant did consist) were partly those which
ordained Sacrifice and Offerings for the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of many sins made pardonable by those
Laws, so far as to exempt the Delinquent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from the temporal penalty threatned for
breach of those other Laws, which for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
sake, I call Laws of Duty; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
these also were Laws of Duty as well as
of Priviledge. There were other Laws of
Indemnity likewise for the purification of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
legally unclean; which being observed,
the persons unclean became delivered from the
penalties they suffered while their uncleanness
was upon them; such as was their separation
from the Congregation.</p>
               <p>Consider we next the Sanction of these
Laws; and that did consist in Promises an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the observing of them, and in a
curse denounced against the transgressors of
them. And for our better understanding
the Nature of the Promises of this Covenant,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55859:49"/>
we will consider them Negatively, and Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively.</p>
               <p>1. Negatively; The Promises of this Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical-covenant
as such, were not Promise; of
eternal life; And when I say so, I do not deny
but that, first, the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi> time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had Promises of eternal life implyed in
the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his
Seed. And accordingly the faithful ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, sought after the <hi>Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
and <hi>looked for a City which hath Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whose builder and maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11.
10, 14, 16. Nor secondly, will I deny but
that there are some passages in the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
if you take the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> in a large
sense, which look somewhat like a renewall
of the antient Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> to
his Seed. As when, for instance, God made
a conditional Promise to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
his time, to <hi>be their God, and that they
should be his people,</hi> as in <hi>Levit 26. 12. Deut.</hi>
29. 13. Which form of words is interpreted
sometimes to imply a future happiness in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, <hi>Heb. 11. 16. Matth.</hi> 21. 31, 32.
And I do not deny but the <hi>Iews</hi> had by
<hi>Moses,</hi> as express a Promise of the <hi>Messias,</hi> as
<hi>Abraham</hi> had, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15.—19. But St. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth not speak of the Law in this large sense,
when he opposeth the Law and the Promise,
the Law and Faith, one to another. But if
we understand by the Law of <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> the Law
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55859:50"/>
as Political, the Law of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
so the Promises of it were not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Eternal Life; For Promises of this
nature did pertain to another Covenant, to
wit, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Spiritual
Seed as such.</p>
               <p>First; Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth down-right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny that the Promise of the Inheritance,
(which in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. is called <hi>the Eternal
Inheritance</hi>) was by the Law, which yet it
would have been, if by Law he had meant
the Law in that large sense, in which the Law
and Promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> are conjoyned, and
not in that strict sense, by which he means the
Political Law distinctly. And if the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
had been promised upon the same terms
as temporal Blessings were in the temporal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
the Inheritance might have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Law, as well as temporal Blessings
were. <hi>Rom. 4. 13. For the Promise that he
should be Heir of the World, was not through the
Law, but through the Righteousness of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; St. <hi>Paul</hi> evinceth the badness of
that Opinion, to think that Eternal Life was
Promised upon the Law-terms, from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
consequence of it; shewing that if it
were, that then it would make void the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the way of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men by Faith in that Promise, of none
effect: <hi>Gal. 3. 18. For if the inheritance be of
the Law, it is no more of Promise: But God gave
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55859:50"/>
it to Abraham by Promise.</hi> Rom. 4. 14. <hi>For if
they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is
made void, and the Promise made of none effect.</hi>
It was altogether unreasonable to think that
the Inheritance should be promised upon such
distant and inconsistent terms, as are Faith
in the Promise, and by Works of the
Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>The Law,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is not
of Faith, but the man that doth them shall live in
them,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. meaning, that what the Law
promised, it did not promise it upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of believing, but upon condition of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And Eternal Life is not since the fall
promised upon condition of doing without
Faith, but upon condition of believing;
<hi>For the Iust shall live by Faith,</hi> Vers. 11.
and therefore Eternal Life is not promised
by the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; Wherefore else are the Promises
of that <hi>better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8. 6. said to <hi>be
better Promises?</hi> But because they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of better things than were promised in
the first Covenant; which yet they could not
be, if Eternal Life had been promised in that
Covenant, because that is the best of all
Promises.</p>
               <p>To say they are better only in respect of
Administration, and clearness of Revelation,
would not satisfie such as should well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That if the betterness of the Covenant
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55859:51"/>
and Promises, lay only in that, the difference
would not be so great, as to denominate
them two Covenants, and two so vastly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
as the Scripture represents them to be.
The difference then would be but only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,
as that is, which is found in the
same Covenant of Grace in the several Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and
now to all Nations since Christ's coming; and
not Essential, as that between the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
seem to be, as it is represented in <hi>Gal.</hi>
4. 24. Besides, St. <hi>Paul</hi> represents the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the two Covenants, to differ as
much as Righteousness and Condemnation,
Life and Death differ, which sure is more
than a gradual difference. The one is <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of Death and Condemnation;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>the Ministration of Righteousness and
Life.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Law made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope
did,</hi> Heb. 7. 19. By which it appears again,
that the hope of the Gospel (in which the
things hoped for upon the Promises of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
are not the least) is better than what the
Law promised the observers of it. <hi>This is the
Promise which he hath promised us, even Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life,</hi> 1 John 2. 25.</p>
               <p>2. And Affirmatively; It was then a long
and Prosperous life in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
that was promised in the first Covenant, <hi>Deut.
28. 11. The Lord shall make thee plenteous in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55859:51"/>
Goods, in the fruit of thy Body, and in the fruit
of thy Cattel, and in the fruit of thy Ground,
in the Land which the Lord sware unto thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to give thee,</hi> Deut. 11. 21. <hi>That your
days may be multiplied, and the days of your
Children as the days of Heaven upon Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great variety of outward blessings
is promised, as the reward of keeping that
Covenant. And therefore Wisdom under
that Dispensation is described, as having <hi>length
of days in her right hand, and in her left ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
Riches and Honour; whose ways are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness,
and all her paths peace,</hi> Prov. 3. 17.
And as this Covenant was National, so there
were Promises of National Blessings; such as
was the <hi>setting them on high, above all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth;</hi> making them <hi>the Head and
not the Tail:</hi> The giving them <hi>victory over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
multiplying the Nation,</hi> and bestowing
on it Health, Peace, and Plenty, <hi>Deut. 28. Lev.</hi>
26.</p>
               <p>When it's said once by <hi>Moses,</hi> thrice by
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and twice by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>the Man
that doth them, shall live in them,</hi> (Lev. 18. 5.
Ezek. 20. 11, 13, 21. Rom. 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12.)
thereby Epitomizing the first Covenant; I
conceive that by <hi>living,</hi> is meant a long and
prosperous life in this World. As on the
contrary, the condition of one greatly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is in Scripture-Dialect, a kind of Death,
and such an one said to <hi>be free among the Dead,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:55859:52"/>
Psal. 88. 5. And that which inclines me
so to think, is not only the Reasons already
given to prove that no other life was promised
in the first Covenant, but also the congruity of
this sense with other passages in the Writings
of <hi>Moses.</hi> As <hi>Deut. 30. 15. See, I have set before
you this day, Life and Good, Death and Evil.</hi> If
you would know what is meant by Life here,
the next verse will inform you: <hi>That thou
mayest live and multiply, and the Lord thy God
shall bless thee in the Land whither thou goest to
possess it.</hi> The contrary whereunto is the
death he had set before them; saying, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
unto you this day that ye shall surely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and that ye shall not prolong your dayes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Land, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 32. 46, 47. <hi>Set your
hearts unto all the words which I testifie among
you this day,; for it is not a vain thing for you,
because it is your life; and through this thing
ye shall prolong your dayes in the Land wherein
ye go.</hi> The latter words are exegetical of the
former: Through this thing ye shall prolong
your dayes, is the interpretation of those; <hi>it
is your Life.</hi> And it may be considered also,
whether this Particle [<hi>in</hi>] (which if a man do
he shall even live [<hi>in</hi>] them) may not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the nature and kind of that reward which
was promised in the first Covenant, as it was
a <hi>present</hi> reward, a reward which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
even while the work was doing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that, <hi>Psal. 19. 11. In keeping them
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55859:52"/>
there is great reward.</hi> And this is agreeable
to what fell out in the event. <hi>The Lord was
with them</hi> to prosper them, <hi>while they were
with him;</hi> but when they forsook him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
troubles overtook them. The pouring
out of God's fury on them to consume them
in the Wilderness, being put in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 13,
21. as the direct contrary to those words,
<hi>which if a man do, he shall even live in them,</hi>
seems greatly to favour this Nation. <hi>But the
house of Israel rebelled against me in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
They walked not in my Statutes, and they
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>spised my Iudgments, which if a man do, he
shall even live in them: Then I said, I would
pour out my fury upon them to consume them in
the Wilderness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed one main difference between
the two Covenants, (which I would have
here observed) lies in this, to wit, the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentness</hi>
of the reward promised in the first,
and the <hi>futurity</hi> of that promised in the second.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Allegorical description of the
two Covenants, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24, &amp;c. represents
those that adhered to the first Covenant, by
the children of <hi>Bond-servant,</hi> to whom <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
gave gifts in present, and sent them away,
as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 5. and those that adhered to
the second, by <hi>the Son of the Free-woman, Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi>
who was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Heir, to whom he
gave the whole Inheritance at last. And the
Adoption of Sons, as the Priviledge of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55859:53"/>
New Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is opposed to the condition
of Servants under the Old, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 7. And
what are they adopted to, but to an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for the future? for by Adoption they
are made Heirs: <hi>If a Son, then an Heir of God
through Christ:</hi> an Heir of what? <hi>of an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
for the future; an Inheritance Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
undefiled, and which fadeth not away,
reserved in Heaven,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 4. And therefore
they are said <hi>to wait for the Adoption, to wit
the redemption of their Bodies,</hi> at the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. Sons and Heirs serve their
Father with a free and ingenuous Spirit,
though they have but little for the present, in
confidence of what he will do for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in another world, when they shall come
to age. But those under the Old Covenant,
were like Servants, who serve with a servile
Spirit, because they do it with expectation
of present pay. The one <hi>walk by Faith,
which is the substance of things hoped for, and the
evidence of things not seen;</hi> the other were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
in their obedience, by the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of present reward, because that was it
which the first Covenant promised to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of it.</p>
               <p>These Promises now insisted on, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of reward to the observers of this first
Covenant: But besides these, there was
another sort of Promises exhibited in the first
Covenant, and they were Promises of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55859:53"/>
in many cases, when the Laws of
that Covenant were broken. There were (as
I have shewed) Laws of Indemnity, which
made many of the breaches of the Laws of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
pardonable upon certain conditions. And
such were all sins of Ignorance and Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and some of those also which were
committed wittingly. But presumptuous sins,
and such as carried in them a kind of contempt
of the Law, these were exempted from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
<hi>Heb. 10. 28. He that despised Moses Law, died
without mercy, under two or three witnesses.</hi>
But for the other, there were promises of
pardon upon certain conditions; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
were not always the same. In some
cases the offering of a Sin-offering, or Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass-offering,
was the Condition. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cases, that with confession of Sin, was the
Condition. And in some other Cases, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing,
Restitution, and Satisfaction were the
Condition. And afflicting of the Soul, as well a
the Sacrifice for Atonement on the day of
general Expiation, was always a Condition
of forgiveness. These things in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
of them, you have in the 4, 5, 6, 16,
and 23d Chapters of <hi>Levit.</hi> And then the
Condition of the Promises of Purgation of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Uncleannesses, and the penal effects of
them, was the observing the Rules prescribed
for purifying the Unclean.</p>
               <p>Now the forgiveness promised by these
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55859:54"/>
Laws of Indemnity, did not free the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
from all Obligation to Eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but only freed the Person from suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those temporal evils, which were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this Covenant against those which did
not continue in all things written in the Book
of it. Neither Sacrifices, nor Legal Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Sanctified, but unto the purifying of the
flesh,</hi> and to their temporal concerns only, <hi>Heb.</hi>
9. 9, 10, 13.</p>
               <p>And here we may observe a five-fold dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in reference to Remission of Sin,
between the first Covenant, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace.</p>
               <p>1. They differ in the nature of those Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
by which Atonements were made, and
upon which forgiveness was promised. The
blood of the Sacrifice of the first Covenant,
was but <hi>the blood of Bulls and of Goats,</hi> and the
like, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4. But the Blood of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the second Covenant, is the Blood of
Christ the Eternal Son of God. So that the
nature of the Sacrifices of the two Covenants,
upon which the Promise of the pardon of Sins
was granted, doth differ as much as the blood
of Beasts and the Blood of the Son of God
differ.</p>
               <p>2. Those two sorts of Sacrifices pertaining
to two kinds of Covenants, differ in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Efficaty and Virtue to accomplish
their respective ends and effects. There is a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55859:54"/>
greater richness of proportion in the Blood of
Christ to free the Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ience from the guilt of
Sin, or obligation to Eternal punishment,
than there was in the blood of Beasts to free
the Delinquent person from temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This is plainly intimated in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
13, 14. <hi>For if the blood of Bulls and of Goats,
and the ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the unclean,
sactifieth to the purifying of the flesh;</hi> [<hi>how
much more</hi>] <hi>shall the Blood of Christ, who through
the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot
to God, purge your Conscience from dead works
to serve the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They differ in the nature of the pardon
promised in each of the Covenants respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The Redemption granted in the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
was but temporal, as the Covenant
it self was; it was but from evils temporal:
But Christ Jesus by his Atonement, <hi>hath
obtained Eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Hebr.
9. 12.</p>
               <p>4. They differ in respect of the Sins made
pardonable by each Covenant respectively.
There were many sins for which the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
granted no pardon upon any terms
whatsoever. <hi>They that despised Moses Law,
died without mercy,</hi> Heb. 10. 28. But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace makes promise of the pardon
of the greatest sins upon Repentance. <hi>All
manner of Sin and Blasphemy, except the Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against the Holy Ghost,</hi> are pardonable
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55859:55"/>
upon Repentance. This difference is set down,
<hi>Acts 13. 39. And by him all that believe are
justified from all things, from which ye could not
be justified by the Law of Moses.</hi> We may well
suppose that the first Covenant did finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
some, which the Covenant of Mercy
pardoned. <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi>
did that which was unpardonable by the first
Covenant; it was a Fact to have been punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with death by the Law, but that there
was none but God that could duly inflict it
upon him in his capacity; and yet upon his
Repentance, it was pardoned as to his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
concerns, as well as temporal, by virtue of
God's Covenant of Mercy. On the other
hand, a man probably might be so righteous
in the Eye of the first Covenant, as not to
be visibly blameable, and yet even then he
obnoxious to the curse of the Everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
<hi>Paul</hi> while he was <hi>Saul,</hi> and in the
state of unbelief, was even then <hi>as touching
the righteousness which is in the Law, blameless,</hi>
as he himself saith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. So different were
these two Covenants, that him whom the
one condemned the other might justifie, and
likewise justifie him whom the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
               <p>5. They differed in respect of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be performed on Man's part for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of pardon. Pardon was promised i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the first Covenant upon condition of doing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55859:55"/>
only without reference to Faith; but so are not
the pardons of the New Covenant, <hi>Gal. 3. 11, 12.
But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight
of God, it is evident; for the Iust shall live by
Faith: And the Law is not of Faith; but the
man that doth them shall live in them.</hi> So
much concerning the first Part of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the first Covenant. Come we now
to the second.</p>
               <p>The other part of the Sanction of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
did consist in the curse of it denounced
against the breakers of it. Though it's true
that every Man is under a condemnation that
would be Eternal, until he comes to be
absolved by Virtue of the Law of Grace, yet
more than temporal death was not expresly
threatned for breach of the Political Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as such.</p>
               <p>1. For first, A violent death inflicted by
the hand of the Magistrate, for Capital Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
is called the <hi>Curse,</hi> Deut. 22. 23. <hi>He
that is hanged, is accursed of God,</hi> or is the
Curse of God.</p>
               <p>2. Christ who did not suffer Eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for Man's Sin, did yet <hi>suffer the
curse of the Law,</hi> in that he <hi>was hanged on a
Tree,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. It is true indeed, that by
that temporary suffering of his, he redeemed
us from Eternal punishment, which we were
obnoxious to.</p>
               <p>3. Those who Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atize from Christ, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55859:56"/>
reject his Gospel, merit <hi>sorer punishment</hi> than
what was inflicted on them that <hi>despised Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Law;</hi> and yet sorer punishment for kind
they cannot suffer, if Eternal punishment had
been the penalty of that Covenant as such, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>4. As the Promises of that Covenant when
particularly expressed, did appear to be but
temporal, so the curses of it appear to be no
other in the particular enumeration of them.
As for instance; a violent death inflicted by
the hand of the Magistrate, was the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
threatned for many Capital Offences;
Such as was Idolatry, Blasphemy, Witchcraft,
working on the Sabbath, invading the Priests
Office, and for being a false Prophet; &amp; also for
Murder, Adultery, Sodomy, Buggery, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stealing,
Cursing, or Smiting of Parents, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stubbornly rebllious against them, and
some other. And a cutting off from among
the people (whether by God's hand imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
or by Mans, I determine not) was
the penalty threatned for eating leavened
Bread within the time prohibited, for not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
ones self when unclean, for profaning
holy things, for ones eating of the Sacrifice
with his uncleanness upon him; for offering
Sacrifice any where but at the Tabernacle, for
eating of Blood, and for eating of the fat of
the Sacrifice; for neglecting to keep the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
and for not afflicting the Soul in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55859:56"/>
day of general Atonement; and for several
other Offences. And those Offences for
which cutting off from among the people, is
threatned, being less criminous than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
we have no reason to think the penalty
of cutting off from among the people, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
more (if so much) than the suffering
of a temporal death. As we may observe
how the <hi>Israelites</hi> various punishments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
for their manifold crimes in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
by <hi>God's overthrowing them in the
Wilderness</hi> by Pestilence, and otherwise.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>In brief; The temporal evils threatned in
this Covenant, were either Personal, Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,
or National. The Personal and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
evils, were no less, than whatsoever
tended to the infelicity of Man's life, as Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
in Body, Perplexity of Mind, unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in Body, in Cattel, in Ground; Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
Poverty, Oppression, loss of Relations,
fewness of days, and an untimely cutting off
from the Promised Land. The National
were wild Beasts, Pestilence, Sword, Famine,
Captivity, and such like. These were inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when the breach of the Covenant became
National in the generality of the people:
But especially when those who had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of publick Affairs, Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick,
did not restrain the people by a
due Execution of Laws, but rather led them
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55859:57"/>
into sin by their Example, and sometimes by
their Commands; corrupting Religion, and
perverting Justice, <hi>Levit. 26. Deut.</hi> 28. And
the evils threatned being National, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
it self was, they must needs be but
temporal, because there is no Judging, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning,
and Executing Nations as Nations,
but in this World.</p>
               <p>4. Come we now to shew reason why this
Covenant is called the <hi>first</hi> Covenant, since
there were others made before it; as that
with <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Salvation with <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall,
and with <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>1. Negatively; It is not so called, as if it
were the same for substance with that which
was first made with <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> as
many have thought, or because it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the same term. For,</p>
               <p>First, That Covenant was established upon
the terms or condition of perfect innocency; no
provision being made in it for pardon in case
of failure, upon any condition whatsoever. But
it was otherwise in this <hi>Mosaick</hi> Covenant, as
I have shewed, in that it contained seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Laws of Indemnity for the relief of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent
persons, upon certain possible and
practicable conditions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If this and the Paradisical-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
had been of the same Nature, then it and
the Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55859:57"/>
Seed, would have been inconsistent, the
one promising Eternal life upon believing, the
other only upon condition of sinless obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If this had been the case, the Law
would have been against the Promise, which
God forbid it should, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. and the one
would have excluded the other, according to
St. <hi>Pauls'</hi> reasoning, <hi>Rom. 11. 6. If by grace,
then it is no more of works; otherwise grace is

work.</hi> But</p>
               <p>2. Affirmatively. It is called the <hi>first</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
because it is the first of the two under
question and dispute between the Apostles and
unbelieving <hi>Iews.</hi> The Question and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
between them was, which of the
two Covenants, that by <hi>Moses,</hi> or that by
Christ, was finally adhered to as the way of
Salvation. In the handling of which Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
that by <hi>Moses</hi> is called the first, and
the Gospel-Covenant established by Christ, as
was Prophesied by <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> is called the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
Even as the one is called the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
not because it was the Oldest of all
Covenants, but because opposed to that which
was Prophesied of under the name of a New
Covenant. It is observable, that where we
meet with the first mention of the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
under that Denomination, it is not stiled
[<hi>the</hi>] first Covenant absolutely, but [<hi>that</hi>]
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55859:58"/>
first Covenant, as pointing at that under
dispute, <hi>Hebr. 8. 7. For if</hi> [<hi>that</hi>] <hi>first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
had been faultless, then should no place have
been sought for the second.</hi>

               <p>1. They held Circumcision in the flesh to

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55859:58"/>
of sinful affections and lusts, was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
intended, when God made Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the Condition of his Covenant. For they
were it seems grosly ignorant of the necessity
of Regeneration, and so of the Spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Circumcision; which was the reason
why <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though a Ruler among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> answered Christ so aukardly when he
Preached to him the necessity of being <hi>born
again,</hi> Joh. 3. An ignorance that some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
possibly might have been made for,
had not the Circumcision of the Heart, and
the making themselves a new Heart, been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
called for, as it was, <hi>Deut. 10. 16. Ier.
4. 4. Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. Now this ignorance of
theirs in the Doctrine of the Circumcision of
the Heart, and the sense they put upon God's
making Circumcision to be the Condition of
his Covenant of being their God, was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the reason why they placed so very much
as they did in Literal Circumcision. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Circumcision first given to <hi>Abraham</hi>
by way of Covenant, was afterwards incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
with the body of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, yet it
should seem these <hi>Iews</hi> considered it not so
much as it was a part of that Law, but chiefly
as a Condition of God's Covenant with them
in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they were his Seed. And
therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> where he reckons up his
Jewish Priviledges whil'st he was a <hi>Pharisee,</hi>
puts Circumision in the Head of them all, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55859:59"/>
as accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

distinct from his <hi>being blameless touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Righteousness which was in the Law,</hi>
Phil. 3. 5, 6. Whence also the Judaizers said,
<hi>it was needful to Circumcise them, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to keep the Law of Moses,</hi> Acts 15.
5, 24. as if Circumcising did import some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
different from, or at least something
more, than keeping of the Law did, though
otherwise it was a part of the Law. Upon this
account doubtless it was that we find them
more zealous for Circumcision, than for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Point of the Law besides.</p>
               <p>Against this Erroneous Opinion of theirs
touching Literal Circumcisions being the
Condition of the Spiritual Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>its of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> argueth several ways. First,
By maintaining that the Covenant did chiefly
respect Circumcision in the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.
28, 29. <hi>He is not a Iew which is one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
neither is that Circumcision, which is outward
in the flesh</hi> (that is, it was not that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
which would savingly avail them, as
they thought it would) <hi>but he is a Iew, which
is one inwardly; and Circumcision is that of the
Heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter;
whose praise is not of Men, but of God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By shewing that <hi>Abraham</hi> could not
have been justified before Circumcision, if
the great benefits of the Covenant (of which
Justification was one) were suspended upon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55859:59"/>
that, as a necessary condition. And yet that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
was justified when not Circumcised, there is the
express Authority of Scripture for. This he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.
Rom. 4. 9, 10. <hi>For we say that Faith was
reckoned to Abraham for Righteousness. How
was it then reckoned? when he was in
Circumcision, or in Vncircumcision?</hi> Not
<hi>in Circumcision, but in Vncircumcision.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards he proceeds to undeceive them
in the apprehension they had, that the benefits
of the Covenant were entailed upon <hi>Abraham's</hi>
Natural Seed as such; or at least as such, with
the addition of a literal observation of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
and the Law, without respect to
the Spiritual and new Birth: <hi>Rom. 9. 6, 7, 8.
They are not all Israel, which are of Israel</hi> (as
they thought they were) <hi>neither because they are
the Seed of Abraham, are they all Children: But
in Isaac shall thy Seed be called:</hi> That is, those
shall be called <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed, which are born
as <hi>Isaac</hi> was, by Faith in the Promise, which
are therefore called <hi>Children of the Promise.</hi>
For so the Apostle expounds it, saying, <hi>They
which are the Children of the flesh, these are not
the Children of God; but the Children of the
Promise are counted for the Seed;</hi> to wit, such
as are <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> as it is explained,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 28, 29. And this agrees to what he had
said before, <hi>Rom. 2. 28. He is not a Iew, which
is one outwardly,</hi> &amp;c. Against which corrupt
Opinion, <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> did oppose himself
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55859:60"/>
when he admonished the <hi>Pharisees, to bring
forth Fruit meet for Repentance, and think not
to say within your selves, we have Abraham to
our Father,</hi> Mat. 3. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>The Apostle labours to cure this grand Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
about Literal Circumcision as disjoyned
from Spiritual, in many other places, and
shews how that Circumcision <hi>availeth nothing,</hi>
but <hi>a new creature,</hi> such as Spiritual Cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
makes a man to be, <hi>Gal 6. 15. Not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
but Faith,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. <hi>Not Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but keeping the Commandments,</hi> is that
which would only reach those great ends
which they sought after in Literal Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. But I shall have occasion to
improve these Scriptures further upon another
Head of this Discourse. And by the way,
we may observe, that those who build their
hopes of future happiness upon their having
been Baptized, and their being of the Church,
without the inward Grace signified by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
which is the <hi>washing of Regeneration
and renewing of the Holy Ghost,</hi> they are
much a-kin to those miserable mistaken
<hi>Iews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They not understanding the Typical
and Spiritual use of the Legal Sacrifices, as
they did prefigure the death and suffering of
Christ, and the general Atonement which was
to be made thereby, nor yet the Predictions
of the Prophets touching his death, they ran
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55859:60"/>
into another gross Error, and that was, That
the promised <hi>Messias should not by suffering
death, become a Sacrifice for sin.</hi> And therefore
they said to him when he spoke to them of his
death; <hi>We have heard out of the Law, that
Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou the
Son of Man must be lift up?</hi> Joh. 12. 34. They
did not dream of his dying, but of his Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
visibly as a mighty Monarch among them,
and subduing all Nations under them, <hi>Because
they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
which are read every Sabbath day, they
have fulfilled them in condemning him,</hi> Acts 13.
27. Their ignorance in the meaning of the
Types and Predictions touching the death of
the <hi>Messias,</hi> would have been the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
<hi>if</hi> they had not wilfully and obstinately
persisted in that Error after those Types
and Prophecies were fulfilled and explained to
them. Ignorance in this matter was found
in Christ's own Disciples a great while; but
their slowness to believe those Types and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
after they were fulfilled, was a thing
which our Saviour rebuked them for, saying,
<hi>O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the
Prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ to have
suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</hi>
Luke 24. 25, 26. But the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi>
were tenacious of this Opinion, after they had
sufficient means to have been convinc'd of their
Error in it. In opposition to which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55859:61"/>
the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
argues at large the necessity of Christ's
suffering by death. As first, he argues it
from his Priesthood. For having proved
him according to Prophecy, to be a Priest not
after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi>
and so a Priest of greater Dignity, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.
and 7. He infers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. that as a Priest he
must have something to offer in Sacrifice,
and that of greater value than what was
offered by Priests under the Law, that were
but of an inferiour Order; and that he shews
to have been himself and his own Blood, as the
Antitype of all those Legal Sacrifices, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.
Secondly, He proves his death necessary for
the confirmation of the second and new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
as he was Mediatour of it. As <hi>the
first Testament was not dedicated without Blood,</hi>
so neither is the second: <hi>For where a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is</hi> (saith he) <hi>there of necessity must also
be the death of the Testator,</hi> Chap. 9. 15,—23.
Thirdly, His death was necessary for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of Remission of Sins; a Benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in the new Covenant: <hi>For without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Blood</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is no Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sin,</hi> Chap. 9. 22. with Chap. 10.
5—18.</p>
               <p>And indeed it was a good part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
work to beat down this Opinion, that
the <hi>Messias</hi> was not to dye. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 3. St. <hi>Paul,
as his manner was, went into them, and three
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55859:61"/>
Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the
Scriptures, opening and alledging that Christ
must needs have suffered and risen again from
the dead.</hi> Yea, this Opinion had so generally
obtained among them in our Saviours time,
that it seems the Apostles of Christ at first
were not free from it. For when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
told them, that at <hi>Ierusalem he should be
delivered to the Gentiles, and that they should
scourge him, and put him to death, and that the
third day he should rise again;</hi> it's said, <hi>they
understood none of these things, and that this
saying was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id from them, neither knew they
the things which were spoken:</hi> Though they
were spoken plainly and in no Parable, <hi>Luke</hi>
18. 32, 33, 34. Christ his being crucified,
<hi>became a stumbling-block to the Iews</hi> through
this Error of theirs, and that which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon as a Reason why they would not
receive him as the Christ of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 23.</p>
               <p>3. They held another Error which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
was Mother or Daughter of the former,
and that was, That the Legal Sacrifices did
expiate and take away Sin, not only so as to
free them from Legal penalties, and temporal
punishments, as in many Cases they did, but
so also as to free them from all Obligation to
Eternal punishment. And so they did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to those Sacrifices, the same atoning vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and purging efficacy, as is proper only to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55859:62"/>
the Blood of Christ. In opposition to this
Opinion, it is maintain'd,</p>
               <p>1. That those Legal Sacrifices, were but
Figures of the great Sacrifice, Christ Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi>
9. 10, 11, 12. and 10. 1.</p>
               <p>2. It was argued, that it was <hi>impossible that
the blood of Bulls and of Goats should take away
Sin,</hi> because these were offered year after year,
over and over in the day of general Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the same sins. And that if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sacrifices which were first offered, had
taken away sin, the latter could not have been
necessary to the same purpose, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2,
3, 11. The often repetition of Sacrifices
for the same sins, argues that the Worshippers
had a secret sense in their Conscience, that
those Sacrifices were not of a competent value,
nor a sufficient price to redeem their Souls
from Sin, as it exposeth to Eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
however they might <hi>sanctifie as to the
purifying of the flesh,</hi> yet they could not <hi>make
any perfect as pertaining to the Conscience;</hi> Heb.
9. 9. &amp; 10. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>3. It was argued from a Prophetical passage
in <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. in which Christ is brought in
speaking thus; <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou
would' st not, but a Body hast thou prepared me:
In burnt Offerings and Sacrifice for sin thou hast
had no pleasure: Then said I, Lo, I come to do
thy will, O God.</hi> From whence he infers, that
the first sort of Sacrifices <hi>were taken away</hi> as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55859:62"/>
insufficient, <hi>that the second might be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
By the which will,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
through the offering of the Body of Iesus
once for all,</hi> Heb. 10. 5.—10.</p>
               <p>This Opinion of theirs, that Legal Sacrifices
did expiate all their Sins, did keep up in them a
hope of impunity here and hereafter, under
many immoralities and great transgressions in
the course of their lives. Though they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
transgression, yet if they multiplyed
Sacrifices too, they thought they should escape
well enough. <hi>Amos 4. 4, 5. Come to Bethel and
transgress, at Gilgal multiply transgression,
and bring your Sacrifice every morning, and your
Tythes after three years, and offer a sacrifice of
thanksgiving with Leaven, and proclaim and
publish your free-Offerings, for this liketh you, O
Children of Israel, saith the Lord God.</hi> And
much after this rate do carnal Christians bear
up themselves in hopes that all their sins are
done away by the Sacrifice of Christ the Lamb
of God that taketh away the Sins of the
World, though they live from day to day in
ungodliness. Only indeed they sin at a cheaper
rate for the present than the wicked <hi>Iews</hi> did.
The <hi>Iewish</hi> sinners were at the cost of many
a Sacrifice to stop the mouth of Conscience; but
these are at cost only in <hi>making provision for
the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon Christ to pay all their scores.</p>
               <p>4. Another of their Errors as consequent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55859:63"/>
upon the former was this; That without
Circumcision and observing of the Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could not be saved. This
Opinion the Judaizing Christians retained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Conversion to the Christian Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<hi>Acts 15. 1, 5, 24. Certain men which came
down from Iudea taught the brethren, saying,
Except ye be Circumcised after the manner of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
ye cannot be saved. There rose up certain
of the Sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying,
that it was needful to Circumcise them, and
to command them to keep the Law of Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In opposition to which Opinion, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
taught that the <hi>Righteousness of God by Faith
without the Law is manifested unto all, and upon
all that believe, whether Iews or Gentiles, and
that there is no difference,</hi> Rom. 3. 21, 22. And
that a Man <hi>is justified by Faith without the deeds
of the Law,</hi> though never Circumcised: And
that <hi>God is the God of the Gentiles,</hi> as well <hi>as of
the Iews,</hi> and that <hi>he doth justifie the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
and the circumcision;</hi> those that had
observed the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and those that
had not, upon the same terms, <hi>viz.</hi> of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28, 29, 30. Whereunto
agrees the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 15. 9, 11. <hi>He
put no difference between us and them, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their hearts by Faith; i. e.</hi> us <hi>Iews,</hi> and
they <hi>Gentiles: But we believe that through the
Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, we shall be saved
even as they,</hi> and upon no other terms, though
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55859:63"/>
we have observed the Law, and they have not,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15, 16. Upon the same account St. <hi>Paul</hi>
again affirms, <hi>Rom. 4. 5. That to him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness.</hi>
That is, the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles</hi> that never had
observed the Law, but lived <hi>without God in
the World;</hi> should yet have their practical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Gospel imputed even to them for
Righteousness. And he further exemplifies
this in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Ver. 9, 10, 11, 12. whose
Faith was reckoned to him for Righteousness
before he was Circumcised, that he might be
the Patern and great Example of Gods justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Heathen upon their believing and
obeying as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, in leaving his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and his Countrey upon God's Promise and
Command, though he never had been Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised.
And upon the like account he
saith again, <hi>Gal. 3. 8, 9. That the Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
that God would justifie the Heathen through
Faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
saying, In thee shall all Nations be blessed.</hi>
And from thence he concludes that those <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
that <hi>be of Faith,</hi> that believe as <hi>Abraham</hi>
did, <hi>are blessed as Abraham was, are blessed with
faithful Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Another Error which was held by some
Judaizing Christians was this; That Faith in
Christ and Literal Circumcision, with a Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
observation of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> joyntly,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55859:64"/>
were the Condition of Justification. Though
they were such as believed, yet they
taught that except men were Circumcised and
kept the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> they could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1, 5. They seem to have retained
the same false Opinion of Justification by the
Law, as the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> did, but held
the Death of Christ necessary to be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added.</p>
               <p>To convince them of which Error, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
sets before them the bad consequence of it in
two respects. 1. In that they hereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the death of Christ needless in it self.
<hi>Gal. 2. 21. If righteousness come by the Law,
than Christ is dead in vain:</hi> There would then
have been no need of Christ's death to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
it, as the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> indeed did
hold. 2. In that this Opinion of their's
made Christ and his death useless unto them,
and cut them off from receiving any benefit
by him, <hi>Gal. 5. 2, 4. Behold, I Paul say unto
you, that if you be Circumcised, Christ shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
you nothing: Christ is become of none effect
unto you: whosoever of you are justified by the
Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> And hereto
agrees that in <hi>Hebr. 13. 10. We have an Altar
whereof they have no right to eat which serve
the Tabernacle:</hi> Those Judaizers who stand
for the necessity of Mosaic Observations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have
no right to, nor shall receive benefit by Christ,
who is the only Christian Altar to which we
bring all our Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55859:64"/>
6. They held the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable,
and of perpetual obligation. In op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to which, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
improves to great purpose that Prophesie, <hi>Ier.
31. 31, 32. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
that I will make a new Covenant with the house
of Israel, and the house of Iudah: Not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Covenant that I made with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the day when I took them by the hand to
lead them out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For in
that he saith, a new Covenant, he hath</hi> (saith
he) <hi>made the first old. Now that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth
and waxeth old, is ready</hi> (saith he) <hi>to
vanish away.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> shews how that
the Legal Ministration how glorious soever it
was, was yet done away, when that which
was far more glorious did appear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
7, 11. And again, <hi>that we are become dead to
the Law by the Body of Christ, and delivered
from the Law,</hi> Rom. 7. 4, 6.</p>
               <p>7. The last of their Errors I shall insist on,
was this: They held the first Covenant as alone,
or separated to be the Covenant of Salvation,
only taking in with it the Covenant of Literal
Circumcision, which also was made a
part of their Law. That first Covenant
which I have already described as a temporal
Covenant, and the Promises and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of it but temporal, they took to be
established for perpetuity, and the Promises
of it to contain Promises of Eternal
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55859:65"/>
Redemption, or Remission, as well as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and Eternal Life and Felicity as well as
Temporal: And such a Literal observation of
the Laws of it to be the Condition of those
Promises, as would render them inculpable in
the eye of the Magistracy; such a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sufficient to justifie them before God, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith he had while he was a <hi>Pharisee,</hi>
Phil. 3. 6. <hi>As touching the Righteousness
which is in the Law blameless;</hi> which then he
accounted to be his gain.</p>
               <p>Now that they did peremptorily adhere to
this first Covenant, and the terms of it, for
Justification and Eternal Life, it doth plainly
appear by the mighty opposition which the
Apostles made against them in it. For they
did still oppose another Covenant as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Justification, and Eternal Life unto
this Mosaical Covenant; and Faith, as the
Condition of that, in opposition to Works as
the condition of this, as will appear if we come
to Instances.</p>
               <p>1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues it with them, that
the Promise of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed,
<hi>was not through the Law, but through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 13. Not through
the Law, that is, not upon the terms upon
which the benefits of the first Covenant were
promised to the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but upon
quite other terms, exprest by the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:55859:65"/>
2. He argues it farther with them; That
God's way of accounting men righteous by
Faith, and their way of seeking Righteousness
npon the terms of the first Covenant, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
inconsistent, &amp; the one destructive of the
other, and that but one of these ways could
possibly stand. <hi>For if they which are of the
Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made of none effect,</hi> Rom. 4. 14. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>If the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no
more of Promise: But God gave it to Abraham
by Promise,</hi> Gal. 3. 18. <hi>And if by Grace, then
it is no more of Works, otherwise Grace is no more
Grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p>3. And that the Law did not exclude the
Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he farther argues, in
that the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and unalterably setled and established
in the <hi>Messias</hi> 430 years before the Law by
<hi>Moses</hi> was given, and that therefore for them
to go about to introduce the Law in the room
of the Promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> so confirmed, would
be as unreasonable and unjust, as for one man
to alter or make void anothers Covenant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he hath confirmed it. <hi>Gal. 3. 15, 17. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I speak after the manner of men: though it
be but a Mans Covenant, yet if it be confirmed,
no Man disanulleth or addeth thereto. And this
I say, that the Covenant that was confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of God in Christ, the Law which was 430 years
after, cannot disanul, that it should make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of none effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55859:66"/>
4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues it impossible in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing that they should be justified
by the Law, because one main end of God's
promulging the Law of Nature (which yet
was a great part of the first Covenant) was
to convince men of their guilt, and of their
obnoxiousness to wrath, and to stop their
Mouthes, and to leave them without any plea
of defence as from it, <hi>Rom. 3. 19, 20. Now we
know that what things soever the Law saith, it
saith to them who are under the Law: That
every mouth may be stopt, and all the world may
become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds
of the Law, there shall no flesh be jnstified in his
sight: for by the Law is the knowledge of sin.</hi> And
if the Law doth convict men, it cannot justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
them: For the same Law cannot both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
and justifie the same person in reference
to the same charge. If all are cast and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Original Law, as they are
(<hi>for he hath concluded all under sin, that he
might have mercy upon all,</hi> Gal. 3.) then so
many as come to be justified after this, must
needs be justified by another Law superceding
that, and that is none other than the Law of
Grace. The Law of Nature curseth every
one that hath broken it, though but once,
and therefore it cannot justifie them too: <hi>Out
of the same mouth</hi> (in this case) <hi>doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
blessing and cursing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:55859:66"/>
5. He argues this Opinion of theirs to be
contrary to the Doctrine of the Prophets ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred years after, as well as contrary to
the Promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> long before the Law.
<hi>That no man is justified by the Law in the sight
of God, it is evident; for the Iust shall live
by Faith: and the Law is not of Faith; but,
the man that doth them, shall live in them,</hi> Gal.
3. 11, 12. from <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. The Law is not
of Faith, that is, it doth not promise pardon,
or any other blessing upon believing, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition of doing the things therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:
<hi>the man that doth them, shall live in
them,</hi> Levit. 18. 5.</p>
               <p>6. The insufficiency of the first Covenant to
make men eternally happy, and the necessity &amp;
validity of the second to that end, is further
argued in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. from another famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
in <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 31, &amp;c. of God's making a
new Covenant with <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> in the
latter days, not according to that he made
with their Fathers when he brought them out
of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 1. It's argued that that first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was but temporary, and <hi>being old, was
ready to vanish,</hi> and to give place to a New
and Everlasting Covenant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 13. 2. That
<hi>the first Covenant was faulty,</hi> or defective, or
else there would have been <hi>no place sought for a
second,</hi> ver. 7. 3. That the Promises of that
first Covenant were not of such things as men
stand in need of to make them everlastingly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55859:67"/>
happy, as those better Promises of the second
Covenant are, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 4. And yet more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
that in this New Covenant there is
promise of such a forgiveness of sins, as that
<hi>iniquity shall be remembred no more,</hi> ver. 12.
whereas the first Covenant did not promise
any such pardons: All that it promised, was
a forgiveness only as to the concerns of this
life, otherwise their sins were still kept upon
the File to be taken away (if ever taken away)
by the <hi>Mediatour of the New Testament, by means
of his death, for the redemption of the transgressions
that were under the first Testament,</hi> Chap. 9. 15.
But in those Sacrifices (which were but the
Sacrifices of the first Covenant) <hi>there was a
remembrance again made of sins every year,</hi>
Heb. 10. 3.</p>
               <p>And now by all these reasonings of the
Apostle put together, it sufficiently appears
that the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> did expect Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Eternal Life, only upon the terms
of the first Covenant, and that they held that
Covenant, as comprehending the Covenant
of Circumcision, to be the Covenant of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life. And indeed this last mentioned
Error of theirs, in holding the first Covenant
to be the Covenant of Salvation, did in a
manner contain in it all the rest mentioned
before, which did naturally grow out of it.
For if that had been the Covenant of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then it would have followed that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55859:67"/>
of that Covenant had been sufficient,
and the death of Christ needless; and that
Circumcision and keeping the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
would have been necessary to the salvation
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now after all this, considering what
Erroneous Opinions the incredulous <hi>Iews</hi>
held about the Law, and about Circumcision,
and considering in what sense they asserted
Justification by the Law, and by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it will be no difficult thing to understand
exactly in what sense the Apostle doth every
where deny Justification to be by the Law,
or by the works of the Law.</p>
               <p>For doubtless St. <hi>Paul's</hi> denial of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Salvation to be by the Law, or works
of the Law, is to be understood in the very
same sense in which the incredulous <hi>Iews,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom he disputed, did hold these to be
attainable thereby. For else his reasonings
would have been beside the question under
debate between them. And therefore we
must take our measure of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> sense in
the Negative part of the Question, by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
sense of it in the Affirmative. And
if so, then in his denying Justification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to be by the Law, or by works of the
Law, we must understand him to deny a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the Eternal Punishment to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
by Legal Sacrifices: And also to
deny that the Promise of Eternal Life was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55859:68"/>
made upon condition of Literal Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a Literal Observation of the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Law, without being by Faith renewed in
the inward frame &amp; Moral constitution of
the Soul: And likewise to deny Eternal Life
to be attainable by the terms of their Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Covenant, the Promises whereof were not
made upon condition of believing, but of doing.
<hi>The Law is not of Faith, but the man that doth
those things, shall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. For
these and such like were the Opinions which
those J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws did hold (as I have shewed) and
these were the things in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them. They divided and separated Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumision
and the Law in the letter of them,
from the Spirit of them both; claiming Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by the Letter alone. And they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Law from the Promise rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and looked to be justified by Works
of the Law, without Faith in the Promise
rightly understood. They looked for the
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssias</hi> indeed, but not to become a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Sin, or to establish a New Covenant
of Salvation, but to further their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Eternal Felicity in the way of
their Obedience to the Political Law.</p>
               <p>But then it doth not in the least appear that
St. <hi>Paul</hi> in denying Justification to be by the
Law in the sense thus explained, doth also
thereby deny works of sincere Obedience
to God, to concur with Faith in Man's
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55859:68"/>
Justification in all respects.</p>
               <p>And if any shall yet suppose that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in denying Justification by Works in the Jews
corrupt sense, doth also, on the by, deny all
Works of Evangelical Obedience to bear any
part of the Condition on which God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to justifie Men through Christ; such a
Supposition, if admitted, would make his
Doctrine herein, inconsistent not only with
the Faith of the holy Men of Old, who were
wont to express the Condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Merey, by loving God, and keeping
his Commandments; but it would also make
him inconsistent with himself and his own
Doctrine, and the Doctrine of other Apostles,
as I doubt not, but plainly to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before I have done with this Discourse.</p>
               <p>There is one Character of Works given, by
which you may certainly know what Works
they were which St. <hi>Paul</hi> denyed Men were
justified by; and they were such Works which
were apt to occasion boasting, <hi>Ephes. 2. 9. Not
of Works, lest any man should boast.</hi> Rom. 4. 2.
<hi>For if Abraham were justified by Works</hi> (to
wit, in the Jews sense, by Circumcision in the
flesh, to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) <hi>he
hath whereof to glory, but not before God,</hi> but
only before Men who were not Circumcised
as he was. For the unbelieving Jews who
sought and expected Justification by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
and other Legal Observations, did glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55859:69"/>
over the poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were destitute
of those Works which consisted in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Priviledges which the Jews had; and
looked down upon them with contempt,
though some of them were much better than
themselves, such as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whom they
looked upon as unclean. This boasting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of the <hi>Iews</hi> over the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
and reproved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to 29.
Now the Doctrine of Justification by Faith;
of obtaining pardon by anothers undertaking
for us, to wit, Christ Jesus, and of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
with God through him, upon our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
though otherwise imperfect obedience,
(which sincere Obedience too, is not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without his special Grace and assistance)
takes away all occasion of boasting, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
both to God and Men, and laid the
<hi>Iews</hi> as low as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and made St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
a Jew to say: <hi>But we believe that through
the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ we shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
even as they,</hi> Acts 15. 11. And therefore
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had said, that <hi>now the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God without the Law is manifested, even
the righteousness of God which is by Faith of
Iesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
for there is no difference;</hi> meaning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 3. 21, 22. he
thereupon demands, in <hi>ver.</hi> 27. saying, <hi>where
is boasting then?</hi> It excluded. By what Law?
<hi>Of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi>
Therefore we find the holy Men of Old among
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55859:69"/>
the <hi>Iews,</hi> who expected acceptance with God
upon other terms than the Pharisaical <hi>Iews</hi>
did, who placed their confidence (called
<hi>trusting in the flesh,</hi> Phil. 3. 4.) in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Priviledges and Performances alone;
were so far from glorying in such a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
as that, that they cryed out in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to that; <hi>all our righteousnesses are as
filthy rags,</hi> Isa. 64. 6. Thus Regenerating
Grace made <hi>David</hi> so far from boasting either
of Priviledges, or of his Performances, that
he saith unto God, <hi>Who am I, and what is my
people, that we should be able to offer so willingly
after this sort? for all things come of thee, and
of thine own have we given thee,</hi> 1 Chro. 29. 14.
This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> to say, <hi>We are not sufficient
of our selves, as of our selves to think any thing,
but our sufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 cor. 3. 5. And
<hi>by the grace of God, I am what I am,</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 10. And <hi>of him are we in Christ Iesus,
who of God is made unto us, Wisdom, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Sanctification, and Redemption, that
he that glorieth, may glory in the Lord,</hi>
having nothing but what he hath received
from him <hi>gratis,</hi> and without all desert, yea
contrary to his demerits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30, 31. The
<hi>good Works</hi> which the Saints do, they do them
by vertue of their being <hi>created in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
in order thereunto, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. and all
that good is, <hi>is through Christ strengthening
them,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. From whence therefore we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55859:70"/>
may well conclude, that if the works which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> wholly excludes in the matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
were only such as were apt to
occasion boasting, that then Acts of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Obedience were none of those Works.</p>
               <p>According to the sense explained then, I
presume we may well understand that Text,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. which of all others seems in the
Phrase and Expression to be most Exclusive
of Works in the point of Justification; the
words are these, <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a
man is justified by Faith without the deeds of the
Law.</hi> Which words (if you consider the
context) seem to import no more but this, <hi>viz.</hi>
That a Man is justified in the Gospel-way,
which in the verse before is called <hi>the Law of
Faith:</hi> And not by the deeds of the Law, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the terms of the first Covenant, which in the
verse before, likewise is called <hi>the Law of
Works.</hi> Which two, the Gospel terms, &amp; the first
Covenant terms, are still opposed to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the point of Justification. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Conclusion here laid down is true,
in reference to the <hi>Iews</hi> as well as to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
yet it seems to be written here with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
reference to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Intimating
that upon their belief, they might be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without turning Proselytes to the Jewish
way, as appears by that Interrogation in the
very next words following, <hi>ver. 29. 30. Is he
the God of the Iews only? is he not also of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55859:70"/>
Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also: Seeing it
is one God which shall justifie the Circumcision
by Faith, and Vncircumcision through Faith.</hi>
And the words in the 31, <hi>ver.</hi> do intimate
that the words in the 28th <hi>vers.</hi> are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in such a limited sense as I have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
in my Explication, <hi>viz.</hi> as excluding
the deeds of the Law in the act of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
only in the <hi>Iews</hi> corrupt sense of the
Law: because St. <hi>Paul</hi> therein affirms his
foresaid Doctrine of Justification by Faith
without the deeds of the Law, not to be at
all destructive of the Law, but contrariwise
tending to <hi>establish the Law,</hi> if we take the
Law not in that distorted sense in which those
<hi>Iews</hi> held it, but as it was appointed by God
to promote holiness in the World, which is
the end and scope of all his Laws. In which
sense the Apostle was so far from excluding
the works of the Law from having any thing
to do in the Justification of Men, as that he
had expresly affirmed before, That though the
<hi>hearers of the Law were not just before God, yet
the doers of the Law should be justified,</hi> Rom.
2. 13. Meaning by doers, such as do sincerely
obey that Law of God under which they are,
and not such as do perfectly fulfil it, as some
would seem to understand it. For I have
shewed before, that God never made Promise
of Justification upon naturally impossible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as that would be, and they are disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
thoughts of God to think he hath;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55859:71"/>
and therefore the Apostle may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to promise Justification to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Law upon any such terms.</p>
               <p>There is one vein of Texts mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> wherein the
Opposition is made in such a form of words
between the <hi>Iews</hi> way of seeking Justification
by the Law, and the Gospel-way of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it by Faith: that being a little opened, will
both illustrate and confirm what I have been
representing to you: And they are such in
which the <hi>Iews</hi> erroneous way is called <hi>their
own Righteousness,</hi> and the true Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of Justification, <hi>the Righteousness of God
by Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> Rom.
10. 3. <hi>For they being ignorant of God s Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss,
and going about to establish their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
have not submitted themselves to the
Righteousness of God,</hi> Phil. 3. 9. <hi>And be found
in him, not having mine own Righteousness,
which is of the Law, but that which is through
the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is
of God by Faith.</hi> This Righteousness is called
their own Righteousness in opposition to the
Righteousness of God, upon a three-fold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
as I understand it.</p>
               <p>1. Because they sought the pardon of their
sins by that only which was their own; their
own Sacrifices, Sacrifices which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
brought to be offered. Whereas the
Christian Justification is called the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, because the Sacrifice by which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55859:71"/>
pardon of sin, and acceptation with God is
obtained, was from God, and given by God,
to wit, Christ Jesus, <hi>whom God hath set forth
to be a propitiation,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. and Christ <hi>hath
given himself an offering and a Sacrifice
for us,</hi> Ephes. 5. 2. <hi>And he is made unto us of
God, Wisdom, Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor.
1. 30.</p>
               <p>2. It was called their own Righteousness,
because they did not think Regeneration, or
Supernatural Grace necessary to the obtaining
of it, but a Literal observation of the Law
and Circumcision, such as passed for a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
among Men, and such as they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

As for those Precepts which commanded the
loving of God with all the heart, and the
circumcising the heart; because these were
not enjoyned under express penalties, as
those things were of which the Rulers
were to take cognizance, therefore the <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is by Faith, may be said to be
of God, because <hi>by Grace they are saved through

               <p>3. It was called their own Righteousness,
because it was a way of seeking to be justified
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55859:72"/>
of their own devising, and not of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing.
And on the contrary the Gospel-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Justification is called the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God through Faith, because it is of
God's Institution and appointment: It is the

               <p>The result of all then is, That they were
the Works of the Law, as exclusive of Faith in

effects of Faith in Christ, in his Death, and

               <head type="sub">How St. Paul's Doctrine of Iustification
by Faith, and not by Works, was
then mistaken by some.</head>
               <p>I Come in the next place to shew how that St.
<hi>Paul's</hi> reasonings about Faith and Works,
in reference to Justification, were probably mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
by such Solifidians as St. <hi>Iames</hi> reasoned
against. For he having taught that God
did justifie the ungodly <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
and without the deeds of the Law, but
denying Justification to as many of the <hi>Iews</hi> as
did not believe, though they were Observers
of the Law; there were some who thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
through mistake, laid the whole stress of
Salvation upon believing, to the neglect of a
holy and virtuous life. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> being
sensible how apt some were to make a bad
use of his good Doctrine, and to draw bad
Conclusions out of good Premises, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mentions such Inferences, on purpose
to caution Men against them. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
He having said in <hi>Rom. 5. 20. That
where sin abounded, grace did abound much more:</hi>
In Chap. 6. 1. he saith, <hi>What shall we say
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55859:73"/>
then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may
abound?</hi> as some it seems were ready to infer;
<hi>God forbid,</hi> saith he; <hi>how shall we that are dead
to sin, live any longer therein?</hi> You may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
to like purpose in general, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 31.
&amp; 6. 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 17. and find that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and
others were <hi>slanderously reported to have said,
let us do evil that good may come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there were such as did misrepresent
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Doctrince touching God's grace and
long-suffering, and wrest several passages in his
Epistles, and other Scriptures, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
we are told by St. <hi>Peter</hi> also, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15.
16. <hi>And account that the long-suffering of the Lord
is Salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul
also, according to the Wisdom given him, hath
written unto you; as also in all his Epistles,
speaking in them of these things: In which are
some things hard to be understood, which they
that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they
do also the other Scriptures to their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4, 5,
verses, had by many black Characters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
a sort of Christians that had <hi>a form of
godliness, but denyed the power thereof:</hi> In ver.
8. he further describes them by that which
was the cause of the forementioned unsavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fruits of the flesh, to wit, that they <hi>were men
of corrupt minds or understandings, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
concerning the Faith,</hi> or void of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55859:73"/>
concerning the Faith, as the Margin
hath it. They were Men of corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and injudicious concerning the Doctrine
of faith: They did not discern faith to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in the operative and practical nature of
it: But as they did satisfie themselves with a
form of godliness without the power; so
they did likewise with a formal inefficacious
and liveless Faith, which made them so unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
in their lives.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> after he had in his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
antidoted the Christians against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who held a bad life
consistent with Communion with God
through illumination of mind, and the
Christian Faith, deceiving themselves, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to deceive others, in thinking they
might be righteous without doing Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 7. He, towards the conclusion of
that Epistle, sums up his general scope in it in
these words: <hi>These things have I written unto
you that believe in the Name of the Son of God;
that ye may know that ye have Eternal Life,
and that ye may believe on the Name of the Son
of God,</hi> Chap. 5. 13. His meaning is, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that he wrote this Epistle, first, to the
end they might be the better assured of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ upon their rightly believing on
him. And secondly, To the end they might
not be drawn into mistakes in the point of
believing, as if any Faith less than such as is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55859:74"/>
accompanied with a constant adherence to
Christ's Doctrine and example touching a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, would give them that assurance. He
wrote to them that did believe, that they
might believe; that is, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
yet more understandingly, more ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and so perseveringly against all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Apostacy from the Profession of the
Faith, or to loosness in the Profession
of it.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Iude</hi> also, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. stirred up the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to <hi>contend earnestly for the Faith,</hi> the
Doctrine of saving Sinners in the way of
Believing; because, as he told them, there were
certain Men professing Faith, but of ungodly
lives, that were amongst them, <hi>that turned
the grace of God into lasciviousness;</hi> so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Law of Grace, the Gospel, as
if it had been a Proclamation from Heaven of
a general pardon for Christ's sake, and through
Faith in him, of as many sins as Men had a
mind to commit. The which Error led them
into those Monstrous Impieties charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in that Epistle: By reason of which,
<hi>the way of Truth,</hi> the right Faith they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, <hi>was evil-spoken of</hi> in the World
(as St. <hi>Peter</hi> notes) they being indeed <hi>Spots
and Blemishes</hi> to the Christians and Christian-Profession,
so long as they were admitted to
their Feasts of Charity, as owned by them to
be of their number. This was indeed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55859:74"/>
an ungodly Faith: But the Faith which he
exhorted them to contend for, and to <hi>build
up themselves upon,</hi> as on a sure Foundation,
he calls <hi>their most holy Faith,</hi> vers. 20. such a
Faith as is an Operative Principle of a holy
life.</p>
               <p>And they were such Christians as St. <hi>Iames</hi>
in his Epistle did expostulate with, that did
lean so much upon a meer believing, upon a
meer assent of the mind unto the truth of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Propositions, as that they were careless
in the subduing of their Passions, and bridling
their Tongues, and regulating their Actions;
as if these had not been necessary to Salvation:
But thought themselves safe upon account of
their barren Faith, though they were proud
and conceited of their knowledge and Atain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
censorious and contentious, unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and uncharitable. In a word, they were
such as were injudicious concerning the
Faith that will save, and under mistakes of
the Apostles Doctrine about it. All this will
easily appear to any that shall but with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
measure of understanding, view and
consider the Scope and Contents of that
Epistle.</p>
               <p>And thus you see how plainly it appears by
the Epistles of the Apostles, that the Doctrine
of Justification by Faith without Works, in
the sence in which the Apostles asserted it, was
misunderstood by many <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> carnal Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55859:75"/>
or <hi>Solifidians.</hi> The sense in which
the Apostles did assert it, was, that Faith justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
without Works Antecedent to believing,
and without Works as the Works of a literal
observation of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, which was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the <hi>Iews</hi> to Faith, as having Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
for its Object, and Repentance, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and sincere Obedience in a holy Life,
for its inseparable Effects. But these deceived
Souls that <hi>deceived their own Hearts,</hi> seem to
have understood the Apostles, as if they had
taught Justification by Faith, considered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as having the Death of Christ, and the
Atonement made thereby, for its Object,
without respect to Regeneration and new
Obedience, as any part of the Condition.</p>
               <p>And it had been much better for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World, if those corrupt Notions about
the Doctrine of Faith as justifying, had dyed
with those Men, which in the first Ages of
the Christian-Church were infected with
them. But alas, it is too apparent, that the
same, or much of the same dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
mistakes, have been transmitted to,
or revived in these latter Ages of the Church.
For we find by experience in this present Age,
that very many of those who are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
presume themselves to be Christians
indeed, and such as shall be saved by Christ,
though their lives declare them to be far from
being <hi>new Creatures,</hi> from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eing <hi>renewed in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55859:75"/>
the Spirit of their Minds, Wills, Affections, and
Conversations,</hi> as those are that <hi>have been
taught as the Truth is in Iesus,</hi> Ephes. 4. 21,—24.
For they are confident they believe
all the Articles of their Creed, and in doing
so, they are confident they shall be saved; and
so they would, if that belief of theirs were but
so effectual and operative as to produce such a
change in Heart and Life, as would denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
them new Creatures. But the mischief
is, they deceive themselves in the nature of
their Faith; it being but an Opinionative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operative
and dead assent to the truth of the
Gospel, such as is only an act of the mind or
understanding, and doth not powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
the Will, and so it is not <hi>a believing
with all the Heart,</hi> but is the act only of one
faculty of the Soul. A Belief its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
may be found in the Devil himself: And
such a Belief was found in some who were so
convinced by the power of Christ's Miracles
in concurrence with his Doctrine and Life,
that they could not choose but believe him to
be an extraordinary Person sent from God;
though their carnal interest prevailed so much
in them, as that it would not suffer them <hi>to
confess him openly, because they loved the praise
of Men, more than the praise of God,</hi> Joh. 12.
42, 43. And besides, these Men deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about their Faith in this also; that they
do not heartily believe the whole Doctrine of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55859:76"/>
the Gospel, but are partial in their Faith.
They in a sort believe Christ to be the Son of
God, and that he came into the World to save
sinners, and that he dyed for our sins, and
the like. But then they do not heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his Doctrine touching the necessity of
Repentance, of being born again; of <hi>denying
all ungodliness and worldly lusts, &amp; of living righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,
godly, and soberly in this present world.</hi>
Or else they frame such Notions of these
things unto themselves, of Repentance and
Regeneration, as that they think they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Christ's Doctrine touching them, when
they believe only the lying imagination of
their own brains.</p>
               <p>And there is too much ground to fear, that
many Mens ill managing the Doctrine of
Justification by Faith, hath not a little
strengthened Men in this vain confidence.
For while Evangelical Obedience it self, under
the Notion of those Works to which Faith is
opposed, hath been decryed as Popish when
interessed in Justification, and Justification
asserted to be by Faith alone in opposition to
all works whatsoever, inward and outward,
as well Evangelical as Legal, as well those
after Conversion as those before, yea, and the
disposition thereunto; the Flesh and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to help it, hath got great advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to perswade men against the necessity of a
holy Life, in such a sense of a holy Life, as
the Scripture makes absolutely necessary to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55859:76"/>
Salvation. For though its true that good
Works have been acknowledged and pressed
too as necessary to Salvation; yet when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
they have been denyed to be necessary to
Justification, and Men have been taught that
when once they are Justified, they can never fall
away from a state of Justification, they have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
been drawn to believe that good Works
are not absolutely necessary to Salvation no
more than to Justification, but Faith only.
And upon supposition that the other 2 Points
of Doctrine are true, it would be but rational
for them so to believe. For if good Works be
not necessary to Justification at all: And if it
is impossible but that those who are once justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
should be saved; how should Men chuse
but infer from hence, that good Works are
not absolutely necessary to Salvation? unless
it shall be said that Men are not put into
an immediate capacity of Salvation by being
justified: Which to affirm would be to say
Men are not freed from Condemnation,
by being freed from Condemnation, which
would be a contradiction in terms: For to be
justified, is to be freed from condemnation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. &amp; 5. 16, 18. and therefore
Justification must needs put Men into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
capacity of being saved.</p>
               <p>And as there is great reason to think that
the Doctrine of Justification by Faith alone in
opposition to the works of Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
hath been a stumbling-stone unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55859:77"/>
and a back-friend to the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
so there is another which hath been
wont to be joyned with it, that hath rendred
it the more dangerous, and it self no good
friend to holy living; and that is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the imputation of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto Justification, in that way in which
it hath been managed by very many: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
there is a sense (as I have shewed)
in which it is a great and a comfortable truth.
For when Men have been taught to esteem
their <hi>own Righteousness but as filthy rags</hi> (not
only because of its utter insufficiency to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
in stead of Christ, or as he justifies, in which
respect indeed it is no better; but also as any
part of a Condition of Justification or of our
acceptance with God:) And when they have
been taught also, that upon their believing
only, Christ's Righteousness in fulfilling the
Law for them, becomes imputed to them in
it self, and not only as the procuring cause of
their Justification upon the terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
so that they are looked upon as having
themselves perfectly kept the Law in him, it
hath doubtless infeebled their endeavours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an inherent Righteousness, and proved a
temptation to them, to think that so long as
they have such anothers inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
essentially in it self imputed to them as
Christs is, they have no great need to find it
in themselves; considering also that if they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55859:77"/>
had it, they must rather loath themselves for
it, than take any comfort in it: <hi>But let no man
deceive you</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn) he that doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
is righteous, as he is righteous,</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 7.</p>
               <p>I do acknowledge, that many of them have
been worthy men, who yet have propagated
these Opinions: But that makes the Opinions
never the better, but have done more hurt in
gaining thereby the more credit. It is
true also that those worthy Men have zealously
pressed the necessity of Repentance, Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a holy Life: which proved indeed
an Antidote against the Poyson of the other
Opinions, so that they did not become mortal
to many as otherwise they would have done.
And indeed they would have made mad work,
if they had not been yoked with wholesomer
Doctrine, as we see they did among <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Ranters,</hi> and other carnal Chistians that
have followed the Docture of those Opinions,
but have been shy of letting the Doctrines of
Mortification and strict living, to have any
power over them. But then if the preaching
of those sounder Doctrines of Repentance,
Regeneration, and a holy Life, have done
much good, notwithstanding they have been
clogged with Opinions of another tendency;
it is easie to imagine that they would have
done much more good, if they had not been
checkt by those unsound Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55859:78"/>
But I shall say no more of this (though

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">That the Doctrine of St. Paul, and of
St. Iames about Faith and Works
in reference to Iustification, do
not differ, but are wholly one.</head>
               <p>IT is true indeed, though the Doctrine
of St. <hi>PAVL,</hi> and St. <hi>IAMES,</hi>
was in nothing opposite the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet the nature of the subject-matter of
their Epistles, did differ, just as the Errors
they engaged against, did differ. The Errors
of the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> consisting much in
denying Justification to be by Christ and Faith
in him, and in placing it in their own works
of Circumcising, Sacrificing, and other <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Observations. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> designing in
some of his Epistles, to antidote the Christians
against the infection of them, and to establish
them in the saving Doctrine of the Gospel,
was led of course to bend his discourse in
great part against Justification by Works of
the Law; and on the contrary to assert it to
be by Faith in Christ, in his Death, and in his
Doctrine, without those works. Whereas
St. <hi>Iames</hi> having to do in his Epistle, with
such as professed the Christian Faith, and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55859:79"/>
by it, but erring dangerously about the
nature of Faith as justifying, thinking that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionative
Faith would save them, though desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of a real change in the moral frame and
constitution of their Souls, and of a holy Life:
Hereupon it became in a manner as necessary
for him to plead the Renovation of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Evangelical Obedience to be some
way necessary unto Justification, as it was for
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to contend for Justification by Faith
without the deeds of the Law. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though their Doctrines in this respect did
in great part differ, yet they did not differ as
Truth differs from Error, nor as opposites, but
only as one Truth differs from another. For
otherwise when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to do with the
like Erroneous and Scandalous Christians, as
those were which St. <hi>Iames</hi> expostulated the
matter with: When he had to do with such
as had a form of godliness, but denyed the
power thereof, he could, and did decry a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
faith, and plead the necessity of a <hi>Faith</hi>
that is <hi>unfeighned,</hi> and of a holy Life, as well
as St. <hi>Iames;</hi> as appears in part by what was
said in the former Chapter, and will, I
doubt not, be made sufficiently evident in this.
In order whereto I shall recommend to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
these ten things.</p>
               <p>1. That Works of Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
are never in Scripture opposed to God's
Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:55859:79"/>
2. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> in speaking against Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Works, gives sufficient Caution not
to be understood thereby to speak any thing
against Evangelical Obedience in reference
thereto.</p>
               <p>3. That Regeneration, or the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as including Evangelical Obedience, is
oposed to Works in the business of Man's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
as well as Faith is, and as well as
the grace of God it self is.</p>
               <p>4. That Evangelical Obedience as well as
Faith, and together with Faith, is opposed to
the Works of the Law, in reference to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>5. That Evangelical Obedience alone, is
opposed to the Works of the Law.</p>
               <p>6. Faith it self is an act of Evangelical
Obedience.</p>
               <p>7. By Evangelical Obedience, Christians
come to have a right to Salvation.</p>
               <p>8. The Promise of benefit by the Blood of
Christ, is made to Evangelical Obedience.</p>
               <p>9. Repentance. And 10. Forgiving Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are both acts of Evangelical Obedience,
without which a Man cannot be justifyed.
And if these things be made out, they will I
think amount to such a Demonstration, as that
we cannot well desire a clearer or fuller proof,
that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> together with other the Apostles,
taught Justification by Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
as the effect of Faith, as well as St.
<hi>Iames.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:55859:80"/>
1. The works of Evangelical Obedience, as the
effects of Faith, and Regeneration by Faith,
are never in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles, or any other
the holy Scriptures, opposed to God's Grace
in referenee to Justification and Salvation.
Works and Grace indeed are opposed to each
other: But then by Works we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
either Works antecedent to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or as they are denyed to merit at the
hands of God: or the Works of the Law of
<hi>Moses</hi> as Erroneously contended for by the
<hi>Iews:</hi> Or the Works of the Law as Typical,
and as opposed to things Typified: Or the
Works of the Law, as the Law is in its rigour
opposed to the milder Oeconomy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
But the Works of Evangelical Obedience
are never opposed to Grace, no more than
Faith it self is. And there is no reason why
they should, because Evangelical Obedience
is the effect of Divine Grace as well as Faith
it self is, and tends to the praise of it, and
is accepted, and will be rewarded through
Grace.</p>
               <p>Contrary hereunto, those words in <hi>Titus 3. 5.
Not by works of Righteousness which we have
done, but according to his mercy he saved us,</hi>
are wont to be alledged to prove that Works
after conversion, as well as those before, are
opposed to the Mercy of God in the saving of
Men. But whether this be duly collected
from these words, will best appear by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55859:80"/>
the Scope and meaning of the words with
the Context. The words in the 3, 4, and 5,
verses, are these; <hi>For we our selves also were
sometimes foolish, serving divers lusts and
pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,
and hating one another. But after that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and love of God our Saviour toward Man
appeared: Not by Works of Righteousness,
which we have done, but according to his mercy
he saved us by the washing of Regeneration, and
renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> By their being
saved here, is meant their being rescued and
delivered from their sinful state, mentioned
<hi>vers.</hi> 3. In that this is said to be done, not by
Works of Righteousness which they had done,
but according to God's Mercy: The plain
meaning (I doubt not) is, that this change
of their condition, and deliverance from their
sinful state, was not effected, or so much as
begun among them by any Reformation of
their own, till the Gospel came to work it,
(which is meant by the appearing of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and love of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. and is of like
import with that Chap. 2. 11, 12.) which God
of his mercy, and not of their desert, sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them to that end. And if this be the
meaning of the words, the Apostle was far
from intending by Works of Righteousness in
this place, Works after Conversion. I might
rather well argue on the contrary from this
place; That Baptism which is an Act of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55859:81"/>
Obedience in the person Baptized, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
which is Evangelical Obedience in
the root &amp; principle, are together with the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, and, as subordinate to it, opposed to
the Works of Righteousness here mentioned, in
the Work of Salvation. For it is probable
that by the washing of Regeneration here, is
meant Baptism as the Figure of Regeneration,
and by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
it self. By both which, as subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to God's mercy therein, they were said
to be saved, and not by the Works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
which they had done before these.
There is another place in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. which is
wont to be urged with this to <hi>Titus,</hi> to the
same purpose: But it being of the same nature
with this, the same answer may serve both
with a little variation.</p>
               <p>2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in speaking against Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Works, gives sufficient caution not to
be understood thereby to speak against Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience in the Case. When he had
asserted Justification to be by Faith without
the deeds of the Law, and that the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
might be justified by believing, without ever
observing <hi>Moses</hi> Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. lest he
should be understood thereby to favour <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lism,</hi>
or loose living in men, provided they
would but turn Christians; he frames and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
an Objection thus, <hi>vers. 31. Do we make
void the Law through Faith? God forbid: Yea
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55859:81"/>
we establish the Law.</hi> And how did they so?
certainly they did not thereby establish the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Law in the Letter of it, but in the
Spirit of it they did, in as much as in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Justification in the Gospel-way, they
preached in plain Precepts the necessity of that
Spiritual purity unto salvation, which was
but darkly, and in a Figure taught by the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Law: And this they did, in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the necessity of Mortifiation, instead of
Circumcision. And by the Doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Faith, they established the Moral
Law, both in the Letter and Spirit of it, in
teaching the necessity of Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it, after a more Spiritual and forcible
manner than had been taught before. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
when he had charged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the unbelieving
<hi>Iews</hi> with a great Error, in going about to
establish a Righteousness of their own, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to God's, in adhering to their Law
against the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. to the end it
might not be thought that he would take them
off their Law, that they might be lawless, or
less Religious, he adds, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. that <hi>Christ is
the end of the Law for Righteousness to every
one that believeth.</hi> For so he is in his Doctrine,
having therein taught that Righteousness of
living which the Law it self taught, but in
a far more Excellent, Spiritual, and effectual
manner, than was taught by the Law. So
that all that he designed in taking them off
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55859:82"/>
from their Law, was but to put them under
a better conduct: To make them <hi>dead to the
Law, that they might be married to another,</hi>
viz. to Christ by his Gospel, that <hi>they might
bring forth fruit unto God,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. And
likewise in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he saith, <hi>We are delivered
from the Law,</hi> but not to be lawless, but <hi>that
we might serve in newness of Spirit, and not
in the oldness of the Letter;</hi> that is, according
to the Spirit, Scope, and Design of the Law,
now expressed in plain Precepts, and not in
the oldness of the Letter and Ceremony. And
so he saith of himself, <hi>Gal. 2. 19. I through
the Law am dead to the Law, i. e.</hi> he through
a better understanding of God's Design in the
Law, became dead as to all his former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
of Justification by it. But then, if
he were dead to the Law, it was, as he saith,
that he might <hi>live unto God,</hi> live <hi>a life in the
flesh through the Faith in his Son,</hi> through belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Gospel in its Precepts and Promises;
the one directing, and the other quickning
unto a most excellent life, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>And if St. <hi>Paul</hi> were thus careful in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Justification by Works, to assert the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Evangelical Obedience, we may
well conclude, that he never intended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of Works of the Law, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Evangelical Obedience from having
any hand sooner or later in Justification.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55859:82"/>
3. Regeneration, or the new Creature, as
including Evangelical Obedience, is opposed
to Works of the Law, in the business of Man's
Justification, as well as Faith is, and as well
as the Grace of God it self is. <hi>Gal. 6. 15. For
in Christ Iesus neither Circumcision availeth any
thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new Creature.</hi>
Circumcision is here as elsewhere by a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi>
put for the Works of the Law in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
For there were none that were for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising,
but who were also for keeping the
Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> Only Circumcision is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
frequently instead of all the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they held it to be not only a part of the
Law, but more; and because they laid the
greatest stress upon it, as I shewed before,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. Now in that which the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
Circumcision and the Works of the Law
to avail a Man, in that he affirms the becoming
a new Creature will avail him, and that was
in the business of Justification and Salvation:
For in that sense the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizers</hi>
held Circumcision and other Works
of the Law available. And this new Creature
thus opposed to works, and thus available to
Justification, consisteth in a new frame of
Spirit, and the vital operations thereof, and
which we can have no right notion of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Evangelical Obedience in will and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at least (which are really inward acts of
that obedience, and are a conformity of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55859:83"/>
renewed will to the Divine Law).</p>
               <p>4. Evangelical Obedience as well as Faith,
and together with Faith, is opposed to the
Works of the Law in reference to Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Salvation. <hi>Gal. 5. 6. For in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
neither Circumcision availeth any thing,
nor uncircumcision, but Faith which worketh by
love.</hi> Here again Circumcision by the same
Figure, and for the same reason as before, is
put for the Works of <hi>Moses</hi> Law. And as
these are denyed to avail any Man to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Salvation, so on the other hand it is
affirmed that that Faith which worketh by
love doth avail to these great ends. For to
say that Faith which worketh by love doth so,
is the same in sense, as to say, that Faith which
worketh by fulfilling the Law, and by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commandments, doth so avail: For
so love is said to be, <hi>Rom. 13. 10. 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 3.
The Assemblies <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the place
give notice, that the word here translated
[<hi>worketh</hi>] (Faith which worketh by love)
being in the mean, or middle voice, may be
taken either Actively or Passively. And seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Learned men (among whom Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi> is one) do render and understand
it passively; as if the Apostle should have said,
Faith which is <hi>wrought,</hi> or <hi>perfected,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate</hi>
by love, and so make it directly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
with that in St. <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 2. 22. <hi>by
Works was Faith made perfect.</hi> So far is the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55859:83"/>
Scripture we see from opposing acts of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience to Faith in the Work of
Justification, as that it conjoyns them with
Faith in the title to it, and in opposition to
false pretentions to it.</p>
               <p>5. Evangelical Obedience alone is opposed
to the Works of the Law in reference to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
so far is it from being true, that
where the Works of the Law are excluded,
there Evangelical Obedience is excluded from
having any share in the Work of Justification.
1 <hi>Cor. 7. 19. Circumcision is nothing, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
is nothing, but the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God.</hi> Circumcision is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
as before, put for the whole Law: And
indeed he that was circumcised, was bound
to keep the whole Law, as this Apostle noteth
in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. And when he saith Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is nothing, he means here doubtless, as in
those other places already opened, that it
avails nothing to any Mans acceptation with
God, or to his Justification and Salvation, as
the <hi>Iudaizers</hi> of those times thought it did.
But then the keeping of the Commandments of
God will avail to these ends: For that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
was intended, and ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the opposition that is made between
Circumcision and keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>6. Faith it self is an act of Evangelical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
this as wel as love is an act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55859:84"/>
to our Lord's Commands; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Man cannot be justified by Faith, but
in being so, he must be justified by Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Obedience. 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 23. This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
that we should believe in the name
of his Son Iesus Christ, and love one another, as
he gave us Commandment.</hi> This by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is called a <hi>work,</hi> Joh. 6. 29. <hi>This is the
work of God, that ye believe on him whom he
hath sent.</hi> And there is so much of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Evangelical Obedience in Faith it self,
as that to believe and to obey are promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
put one for another; and so is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and disobedience. Accordingly you
have in many places the one reading in the
Text, and the other in the Margin, as <hi>Acts
5. 36. Rom. 11. 30, 31. Ephes. 5. 6. Heb.</hi> 4. 11.
&amp; 11. 31. And belief and disobedience
are in Scripture opposed to each other as
direct contraries, <hi>Rom. 10. 16. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 7.
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>So that since Faith is an act of Evangelical
Obedience, it follows, that to say the Works
of Evangelical Obedience do justifie, does no
more derogate from the Grace of God, or
the freeness of his Grace in justifying, than to
say Faith justifies. First, Because other acts
of Evangelical Obedience are the effects of
God's Grace, and produced by it, as well as
Faith. <hi>It is God that worketh in you both to
will and to do of his good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55859:84"/>
And secondly, Because it is meerly of the Law
of Grace, that Faith and other Acts of
Evangelical Obedience, are made the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Promise of Salvation, <hi>Ephes. 2. 8.
By grace are ye Saved, through Faith in Christ
Iesus; and that not of your selves, it is the
gift of God.</hi> As Men do not believe or obey
of themselves without supernatural assistance,
so neither is it of themselves that they are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
or saved upon their believing, but both
the one and the other, is the gift of God. <hi>It
is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
but of God that sheweth mercy.</hi> It is by
virtue of God's new Covenant, that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of pardon is made to Repentance, or to
Faith; for the primary Law, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
promised no such thing upon Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
And it is by virtue of the same Law of
Grace, that a Promise of Justification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
is made to sincere Obedience in other
Acts of Obedience, as well as those of Faith
and Repentance.</p>
               <p>That which hath made many afraid of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressing
Evangelical Obedience with Faith,
in justifying men, hath been an Opinion, that
so to do would derogate from God's Grace, &amp;
attribute too much to Man: But you see there
is no ground for such an Opinion. It's true
indeed, the proper merit of Works, and God's
Grace are inconsistent: And therefore are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to each other in Scripture. But Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55859:85"/>
Obedience and Grace, are no more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
or inconsistent, than Cause and Effect,
or than Causes principal and subordinat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
And as it doth not follow, that because
we are justified freely by God's Grace, that
therefore we are not justified by Faith: So
neither doth it follow, that because we are
justified by Faith, that therefore we are not
justified by sincere obedience. For these
and the Blood of Christ, do all concur
in producing many of the same effects, though
not in the same respect.</p>
               <p>7. By Evangelical Obedience, Christians
come to have a right to Salvation. <hi>Revel. 22. 14.
Blessed are they that do his Commandments, that
they may have a right to the Tree of Life, and
may enter in through the gates into the City.</hi> This
is left on Record as a special <hi>Memorandum</hi> for
Christians in closing up the Canon of the
New Testament; and therefore is to be taken
special notice of. This right to the Tree of
Life, and of entring into this blessed City up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
keeping the Commandments, is from a
new Covenant, or Law, Act, or Grant from
God: For otherwise Man that had transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the first Law he was put under, would
have been far from having any right to such
happiness upon the terms here mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
of sincere, though imperfect Obedience. But
seeing that a Right to <hi>Salvation</hi> doth accrue to
Men upon a sincere keeping of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55859:85"/>
notwithstanding their forfeiture
of their first Right by Man's first fall, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
follows, that Evangelical or Sincere
Obedience, is part of the Condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of blessedness in the new Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and is here put for the whole of it, as
at other times Faith is put for the whole of the
Condition. And that <hi>Moses, David, Solomon,
Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> received it in this sense,
and understood all along that sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
flowing from Love, was the Condition
of God's Covenant of mercy when they styled
him a God keeping Covenant and mercy with
those that love him, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Deut. 7. 9. 1 King. 8. 23. Neh. 1. 5. Dan.</hi>
9. 4. I have before shewed.</p>
               <p>If it shall be here said, that sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is indeed a Condition of Salvation, but
not of Justification, and that it is so made
here in this 22d of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> I have I think
sufficiently answered this Objection in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapter, but shall here add; That such
as thus say, are morecurious and nice in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
between Justification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than St. <hi>Paul</hi> was. For he calls Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>the Iustification of Life,</hi> Rom. 5. 18.
<hi>Whom he justified, them he also glorified,</hi> Rom.
8. 30. and proves that men shall be justified
by Faith, because it is written that <hi>the Iust
shall live by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 11. Thus with him
to be justified, &amp; to be blessed are all one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55859:86"/>
8, 9. <hi>Ro.</hi> 4. 7, 8, 9. And to confirm this, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Justification and Life, are used by him as
Synonimous terms, <hi>Gal. 3. 21. For if there had
been a Law given which could have given life,
verily Righteousness should have been by the
Law.</hi> And Justification and Condemnation
are put in direct opposition to each other,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. &amp; 8. 33, 34. And to be from
Condemnation (which is Justification) and
to be saved, are as much one, as not to dye, is
to live. In short, Salvation as well as Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is promised to believing, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16.
Act. 3. 31. Heb.</hi> 10. 39. And therefore Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
as well as Justification, must needs be
the immediate effect of Faith; if we take
Salvation as begun here in this Life (as the
Scripture represents it to be, <hi>Ioh. 5. 24. 1 Ioh.</hi>
3. 14. &amp; 5. 12.) From all which me may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that what is absolutely necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
must needs also be necessary to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Add we hereto, that to be justified, and to
be saved, is the same thing with St. <hi>Iames,</hi> as
well as it is with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> according to the
tenour of his reasoning, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. from ver. 14.
to the end. <hi>What doth it profit my brethren</hi>
(saith he) <hi>though a man say he hath Faith,
and have not Works? can Faith save him?</hi> vers.
14. This Interrogation implyes an Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Negation, and the meaning is, that
such a Faith can by no means save a man; and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55859:86"/>
he gives the reason of it twice over in <hi>vers.</hi> 17,
20. because Faith without Works is dead.
And then afterwards argues the necessity of
Works together with Faith, unto Justification,
or unto Salvation (which was the thing he
began with) by God's justifying <hi>Abraham</hi> by
Works, together with his Faith, who was
the great Patern or Example of God's justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all others. If then to be ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tified, and to
be saved amounts to the same in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Discourse here, then by the way, they do
not rightly understand St. <hi>Iames,</hi> who think
he doth not speak of a Justification before
God in this his Discourse about Justification
by Works, together with Faith, but of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
before Men, and to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
only. Which supposition of theirs
doth directly thwart the very Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of his whole Discourse, which is to set
forth what will, and what will not avail a
Christian-Professor in the sight of God, to the
saving of his Soul, as abundantly appears. So
that <hi>the Scripture which saith Abraham belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God, and it was accounted to him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;</hi>
and which St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith <hi>was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi>
in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being justified by Works as
well as by Faith, was not fulfilled in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
being justified to others, and to his own
Conscience, but in his being justified before
God, and so St. <hi>Paul</hi> understood it, <hi>Rom. 4. 3.
Gal.</hi> 3. 6. But this was touched before in Chap. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:55859:87"/>
The result then of what hath been argued in
Answer to the Objection, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That
all that are justified, are thereby put regularly
into an immediate capacity of Salvation; so
that if they should dye the very next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after they are once justified, they would
undoubtedly be saved. And therefore Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience can be no more necessary to
Salvation, than it is to Justification, and it is
as necessary to the one as to the other. And
if to say Evangelical Obedience is necessary to
Justification, be injurious to Christ and to
the Grace of God, as some would pretend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
how comes it to pass then, that to say Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience is necessary to Salvation, is
not so too? For our final Salvation is as much
the effect of God's Grace, and of Christ's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
for us, as our Justification it self is,
and of as much value. And therefore if the
one be not injurious in this kind, neither is
the other.</p>
               <p>8. As the Promise of forgiveness of sins by
the Blood of Christ, or the Promise of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in his Blood to the pardon of Sinne,
is sometimes made unto believing, so some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again it is made unto Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or a holy Life, as in 1 <hi>Ioh. 1. 7. If we
walk in the light, as he is in the light,</hi> (that
is, endeavouring to be holy, as God is holy)
<hi>then have we fellowship one with another, and
the Blood of Iesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55859:87"/>
from all Sin;</hi> but otherwise it doth not. And
so the Christians to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote, were
said to be <hi>elect according to the foreknowledge of
God the Father, through Sanctification of the
Spirit, unto obedience, and sprinkling of the
Blood of Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 2. But they were
not elect to the benefit of being sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the blood of Christ without obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And therefore by this we see also that
Evangelical Obedience, is part of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Promise of Justification by the Blood
of Christ.</p>
               <p>9. To forgive Injuries is an act of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Obedience to that Precept of our Lord,
<hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 25. And yet without this act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Men that have been injurious, cannot be
justified, because they cannot be pardoned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of our Lord, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.
26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 15. &amp; 18. 35. Therefore Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Obedience must needs be part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Justification.</p>
               <p>10. Repentance is an eminent Act of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. and yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of sin which is essential to Justification, is
not to be obtained without it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3, 5.
Therefore again it follows, that Evangelical
Obedience is necessary to Justification, and part
of the Condition of it.</p>
               <p>And now by this time I suppose it fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to any unprejudiced Reader, that the
Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yea, and of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55859:88"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> too, do fully accord with the Doctrine of
St. <hi>Iames,</hi> touching the necessity of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience unto Justification. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
then which some have made between
Faith and all Internall and External Works in
reference to Justification, as well Evangelical
as <hi>Mosaical,</hi> hath not been only <hi>without</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ground,
but <hi>against</hi> Scripture-evidence;
and looks more like that which was made by
the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> or other Solifidians, opposed by
St. <hi>Iames,</hi> (if it be not the very same) than
any the Scripture any where maketh. And
how much injury the Christian Religon and
the Souls of Men may have suffered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
is a thing to be thought on, and sadly laid
to heart.</p>
               <p>It is a pleasant Doctrine, and the worst of
Men called Christians, are glad to hear that
they may be justifyed by Christ, only upon
their believing in him without any Works of
Righteousness or self-denial of their own. And
upon that account (presuming verily that they
do believe) they are confident that they are
justified, though they are unsanctified. But
those especially are in great danger of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their own Souls, by building their
confidence upon this Doctrine, who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with this belief, have more of the form
of godliness than the other have, and are
found much more in the use and exercise of
the external devotional part of Religion, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55859:88"/>
are zealous for this or that Opinion, Party, or
Way which they think most Orthodox;
though they be greatly destitute of love to
the Nature of God, and of Humility, Charity,
strict Justice, Fidelity, Peaceableness, Sobriety,
Temperance, Modesty and Meekness, and of
that renewed frame of Soul which would
make them like Christ Jesus, wherein the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Christiany doth consist: The External
duties of Hearing, Reading, Praying, and the
rest, being in great part but means referring
to the other as the end: So that no Man is to
account himself truly Religious, further than
he attains to these truly Christian Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by the use of the External Means, and
Internal Aids. Yea, the fleshly part, even in
Men good in the main, is very apt to make an
advantage of such a Doctrine as aforesaid, to
the lessening of their Care, Diligence, and
Zeal, in working out their Salvation, in stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to enter in at the straight gate, in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own Spirits and Appetites, in clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselves from all filthiness of Flesh and
Spirit, and in perfecting holiness in the fear
of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore there is great need for those
that are Spiritual Guides to the people, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
much upon the necessity of Repentance,
Regeneration, and a holy Life as well as Faith,
in order to their being justified and saved by
Christ Jesus. For the people, yea, the better
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55859:89"/>
sort of them, stand most in need, as of being
well-grounded touching the truth of the
Christian Religion, so especially of having
the Doctrines of Morality inculcated upon
them, the Precepts of the Gospel being almost
all of that Nature, (though some speak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutively
of Moral Preaching) and tend to
the perfecting of the Nature of Man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
the Internal operations of the Soul,
and the External actions of life, in reference
both to God and Man, our selves and others:
The recovering of Men to which, is God's
great design by the Gospel, in order to
their being made perfectly happy at last, as I
have shewed in Chap. 1.</p>
               <p>There is indeed an absolute necessity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the Gospel in order to Christian Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
And therefore our blessed Saviour did
not only Preach the necessity of Faith in him
and his Doctrine, but also wrought abundance
of Miracles to beget this Faith in Men. And yet
he knowing the great danger of Mens miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in point of Morality in the disposition
of Soul, and actions of Life, insisted chiefly
in his Preaching, upon Doctrines of that
nature; as you may see in his Sermon on the
Mount, and elsewhere. He taught the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of being <hi>born again: Of making the Tree
good, that the fruit might be good.</hi> And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
this Doctrine of his, he was not wont to
tell his Auditors that every Man shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55859:89"/>
according to his belief, but that <hi>when
the Son of Man shall come, every Man shall be
rewarded according to his Works: That those
that have done good, shall come forth to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of life,</hi> and <hi>those that have done evil,
to the resurrection of damnation:</hi> That <hi>by their
words they shall be justified</hi> (which are no
more Faith than Works are) <hi>And by their
words they shall be condemned:</hi> That in the
great day of the tryal of all Nations; every Man
shall be acquitted or condemned, according to
the good they have done, or neglected to do,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. And that then not every Man that
had Faith enough to <hi>cry Lord, Lord,</hi> or <hi>to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
cast out Devils, or do wonders in his
Name, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
but such and such only <hi>as have done the will of
his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great need there is therefore of peoples
examining themselves impartially, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often admonished to take heed, left they
mistake and deceive themselves in the nature
of Religion, and in what is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be done on their part; because men are
very apt to flatter and deceive themselves in
that, and to think that when their Faith is
right in the Object of it [as when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the true God, and in his Son Jesus
Christ, and expect Salvation by him alone]
that then they are true believers, and such as
shall be saved; especially if therewith they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55859:90"/>
joyn the frequenting of God's Ordinances, and
the paring off of some of the grosser enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their lives, though in the mean while
they make no Conscience of cleansing their
hearts, and governing their Spirits, of subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Passions and inordinate affections,
and of bridling the Tongue. For this cause
it is that Christians are so often in Scripture
cautioned to take heed lest they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for
whatsoever a Man sows, that also shall he reap,</hi>
Gal. 6. 7, 8. <hi>Little Children, let no man deceive
you: He that doth righteousness, is Righteous,
even as he is righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 7. 1 Cor. 6. 9.
Ephes. 5. 6.</p>

            <head>An APPENDIX touching the nature
and Difference of that Faith which
is justifying, and of that which is
not; and the reason of that
difference.</head>
            <p>MEn's Eternal Estate of Weal or Wo in
another World, and their Peace and
Comfort in this, being very much
concerned in their right understanding, or
mistaking the nature and difference of that
Faith which is saving, and of that which is
not; I shall here add to what is said before,
something to state the nature and difference
of those two kinds of Faith, with what bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and perspicuity I can. I cannot (I co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess)
think that the nature of Faith, which is
of absolute necessity to the Salvation of the
meanest Christian, is in it self hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
were it not that the many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
about it, about its Object, and the Acts
of the Soul necessary to it, had puzzled
mens minds, and distracted their apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:55859:91"/>
Things absolutely necessary to Salvation, as
they are not many, so there are hardly any
Doctrines delivered with more plainness than
they, that the weak who are as much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them as the strong, might competently
understand them as well as they.</p>
            <p>Men may multiply Notions about Faith, as the
Scripture useth various expressions about it:
But I doubt not but that the general sense of
the Scripture hereabout may be summarily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in this plain Proposition: That saving
Faith is such a belief of Christ to be the Son of
God, and of the truth of his Doctrine, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
touching the virtue of his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and the necessity of amendment
of life, for the obtaining remission of Sin, and
Eternal Life, as causeth a man to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness
and worldly lusts, and to live a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
righteous, and a sober life.</p>
            <p>This is so plain in Scripture, as that there
is no Christian so weak, but may easily come to
understand it, and so evident, that none who
acknowledge the Truth of the Gospel, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it. That I may state the difference then
between Effectual and Ineffectual Faith, and
matters relating to them, with all the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
I can, I shall very briefly endeavour these
five things.</p>
            <p>1. To open the comprehensive nature of
Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:55859:91"/>
2. Shew wherein the defect lies of that
Faith which is not saving.</p>
            <p>3. Shew whence that defect proceeds.</p>
            <p>4. How, and after what manner, Faith in
the Understanding, works savingly upon the
Will.</p>
            <p>5. Answer some few Objections.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>1. The comprehensive nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aving
Faith opened.</head>
               <p>That I may open the comprehensive nature
of Faith the better, I shall first observe how
variously the Condition upon which saving
benefits are promised, is expressed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and then what actings of the Soul are
thereby signified.</p>
               <p>It is thus variously expressed in Scripture:
Sometimes its called a believing God, <hi>Rom.
4. 3. Gal.</hi> 3. 6. a believing in God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.
a believing on God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 24. a believing
the Record which God hath given of his Son,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 10. Sometimes its called a believing
on Christ, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16, 36. Act.</hi> 16. 31. a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to be the Christ the Son of God,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 31. 1 Ioh. 5. 5. It's called Faith in
his Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. a believing that God
raised him from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
its called a believing of the Gospel, <hi>Mar.</hi>
16. 15, 16. a believing of the Truth, 2 <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi>
2. 15. a believing the testimony of the Apostles,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. Sometimes it is expressed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55859:92"/>
the Notion of Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. &amp;
3. 19. &amp; 11. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. and sometimes
of obedience, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 7. 1 Pet. 1. 2. Heb.</hi>
5. 9.</p>
               <p>The Condion of the Promise of saving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
being thus variously expressed, can sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
no less than a three-fold Act of the Soul:
The first, being the Act of the Understanding:
The second, of the Will: The third, of the
Understanding and Will conjunct.</p>
               <p>I. Such expressions of the Condition of the
Promise as is the believing God, the believing
in God, the believing his Record, the believing
the Gospel, the believing Christ to be the
Son of God, do most properly signifie the act
of the mind or understanding in <hi>assenting</hi> to
the truth of what God testifieth, or promiseth.
Which assent is grounded upon a knowledge,
or belief of God's Veracity, his Truth, and
Faithfulness, armed with All-sufficiency of
Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, to make good
his Word to a tittle. And although such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
as aforesaid, do most properly signifie
the act of the Understanding, yet, when ever
saving Benefits are promised, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
expressed in such a form of words as
doth most properly and primarily signifie the
<hi>assent</hi> of the mind, even then the act of the
Will in <hi>consenting</hi> to the Condition, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
and ought to be understood; as I shall
fully prove in the next Particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:55859:92"/>
And the reason why the whole of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Promise relating to the consent
of the Will, as well as the assent of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
is frequently expressed in such a
form of words, as primarily and strictly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the assent of the mind, is, I conceive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such <hi>assent</hi> of the mind, is the Principle
from which all concurrent acts of the Will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Justification and Salvation do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>And it is of frequent use in Scripture, to
denominate the whole of Religion, by some
one Principal part which is a fruitful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of all the rest.</p>
               <p>Thus the knowledge of the true God, and
of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, is said to
be Eternal Life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. And thus some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the fear of God, and sometimes the love
of God, is put for the whole of Mens saving
Religiousness, and the same Promise of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
made to one of these singly exprest, is to
be extended to the whole.</p>
               <p>In like manner, the whole of Christianity, is
frequently denominated by <hi>Faith,</hi> and the
Christians stiled <hi>Believers,</hi> and the <hi>houshold of
Faith,</hi> and the like; and all because that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
life of theirs, by which they differ from
other Men, flows from their Faith, which is
the first active Principle of it.</p>
               <p>2. Another act of the Soul essentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to that Faith which is the Condition of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55859:93"/>
the Promise, is the <hi>consent</hi> of the Will to repent,
to receive Christ as Lord &amp; King, to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Laws, as well as to own him for a
Priest once of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ering himself, and ever making
interecession for us.</p>
               <p>For the Condition of the Promise of Pardon
and Salvation, is expressed under the notion
of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Obedience,</hi>
as I shewed before: And Repentance and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
are acts of the Will as renewed.</p>
               <p>And that there is no Promise of saving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
upon meer believing, without observing
that part of the Condition which consisteth
in Repentance, Regeneration, and Obedience,
is most evident: Because they are expresly
excluded in Scripture from having any share
in the saving benefits of the Covenant, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or Salvation, who do not Repent, <hi>Luke</hi>
13. 3. who are not regenerate, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. who
love not the Lord Jesus Christ, and that above
any worldly enjoyment, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 22. Matth.</hi>
10. 37. and who do not obey him, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.
22, 23. <hi>Luke 19. 27. 2 Thes.</hi> 1. 7. By all
which we may certainly know that when ever
there is Promise of Justification and Salvation,
made to believing, it is to be understood of
such a believing as doth at that instant in which
a man believes savingly, produce a sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Will to repent, to love Christ, and
to obey him: For otherwise those Scriptures
and these would be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onsistent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:55859:93"/>
For if men cannot be pardoned, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the curse, nor be safe from destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
until they have repented, are regenerate,
do love Christ, and obey the Gospel, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Scriptures do assure us they cannot; then
no Faith whatsoever is justifying, or can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
them to Pardon and Salvation acording
to the Tenour of God's Promise, until it hath
produced that Repentance, Regeneration, Love,
and Obedience: Which is a full and an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable
proof of the necessity of such a consent
of the Will as aforesaid, to render Faith justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and saving.</p>
               <p>Now this consent and resolutionof the Will
to repent and obey Christ, and to forsake all
for him, is the Moral change of the Soul, and
the new life in its first beginning. And so a
mans first effectual Belief, is his whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
life in its beginning. And a mans first
Faith is perfected afterwards by Works, (<hi>Iam.</hi>
2. 22.) as a Child is perfected in his manly
state, as he grows up to manly actions; or
as the Seed is perfected when it grows to a full
Ear.</p>
               <p>By this first consent of the Will, we resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate
and strike Covenant with God; and
not only so, but we thereby begin also to keep
and perform Covenant with him on our part.
When this consent is first wrought in the
Will, then the Laws of the new Covenant are
first put into the mind and written in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55859:94"/>
heart: And by this we first begin to become
savingly a people unto God, to believe in him,
to love and serve him, as he by Covenant and
Promise becomes a God unto us, to make us
happy. <hi>Heb. 8. 10. This is the Convenant that I will
make, I will put my Laws into their mind, and
write them in their hearts; and I will be to them
a God, and they shall be to me a people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The other act of the Soul, which I call the
act of the Understanding &amp; of the Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct,
is an <hi>affiance</hi> in God through Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
trusting in him, or a relying on him for the
fulfilling of his Promise of saving Benefits,
while we continue sincerely to consent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
and endeavour to perform the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on our part.</p>
               <p>This is that, or part of that, which is called
a believing <hi>on God,</hi> a believing <hi>on Christ,</hi> and a
<hi>trusting in him:</hi> Noting the Souls dependence
upon Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the saving benefits which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
to Men by his Mediation, Office, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
and on the Truth and Faithfulness,
Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, to
perform all that he hath promised them
through his Son, and upon the terms he hath
promised, and not otherwise.</p>
               <p>For the Promise of saving Benefits being
made but upon the Condition before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a true Believer, or he that is rational &amp; wise,
considers as well upon what terms the benefits
are promised, as who hath promised them,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55859:94"/>
and what they are; and expects the one, no
otherwise than as he sincerely resolves and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to perform the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore if any shall rely on God, and
Christ for those benefits, in whom yet the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
condition of the Promise of them is not
found; Such a relyance is but a groundless
presumption, and not Faith or Affiance duly
so called. For such do not only rely on Christ
for that for which they have no Promise, but
for that which God hath expresly declared
they shall have no share in whilst they remain
destitute of that qualification, which is the
Condition upon which, and not without it,
the promise of those benefites is made.</p>
               <p>These three acts of the Soul exercised on
their Objects, do make up that Faith which
is justifying and saving. And when justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith in the compleat nature of it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in Scripture; all these three acts of the
Soul are to be understood, and especially the
two first; though perhaps they are many

               <head>II. Wherein the Defect lyes of that Faith
which is not saving.</head>
               <p>By what hath been discoursed touching the
nature of that Faith which is saving, it is
easie to dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ern wherein the defect lies of that
Faith which is not so.</p>
               <p>And the defect lyes chiefly in the Will, in
its not consenting to perform the condition
of the Promise in repenting, and in receiving
Christ as Lord to be governed by his Laws.</p>
               <p>I will not deny but the defect in part may
be in the Understanding, when its assent unto
the Truth of Divine Revelation is so weak,
as that it can make but a too weak and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aint
impression upon the Will, to procure its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto the Condition of the Promise.</p>
               <p>But then that defect in the assent of the
Understanding, doth usually, at least in great
part, proceed from the Will; as I shall shew
afterwards. Now that the defect lyes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Will's not consenting to the Condition
of the Promise, appears by this; because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
men may assent unto the truth of
God's Testimony, and may trust that they
shall be saved by Christ (which contain the
other two acts of the Soul) but no man tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consents, to perform the Condition of the
Promise, but in doing so, he is regenerate in
the first Act, and justified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:55859:95"/>
1. Unregenerate men may have the same
Faith of assent in the Understanding to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as the regenerate may: They may believe
God to be the Father Almighty, Maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, and Jesus Christ to be his only
Son, and the rest of the Articles of the Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and they may believe in great part that to be
their duty both towards God and Man which
is so indeed, and yet hold that truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
which they do believe. <hi>Rom.
1. 18. Many of the chief Rulers believed on
Christ,</hi> who yet <hi>loved the praise of Men more
than the praise of God,</hi> and durst <hi>not confess him,</hi>
Joh. 12. 42, 43. As also did many others when
they saw his Miracles, who yet were
such as Christ had no mind to commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 23, 24. And <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
believed, wondering, and being astonished
at the signes which were done by Philip,</hi> who yet
remained in the <hi>bond of iniquity,</hi> Acts 8. Such
as are resembled by the stony ground, believed,
who yet loved their ease and worldly interest
more than Christ; And those that St. <hi>Iames</hi>
expostulates with, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. were thus far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
also.</p>
               <p>2. Excepting the consent of the Will to the
Condition of the Promise; unregenerate Men
may hope to be saved by Christ, and rely on
him for Salvation as well as the Regenerate:
Only for want of their performing the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Promise, their hopes and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55859:96"/>
are groundless, and will deceive them.
But otherwise men, that are but carnal, and
live in some known sin, may and oftimes do
perswade themselves that they shall be saved
by Christ Jesus, because they believe that he
dyed for sinners, and because they ask God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
and perform some acts of Religion.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour saith, <hi>Many will say unto
me in that day, Lord, Lord, open unto us: Have
we not prophesied in thy Name? and in thy
Name have cast out Devils, and done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
works. We have eaten and drunk in thy
presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</hi> To
whom he will say for all that, <hi>Depart from me,
ye workers of iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7. 22, 23. Luke
13. 25, 26. These had some kind of Faith in
Christ, by which they prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied in his Name,
and cast out Devils, and did many wonderful
works. They were such as were hearers of
his Word, and Preachers of it too, and had
eaten and drunken in his presence. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this Faith, and these Works, they had
a Hope and Confidence that Christ would
open unto them, and receive them into his
Kingdom, and would not be easily beaten off
from this confidence.</p>
               <p>But the true reason why their Faith will
stand them in no stead, nor their Religious
performances neither, is, because for all that
they were workers of iniquity, they never
heartily consented to the terms of the Promise
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55859:96"/>
of Salvation by Christ in repenting: They
did not first heartily resolve, and after sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavour to turn from every known sin,
unto every known duty. And in this very
thing doth the defect of that Faith lye which
is short of saving.</p>
               <p>Which will yet further appear, in that St.
<hi>Iames</hi> when he would state the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that Faith which is saving, and that
which is not, fixeth it here.</p>
               <p>The dead Faith is denominated such by
him, from its being alone without Works,
<hi>Iam. 2. 17. Even so Faith if it hath not Works,
is dead, being alone, or by it self.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>vers. 20. But wilt thou know, O vain
Man, that Faith without Works is dead.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>ver. 26. For as the body without the Spirit
is dead,</hi> so <hi>Faith without Works is dead also.</hi>
Meaning by its being dead, that it avails
a Man no more to his Justification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than a dead Corps avails to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceing
the useful and serviceable effects of a
living Man; or than a Tree that is dead,
avails to the bringing forth fruit; or than a
few good words, <hi>Depart in peace, be ye filled
and warmed,</hi> will avail poor people, <hi>when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is given which is needful to the body,</hi> ver.
15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>In all this I do not deny, but that there may
be in such as do not savingly believe, some
consent of the Will to do something towards
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55859:97"/>
performing the Condition of the Promise, in
repenting and obeying. Such Men may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and resolve to forsake some sins, and to
do some, yea many duties, who yet never sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
consent, because they do not heartily
consent and resolve to forsake [all] known
sin, and to do [all] known duties; in which
the sincerity of Repentance and Obedience
doth consist, to which the Promise is made.
Such men may not be far from the Kingdom
of God, but yet must go farther, if ever
they would have any good ground of hope
to enter into it: But of this more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>III. Whence this defect doth proceed.</head>
               <p>I have shewed before, that there is the Faith
of assent in the Understanding unto the truth
of God's Testimony, in some unregenerate
men, as well as in the regenerate. And in
whomsoever the Faith of <hi>Consent</hi> in the Will
to perform the Condition of the Promise is
found, it always proceeds from the Faith of
<hi>Assent</hi> in the Understanding. A Man always
(in order of nature at least) believes that the
promised benefits shall be made good to him,
in case he perform the Condition, before
he consents to perform it; and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to perform the Condition in hope and
confidence of obtaining the promised benefits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:55859:97"/>
Now then the Question is, whence is it'
and what is the reason that the Faith of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the Understanding, doth not always
produce the same consent in the Will in one, as
well as in another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as it always doth,
when it becomes effectual to Justification and
Salvation? Why doth this Faith remain alone
in some, when as it is accompanied with
Works in others?</p>
               <p>I shall offer what I conceive to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this, First, in general, and then more
particularly.</p>
               <p>The difference sometimes may proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
from the different measures and degrees of the
evidence upon which the same Truth is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
One man may have a clearer discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the evidence than another, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a stronger assent in the discerning faculty,
and that stronger assent in the Understanding,
may well cause a stronger consent in the Will,
and a firm and lasting resolution. As on
the contrary, a weak and partial consent and
resolution in the Will to the Condition, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
proceds from a weak assent in the Mind,
to the Truth of God's Testimony, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and that from the weakness of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in the discerning the evidence of that
Truth which is the Object of Faith.</p>
               <p>But the reason most commonly why the
<hi>assent</hi> in the Understanding unto the Truth
of God's Testimony doth not work a <hi>consent</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:55859:98"/>
in the Will to the Condition of the Promise,
is to be taken, I conceive from the opposition
which the lower faculties of the Soul, the Will,
&amp; Affections, assisted and influenced by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Appetites, make against the superiour
Faculty the Mind, or Understanding, so that
they do not hearken to its Notices, nor obey
its Dictates. The Will which is the Spring
of Action, is a middle Faculty between the
Understanding and the sensitive Affections or
Appetites, and is sollicited by both.</p>
               <p>As the Understanding calls upon it to obey
its rational Dictates in chusing the means
which tend to the best end, both which the
Understanding represents to it from the Word
of God; so on the other hand, the sensitive
Affections sollicite it to be on their side, and
to be active in making provision for the flesh,
in chusing such things as tend to satisfie its
cravings and lusts. And because the Will
hath usually been pre-ingaged to the flesh,
and had a share in its gratifications, it's not
without much difficulty prevailed with to be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senting to, &amp; active in the <hi>crucifixion of those
affections and lusts.</hi> Which until the Will do,
and herein obey the enlightned Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Faith of <hi>assent</hi> in the Understanding
abideth alone. The Will's obstinate adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
then to Mens fleshly lusts, and carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
in opposition to that belief in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
which puts it upon destroying
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55859:98"/>
them, as absolutely necessary to the Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
as believing God touching the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of this as a means, as well as it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him touching the blessedness of the end;
this obstinate opposition in the Will, I say, is
the true reason why the Faith which is in some
men, is but a dead Faith. <hi>How can ye believe</hi>
(saith our Saviour) <hi>which seek honour one of
another, and seek not the honour that cometh
from God only?</hi> Joh. 5. 44. Yes, some of them
could, and did <hi>believe</hi> so far as to <hi>assent</hi> in their
minds, that Christ was no Impostor, but one
that came from God; and that therefore his
Doctrine must needs be true; but they did not
believe so as to be converted in their Wills, to
consent to part with their carnal interest of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reputation, with their party the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi>
which they must have done as the case
then stood, if they would have confessed him
openly; which to do, was necessary to make
them capable of the Promise of Salvation by
him. <hi>Ioh. 12. 42, 43. Among the chief Rulers,
many believed on him, but because of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
they did not confess him, lest they should be
put out of the Synagogue, for they loved the
praise of Men, more than the praise of God.</hi>
These had more understanding than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, who, as they said, knew not the
Law, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.) and yet not so many of them
as of the people believed on Christ, so as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and follow him, because their wordly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55859:99"/>
interest being greater, it held them faster and
had the greater power over their Wills. The
unbelief then of Men where the Gospel comes,
is generally to be resolved into the obstinacy of
their Wills, in opposition to the convictions
of their Understanding, <hi>Iohn 5. 40. Ye will
not come to me that ye might have life. How oft
would I have gathered you, and ye would not,</hi>
Mat. 23. 37. <hi>O that my people had hearkened to
my counsel! but Israel would none of me.</hi> Psal.
81. 11. <hi>They did not chuse the fear of the Lord,</hi>
Prov. 1. 29. <hi>They chose</hi> their own ways, their
Souls <hi>delighted in their abominations,</hi> Isa. 6. 3.
Thus much in general. But I would shew
yet more particularly how the Will doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the perfecting the work of Faith after
it's begun in the Understanding. And it doth
it as I conceive.</p>
               <p>I. By calling off the Understanding from
a frequent consideration of that evidence by
which it was first convinced of the Truth of
Gods Testimony touching the Promised Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and the Condition and Means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, and from a frequent application of
it to the Will: and this the Will can do.</p>
               <p>For as the Understanding hath a power
over the Will, so far a to represent it's appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
to the Will in order to its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereupon according to a Man's
own concerns therein; so also the Will hath
ak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd of power over the Understanding, both
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55859:99"/>
to put it upon frequent consideration, to
strengthen it self in the belief of that which
the Will would have to prove true and to be
believed; and also to call it off from so doing,
when there is a great reluctancy in the Will
against having that prove true which the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
represents as true. And if the
Understanding be taken off, so that it hath
not frequent recourse to that evidence which
first procured its <hi>assent</hi> unto the Truth of God's
Testimony in the Gospel, that it might be
thereby nourished, strengthened, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
that Faith in the Understanding will
languish and grow weak, and so have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
operation upon the Will to change and
renew it, and to procure its effectual consent
to perform the Condition of the Promise,
when the Will stands disinclined of it self, to
the Verdict of the Understanding. Besides,
if the Understanding doth not <hi>ply</hi> the Will,
and frequently inculcate upon it, its own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
concerning God's Testimony, and
the consequence and concernment of it to a
Mans own self, thereby to make the Word
believed to be an <hi>ingrafted Word,</hi> it will not
not work any Cure upon it, or any through
change in it.</p>
               <p>The unwillingness in Men to have their
Minds ingage in the consideration of God's
ways and their own, is the reason of their
turning back from him, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 34. 27. They
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55859:100"/>
turned back from him, and would not consider
any of his ways.</hi> As on the contrary the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
represents the conversion of a sinner
as proceeding from the consideration of
the bad tendency of his evil ways, Ezek. 18. 28.
<hi>Because he considereth and turneth away from all
his transgressions which he hath committed, he
shall surely live, he shall not dye.</hi> And our
Saviour seems to cast mens profiting, or not
profiting, their belief, or not belief by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Testimony in the Gospel, upon their
considering, or not considering of it. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.
24. <hi>And he said unto them, consider what
you hear</hi> (so Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> reads it) <hi>for
with what measure ye mete</hi> (viz. in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or not considering) <hi>it shall be measured
to you again,</hi> in profiting, or not profiting;
which is to be understood according to God's
ordinary proceeding with men.</p>
               <p>The reason why the Faith of those resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the stony ground, doth not abide, or
come to perfection, is, because they have no
Root in themselves, and that comes to pass
for want of much consideration, and a frequent
working the first conviction of the mind from
the evidence of Truth, into the Will &amp; Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by a constant Consideration, and close Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it. <hi>Acts 17. 11. They searched the
Scriptures [daily] whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se things were
so;</hi> and <hi>therefore they believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:55859:100"/>
2. When men hold fast their lusts out of their
great love to them, notwithstanding their
conviction in their Understandings, and
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot willing to part with them upon any
terms; the Fumes of those lusts continually
ascending, will cloud and darken the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
as a thick Fogg doth the Sun, and
by degrees make it less capable of discerning
its Object, <hi>viz.</hi> saving Truth, in its clear
evidence, and proportionably hinder in its that
opperation upon the Will. <hi>The cares of this
World, and the deceitfulness of Riches, and the
lusts of other things, choaked the Word, and it
becometh unfruitful,</hi> Mar. 4. 19. <hi>He that hateth
his Brother is in darkness, and walketh in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and knoweth not whether he goes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
darkness hath blinded his eyes,</hi> 1 Joh.
2. 11.</p>
               <p>3. Sinful Mens understandings are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot so
uncorrupt, but that they are apt to be bribed
by their Wills, to cast about and devise how
to evade the force and edge of their own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
and Dictates, and to attempt and baffle
their former apprehensions and convictions,
to the end they may still retain their lusts
without any great disturbance from their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
This when it is yielded to,
and put in practice, is that which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is called Mens <hi>closing their eyes, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t at any
time they should see with their eyes, and hear
with their ears, and understand with their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55859:101"/>
hearts, and should be converted and healed,</hi>
Mat. 13. 15. And when this takes place in
Professors of Christianity, that do believe that
Faith, Repentance, and Obedience are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Salvation, as the Condition on which it
is promised, the way by which they u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ually
deceive their own hearts, is, by perswading
themselves, that they do perform the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Promise in these, when indeed they
do not; but frame to themselves Notions of
saving Faith, Repentance and Obedience, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the Scripture Notions of them, as
I shall shew in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ach of them.</p>
               <p>1. Many delude themselves by taking up a
wrong Notion of saving Faith, and so think
they have it, when they have it not. They
believe indeed Christ to be the Son of God,
and Saviour of the World, and that those shall
be saved that believe in him, and those damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that do not, because the Scripture, which
they believe to be the Word of God, saith so:
And thus far they believe rightly objectively.
But then they deceive their own Souls by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
themselves that a meer <hi>assent</hi> of their
mind to the Truth of these and other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Verities, is the Faith to which the
Promise of Justification and Salvation is made,
though it hath no such powerful operation
upon their Wills, as to make them new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to make any thorow change in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of their hearts and tenor of their lives. And
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55859:101"/>
many doubtless have been greatly strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this delusive confidence, by having been
taught that Faith justifies without any Works
at all. And these again perswade themselves,
that they believe in Christ to the saving of their
Souls, because they rely on him alone for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and upon what he hath done, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for them, though they love their sins,
and live in them still. Just like some <hi>Iews</hi> of
old, who though they were very bad in their
lives, yet <hi>leaned upon the Lord, and said, is not
the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us?</hi>
Mich. 3. 11. Isa. 48. 1, 2. They leaned upon
God's Promise of being their God, as those
do upon Christ's undertaking to be a Saviour,
although they overlooked the Condition to be
performed by them in being a people unto him,
in loving and serving him, as those Christians
I speak of, also do. Though Christ alone is
to be relyed on for Salvation, as touching all
that is proper to the Mediatory Office and
Work, yet no man is to rely on him, so as to
think he should excuse him, if he do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or be not regenerate, or as if he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or were regenerate for him. If they
do; they promise themselves from him, that
which he never promised, or undertook,
but hath told them plainly, that except they
themselves repent, they shall perish, and
that except they themselves be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55859:102"/>
they cannot see the Kingdome of
God.</p>
               <p>2. They deceive their own hearts also in the
nature of Repentance, their Notion of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one thing, and the Scripture-Notion of it
quite another: So that they perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
they have repented, when indeed they
have not. They know and believe perhaps,
repentance to be necessary to Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ hath said, that except ye repent,
ye shall all likewise perish. But then they
mistake in perswading themselves that they
do repent, because they are frequently sorry
for what they have done, though they cease
not to do the same again. Indeed when the
pleasure of Sin is over, and rebukes of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
come in the room of them; these trouble
their minds for what they have done, which
was the Repentance of <hi>Iudas;</hi> and <hi>there is no
peace to the wicked, who are like the troubled
Sea.</hi> Now this they count repentance, though
it work no effectual and thorow change in
Heart and Life; but when that sad fit is over,
they appear to be the same Men they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by returning to the same sins.</p>
               <p>And herein the <hi>Romish</hi> Church hath most
unhappily laid a Snare, which as is to be
feared catcheth multitudes of Souls to their
destruction, in asserting <hi>Contrition,</hi> yea, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi>
with confession, to be repentance suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55859:102"/>
to Salvation. Whereas sorrow <hi>alone,</hi>
though it be <hi>godly sorrow,</hi> is not Repentance,
but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Godly sorrow worketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
2 Cor. 7. 10. But Repentance itself,
which is saving, consisteth chiefly in a real
change in Mens apprehensions of, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to both sin and duty; and in <hi>ceasing to do
evil, and learning to do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others again deceive themselves in taking
a partial Reformation for true Repentance: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have left some sins which they
could best spare, as blemishing their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or impairing their Estates, or their
Health: And because they have done many
things (which yet <hi>Herod</hi> also did, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.)
they think they have repented, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
though they retain others which are
more gainful, or yield them more pleasure.
Whereas the sincerity of Repentance can be
proved by nothing less then a hatred of, and
turning from sin as sin, and so from all sin, by
diligent and careful endeavours.</p>
               <p>3. They deceive themselves by a false Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Obedience which is necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
They believe in the gross indeed, that
Obedience to the Commands of God, to the
Rules and Precepts of the Gospel, is necessary
to Salvation, because the Scripture so plainly
declareth it to be so: But then they deceive
their own hearts, in thinking and perswading
themselves that they have performed this part
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55859:103"/>
of the Condition of the Promise, when as they
have not performed one half of it. They
have, been it may be, somewhat careful to be
found in acts of External Worship and and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
both publick and private; and to keep
themselves from Idolatry, Swearing, Cursing,
Sabbath-breaking, Murder, Adultery, Stealing,
False-witness-bearing, and the like, in the
outward and gross acts of them. But all the
while have made no conscience of governing
their Thoughts, Affections, and Passions, nor
their Tongues neither as to many things. And
in all this, wherein do they exceed the <hi>Pbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi>
whom if we exceed not in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Christ hath told us (who best knows)
that we shall never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nter into the Kingdom of
Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 20. They were strict and
zealous in the observation of the Laws for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
Sacrifice, Sabbaths, Tythes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
positive Precepts, and that to a tittle;
and fasted often, and made long Prayers, and
gave Alms; and made Ostentation also that
they were not as others were; Extortioners,
Unjust, Adulterers, nor as the <hi>Publicans.</hi> And
why would not all this bring them to Heaven?
Because all this notwithstanding (as they had
not Faith in Christ, so) they were Covetous,
Proud, and Ambitious, seeking Honour one of
another, contemning, and despising others,
they were envious, and malicious, cruel, and
ill-natured, unmerciful, and persecuting such
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55859:103"/>
as faithfully reproved them. They made clean
the outside of the Cup and Platter; and so far
as they did so, they did well: But that for
which Christ denounced wo to them, was
that their <hi>inward part was ful of ravening and
wickedness,</hi> and for want of love to God, and of
Judgment, Mercy, and Fidelity.</p>
               <p>God is a Spirit, and the Service that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him, as being most agreeable to his
Nature, is that which is done <hi>in Spirit and
Truth.</hi> And therefore his Preceps are given
to govern the inward Man as well as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>He that said thou shalt not kill, hath said
also, <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart,
nor be angry with him without a cause, or bear a
grudge against him.</hi> He that said, <hi>Thou shalt
not commit adultery,</hi> hath said also, <hi>Thou shalt
not lust after a Woman in thy heart.</hi> And he
that said, <hi>Thou shalt not steal,</hi> hath said also,
<hi>Thou shalt not covet,</hi> and the like. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that think themselves to be obedient
Children to God, upon account of their
abstaining from outward gross sin, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
outwardly righteous, and do not truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
and make a business of it to mortifie
and subdue their Pride, Covetousness, love of
the World, Envy, Hatred, Malice, thoughts
of Revenge, the unruliness of Passions, and all
immoderate Affections; but indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in these, or any of these, or the like, they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55859:104"/>
deceive themselves, whatever their External
Conformity to Divine Precepts otherwise may
be. They are <hi>the pure in heart that shall see
God. And they that are Christs, have crucified the
flesh with the affections and lusts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God observes more what Men are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than what they are outwardly, and judges
of them accordingly. <hi>He is not a Iew,</hi> nor he
a Christian, <hi>who is one outwardly, in the flesh,
but he who is so inwardly in heart, whose praise
is not of Men, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 28, 29. And
therefore St. <hi>Iames</hi> counted them but <hi>Earthly,
Sensual, and Devilish,</hi> in their profession of
Christianity, how high soever they professed,
and such as did <hi>lye against the Truth,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
<hi>bitter envying and strife,</hi> though it were
but <hi>in their hearts,</hi> Jam. 3. 14, 15. And if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

soever such a man may otherwise seem to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or others, yet St. <hi>Iames</hi> hath plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
his case; such an one hath <hi>deceived
his own heart, and his Religion is vain,</hi> Jam. 1.
26. Mat. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>Men may go a great way in Religion, yea
so far as until they <hi>are not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</hi> Yea, <hi>many shall seek to enter</hi> in
by doing many things in order thereto, and
yet <hi>shall not be able</hi> for want of <hi>striving</hi> to do
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55859:104"/>
all that is necessary thereto. And for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reason, and because of the great danger of
Christians falling short, though they have gone
far, and done much, are they so earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to <hi>work out,</hi> or to <hi>work through</hi> their
own Salvation with fear and trembling; with
a fear of falling short, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. And not
only so, but to <hi>fear</hi> even a <hi>seeming</hi> to come
short of the promised rest, <hi>Heb. 4. 1. Let us
therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into his rest, any of you should seem to come
short of it.</hi> The matter is of that huge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that every wise Man that doth not
<hi>despise his own Soul,</hi> should be afraid to do, or
omit to do, any thing that hath but the least
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eeming</hi> shew or appearance of putting his
Salvation into any hazard. And therefore [all]
<hi>diligence</hi> is not too much for the wisest Man
living to use, to <hi>make his calling and election
sure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10.</p>
               <p>Thus when Mens Understandings are bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by their corrupt Wills, they then take up
with a partial Faith, a partial Repentance, and
a partial Obedience, instead of that which
is Evangelically compleat, and hope it is a
fulfilling of the Condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p>And when Men shut their own Eyes, and
stop their own Ears against the evidence of the
word of Salvation, that they may the more
quietly enjoy the pleasures of any sin, God
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55859:105"/>
many times in his righteous Judgment, after
much striving, and long-suffering, withdraws
the assistances of his Grace and Spirit, and
leaves them to themselves, and their own delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and to be practised upon by the Devil
for their farther hardening; according to that
dreadful Prophesie, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. mentioned
no less than five or six times in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>Mat. 13. 14. Mar. 4. 12. Luke 8. 10. Ioh.
12. 40. Acts 28. 26. Rom. 11. 8. Go tell this
people, hear ye indeed, but understand not, and
see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart
of this people fat, and make their Ears heavy,
and shut their Eyes, &amp;c.</hi> When Men will not
receive the love of the Truth that they might
be saved, but have pleasure in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
God sometimes <hi>sends them strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to believe a lye,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 10, 11, 12.
Whereas on the contrary, the good ground-hearers
are described by the <hi>honesty</hi> of the heart
into which they receive the Word: They
study no tricks or shifts, nor use any shuffling
upon the account of any dishonest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
to evade the plain Truth, but are content
that should take place, and all other things
give place to it: They <hi>suffer</hi> that Word
which was received and assented to in the
Judgment before, in order of Nature, <hi>to sink
down into their hearts,</hi> by which the Will and
Affections become changed.</p>

               <head>IV. How, and afer what manner Faith in
the Vnderstanding, works savingly
upon the Will.</head>
               <p>The Faith of <hi>Assent</hi> in the Understanding,
worketh a <hi>Consent</hi> in the Will unto the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Promise, by its operative and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
influence upon the passions of Hope, Fear,
and Love, the powerful Principles of Action
in Man. For though Faith in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
is the first Principle of Action as
Christian, yet not that, but the Will, as it is
affected with Hope, Fear, or Love, is the
next and immediate Principle of Action. The
Understanding when it rightly performs its
Office, doth not only assent unto the Truth
of Divine Revelation, upon competent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that it is from God; but also consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and weighs, as in a ballance, the import
of it, and how a man is concerned in it; as
whether it betoken good or evil to him, and
how much, and upon what terms, whether
absolutely, or conditionally, and what the
Condition is: All which when brought down
to the subordinate Faculties of the Soul, the
Will, and Affections, is apt to affect them,
and work upon them more or less, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the things believed are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
more or lesse to concern a Man.</p>
               <p>And the things believed, Eternal Life,
and Eternal Death in another World, being
invisible and absent things, it is a mans Faith,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55859:106"/>
touching the reality of them, that supplies the
room or absence of sense. <hi>For Faith is the
substance of things hoped for, and the evidence
of things not seen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. We neither see
nor feel the glorious things promised, nor
the dreadful things threatned in another
World, otherwise than by Faith, which gives
the Believer a prospect of them. But a man
by his Faith in that Gospel by which they are
revealed, hath a foresight of them (as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had of Christs day) and that fills the
Soul with hope, and fear, and a sence of God's
love in giving such an hope. And this hope, fear,
&amp; love, puts Men upon, more or less, care, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and industry in doing what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the obtaining of the one, and efcaping
the other, as they are more or less influenced
by a Faith that is weaker or stronger, or more
or less active and exercised about these things.
And hence comes that change which is made
in the Hearts and Lives of true Believers, who
<hi>walk by Faith, and not by Sight,</hi> that is, they
govern their Lives by the belief of invisible,
and not sensible things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. This in
general. But more particularly, the Faith of
<hi>Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt</hi> in the Understanding, works the Faith
of <hi>Consent</hi> in the Will, by its operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those three Passions, or Affections of the
Will, Hope, Fear, and Love.</p>
               <p>1. As a firm asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting to the Truth of God's
Promise through Christ, of pardon of Sin, and
Eternal Life upon Condition of Repentance
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55859:106"/>
and new Obedience, together with his Faith,
gives a man hope and confidence of obtaining
these great benefits upon the terms on which
they were promised.</p>
               <p>The hope of this happiness causeth a Man
to be willing to comply with the Condition
upon which it is promised, in order to the
obtaining the happiness it self.</p>
               <p>There is a Principle of self love planted by
God in the nature of every Man, by which he
doth naturally desire and aspire after the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of his own being. And that will put
a man upon the use of such means, and the
performance of such a Condition, without
which he believes, and is verily perswaded he
cannot be happy. Now every Man in whom
there is the Faith of assent unto the Truth of
God's Testimony in the Gospel firmly fixed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
verily perswaded that everlasting happiness
is not attainable without Repentance, Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and sincere Obedience, because God
hath declared this as plainly as he hath done
any thing: (And it is the nature of Faith to
acquiesce in his Testimony.) The love of
the end, which is Mans own happiness, makes
him in love with the means, such as is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
Mortifying, and Obeying work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which he cannot attain his end in being
happy. This Principle of Self-love under the
conduct of a Mans Understanding and Reason
enlightned, and regulated by a Declaration of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55859:107"/>
the Divine Will, and influenced by a firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of it, will work in a Man new apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of, and new Affections to both Sin and
Duty; and will cause him to abandon the
little <hi>pleasures of sin which are but for a season,</hi>
that he may come to the fruition of that <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of joy, and those Rivers of pleasure, which
are in the presence of God, and at his right hand
for evermore;</hi> when once he knows, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believes that they cannot otherwise be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>Thus by Faith is the <hi>victory over the world</hi>
obtained, in all its temptations from Honours,
Profits, and Pleasures, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 4. For by such
a Faith a Man well perceives that the World
offers him to his unspeakable loss, though it
should offer him all of these that it is able to
confer upon him, if it be upon condition of
doing, or omitting to do that by which he
shall certainly deprive himself of that <hi>Glory,
Honour, and Immortality,</hi> which he is well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of through Faith in God's Promise, if
he <hi>overcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We see Men are so commonly governed by
a Principle of Self-love, in parting with a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
good or conveniency for a greater, even
in the things of this life, that they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. 2.</p>
               <p>2. The Faith of Assent in the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
worketh a Consent in the Will to the
Condition of the Promise, as the passion of
fear is awakened by believing God's threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
against such as do not observe and fulfil
that Condition. There is a Principle of self-preservation
planted by God in every Man's
nature, by which he fears and abhors that
which he knows, and verily believes tends to
the infelicity and misery of his being, and
which puts him upon the avoiding of that
which he believes hath such a tendency, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the declyning the misery, or destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it self.</p>
               <p>When a Man receives such sayings into his
Understanding, as threaten, that <hi>if ye live
after the flesh ye shall dye;</hi> that <hi>except ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
ye shall all perish: That without holiness,
no Man shall see the Lord,</hi> and the like; and
doth assent unto them as the true sayings of
God, which assent is his Faith; the fear of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55859:108"/>
the misery threatned, and the Principle of self-preservation,
work in him a desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to have his sinful inclinations and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
mortified, and a care to avoid the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts of sin, as really and truly as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to escape Eternal Destruction it self; as
believing and knowing they tend thereto, and
that he cannot escape the one, without a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
desire and endeavour to destroy and avoid
the other.</p>
               <p>And in this way Faith is a Believers <hi>Victory,
by which he also overcomes the World,</hi> when it
tempts him to sin by threatning him with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
loss of Estate or Liberty, or with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
of corporal punishment, or death it
self. For he believes the punishments in the
other world to be of such a nature and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that the worst things which Man can
inflict, are altogether inconsiderable in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of them. By which belief he is so far
guided, that he chuses to suffer the less, when
his faithfulness to God, and his own best inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
doth expose him to it, rather than to expose
himself by unfaithfulnes to infinitely the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to avoid the less. And thus Faith puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the heart of all inordinate affection to
Riches, Honour, Ease, and Pleasures, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 9.</p>
               <p>3. The Faith of Assent or Credence in the
Understanding touching the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God's love to mankind in the gift of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55859:108"/>
Christ for their Redemption, and in his great
and precious Promises made in him upon a
very gracious Condition, works in the Will
a love to God, and so a love to please him, in
doing those things which he hath made the
Condition of his Promise. When once the
Understanding represents it to the Will, as a
certain Truth upon clear evidence, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
Mens Apostacy from God, and
Rebellion against him, and the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they are under thereby; yet God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
to them, yea, willing, and so desirous
to reconcile them to himself; that as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and proof of it, he hath given his own
Son Christ Jesus to become <hi>a Rans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that he hath made a new Covenant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
that upon account of his Son's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
for them, he is not only abundantly
willing to pardon all such as shall unfeig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

repent of their disloyalty, and sincerely return
to their duty; but that he will also bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reward their future sincere Obedience
with perfect and perpetual happiness: I say,
when all this is represented to the Will, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
true, it will work in it a love
to that God and Saviour, that hath been so
loving, if it be but kept close to it. A mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of such love and goodness to Man,
and that while yet in enmity against God, so
ill deserving, and so obnoxious to <hi>the power
of his wrath;</hi> when he hath no need of him,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55859:109"/>
nor can be profited by him, will create
good thoughts of God, and reconcile Man's
mind to him, and work melting affections
in him to God, when heartily believed.</p>
               <p>What Rebel is there, or Nature so bad, that
would not be won to leave off rebelling against
his Priuce, and to love and please him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
undoubted assurance, that by so doing he
should not only be pardoned, and restored to
favour, but also preferred to the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and happiness he is capable of receiving
from any mortal? And yet how weak a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is this in comparison of what comes from
God, to reduce men to their love and loyalty
to him? God's love to Man when perceived,
and heartily believed, is the great motive, and
attractive of Mans love to God. <hi>We love him,
because he first loved us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 19. Love is an
active and commanding Principle in Man, and
procureth Thoughts, Cares, and Endeavours
of pleasing God. <hi>If any Man love me, he will
keep my words,</hi> saith our blessed Saviour, <hi>Iob.</hi>

               <head>V. Some few Objections answered.</head>
               <p>1. Some have thought Men may be justified
only by their believing, even while they are
ungodly in their lives; and have thought that
Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. will bear them out in
such a conceit, which saith, <hi>He that worketh
not, but believeth on him that justifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
his Faith is counted for Righteousness.</hi>
But they grosly mistake the Scripture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves. For that Text speaks of
God's justifying the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
conversion to the Christian Faith and
Life, though they had lived in <hi>Gentilism,</hi> in
all ungodliness before, and until then, and
though they should not work at all, as the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizers
would have had them, in turning
<hi>Proselytes</hi> to the Jewish way. But otherwise
it's flatly against the express Doctrine of
the Gospel, and current of the Scriptures, for
Men to hope to be pardoned by any believing
whatsoever, while they remain impenitent;
as every Man doth while he remains ungodly.
<hi>To justifie the wicked is an abomination to the
Lord.</hi> It's said that Christ made the blind to
see, the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak,
as well as it's said God justifieth the ungodly.
But is any man so senseless as to think that
Christ made them to see, to hear, and to
speak, while they remained blind, deaf, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55859:110"/>
dumb? And if not, but that they know the
meaning is, that Christ made those to see, to
hear, to speak, which had been blind, deaf,
and dumb, before those Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s were wrought
upon them; they might as well know also that
the meaning is, that God justifieth those up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their believing, which had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
until then, and not that he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
them while they remain ungodly.</p>
               <p>2. Some alledge that although the Faith
which is alone, and with the concomitant
effects of it, Repentance, Regeneration, &amp;c.
doth not justifie; yet that Faith <hi>alone</hi> which
doth produce such effects, doth justifie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the concurrence of these in the justifying
act. Which they illustrate by this Similitude. A
Man sees with his Eye alone, though he doth
not see with his Eye that is alone, or separated
from his body. In return to all which, let
these things be considered.</p>
               <p>1. They that go thus far, do grant that which
will secure the Notion of the necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
Regeneration, and new Obedience
unto Justification. They grant we see such a
necessity of these, as without which no man
can be justified, no not by Faith. In grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, though we suppose them to err in
their foresaid Notion, yet this makes their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
the less dangerous; because the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Repentance, Regeneration, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
are no less necessary to Justification ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this account, than they esteem them
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55859:110"/>
to be, who say they concur with Faith in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act of Justification.</p>
               <p>2. When they say Faith, alone is all that is
necessary to the justifying act, without the
concurrence of any thing else done by us: By
justifying Act, they mean either God's Act, or
Man's Act. If Man's Act, that's nothing but
Man's performing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Condition upon which
God hath Promised to justifie Men. If they
mean God's Act, it is his imputing Mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Condition of the Promise unto
them for Righteousness. The only thing then in
question will be, what it is which is a fulfilling
of the Condition of the Promise of Justification,
which God imputes for righteousness? If they
say it is only the Assent of the Understanding
unto the Truth of Gods Testimony in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
or this Assent, together with a relyance on
Christ for Salvation: I have shewed before,
that both these may be found in Men unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
and unjustified: And that these two
of themselves without Repentance and hearty
Obedience to the Laws of Christ, are not a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the Condition of the Promise, and
that consequently Men without these cannot
be justified by any Faith whatsoever, and so
not by Faith alone; unless they will call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Heart-Obedience in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the foresaid Assent of the mind and
relyance of the Soul, by the name of Faith:
Which if they will, we are agreed as to the
thing at least, if not to the name, that we are
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55859:111"/>
justified by such a Faith alone. And yet I doubt
not that when ever Justification is promised
to believing singly and alone exprest, but
that there the foresaid effects are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under that name also, for the Reasons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
given.</p>
               <p>3. They which say, we are justified by Faith
alone, but not by that Faith which is alone,
do distinguish where the Scripture doth not
distinguish: The Scripture no where saith
we are justified by Faith alone, as contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from Repentance, Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp;c. The third Chaper of <hi>Rom.</hi> 28. and
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. are sometimes made use of to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
their Notion, but to how little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
hath been shewed already in the
Treatise, which needs not be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
               <p>4. The Scripture is not only silent in the
case, not any where affirming we are justified
by Faith alone; but it expresly affirms the
quite contrary. <hi>Iam. 2. 24. Ye see then how that
by Works a Man is justified, and not by Faith
only.</hi> That this is affirmed in reference to our
Justification before God, hath been shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>5. Faith and Repentance are a joynt Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon which Justification is suspended,
and are both constituted so by the same means,
and that is by promise of pardon to such as do
believe, to such as do repent, and by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the contrary to those that do not both.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55859:111"/>
And if they are a joynt Condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Justification, then Justification proceeds
not upon either of them alone, but upon both
together.</p>
               <p>6. Whereas it is said in the Similitude, that
a man sees with his Eye alone, though not
with his Eye which is alone, or when it is
alone. I doubt this is no more true than that
which is intended to be illustrated by it. For
Naturalists will tell them the contrary, that it
is not the Eye alone by which a Man sees, but
that it is the Soul that sees by the Eye as its
Organ. The Eye sees not when the Soul is
departed, though it be not then alone. I confess I
cannot possibly conceive either how the Soul
should not concur with the Eye in the act of
seeing, when the Eye cannot see without it,
nor yet that Repentance should not concur
with Faith in the act of Justification, so long
as men cannot be justified by Faith it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, or in the absence of it, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
grant.</p>
               <p>3. This lyes in the way of some; they
cannot conceive how Justification by Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Obedience as well as Faith, should consist
with the possibility of somes being justified by
believing, who yet may not live so long after,
as to have an oppertunity of doing good
Works.</p>
               <p>How rare Instances of this kind are, I shall
not dispute: But doubtless, when ever men so
<pb facs="tcp:55859:112"/>
believe Gods Promise of pardon through Christ
upon their Repentance, and the necessity of
their own Repentance for the obtaining of it,
as that they in Will, and a fixed and lasting
Resolution become new men, then they first
believe unto Justification. And it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but that some may so believe, that
may never after they do so, have opportunity
to be much active in External Acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
But though this should so fall out, yet
such are not justified without Evangelical O<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bedience
as wel as Faith. For,</p>
               <p>1. These Motions and Acts of the Will,
are themselves Acts of present Evangelical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>2. They are in the Root and Cause, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience future, and to come.</p>
               <p>I. They are in themselves Acts of present
Evangelical Obedience. For by these Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Acts of the Will, Men do when ever
they take place, turn from sin to God and
their Duty, out of hatred to that they
turn from, and out of love to that they turn
to. And these Acts of the Will which consist
in affection and resolution, are proper effects
and fruits of Faith in the Understanding, and
Acts of Heart-Obedience in the sight of God,
and a conformity of Soul to his declared Will
and Commandment. And they may as well,
and as truly be called Works, as evil Acts of
the Will may, such as are a love to evil, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55859:112"/>
desires and resolutions of perpetrating it:
Which evil Acts of the Will, are yet in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
called Works, and a working of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Psal. 58. 2. Ye work wickedness in your
hearts,</hi> Micah 2. 1. <hi>He that looketh upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to lust after her, hath committed adultery
with her already in his heart,</hi> Matth. 5. 28. And
<hi>envy, wrath, and hatred,</hi> which are Internal Acts
of the Soul, are called Works of the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi>
5. 19, 20, 21. And if such inward fixed reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
in Men, of obeying God in External
Acts, if ever they have opportunity and a Call
to it, did not pass in God's account for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and were not accepted in stead of the
Deed, when opportunity for the Deed is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the best Man in the World could be no
Disciple of Christ, who doth not actually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all that he hath, and lay down his life
for him. <hi>Whosoever of you forsaketh not all
that he hath, cannot be my Disciple,</hi> saith he
Luke 14. 26, 33. Whereas Christ pronounceth
the poor in spirit blessed, many of whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
became actually poor for his sake, as not
being called to it. But if they are poor in
Spirit, if they firmly resolve to become poor in
forsaking all for Christs sake, when called to it,
these are capable of blessedness in Christ's
account, as well as those that suffer the
loss of all for Righteousness sake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>II. Those Acts of the Will, are in the Root
and Cause, Evangelical Obedience future, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55859:113"/>
to come: Because those resolutions against
evil for good, when they are of a fixed and
lasting nature (as they alwayes are, when
together with Faith, they make men capable
of Justification) will certainly produce Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Acts of sincere Obedience, as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
doth occur.</p>
               <p>When the Tree is made good, it will bring
forth good Fruit in the season of Fruit, if it be
not cut down before: When the heart is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in affection and resolution, the course
of a Mans Life will certainly be answerable to
it, if ever he have opportunity of shewing it.
<hi>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart,
bringeth forth good things,</hi> Mat. 12. 35. And
God who knows the heart, doth judge of, and
estimate men according to what they are in the
inward frame of their heart, and prevalent
bent of their Wills. <hi>If there be first a willing
mind, it is accepted according to that a man
hath, and not according to that he hath
not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. We judge of the Cause by
the Effects; of the goodness of mens hearts
by the goodness of their lives; to us the
Tree is known by its Fruit: But God who
is greater than our hearts, and knows them
better than we do, judges of the effect by
the Cause, and knows what a Mans Life
will be by what his heart is upon its first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to him; and so confers on him the
benefit of Justification, when the Foundation
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55859:113"/>
of a good Life is laid in the conversion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of the heart.</p>
               <p>The Understanding of this Part of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
will serve not only to satisfie the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
doubt, but also to inform us what Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Obedience is necessary to Justification
in its beginning. Not but that actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in Life is necessary to the continuance
of Justification where Life is continued. And
therefore we find that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified
by his after-believing, and after-obedience, as
well as by his first; and so was <hi>Noah</hi> before
him. <hi>Noah</hi> was a righteous Man, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
before <hi>he became heir of the Righteousness
which is by Faith,</hi> by his believing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God in preparing the Ark, <hi>Gen. 6. 9. Heb.</hi>
11. 7. It was by Faith in God's Promise that
<hi>Abraham</hi> left his Countrey to obey God at the
first, and by that he was first justified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8.
And yet his believing God's Promise, <hi>so shall
thy Seed be,</hi> which was not made till some
years after, was imputed to him also for
righteousness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. It was many years
after that again, that by Faith he offered his
son <hi>Isaac</hi> upon the Altar, and yet by that he
was justified as well as by his first Faith and
obedience, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 21. pardon of sin, is our
Justification from sin, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39. And this
we are directed by the Lords Prayer, to pray
for daily all our dayes. And the continuance
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55859:114"/>
of Justification is promised upon Condition of
continuance of Faith and Obedience to the
Gospel, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. and a discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it threatned in case of disobedience,
according to the Tenour of the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. from <hi>ver.</hi> 23. to <hi>ver.</hi> 35. By all which we
may see what need there is for all Christians to
work out, to work through their own
Salvation with fear and trembling, to which
they are earnestly exhorted, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. and
<hi>to run so that they may obtain,</hi> 1 Cor 9. 24.</p>
               <p>4. Some to evil affect their own and others
minds; with prejudice against Discourses of
this nature do suggest, That the laying so
great a stress upon Duty, as to esteem any
thing of it necessary to Justification, save be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
only, doth derogate from the Glory
of Christ's great Undertaking in the business
of Mans Salvation; and that it is a trusting
in our own Righteousness. But it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
far otherwise, if they will but imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
consider in what sence, and upon what
account such stress is laid upon Duty; which I
shall open in two particulars.</p>
               <p>1. They that rightly understand themselves
in this matter, do not look that any of their
Duties of what nature soever, should of
themselves as such, be available to their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55859:114"/>
or Salvation; but that it is for the
sake of Christ, and upon account of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
for us, that God accepts, and
imputes for Righteousness to us, such Duty
as Faith, Repentance, and Obedience is, and
that he doth make promise of Justification up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Condition of these.</p>
               <p>Since the fall we say, all our Duties that are
acceptable to God, or available to us, become
so through Christ, and for his sake. And
therefore so long as we Attribute and Ascribe
the benefit we expect upon our Repentance,
and sincere Obedience or Belief, unto Christ,
and to his great and worthy undertaking for
us; we are far from derogating from the
Glory of it, and from trusting in our own
Righteousness in that Notion in which mens
trusting in their own Righteousness, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in Scripture, or any otherwise than
as our Duty is made a Condition, without
which we shall have no part in Christ, nor be
qualified for glory.</p>
               <p>2. When we lay such stress upon Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
Obedience, &amp;c. as a condition, or part
of a Condition of the Promise of Justification
and Salvation, as without which we say, we
cannot be justified or saved by Christ's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
for us, yet then this stress is laid, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the Will and appointment of God,
by which these Duties are thus made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55859:115"/>
and not on the intrinsick worth or
value of the Duties themselves simply consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
without reference to God's Ordination,
appointing them to that use. For if God had
not made a new Covenant, promising pardon
for Christ's sake to such as do repent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
and reward to such as sincerely obey
him, they would have had no sufficient ground
to have been confident of Pardon, Acceptance,
or Reward, though they should have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so obeyed. And the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Men are not justified in the Eye of the
Natural or Moral Law, upon any such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
as that is. So that all the stress which
is laid on Duty by them that rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their Duty in this matter, doth termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
partly in Christ's undertaking for them,
and partly in God's Institution and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who hath made his Promise of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us for Christ's sake so, as that he hath
made our Duty of Repentance, and sincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
a necessary Condition of it. And he
that trusteth to be pardoned, accepted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for Christ's sake upon his repentance,
and sincere Obedience, because God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that he shall; trusteth in God, and in
the fidelity of his Word and Promise. And
in doing so, what more stress doth he lay
upon Duty in this kind, than they that trust
to be justified and saved upon their believing?
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55859:115"/>
For their believing is matter of Duty, as wel
as their Repenting and Obeying: And their
believing would no more have entitled them
to the benefit without the Promise which
gives them that title, than other Acts of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would do. And other Acts of Duty do
entitle to the same benefits as fully as Faith it
self doth, where there is promise of the same
benefits annexed to them, as Faith hath: And
that they have, I have shewed before. So long
then as the stress which is laid on Duty, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
in Christ, and in God's Will and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
in the new Covenant, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by his Word and Promise, there is no
danger of overcharging Duty.</p>
               <p>It's true indeed, if we should expect that
Duty should do that for us, which is proper
only to Christ, as to expiate our sin, or the
like; we should sinfully overcharge it, as
the Pharisaical <hi>Iews</hi> did their Sacrifices,
and other Legal Observances, in expecting
remission of Sin by them without Christ's
Atonement: Which Righteousness of theirs
is for that cause called their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which was by the Law, as being
no method of Justification of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
but of their own devising, which
in that respect was indeed <hi>but as filthy
Rags,</hi> and loathsome to God. But this is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55859:116"/>
not the case with Protestant Christians, who
lay no such stress upon Duty, no not upon
Faith it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf; but do acknowledge that all
the power and virtue it hath to justifie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
wholly upon, and is derived from the
Will and Ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Repentance, and sincere Obedience also.
And a confidence of being saved in a way
of Duty upon such terms, is represented in
Scipture, as trusting in the <hi>Righteousness of

Natural or Moral Law, upon any such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

is laid on Duty by them that rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their Duty in this matter, doth termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
partly in Christ's undertaking for them,

who hath made his Promise of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us for Christ's sake so, as that he hath
made our Duty of Repentance, and sincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
a necessary Condition of it. And he
that trusteth to be pardoned, accepted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for Christ's sake upon his repentance,
and sincere Obedience, because God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that he shall; trusteth in God, and in
the fidelity of his Word and Promise. And
in doing so, what more stress doth he lay
upon Duty in this kind, than they that trust
to be justified and saved upon their believing?

pointment in the new Covenant, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by his Word and Promise, there is no
danger of overcharging Duty.</p>
               <p>It's true indeed, if we should expect that
Duty should do that for us, which is proper
only to Christ, as to expiate our sin, or the
like; we should sinfully overcharge it, as
the Pharisaical <hi>Iews</hi> did their Sacrifices,
and other Legal Observances, in expecting
remission of Sin by them without Christ's
Atonement: Which Righteousness of theirs
is for that cause called their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which was by the Law, as being
no method of Justification of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
but of their own devising, which
in that respect was indeed <hi>but as filthy
Rags,</hi> and loathsome to God. But this is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55859:117"/>
not the case with Protestant Christians, who
lay no such stress upon Duty, no not upon
Faith it self; but do acknowledge that all
the power and virtue it hath to justifie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
wholly upon, and is derived from the
Will and Ordination of God in Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
6. 40. &amp; 1. 12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8. And we say the same
of Repentance, and sincere Obedience also.
And a confidence of being saved in a way
of Duty upon such terms, is represented in
Scripture, as trusting in the <hi>Righteousness of
God through Faith,</hi> in opposition to ones
trusting in his own Righteousness, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 9. so far is it from trusting in our own
Righteousness, or from derogating from Christ
in the Glory of his undertaking for us.</p>
               <p>And now for a Conclusion: It would be
considered whether such as are educated in
Christianity, are not hardlier brought to live
as becomes the Gospel in point of practice,
than to believe that Christ Jesus came into
the World to save Sinners; and that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them, and rose again: And whether
there is not cause to fear that very many more
such do eternally miscarry through neglect of
the former, than for want of the latter: And
if there be, as doubtless there is; Then pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
discourses among such must needs be
highly necessary, however some of weak
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55859:117"/>
minds, thirst more after Discourses Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
upon account of believing only. Which
May serve instead of an Apology for writing
