            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat thou mayest with better acceptance pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse my <hi>Exposition</hi> of this Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,<note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> I thought fit to say something by way of Preface: First, concerning the <hi>Book it self,</hi> not only the <hi>Authentickness</hi> and <hi>Intelligibleness,</hi> but also concerning the <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> thereof: Secondly, concerning the <hi>grounds</hi> I go upon, and the <hi>Truth</hi> of my <hi>Exposition:</hi> And thirdly and lastly, concerning the great <hi>Usefulness</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>That this Book is <hi>Canonical</hi> and of <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi> is confirmed by the Authority and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of the Church Universal, both <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Reformed:</hi> And though it had no external Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the truth of Predictions in that large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of things that it reacheth to, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of that Spirit that breaths in it, to any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:98585:3"/>
               <hi>Reader</hi> will certainly prove it to be a Book Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspired. Not to add, that the very <hi>Wit,</hi> as I may so say, and <hi>Artifice</hi> in it seems not to be <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> but <hi>Angelical.</hi> It was indeed doubted of at first, and the Authority thereof called into question; but the occasion of questioning it was, because it was in the hands of very few, it being dangerous for the Christians to let this Book of the Apocalypse (that does plainly predict, as it might seem, the burning of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> situated on seven Hills, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Rule then over the whole Earth) so freely to go about as those others of the New Testament did. And therefore this Book being so generally unknown, when they began to determine what Books were Authentick and what not, they might very well be at a loss con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Besides that, <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and others o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch <hi>Judaizing</hi> Christians who drew those things written of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Resurrection,</hi> and the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> and the thousand years Reign of Christ, to their Carnal Iudaical conceits, made them more shie how they admitted this Book for Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. Nay some, as <hi>Gaius</hi> an ancient Author in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> relate that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Chiliast was the writer of it. Others, who yet thought well of the Book, that <hi>John</hi> the Presbyter, a Disciple of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, not <hi>John</hi> himself was the Author thereof. The occasion of which might be, as <hi>Grotius</hi> ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:98585:3"/>
conjectures, because that <hi>John</hi> the Presbyter had the Book in his custody, whence some out of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake might deem him the Author thereof. But by the Authority of the chiefest Fathers, and upon a more narrow search and examination of the business, it is now out of question with all Christian Churches, that this Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is Authentick and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and writ by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangelist</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> so called for his more plainly and peculiarly declaring the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ beyond any other of the Evangelists.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Intelligibleness</hi> of the Book.<note n="II" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibleness of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse.</hi>
               </note> Though there is a marvellous artifice of <hi>Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in it, yet there is as sure an artifice of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealment,</hi> as I hope will appear by this our <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</hi> And why Prophecies should be obscurely writ, and in what this obscurity consists, I have sufficiently <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Synops. Prophet. Book 1. chap. 2.</hi>
               </note> elsewhere declared. The chief obscurity is in the Prophetick stile, which when it is opened to a Man, the sense will run clear. As he that understands any other Language different from the Vulgar, if the Book it is writ in be good sense, he without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will find it out. And as it would be absurd in him that understands not that language to complain of the obscurity of the Book, so it is as childish for him that will not take the pains, (which is not much) to understand the Prophetick stile, to complain of the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:98585:4"/>
obscurity of the Apocalypse. But that it is <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi> all sorts of Christians <hi>Reformed</hi> and <hi>Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> have given their suffrage thereto, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Commentaries upon it: And it is no less than blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against the Holy Ghost that inspired this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, to say it is simply unintelligible, as if Christ trifled with his Church in a thing so exceeding seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as this Book of Prophecies seems to be.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="III" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Book of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse.</hi>
               </note>The <hi>Excellency</hi> whereof is notably set out, if not also the necessity of reading and understanding it, <hi>chap. 1. vers. 3. Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this Prophecy, and keep those things that are written therein</hi>; which they cannot do unless they understand them. And so, <hi>chap. 22. vers. 7. Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the Prophecy of this Book</hi>: Which is chiefly performed by Faith and Constancy to the True Church of Christ against either the <hi>Dragon</hi> or <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which he cannot do if these Prophecies were unintelligible: nor can there any blessedness accrue to a man from reading a Book he understands not: But the sayings thereof understood and kept being so effectual a way to blessedness, it must needs argue the excellency of the Book.</p>
            <p>But there is yet a further illustration of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency thereof from what occurrs, <hi>chap. 5. vers. 2.</hi> which concerns the greatest part by far of this Book,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:98585:4"/>
and that which some phansie the only Prophetical part thereof, namely the Visions of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> and of the <hi>Opened Book.</hi> For what was contained in the <hi>Opened Book</hi> lay open by virtue of the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Seals. In that Chapter is the highest Encomium of this Book of Prophecies that the <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> of men or Angels can <hi>invent</hi> or <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> For first it is said, <hi>vers. 2. And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the Book and to loose the Seals thereof? And no man in Heaven nor in Earth, neither under the Earth was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon.</hi> This therefore must be a most excellent and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent Book of Secrets and Predictions that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels, Men, nor Infernal Spirits can reach to the knowledge of by virtue of their own faculties. And then it follows, <hi>And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the Book and to look thereon.</hi> Which further argues that it is a Book not only of rare secrets and vast comprehensive Predictions, but more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary desirable, if not necessary to be known. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> that is, Christ, the Lamb under another expression and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was found worthy, and had taken the Book, what acclamations in Heaven were there thereupon? For
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:98585:5"/>
               <hi>the four Beasts, and four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of the Saints. And they sung a new Song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the Book and open the Seals thereof, for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.</hi> As if this priviledge of obtaining such a wonderful power of predicting things to come, and communicating such a Book as this of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse unto his Church, were one special fruit of his Passion, and the shedding his most precious blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="IV" place="margin">
                  <hi>The peril of slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse, and the study of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it.</hi>
               </note>And therefore let them take heed that despise this Book of the Apocalypse so much, and all endeavours to understand it aright, that they be not found in the number of them that tread under-foot the Son of God, even in those things for which he is the most highly admired and extolled by the blessed Saints and Angels (which is the greatest slight and affront of him ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable) and count his precious blood shed upon the Cross (whereby he procured this transcendent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to himself and them, of fore-knowing things that concern all Ages of his Church) an unholy thing, and do despite to the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, this may at least excuse them that seriously and soberly endeavour rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:98585:5"/>
the Visions of this Book from being reputed men less judicious, or else very unfortunate to spend their time and labour on so mean and obscure an argument as this Book of the Apocalypse; as some for want of judgement or good will have perstringed that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently learned and pious person <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Joseph Mede</hi>: But what a vast difference is there betwixt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the holy Evangelist <hi>John</hi> and the great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or Wits, as they would be accounted, of this Age! He wept out of an eager desire of understanding the Prophecies of this Book, they laugh at any one for a fool that pretends the endeavouring to understand them, or thinks they are to be understood. But I hope that will be found true that <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Prov. chap. 14. vers. 6. A scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not, but knowledge is easie to him that understandeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which I distrust not but will be made good in any intelligent Reader of my <hi>Exposition</hi> of this Book.<note n="V" place="margin">

               </note> It will prove easie to him upon his taking notice of the meaning of the Prophetick stile, and supposing the grounds I go upon, which are but few, and allowed generally by all Protestant Churches that I know of, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> which will imply, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church also was so, as is plain from the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which the Romanists alledge. That the said Church is <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous,</hi>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:98585:6"/>
as having put to death many and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of innocent Souls, because their consciences would not allow them to joyn with this Church in their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worship.

As changing the Elements, as they call it, of <hi>Bread</hi> into real <hi>Flesh,</hi> and of <hi>Wine</hi> into real <hi>Blood,</hi> by saying certain words over it: In exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising or enchanting of Statues, or Images, and of Water, Oyl, and other things, by certain words, into a power of keeping off Enemies, repelling Diseases, ceasing Thunder and Lightening, and driving away the Devil; nay, in pretending to a Power of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-striking men down into hell, which is only in the hand of God Almighty, to do at his pleasure, and not for men to do at their pleasures, because others will not joyn with them in their gross Doctrines, and Idolatrous Worship. This if it were true were a stupendious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle indeed, thus to bring fire from heaven to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-strike innocent men into the pit of hell. But such pretended feats as these this Book elegantly expresses by the phrase of <hi>Sorcery</hi> or <hi>Magick,</hi> as it may be called, as being an imitation of the pretences of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians thus to act above Nature, by words and charms. These are the main things that are supposed concerning the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which if they be
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:98585:6"/>
admitted the sense of the Apocalypse will run as glib as may be upon a little knowledge of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick stile: And I shall wonder at any one that is satisfied concerning these, that shall stick at the truth of our Interpretation; which as touching this part is so throughly demonstrated in my <hi>Joynt-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> or rather in the eight last Chapters of the first Book of my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what can be more fully evidenced to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a man; namely, That <hi>the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> is the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the Woman that rides him, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, after the times of the <hi>seventh King,</hi> that was to stay but a little while, which are the <hi>pure Christian Caesars:</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy after that time being set out by the symbol of a <hi>Whore,</hi> for so that Woman is called, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Beast she rides on, said to be full of <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> it is manifest, that both the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy</hi> are become Idolatrous. Besides that, if the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse were silent in this matter of their being Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, the Writers of the Protestants have over and over again demonstrated them to be so, and for them that are so perswaded, not to acknowledge their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be predicted in the Apocalypse, but to conceit it silent therein, is to envy God and Christ the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:98585:7"/>
of foretelling things to come, and the Church the priviledge of having them foretold her, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of confounding her enemies thereby.</p>
            <p>And now for the state of the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> that it will be at last so well Reformed, and so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amplified, that Peace, Truth and Righteousness shall at last over-spread as it were the face of the earth, and that herewith the Iews will be called, and make one part of the Catholick Church, this is a thing both believed and hoped for by all good men, and expresly pointed at in several places of Scripture, as well as in the Apocalypse. And lastly, for the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> the proper priviledge of the Martyrs at the entrance of the Millennial Reign of Christ upon <hi>Earth,</hi> that this was the general O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> is made out nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> J. Mede</hi> in sundry places of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: And that way that I have explained it here in my <hi>Exposition,</hi> it cannot have the least scandal or offence, the Martyrs according to my <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not living upon <hi>Earth,</hi> but being revivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Glorious Bodies, reign with Christ in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the things that I suppose being so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or unexceptionable, and my <hi>Exposition</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential to these, and perpetually made out accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known meaning of the <hi>Prophetick</hi> stile,
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:98585:7"/>
and agreeably to the truth of History, without any violence done to either Grammatical <hi>Criticisme,</hi> or the Rules of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and observable Genius of the very stile of this Book of the Apocalypse it self, if such an <hi>Exposition</hi> for so far as the time of Prophecies is already past, be not true, what <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> of any Prophecy, or of any thing else can be thought to be true? And the things that are to come, as the Calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the utter breaking in pieces of the <hi>Roman Idolatrous Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> sore against their will, considering the sweet <hi>relish</hi> of <hi>domineering</hi> and imposing upon the world, and their obdurate pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it were a Miracle indeed, to think they will ever confesse themselves convinced of those enormous Errours and Crimes that are so justly laid to their charge: And being they would fall of themselves did not some Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power support them, it therefore is rational to conceive that some Remnant of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire may stick to them to the last Vial: So solid is our <hi>Exposition</hi> in that part also. And concerning the Calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> I have noted already how generally the Opinion is allowed of, and how often intimated in the Scriptures. To which I may add, that it does not seem probable, that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a distinct People from the rest of the world all this time for nought. And then for the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:98585:8"/>
of Peace, and Truth, and Righteousness in the times of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> so universally over the face of the Earth; It is a thing that has been so little done already, and so fully and repeatedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated by the ancient Prophets, as well as set down so exactly in the Apocalypse, that unless a man will question the Truth of Scripture, he cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to be true. From which considerations I hope it will appear that our <hi>Exposition</hi> of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse is throughout true, and that I have not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called it <hi>Apocalypsis Apocalypseos,</hi> it being a plain and true unveiling of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> or strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it of all those coverings and disguisings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Prophetick stile, and whatever other Artifices of <hi>Concealment,</hi> and laying the sense bare and open to the eyes of all that will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wink that they may not see the Truth.</p>

For though there will be those, and they not a few that will remain obstinate and unconvinced, especially of the <hi>Roman Hierarchy</hi> it self, even until the effusion of the last Vial, yet there may be many particular gleanings, and some larger harvests in the mean time, to which so sound

               <p n="14">14. <hi>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow,</hi> for the greater venerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this High Priests person, and in token he is that Christ that the Prophet calls <hi>Councellour,</hi> the <hi>Mighty God,</hi> the <hi>Everlasting Father:</hi> For these are the symbols of his Wisdom, and Paternal Authority. <hi>And his eyes were as a flame of fire,</hi> to signifie the penetrancy of his Providence, and spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both in himself, and in his Church.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace</hi>; which shews the stability and purity of his wayes in himself, and the constancy of his Church in the furnace of affliction and fiery try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: <hi>And his voice as the sound of many waters</hi>: Which plainly discovers that Christ is here represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in union with his Church; Waters signifying a Multitude in the prophetick stile, as most certainly they do.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>And he had in his right hand seven stars:</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98585:22"/>
The seven stars according to his own Interpretation are the seven Angels of the seven successions of the Church, whom he bears up, sustains, and strengthens throughout all Ages. <hi>And out of his mouth went a hard two-edged sword</hi>; a Symbol of Christ as he is the Living Word of God quick and powerfull, and sharper than any two-edged sword. And denotes also the powerfull Word of the Gospel preached by the Living Members of his Church. <hi>And his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was as the Sun that shineth in his strength.</hi> This is spoke in reference to him as he is called the Sun of Righteousness, or in reference to the Church in the state of the New Jerusalem; of which it is said, <hi>There shall be no night there, and they need no candle, nor the light of the Sun: For the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead,</hi> as being exceedingly afraid that this fight might portend some great evil to the people of God. <hi>And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not, I am the First and the Last:</hi> And though there may be some great Afflictions and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of my Church represented to thee in what thou seest; yet thou must remember, nothing shall come to pass without my Providence, who am the First and the Last, and will carry you through all Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and Deaths, and make you at length more than Conquerours.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the Keys of Hell and of Death</hi>; as if he should say, For I am now alive, though I was my self dead once and crucified, but behold I am alive for Ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98585:23"/>
This is most certainly true of him whom this Vision represents, and that he has the Keys of Hell and Death. And therefore no man need fear to undergo martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for his Cause, who will certainly make him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of a Blessed Immortality, and plunge his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous persecutors into everlasting perdition. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after this encouragement to <hi>Iohn,</hi> he sayes,</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter</hi>; that is, write the things which thou hast seen and known already as being past, and the things that are present, and the things that are to come after, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The affairs of the first succession of the Church, which is the <hi>Ephesine</hi> succession; the affairs of the <hi>present</hi> succession of the Church (in which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Which affairs thus distributed into seven suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, or intervals, are indeed, <hi>the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks:</hi> For, <hi>the seven stars are the Angels of the seven Churches,</hi> that is, the seven successions of Bishops and Pastors that are to shine forth in the brightness and purity of their Life and Doctrine in the seven successions of the Churches: <hi>And the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven</hi> successions of the Apostolick Church, here called seven <hi>Churches.</hi>

                     <hi>the present,</hi> &amp;c. That the affairs of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession were past when <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi> received those Visions in <hi>Patmos</hi> is plain from hence; because he received them about the end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign: But the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession is in the tenth of <hi>Nero,</hi> or not long before: which is about thirty years before <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi> received the Visions in <hi>Patmos.</hi> Besides that the <hi>Ephesine</hi> succession is described amongst other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as not yet being stained with the doctrine and deeds of the <hi>Nicolaitans:</hi> But the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the twelfth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> as you may see in <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> the Epitomizer of <hi>Baronius:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi> succession was to expire before that time. So plain is it that it was past when <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi> was in <hi>Patmos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But hence emerges a difficulty that well may stumble some, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Being the <hi>Ephesine</hi> succession was then past, why should there be an Epistle directed to it, which is as if one should write to the deceased? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That this Book of Prophecies being designed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the State of the Church, or of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in reference to the Church, from the very beginning of the Church (that the Representation might be the more compleat by not leaving out that little Time that was then past) to the end of the world, in that way, I say, it is comprized, whether <hi>Epistolar</hi> or other, it is to be begun and continued throughout: And therefore in the Prophetical Vision of the <hi>Seals;</hi> as the first Seal is rather an History than a Prophecy, though disguised under Prophetick <hi>Iconismes</hi> (For the time of the thing signified there by the Rider of the White Horse (which the whole stream of Interpreters understand of Christ guiding and assisting the Apostles and his Church in the Apostolick times) was in a manner quite expired when <hi>John</hi> wrote the Apocalypse:) So this Epistle to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesine</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98585:24"/>
succession of the Church, is to be conceived an Historical Description of that State of the Church, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an Epistle, though for conformity-sake it is put into this Epistolar disguise.</p>
                  <p>And since it is not so proper to write Epistles to any but those who are in present Being; surely they who are satisfied there is no absurdity in writing in this Episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way to the successions of the Church not yet come, ought to think the using this Epistolar form to a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion already past, the more tolerable.</p>
                  <p>But supposing the Apocalypse a designed Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I hinted above, of the affairs or state of the Church set out by a triple Prophecy, this of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> the second of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> and the last of the <hi>Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book,</hi> and that the Prophecy of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> and of the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> each of them, though in a Prophetick stile, yet in the entrance of the Prophecies represent Things or Times partly past and partly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (neither of which are the proper objects of Prophecy) when <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi> was in <hi>Patmos,</hi> and therefore so far are rather an History than Prophecy, though disguised or adorned with Prophetick Iconismes, and consequently that that little snip of time, the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Interval con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, though an History rather than an Epistle, may as well be set down in an <hi>Epistolar</hi> form, as the other in a <hi>Prophetical:</hi> These things, I say, being considered, the using this form of an Epistle to the <hi>Ephesine</hi> succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that it might keep conformity with the rest (the usefulness of which Epistolar forms I have declared in my <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap. 1. Sect. 6.</hi>
                     </note> Prophetical Exposition of the Seven Churches) is not only tolerable but very fit and commendable.</p>
                  <p>And yet this is not all that I have to say: For being there was a Real Church in <hi>Ephesus</hi> in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi>'s time, which according to the <hi>literal</hi> sense of these Epistles
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98585:25"/>
might be concerned therein, and that there is also a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> use and sense of them, according to which they may be applicable to this or that state of any particular Church of Christ, in any particular Place or Age of the World (so richly usefull is the contrivance of this holy writing for the edification of the Church of Christ, though the main be the Prophetical design, as to the illustration and Confirmation of his Providence over his Church, and that the Vision of the Seven Churches is a Prophecy properly so called, I have by no less than twenty Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in my <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be watchfull:</hi> Keep a guard over thine own heart, and breath after unfeigned charity, which is the bond of perfection, and will prevent all Schisms and Factions, and tye the Members of Reformed Christendom in one heart and one mind to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Temporal and Spiritual, and to one another. <hi>And strengthen the things which remain that are ready to dye.</hi> Revive and corroborate in you the things that remain, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Faith in God, and in the Lord Jesus Christ, and of a blessed Immortality after this life; these you yet profess, though Infidelity and Atheism, with Sensuality and Libertinism have grown much upon you, so that the belief even of these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things are ready to dye also. <hi>For I have not found thy works perfect before God.</hi> For you do not go on towards perfection, nor are ye in a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing state, though ye have not yet reached your due stature approvable before God, which is a sign you are in a state of languishment and vergency towards death.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98585:33"/>3. <hi>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and repent:</hi> Since you profess your selves reformed into a true Apostolick Church, remember what you have heard out of the Apostles writings. How that <hi>I so loved my Church that I gave my self for it, that I might sanctifie it, that I might make it a glorious Church, having neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish.</hi> And let not the vain glosses of any faint-hearted hypocrites deceive or discourage you. Remember also what ye heard of Antichrist, <hi>That man of sin, that exalts himself above all that is called God and worshipped,</hi> and for ever abandon that wicked and Idolatrous Communion. And take heed of that nauseous and detestable ingratitude of not setting a due value of my redeeming you from that worse than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity into the Gospel-liberty: And be not imposed upon by the fine words and subtil sophistry of either known enemies, or perfidious brethren. These and such like things as these taught by my Apostles, and repeated again by the first Reformers, be sure to hold fast, and repent of your slipperiness and remisness, of your easiness and inclinableness again to the flesh-pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the carnal entertainments under that mystical <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at <hi>Rome. If therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thée as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</hi> These things therefore I strictly command thee and charge thee to do, which if thou wilt not carefully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently observe, and have a due watch over thy wayes, I will come on thee of a sudden, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize thee with some terrible judgement for thy gross ingratitude, and thou shalt not know what hour I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98585:33"/>
come upon thee before the storm certainly overtake thee. God make the Reformed Churches sensible of this sad commination, which is foretold them for no other purpose, than that by their timely repentance, and carefull watchfulness they may avoid it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> There be some few excellent persons, and of a true Christian Spirit scattered up and down in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, (though the generality be so bad and imperfect) who have not defiled their Garments, the inward nor outward cloathing of their Soul, nor spotted the decency of their conversation by any scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of the flesh. With these innocent and spotless souls not soiled or stained with the filth of the usual tinctures of the flesh, will I converse by my spirit, whereby they shall be able to walk with me with all innocency and integrity of heart for ever: For they are persons meet and fit for such converse.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>He that overcometh, the same shall be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in white raiment:</hi> They that overcome all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties inward and outward, and persist in purity and true holiness, they shall be cloathed in white ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, they shall be successfull and prosperous in the affairs of my Kingdom, which they endeavour to propagate. <hi>And I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life:</hi> that is, this sort of men shall continue to the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> succession, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the end of the world. And this <hi>Book of Life</hi> to them shall be as the <hi>Crown of Life</hi> to the <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> succession, shall be their security from persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and death. That Church which they introduce into the world, which is the <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98585:34"/>
be brought again under the Subjection, Tyranny and Persecution of any Power whatsoever. <hi>But I will confess his Name before my Father, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Angels.</hi> I will in a special manner recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the good Providence of God, and the watchful Ministry of his holy Angels.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</hi> The Reformed Churches, especially let them take particular notice what the Holy Ghost has here delivered. That Christ who holds the seven Stars in his right hand, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears thus to the Reformed Churches, as he did to the <hi>Ephesine</hi> or first Apostolick Church, is as ready and serious in the renewing, and the reforming of his Church as he was then in setting it on foot first in the world. And he appears, as then walking in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks; (which signifies his helpfull presence to his Church) so here with the succour of his Divine Graces, and Ministry, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his holy Angels: So that nothing is wanting to rouse us effectually out of this carnal drousiness toward the attainment of the dispensation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Power, except our own sincerity and diligent attention to, and firm belief of the Oracles of God: So that the main success of things hitherto, as to the effect of Religion in the Reformed Churches, lies at our own doors: God give us grace to consider it.</p>

               <p>HItherto reaches the first part of this <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> which has this peculiar and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the other two that follow, That as they run altogether upon <hi>real</hi> Symbols or Iconismes, Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations or Images of what is foretold taken from <hi>Things</hi>; this first part did most what run upon <hi>Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> or <hi>Paranomastical</hi> Iconismes or Images, consisting in allusion to <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Names</hi> that signified the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of things foretold, as was obvious to observe in the explication of that first part of this Book. The second part now begins, and that as high, and reaches as far as the first, that is, it reaches from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Christian Church to the end of the world. And it is to be observed, that as this former part, the so far extended <hi>Prophecy of the Churches,</hi> was ushered in by a voice like a Trumpet, and the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of Christ in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks; so here in this <hi>sealed Book-Prophecy</hi> here is again the voice like a Trumpet, and Christ again represented in a glorious manner, to shew the parity of these two Prophecies, and that they are of the like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98585:39"/>
concern and extent: Which will appear more plain in the Interpretation, after the <hi>Introduction</hi> in this <hi>Sealed Book-Prophecy,</hi> which takes up the fourth and fifth Chapters, is explained.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>After this I looked and behold a door was opened in Heaven.</hi> After this <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> was past, and I come to my self again, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occasion to look upwards; behold a door seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be opened in Heaven: <hi>And the first voice which I heard, was as if it were of a Trumpet talking with me.</hi> And lo! the first voice which I heard before the Vision of the Seven Churches, as of a Trumpet talking with me, <hi>saying, Come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I will shew thee the things which must be hereafter</hi>; that is, the Representations or Prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of those future things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And immediately I was in the spirit,</hi> which is a sign he was again come to himself before. <hi>And behold a Throne was set in Heaven, and one sat on the Throne.</hi> Being thus caught up in Spirit, in this Ecstasie I presently saw a Throne set in Heaven, and one sitting on that Throne with great Majesty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And he that sat was to look upon like a Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper and a Sardine Stone:</hi> A <hi>Iasper</hi> and <hi>Sardine</hi> Stone, the one famous for the firmness thereof, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting the strength, or rather the Omnipotency of the Divinity; the other for the red, fiery colour of it, denoting the piercing activity of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: or the colour of <hi>Fire</hi> is here made choice of, as being the root of <hi>Light,</hi> to show, that he that sits here on the Throne is God the Father: Which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to that appearance of <hi>Fire</hi> in him that sits on the Throne in <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s Vision, to whom the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow belongs: Which is there God the Father, with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98585:40"/>
which this Vision has no small affinity, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, because the Rainbow is seen also here about the Throne in sight like an Emerald, that imitates the most pleasing colour of the Rainbow or Halo, as it follows in the Text: <hi>And there was a Rainbow round about the Throne in sight much like unto an Emerald.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And round about the Throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty Elders sitting cloathed in white rayment, and they had on their heads Crowns of Gold.</hi> Here it also varies from that Vision of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> as being framed for a Type of the future State of the Church, when the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> descends from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Tabernacle of God is with men: And therefore the four and twenty Elders are here said to sit round about the Throne, as the Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were pitched next the Tabernacle: But in that they wear Crowns as well as white Rayment, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the sanctity of the Kings in that State of the Church which this Type points at, those renewed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Times in the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Jews will add the Heads of their twelve Tribes to the number of the twelve Apostles, which these twenty four Elders or Princes of Nations may answer to. And in that there is no one besides God and the Lamb here that appears to be Supream over them; it signifies, that in those Times the Popes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses will vanish, and that Kings and Princes then of the Christian Profession will know themselves, and be acknowledged by all to be in all Causes as well Ecclesiastical as Civil within their own Dominions next and immediately under Christ Supream Heads and Governours.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98585:40"/>5. <hi>And out of the Throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings, and voices: and there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Lamps of fire burning before the Throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</hi> There is also mention of Lamps, and Fire, and Lightning, though no Thundring in the Vision of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> which is the Representation of the <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi> of Christ, which is here again typified, but as a State to come of the Church here on Earth. And the seven Lamps of Fire are, either * all the ministring Angels, or all the living and quickening Graces of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal.</hi> This is not found neither in the Vision of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> but is an Emblem also of the <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi> of Christ, it being the pure laver of Regeneration, the being baptized with the Holy Ghost and with Fire, which the seven Lamps also betoken. And in that it is called a sea of glass, it may signifie the pure transparent condition of the Church, which is a multitude [as Sea signifies] the fixed purity thereof being ever penetrated by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the seven Lamps of Fire, which are the seven Spirits of God. <hi>And * in the midst of the Throne, and round about the Throne were four Beasts full of eyes before and behind.</hi> These four Beasts full of eyes before and behind have plainly a resemblance of the four Beasts in <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s Vision, but may here more particularly relate to the four Camps of <hi>Israel,</hi> which was a Type of the <hi>New Israel</hi> of God: But in that they are said to be full of eyes before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, it implies, they look backward and forward into the Histories of Times past, and unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and Predictions of things to come, for the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98585:41"/>
better managing the Affairs of Christs Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And the first Beast was like a Lion,</hi> which was the Standard of <hi>Iuda,</hi> on the <hi>East side</hi> of the Camp. <hi>The second Beast like a Calf,</hi> which was the Standard of <hi>Ephraim</hi> on the <hi>West side</hi> of the Camp. <hi>The third Beast had the face of a man,</hi> which was the Standard of <hi>Reuben</hi> on the <hi>South side. And the fourth Beast was like a flying Eagele,</hi> which was the Standard of <hi>Dan</hi> on the <hi>North.</hi> And note that these four Beasts were thus situated in the Vision of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> And that this only is a Type of that Church that shall be, cast thus into four parts, the <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi> of Christ signified in both Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And the four Beasts had each of them six wings about him,</hi>

Had each of them six wings. <hi>And they were full of eyes without and within: And they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which was, and is, and is to come.</hi> Now that the four Beasts are said each of them to have six wings, as the Beasts in <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s Vision also have, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly they have them for that use the <hi>Seraphims</hi> are said to make of them in the Prophet <hi>Esay;</hi>

                  <hi>With twain to cover their faces, with twain to cover their feet, and with twain to fly:</hi> Which implies a Reverence of the Divine Majesty, an activity and readiness in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and a carefulness over our Affections, that we walk in clean paths. And whereas they are presently said to be full of eyes without and within, it implies, that with one eye regarding outward objects, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98585:41"/>
other their own nature, and so comparing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they will ever behave themselves decorously and becomingly, with due reverence to that which is above them in dignity and excellency, and at a due distance from those things that are unworthy of them and beneath them: And therefore if any such thing be offered them from without as is repugnant to the innate Light and immutable Principles of an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Creature, their eyes within will easily discern the Proposer to be either a Fool or an Impostor. This is the state even of the whole People of God in those dayes: But as for their Reverence and devotional sense of their Maker and Redeemer it is in a manner perpetual, they rest not day and night saying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come:</hi> who fills all things and times with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Providence. And as the People are, so are their Priest-like Princes and Rulers. For it follows immediately in the next Verses:</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And when those Beasts give glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and thanks to him that sat on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>The four and twenty Elders</hi> also, Prince and People being of one heart and mind, <hi>fall down before him that sat on the Throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and tast their Crowns before the Throne,</hi> in humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from whom and for whom they Reign, even for the manifesting of the Glory, and Honour, and Power of God in the Kingdom of his Saints: And therefore they are introduced, <hi>Saying</hi>;</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Honour, and Power, for thou hast Created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were Created.</hi>

And in that they were not only seen, as it were in the middle of the Throne in the sense abovesaid, but on each side also, and so encompassed the Throne pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the common sections or conterminations of the four quadrants of the Circle drawn about it, they are said to be not only in the midst of the Throne but about the Throne in a Circle at equal distances: Or else in the midst, that is, within the Circle of the Throne which is thus conceived to be drawn about it, but so near that the Beasts supposed like those in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> will have the same faces appear within the verges of the Throne that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without, but in opposite places: But then the Elders must be placed in a Circle without the Beasts, which will

make these Priestly Kings, less answer to the Levites. But thereby we are the better assured that they are Kings and not Priests. It's possible both these wayes may be glanced at in the Vision, and that it may reflect both on the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> and Vision of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> at once.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>ANd I saw in the right hand of him that sate on the Throne,</hi> that is, in the hand of God, <hi>a Book written within and on the backside: (viz.)</hi> A Book that had a more outward sense in the meer <hi>Letter</hi> which consists of Representations Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical or Hieroglyphical, of Iconismes or Images of things future; and a more inward sense, which is the sense of the future things themselves thus represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Symbols or Images; This Book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was in the hand of God the Father, in his power to impart it to whom he pleased, as it is intimated in the beginning of the Apocalypse, which is said to be the Revelation of Jesus Christ, but that <hi>God gave</hi> it unto him: <hi>sealed with seven seals:</hi> And in that this Book is said to be sealed with seven seals, it shews what a great Arcanum or Secret it was, it being a Representation of a Scene of Affairs reaching from the beginning of the Church to the end of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the Book, and to loose the Seats thereof?</hi> And that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable worth of this Book of Prophecies, which sottish and prophane Spirits so much slight and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and crafty Politicians so much harden themselves against, may appear, here is proclamation made by a

strong Angel with a loud voice, <hi>Who is worthy to open? &amp;c.</hi> that is, Who is worthy to have so vast a foresight of things communicated to him from God, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite such a Book of Prophecies as this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And no man in Heaven nor in Earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the Earth was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon.</hi> And this proclamation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made there was none found neither of the Angels in Heaven, or Men upon Earth, or Infernal Spirits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth, who are vulgarly accounted so wise and cunning, and in whom Witches and Wizards so confide for the knowledge of things to come, that were able to open the Book or look thereon, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> That had so reaching a foresight as to pierce through such a large series of future things as is contained in this Book, which intimates, that nothing but the holy Power of God could be the Author thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the Book, neither to look thereon:</hi> That is to say, I was sorely grieved that there was none found meet or worthy to have imparted to him so stupendious a faculty of foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things to come, in such a manner as they are in this Book: So useful a gift of Prophecy. Where <hi>Iohn</hi> personates every good Christian that is solicitous for the affairs of the Church, and thoughtfull what will become of her.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And one of the Elders saith to me, wéep not.</hi> Cease to be so grieved and troubled in spirit. <hi>Behold the Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda, the root of David hath prevailed to open the Book, and to loose the seven Seals thereof.</hi> Christ hath by his coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously fulfilling the will of his Father obtained this priviledge, That he may open the Book and loose the

Seals thereof; that is, to have so wonderfull a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of future things, and piercing foresight by the gift of his Father, as to foresee all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Book, and to communicate it to his Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the Throne and of the four Beasts, and in the midst of the Elders</hi>; That is, betwixt God the Father and the Church, <hi>stood a Lamb as it had been slain,</hi> and with bleeding wounds upon him; the blessed Jesus Mediator betwixt God and Man, as he is here placed betwixt the Throne and the four Beasts: <hi>Having seven horns,</hi> which are the Emblems of Power, as being he to whom <hi>All</hi> Power is given in Heaven and in Earth: <hi>And seven Eyes:</hi> All manner of Wisdom and Counsel, and all the Angels of God at his beck to execute his Counsel and his Will; which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in what follows, <hi>which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth unto all the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And he came and took the Book out of the right hand of him that sate upon the Throne:</hi> That is, it was given to him of his Father to have so vast a foresight of things to come, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church even to the end of the World, and Power to effect what was foreknown, according to the beginning of this Book of the Apocalypse, <hi>The Revelation of Iesus Christ which God gave unto him,</hi> &amp;c. which shews, that the whole Book of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, the Epistles to the seven Churches, as well as the Visions that follow, is a Prophetical Revelation of things to come.</p>

Reign of Christ in the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> which Times this pompous Introduction to the Prophecy of the sealed Book does typifie, (For the four and twenty Elders belong to that state of the Church) will raise a wonderful strain of Faith and Devotion in them, and admiration of the stupendious Providence of Christ over his Church, as it is signified by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>And when he had taken the Book, the four Beasts, and four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps and golden Uials full of Odours, which are the praises and prayers of the Saints.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. <hi>And the four Beasts said Amen.</hi> Unto this the four Beasts, that is, the Church of Christ here upon Earth, we may be sure will say Amen, that is, consent to such a doxologie: <hi>And the four and twenty Elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever</hi>; that is, All the Kings and Princes of this truly Catholick and Apostolick Church will fall down and worship him that was dead but is now alive, and behold he liveth for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; that is, they will devotionally adhere to him, serve him and obey him, who according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to his Church, has brought things at last to such an Admirable, Heavenly, Holy, Righteous and Peaceful Constitution: So Glorious an Effect will there be of the completion of the Prophecies of this Book, both as to Christ, and also as to his Church: Which shows how detestable the ingratitude is of such either shallow and frivolous, or prophane Spirits, or cunning obdurate Politicians, that phancying it not to sute with their worldly Interest, vilifie and decry it; when as indeed this Book of Prophecies will prove the most effectual instrument in the hand of Providence that may be, for the rooting all Atheism and Infidelity out of the world, and Converting all

HItherto the <hi>Introduction</hi> to the Prophecies of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> we come now to the Prophecies themselves: <hi>And I saw,</hi> says <hi>Iohn, when the Lamb opened one of the Seals,</hi> that is the first Seal: <hi>And I heard as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four Beasts</hi>; that is, the first of the four Beasts, the <hi>Lion,</hi> whose place is towards the East, <hi>saying, Come and see.</hi> Where we may observe how some parts of the Introductory Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation are made use of in this following Vision, as some parts of the description of him that was seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the golden Candlesticks are made use of in the Prefaces of the Epistles to the Churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And I saw and behold a white Horse, and he that sate on him had a Bow.</hi> Which Heros on horseback, and on a white Horse signifies a great Commander or Emperour, Righteous, Prosperous and Glorious in his undertaking. And in that he is said to appear upon the first Beast (the Lion placed on the East side) his saying, <hi>Come and see,</hi> it is a sign that he is an Emperour from the East part of the World, and in a word, it is the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> that Captain of our Salvation Jesus Christ, who being ascended into Glory was yet present with his Church, affording them all succours to carry on their Spiritual Warfare. And these Gospel-soldiers came from <hi>Iudea</hi> in the <hi>East.</hi> And in that he is said to have a Bow, it denotes, that he aimed at something
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98585:46"/>
of no mean importance. And this Heros on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back with his Bow answers to the <hi>Ephesine</hi> succession of the Church, whose name imports earnest purpose or desire, but the thing aimed at or designed is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the following words: <hi>And a Crown was given unto him</hi>; to wit, the right of it, even the Roman Imperial Crown, and this Bow-man hat the mark when the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> turned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. This is also the <hi>Crown</hi> promised to the Church in the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession: <hi>Be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life</hi>; the Crown of security from Pagan persecution. <hi>And he went forth conquering and to conquer.</hi> This Heros on the white Horse went forth conquering and to conquer till he obtained this Crown under the sixth Seal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And when he had opened the second Seal, I heard the second Beast</hi>; that is, the <hi>Calf</hi> or <hi>Oxe, say, Come and sée.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And there went out another Horse that was red,</hi> a colour significant enough of the effusion of blood, as the Oxe also of the great slaughter, that was to be under this Seal, and what follows, plainly implies so much: <hi>And power was given to him that sate thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that they should kill one another, and there was given to him a great Sword,</hi> as a token of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much blood-shed on the Earth under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Seal. This Seal therefore begins with <hi>Trajan</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and therefore an Emperour from the West. In his Reign, and <hi>Adrian</hi>'s his successor, there were so great commotions in the Empire, that there were slain in those. Tumults and Rebellions at least fifteen hundred thousand men.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:98585:46"/>5. <hi>And when he had opened the third Seal, I heard the third Beast,</hi> that had <hi>a face like a man,</hi> and was placed on the South, <hi>say, Come and see: And I beheld, and lo a black Horse, and he that sate on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</hi> The black colour betokens Gravity, Severity, Justice, which Justice also is intimated by the face of a Man this third Beast is said to have, Prudence and Justice being the proper characters of a Man: Which sutes well with the last part of the description, the pair of Balances in the Riders hand; which argues him Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, Just, Frugal and Provident.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Which accordingly is exprest by that voice in the midst of the four Beasts: <hi>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four Beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the oyl and wine</hi>; that is, the Rider of the black Horse will take special care: 1. That if one <hi>Choenix</hi> of wheat be sold for a penny, that three of barley shall be sold for a penny. 2. That men shall live by their honest labours, not by theft or rapine: For <hi>Choenix</hi> signifies <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the food for a day, and <hi>Denarius</hi> the wages for a days labour. 3. There shall be no stealing nor robbing but buying by measure, though it should prove so hard a time that their dayes labour will but find them food. 4. He will provide that they shall have a <hi>Choenix</hi> for a penny; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the price of bread-corn and necessary victuals shall not exceed a dayes wages. And so of Wine and Oyl, he will take care that there be no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no fraud in buying and selling there neither, nor spoil and wast by unruly Soldiers. Which prediction was egregiously fulfilled in <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> an <hi>African,</hi> and therefore an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98585:47"/>
from the South, and in <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Mammea,</hi> both of them notorious lovers of Justice, and severe punishers of Thieves and Robbers: To the latter the sight of an unjust Judge was so nauseous, that he was ready to vomit at him; and he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for that Christian Motto, <hi>Do as you would be done to: Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</hi> which he caused to be set up in his Palace, and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places. They are both taken notice of for their care and provision in Bread-corn, and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And when he had opened the fourth Seal, I heard the fourth Beast,</hi> that was like a <hi>flying Eagle,</hi> and was placed on the <hi>North, say, Come and sée.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And I looked and behold a pale Horse:</hi> which colour of the Horse is very sutable to the Name of the Rider. For it follows; <hi>And his name that sate on him was Death: And Hell followed him,</hi> that is the Grave, which is made a person here as Death is, and as it were his Lackey to follow him. <hi>And Power was given unto them over the fourth part of the Earth,</hi> that is over almost all the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which upon due compute was then a third part of the Earth; as if this Power reached three fourths of the Empire. <hi>To kill with the Sword, and with Hunger and with Death,</hi> that is, with Famine and Pestilence, <hi>and with the Beasts of the Earth:</hi> Which ordinarily invade the Land in those Eastern and Southern parts in extream Famines and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences to increase the mortality. The beginning of this Seal is from <hi>Maximinus</hi> the <hi>Thracian,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently an Emperour from the <hi>North,</hi> as the place of the flying Eagle denotes, that notable bird of prey, and feeder on dead carcasses, and therefore significant
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98585:47"/>
of the condition of this Seal under which concur so various modes of vast Mortality, the Sword, Famine, Pestilence and wild Beasts. Which Pestilence raging and over-running in a manner the whole Empire for the space of fifteen years, and ending <hi>Anno CCLXIII,</hi> from <hi>Maximinus</hi> to this year is the extent of this Seal. And now for the Sword in the Interval of this Seal, besides that in the Reign of <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Volusianus</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, the whole Empire in a manner was exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with rapine and slaughters by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and consequently Tillage did fail and Famine ensue; there were not two more bloody Beasts in the world than <hi>Maximinus</hi> and <hi>Gallienus,</hi> the former for his cruelty being called <hi>Cyclops, Busiris, Phalaris,</hi> and what not, who without accusers or defence, caused to be killed and spoiled of their goods no less than four thousand men; and the latter his cruelty was such that he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the Male Sex of whole Cities, and made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of slaying three or four thousand of his Soldiers in a day. And there are many more examples of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelty by the Sword under this Seal according to the prediction thereof: So admirably fully was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished what was predicted by these four Seals, of which it is to be noted, that not only parts of the <hi>Introductory</hi> Vision are made use of, namely, the four Beasts which usher in each Seal, (I mean the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions thereof) as parts of the description of him that appeared in the midst of the seven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks in the salutation of each Epistle are again made use of; but as those parts of his description were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the things signified concerning the Church the Epistle was wrote to, so each Beast is sutable to the things predicted in each Seal in these four first Seals; which strengthens the certainty of the <hi>Epistles</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98585:48"/>
being a Prophecy reaching from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World, as well as this of the <hi>Sealed Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I saw under the Altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the Testimony which they held:</hi> that is, he saw them lye at the foot of the Altar as Sacrifices that are slain use to do, slaughtered or martyred for their couragiously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Christianity: For by Faith, and an invincible Firmness of mind, and unspeakable Patience, they had made themselves an Oblation or Sacrifice for the carrying on the Affairs of the Kingdom of Christ. Here is predicted the bloody ten years persecution begun by <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and continued by his successor, which was the most terrible that befell the Church of God. This is the dregs of bitterness in the <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> succession of the Church, where by the <hi>ten days</hi> of Tribulation, this persecution may be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly glanced at, as well as all the Ten Persecutions usually so called.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>And they cryed with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> that is, the Persecution of the Church under this Seal was so exceeding grievous that they called aloud for Divine Vengeance on this persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Empire.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And white Robes were given to every one of them,</hi> and they were adopted into the Society of the Blessed: which white Robes allude to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome under the Jewish Temple. Where after a due search into their Pedigree, and the unblemishedness of their body, by giving them, or putting on them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98585:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a white Vesture they were admitted into the Court of Priests, as these to serve God in Heaven. <hi>And it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, untill their fellow-servants also, and their brethren that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled:</hi> that is, till their fellow-Christians under <hi>Licinius, Iulian,</hi> and under the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> should be slain, after which due vengeance should be taken of the bloody Empire under the time of the Trumpets.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth Seal, and lo! there was a great Earthquake.</hi> The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and may have a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral signification, and denote a concussion, shaking and commotion of the frame of things: which things are here the constitution of the Pagan Hierarchy, as I may so call it, or Gentilism, the Religion of the Roman Empire as Pagan. <hi>And the Sun became black as sack-cloath of hair, and the Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as blood:</hi> that is, they were both eclipsed, both the <hi>Dragon</hi> himself, the Sun, as Head of that Religion, and the Office of their <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> which is next to the Draconick Majesty, and there intimated by the Moon. These plainly suffered an Eclipse, when the Roman Emperours by professing Christianity renounced Satan with all the wicked crew of evil Spirits under him, and would serve him no more, nor exercise the Office of his <hi>Pontifex Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi> as is recorded of <hi>Constantine, Constantius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinianus,</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> and <hi>Gratian</hi> would not so much as retain the name of <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a Fig-trée casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken with a mighty wind:</hi> that is, all the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98585:49"/>
false gods of this Diabolical Polity, the frame of the Pagan Religion, they fell from that Religious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Worship which was given them, and were trampled under-foot by the prevailing Christians, as also their Priests that served them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>And the Heaven departed as a scrowl when it is rolled together:</hi> that is, this Pagan Hierarchy shrivelled up with all the false Deities and Priests therein, as a scrowl of parchment that hides the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters therein contained as it is rolled up. <hi>And every Mountain and Island were removed out of their places:</hi> that is, their high places where they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and their Temples divided from other houses for their supposed sacredness, were demolished at last by <hi>Theodosius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every fréeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains:</hi> that is, all sorts of men from the highest to the lowest were sorely affrighted and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at this terrible storm that came upon the Pagan Hierarchy, nor were able to resist the force thereof, not <hi>Maximianus Galerius,</hi> not <hi>Maxentius,</hi> not <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> with <hi>Martinianus Caesar,</hi> not <hi>Licinius,</hi> nor <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, who all felt the irresistible Power and Wrath of the Lamb; and some of them, <hi>(viz.) Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Maximinus</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> their miserable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even whether they would or no, forced them by open confession to give Glory to God.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</hi> like that of <hi>Esay</hi> 2.20. <hi>And they shall go into the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98585:49"/>
holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for the fear of the Lord, and for the Glory of his Majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the Earth</hi>; as he did in this shaking of the Pagan Religion of the Empire, and abolishing their Idols.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</hi> Not <hi>Galerius,</hi> not <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius,</hi> not <hi>Licinius,</hi> nor <hi>Iulian,</hi> nor the Tyrants <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> and <hi>Argobastus,</hi> with all the Power the Pagan party were able to make, could stand against this storm of the wrath of the Lamb. So that the Church upon the Conversion of <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Faith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the state of the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> succession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted out of the dust: And O that she had not been thereupon exalted so much in her own mind, and become the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> succession in the worst sense, that is, proud and cruel, as well as exalted in Power.</p>

with the <hi>seven Thunders</hi> fill up the whole space of the <hi>seventh Seal:</hi> Which <hi>seven Thunders</hi> are put in the place of the <hi>seventh Trumpet</hi> on purpose, that the six first Trumpets may be noted as a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar space of time, wherein as vengeance was taken on the Roman Empire by the Incursion of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations for the persecution of the Primitive Christians, so in the mean time a kind of Paganochri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism and Antichristian Power sprung up in the Church, and grew to the height: I say, this being the condition of things under the first six Trumpets, the artifice of the following transition from the first six Seals to them is admirable, and of grand conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The <hi>hundred forty four thousand sealed,</hi> and so taken special notice of by Divine Providence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that the true Apostolick Church should be still preserved all this time, notwithstanding all the incursions and devastations of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and all the gross <hi>Apostasie, Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Antichristian cruelty</hi> from a wickedly degenerated Church, against Christs true members, that held to the pure Apostolick faith and practice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>And after these things, (viz.)</hi> after the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the six Seals, <hi>I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth, holding the four winds of the Earth:</hi> that is, He saw the Ministers of Gods Power in making War and Peace, and blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the world, and that at that time they held all in peace as for any Incursions of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> into the <hi>Empire. That the wind should not blow on the Earth, nor on the Sea, nor on any Tree:</hi> should not blow down buildings, nor cause ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks on the sea, nor break off branches of trees, or tear them up by the root.

the children of <hi>Israel</hi> for the Church of Christ, of which the <hi>Israelites</hi> are here a Type, as they are in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> in which <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> Interval this sealing begins: Wherefore brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the hundred forty four thousands, are meant the faithful, constant Apostolick Christians that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not to the Tyranny and Idolatry of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized Church, but were preserved pure and safe by Divine Providence during the sounding of the first six Trumpets, under which notwithstanding the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was broken in pieces, and the Tyranny and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of Antichrist rising, and increasing, and growing to the height.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98585:52"/>
thrust down into this lowest place, and the Tribe of <hi>Ioseph</hi> here put for the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> whose name is here suppressed, because of the foul faults of that Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in <hi>Micha, Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> all <hi>Ephraimites:</hi> And <hi>Benjamin</hi> juniour of all is rightly placed last: But upon the account of the whole we see the ranking and ordering of the names of the Tribes is so fitted as to represent a company zealous for Christ, and as zealous against Antichrist, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that very Virgin Company with the Lamb on <hi>Mount Sion, Chap.</hi> 14.) and against Spiritual Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is Idolatry. This pure Apostolick Church did Christ seal and keep safe even during all that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous time under the sounding of the first six Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>After this I beheld, and lo, a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which no man could number of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb:</hi> Namely, before that Throne above described in Heaven. For <hi>Iohn</hi> is supposed to see all these Visions in Heaven, though they concern things here on Earth: <hi>Clothed in white robes and palms in their hands.</hi> This part of the Vision therefore shoots beyond the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval of the Church, and begins with the <hi>Sardian.</hi> Which enjoyes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to him that overcomes, that he shall have power over the Nations; that is, whole Nations, Tongues and People are now become open professors of the pure Apostolick Faith: this is the effect of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and the sign thereof, the <hi>Palm-branches</hi> in their hands. They are the same with them that have got the victory over the <hi>Beast, his Image and his Mark, and the number of his Name,</hi> and sing the Song of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98585:52"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> and of the Lamb, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. Which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement also of the <hi>Sardian</hi> succession, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Song of Joy.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And it is here said: <hi>And they cryed with a loud voice, saying, Salvation unto our God which sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb:</hi> Namely, because he has thus delivered his <hi>Israel</hi> from the Antichristian bondage and persecution they were under in the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> successions.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And all the Angels stood round about the Throne, and about the Elders and four Beasts, and fell before the Throne with their fates, and worshipped God:</hi> This may seem to strike further into those Ages of the Church that come near to, or are in the Blessed <hi>Millennium,</hi> to those of the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Interval, which are as it were the Succession and Off-spring of the Apostolick Church that held out in the most persecuting times of Antichrist, and are all held as one continued Church, but growing and spreading further. In which <hi>Angelical</hi> Times the consent and harmony of Heaven and Earth will be more full and more perfectly united and accorded: So that it is no wonder it is said that the <hi>Angels</hi> joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Elders and four Beasts did fall before the Throne on their faces and worship God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Saying, Amen. Blessing, and glory, and wisdome, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might:</hi> by which these happy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Times are brought upon Earth; <hi>be unto God for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And one of the Elders answered, saying unto me, What are these that are arayed in white Robes? and whence came they?</hi> that is to say, how come the true Apostolick Church in these dayes that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98585:53"/>
are here foreseen, to be so prosperous, and successfull, and victorious? For to be clothed in white, signifies so in the Prophetick stile.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest: And he said to me, These are they which come out of great tribulation, and have washed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:</hi> that is, these times of the Church that are thus prosperous, as well as holy, it is in vertue of the great tribulation and affliction, their predecessors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured under the cruel and bloody persecutions of Antichrist: So that they have washed their Robes as it were, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb: that is, the sufferings of Christ in his true and living members under Antichrist were the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Cause</hi> of the splendid and prosperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blessed Times that are here prefigured, in or near the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as the blood of the Lamb in the usual sense is justly deemed the <hi>meritorious</hi> cause thereof.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple,</hi> ever thankfully mindfull of the Evil they are delivered from, and the great good they enjoy. In vertue of the former sufferings of the true Apostolick Church under the Antichristian Tyranny, shall the Church in these dayes here described enjoy peaceably their Religion, and make their addresses to God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in safety in his Holy Church, which is his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>And he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them.</hi> For these are the times of <hi>Iehovah Shammah.</hi> Of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>God</hi> amongst <hi>Men,</hi> the times of the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:98585:53"/>16. <hi>They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more:</hi> They shall not be false-fed nor hunger-star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by deceitful Teachers, that cannot impart to them the bread of Life, nor raise the Spirit of Life in them by their Ministry (as being devoid of it themselves) whereby their thirst may be satisfied. <hi>Neither wall any Sun light on them, nor any heat.</hi> There shall no Political Power whatsoever ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over their consciences, and by their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion force them, as was usuall under Antichrist, to a sapless, senseless, heartless, nay grosly Superstitious and Idolatrous Religion against their own judgement and inward sense of things.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>For the Lamb that is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters:</hi> that is, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by his Spirit, and by true Spiritual Guides and Governours, to whom he has communicated his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, shall feed them; that is, guide and govern them, and shall lead them unto Living Fountains of waters, shall conduct them into, and guide them in the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of Life,</hi> the renovation of their inward Man into the Living Image of God. <hi>And God shall wipe all tears from their eyes.</hi> They shall be no more calamitous by the wrongs and persecutions of bloody Tyrants, whether Spiritual or Temporal. For the true Apostolick Church shall then be an impregnable City or Polity of it self, the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> as it is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the 21 <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> This is the sense of this transition from the six first Seals to the opening of the last, and reaches from the beginning of the corrupt part of the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Interval to the end of the <hi>Laodicean.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>ANd when he had opened the seventh Seal, there was silence in Heaven about the space of half an hour.</hi> This is spoken in allusion to the custome in the service of the Temple, where though in the former part of their Service, while the Sacrifices were offered the Temple rang again with their loud Musick, yet in the time of Incense, all were silent and in their tacit devotions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And I saw seven Angels which stood before God, and to them were given seven Trumpets.</hi> This he saw during this silence, or at the beginning thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And another Angel came and stood at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar having a golden Censer, and there was given unto him much Incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of the Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne.</hi> Things thus represented in Heaven prefigure things here on Earth, and these Ceremonies of the Temple, the Devotions of the Christians, whose prayers are here represented as coming up in remembrance before God: Which is expressed in this Judaical way or Ceremony of the Temple by the giving to this Angel as to a Priest much Incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the Throne, answering to the Altar of Incense over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with Gold, that stood before the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And the smoke of the Incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hand:</hi> that is, the desire of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98585:55"/>
the true Church, who are of one mind with God, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up before God, as Incense out of a Priests hand, and was known and accepted with him. Their prayers in all likelihood were in general for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Church, and suppression of both the old and new growing abominations of the Empire.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And to the end that you may know what the will of God was in order hereunto, it is further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>And the Angel took the Censer and filled it with the fire of the Altar, and cast it into the Earth: and there were voices, and thundrings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</hi> Which things betoken the wrath of God to be poured upon the bloody persecuting Roman Empire, against whom the souls of the slain under the Altar had called for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.10. The great tempests and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that should befall it are thus expressed in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and as an effect of the foregoing groans and cryes of his aggrieved people.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And the seven Angels that had the seven Trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</hi> And therefore those Tempests and Calamities will now more particularly be described in the several sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of those Angels that have the seven Trumpets.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>So the first Angel sounded, and there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hail, and fire mingled with blood:</hi> that is, a thundring hail-storm with fire, whereby is signified the furious Invasion of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And the mention of blood seems on purpose to be added, that there may be no mistake, as if this storm was to be upon trees and grass, and not upon men, though it follows: <hi>And they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up:</hi> Which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98585:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the mention of blood shows not to be understood of earth, trees and grass that bleed not, but of the men of the Roman Empire great and small: <hi>Trees</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Great Ones, and the <hi>Grass</hi> the Common People. And that it is understood of the Roman Empire is plainly intimated from hence, that the <hi>third part</hi> is said to be burnt up: Which third part does not signifie the third part of the Roman Empire, but simply the Roman Empire, the Empire being the third part of the known world in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time: So that here, as in other places hereafter, <hi>Third part,</hi> is not to be taken <hi>numerally</hi> or <hi>proportionally</hi> but <hi>symbolically,</hi> * as a character of the Roman Empire. The Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Trumpet began about the year 395, when <hi>Alaricus</hi> invaded the Empire with an infinite number of <hi>Gothes,</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> especially the Eastern part thereof, harassing it for five years together. And in the year 401 the same <hi>Alaricus,</hi> with <hi>Gothes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, Hunnes</hi> broke into <hi>Italy</hi> also, and besieged <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Emperour at <hi>Hasta,</hi> and so terrified the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Italy,</hi> that they were in a manner all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to leave their dwellings: But with much ado, partly by the valour of <hi>Stilico Honorius</hi> his General, partly by the fair treaty of <hi>Honorius,</hi> he was content to recede into <hi>Illyricum,</hi> a Province of the Eastern Empire. But <hi>Alaricus</hi> being quiet for a while, there was <hi>Anno</hi> 404 a notorious irruption of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> to the number of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand under their General <hi>Radagaisus</hi> a <hi>Scythian,</hi> who yet was slain by <hi>Stilico.</hi> And yet there was a third, and that the most grievous irruption of all, <hi>An.</hi> 406 into the west, an innumerous multitude of <hi>Vandals, Alans, Marcomans, Herules, Suedes, Alemans, Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> with which <hi>France, Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:98585:56"/>
and lastly <hi>Africk</hi> were filled and miserably afflicted: So punctually is this prediction of the hail-storm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first Trumpet here fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And the second Angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became blood:</hi> that is to say, a great City, namely, <hi>Rome</hi> it self, (for so Mountain signifies in the Prophetick stile, and Sea the extent of Jurisdiction or Dominion) by its being taken by <hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who after the death of <hi>Stilico, Anno</hi> 410, made a new and more fatal expedition into <hi>Italy:</hi> This case, I say, of this City being taken by <hi>Alaricus</hi> was as if a burning Mountain had been cast into the Sea, the earthiness and fieriness thereof being so contrary and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to water. And so was this condition of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Territories and Jurisdiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Which <hi>Sea</hi> signifies, the number <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Third</hi> being the character of the Roman Empire: For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this taking of the City did presently ensue the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceration or tearing in pieces of the Roman Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into many Kingdoms: So that the entireness of the Roman Dominion was plainly destroyed. Whence the <hi>Sea</hi> is said to become <hi>blood,</hi> that is, to be dead, and to be dead is to cease to be what a thing was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, namely, the <hi>Romanum Imperium,</hi> properly so called, and as to the former sense thereof failing, when it was now divided into so many Kingdoms: Which division <hi>Honorius</hi> was forced to begin by his Covenant which he made with <hi>Alaricus</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining the City of <hi>Rome</hi> again, and the Empire to himself; as he was likewise forced to make such like Covenants with others: and so the Roman Empire was still more and more divided, till about the year
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98585:56"/>
455, when <hi>Rome</hi> was again sacked by <hi>Gensericus</hi> the <hi>Vandal,</hi> or a little after, it was plainly divided into ten Kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And the third part of the Creatures which were in the Sea and had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed:</hi> that is, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man both <hi>Men</hi> and profitable constitutions of <hi>things</hi> were altered, and ceased to be what they were: Which here in Analogie to Sea are intimated to be <hi>Fishes,</hi> they being the living Creatures proper to the Sea, and plainly said to be <hi>Ships.</hi> These now had lost their former propriety, and they are no longer the entire Roman Empire's but each respective King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's to which they belong, to say nothing of the real destruction of many. And this I think is a fair Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the second Trumpets prediction.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>And the third Angel sounded, and there fell a great Star from Heaven burning as it were a Lamp:</hi> As if it were a fair Comet called <hi>Lampadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> which betokens the greatness of the Prince it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, and also the shortness of his Reign. <hi>And it fell upon the third part of the Rivers, and upon the Fountains of waters.</hi> The burning of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the mischief to the Rivers and Fountains it is said to fall into. Which Rivers are Provincial Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates or Armies, and the Fountains of Waters Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Cities. And here is mention again made of the <hi>Third part,</hi> that you may know the prediction belongs to the Roman Empire. And it is no wonder this falling Star or Comet should be looked upon as so mischievous to Rivers and Waters, when Natural History speaks of falling Comets that have drunk up whole Rivers; so decorous is the representation.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98585:57"/>11. <hi>And the name of the Star is called Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; and the third part of the waters became Wormwood, and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter:</hi> that is, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Princes Reign was such, that the Roman Territories were so full of affliction and calamity, that their life was bitter to them, besides the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of many in wars. Now this Prince was the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Caesar,</hi> who from the time that <hi>Gensericus</hi> sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pillaged <hi>Rome,</hi> which was <hi>Anno</hi> 455, strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Death for a while in the succession of those inconsiderable and unfortunate <hi>Caesars, Avitus, Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus, Severus, Anthemius, Olybrius, Glycerius, Nepos,</hi> at last expired in <hi>Augustulus,</hi> into which Name the <hi>Western Caesar</hi> had dwindled, and under which that <hi>Caesareat</hi> was quite extinguished by <hi>Odoacer</hi> King of <hi>Herules,</hi> to the bitter misery of the Fountains and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Cities and Magistrates Provincial. Thus did the third Trumpet sound the sad final fate of the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Caesareat,</hi> under the figure of a great falling Star, called Wormwood; which <hi>Odoacer</hi> cast down and extinguished, and reigned himself King of <hi>Italy</hi> sixteen years, who restored to <hi>Rome</hi> her Consulate which he had taken away before. And King <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doricus</hi> that vanquished him and succeeded him, so rebuilt <hi>Rome,</hi> and restored to it all the Ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracies, Honours and Priviledges belonging to it, that bating the memory of her misery and infamy, she seemed perfectly restored to her former Glory and Felicity; and thus she continued through the Reign of several successors of <hi>Theodoricus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>But the fourth Angel sounded, and the third part of the Sun was smitten, and the third part of the Moon, and the third part of the Stars, so

These Woes are denounced against the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, who by this time, besides the guilt of the blood of the Primitive Martyrs, had in a gross manner lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into a kind of Paganochristian Idolatry, which they would be found in under these following Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and in cruel persecutions of the Apostolick Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church that would not submit to their Idolatrous Paganochristianisme: Wherefore venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance proportionable to their redoubled wickedness shall be poured down upon them under the voices of the Trumpet of the three Angels that are to come.</p>

                     <hi>As a character of the Roman Empire,</hi> &amp;c. That the <hi>third part,</hi> or <hi>subtriple</hi> proportion is a character of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, will appear from <hi>Chap. 12. vers. 4.</hi> where the Dragon with seven Heads and ten Horns, which is undoubtedly the <hi>Roman Empire Pagan,</hi> is said with his taile to have drawn the third part of the Stars of Heaven, and cast them to the Earth: Which in the Prophetick stile is as much as to say, that he had brought down a third part of the Princes or Rulers of the known world in that time, and subjected them to himself; that is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Power had subdued a third part of the Powers and Principalities of the World to her self. For Heaven and Earth are the parts of a <hi>Political</hi> World as well as of a <hi>Natural</hi>: And the Stars of the Political World are the several Princes or Rulers thereof. But when they are subjected to some other great Potentate, then they cease to be <hi>fixed</hi> Stars, but fall to the Earth, that is, to the low estate of subjection, or are
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98585:58"/>
utterly extinct. And in that they are said to be cast down by the <hi>taile</hi> of the Dragon; by his <hi>taile</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his Retinue, his <hi>Train,</hi> Military especially, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Forces whether by Land or by Sea. This is a most assured sense of the Prophetick stile, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the amplitude of the Roman Dominion is hinted by the <hi>third part</hi> of Stars cast down to the Earth by the Dragons Taile, as if it were about the third part of the known world in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi>'s time. And that consequently this <hi>subtriple</hi> proportion is an intended character of the Roman Empire, whereby we may know, that such or such a Vision belongs to it. And thus to give characters from <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Proportions</hi> is according to the <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listical</hi> mode, and the very Genius of this Book which is <hi>Cabbalistical.</hi> And it is absurd to think there should be so repeated a mention of a third part so perpetually of things (as if Divine Providence had a peculiar pique against the third part of things or persons more than any other part, as it may seem in at beast a dozen places in the Apocalypse) were it not there were this mystery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>ANd the filth Angel sounded, and I saw a Star * fallen from Heaven to Earth,</hi> that is, a lapsed Spirit or Angel, a Devil if you will. For as a Star signifies an Angel, so a fallen Star a lapsed Angel. <hi>And to him was given the Key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless pit:</hi> That is, he had great Power in the Kingdom of darkness, of which a Key is a Symbol.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And he opened the bottomless Pit, and there rose a smoke out of the Pit, as the smoke of a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98585:59"/>
great furnace:</hi> That is, there arose a hot and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish zeal conjoyned with dark Ignorance for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posturous Religion of <hi>Mahomet. And the Sun and the Air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the Pit:</hi> That is, the Gospel of the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness was endeavoured to be clouded and eclipsed by the over-running force and false pretenses of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notheisme,</hi> and of a more pure worship in <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And there came out of the smoke Locusts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth:</hi> That is, under this dark, ignorant, and false pretense, the <hi>Saracens</hi> professors of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Religion spread themselves over the Earth. <hi>And unto them was given power as the scorpions of the Earth have power</hi>; to have their sting and poison in their taile; which deadly sting and poison in the <hi>Saracens</hi> was the falseness of their Religion, which they transfused at the end of their conquests. That was the poisonous sting to all conscientious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and to others it was at least poison if not a sting.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the Earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree:</hi> Which here in Analogie stand for several orders of <hi>Men,</hi> as the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs</hi> for the <hi>Saracens. But only those men, that have not the seal of God in their foreheads</hi>; which intimates, that notwithstanding the grassations of these Impostors, the truly Apostolick Church would be kept safe. And there is mention made of Men, to insinuate, that these Locusts were also men, not mere insects: For Locusts do not fall upon Men, but upon Grass and Trees.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And to them it was given that they should
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98585:59"/>
not kill them:</hi> That is, that these <hi>Saracens</hi> should indeed infest the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire sore, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it quite, as after happened by the <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen: <hi>But that they should be tormented five months</hi>; that is, during their time of lying upon it, called here <hi>five months</hi> in allusion to the time of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs who live about that space of time, as <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> relate: But their continuance in vexing <hi>Italy</hi> was not much above five months of years, if that may be particularly glanced at. <hi>And their torment was as the torment of a Scorpion when he stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man: (viz.)</hi> lesser at first, but increasing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: and the stroke being by the Serpentine taile of the Locusts, it shows the poison and sting to be Diabolical, and to cause such vexations of mind as that poison is apt to breed. And as the torment of a Scorpion when he strikes a man is from a white poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son transfused in the stroke, as <hi>Apollodorus</hi> relates in <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. 11. So it is that perversly pretended <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notheisme</hi> of these <hi>Saracens,</hi> that looks so fairly and innocently on it, with which they might perplex and torment the minds of the <hi>unsealed,</hi> and sorely disquiet their consciences, besides the general fear of their lives in them that would not turn <hi>Mahometans,</hi> the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> Wars being carried on upon a Religious account, as is to be noted in their <hi>Alchoran</hi> and <hi>Zuna,</hi> and they great Zelots, and diligent promoters of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being the most Early Professors of it; and as it is signified by their Type, these <hi>Scorpion Locusts,</hi> it being * the nature of the Scorpion perpetually to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to sting and transfuse her poison, as of these <hi>Saracens</hi> to proselyte the world to their Religion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore the fear of death, and horrour of conscience did so vex men, and fill them with anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98585:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it was worse than death it self, to be in such perpetual danger, and unsettledness of things worse than the Christians are now in under the <hi>Turks,</hi> which were a desirable condition to them, rather than these perpetual renewed vexations of the <hi>Saracens</hi>; but this did not fall to their lot in the <hi>Saracens</hi> dayes, though it were the more desirable condition of the two; which may be glanced at in these words: <hi>And in those dayes shall men seek death and shall not find it, and shall desire to dye, and death shall flée from them:</hi> That is, those parts of the Empire shall not be setled in the <hi>Saracens</hi> hands where they Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as afterwards it came to pass in the <hi>Turks</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, who seized on the Eastern part of the Empire, and setled there; so that the Empire there was not only <hi>vexed</hi> but <hi>killed,</hi> extinguished, or put an end to, and the minds of the conquered at quiet.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And the shapes of the Locusts were like unto Horses prepared to battel:</hi> That is, ready harnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as it is said afterwards, that they have Breast-plates of Iron, which shows the courage of these <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> and their well-appointedness for War; and their success was accordingly, as is expressed by what follows: <hi>And on their heads were as it were crowns of Gold.</hi> Which shows their victory over so many Nations and Kingdoms: For in the space of eight years, or a little more, they acquired to that Satanical Kingdom of <hi>Mahomet, Palestine, Syria,</hi> both the <hi>Armenia</hi>'s, all <hi>Asia minor,</hi> in a manner; <hi>Persia, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Aegypt, Numidia,</hi> all <hi>Barbarie</hi> to the River <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Lusitania</hi> and <hi>Hispania</hi>; nor were they stinted here, but won also a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> even to the Gates of <hi>Rome.</hi> To which you may add <hi>Sicily, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Cyprus,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Islands.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98585:60"/>
Wherefore there is great reason that they should be represented with golden Crowns on their heads, they having acquired so many Rich Kingdoms by War. <hi>And their faces were as the faces of men:</hi> The better to assure the Reader that Men indeed are meant and not Infects or mere Locusts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And they had hair as the hair of women,</hi> to show what Countrey-men they were, not for any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy or cowardize in them; namely, that they are derived from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> whose custom it was to wear long hair on their head unshorn, and an head-tire like women. This therefore shows they are <hi>Saracens</hi> from <hi>Arabia</hi>; and in that it is said, <hi>And their téeth were as the téeth of Lions:</hi> that shows, that they were very dispatchfull of their prey, who could devour so many Kingdoms in so little time, as was above noted.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And they had breast-plates, as it were breast-plates of Iron:</hi> That is, they were well armed to fight, and had an Iron courage. <hi>And the sound of their wings was as the sound of Chariots of many horses running to battel.</hi> Here is mention of wings, in allusion to the figure of Locusts, who also make a noise with their wings when they fly; but the sound of Chariots of many horses running to battel, emplyes that they are indeed Men, and great Warriours, that with great swiftness, noise and terrour run down all before them, witness the above-mentioned conquests which were so large and so many.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>And they had tails like unto Scorpions, and there were stings in their tails:</hi> That is, they are of the <hi>Serpentine</hi> kind, of the Ancient Serpent that was alwayes an Enemy to the Son of God and his Kingdom; and it denotes, that with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98585:61"/>
they would bring in a Religion contrary to that of Christ, and destroy the worship of the Son of God under an ignorant pretense of <hi>Monotheisme,</hi> as if the Christian Religion were inconsistent with the worship of one God, whereas the more distinct knowledge of that one God does not make us less <hi>Monotheists</hi> than they. This is the up-shot of their victories, and the very sting and poison their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements end in. <hi>And their power was to hurt men five months:</hi> That is, to hurt and vex the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire particularly, but not quite to destroy it, as the <hi>Turks</hi> did afterwards. Nor is it said here, to hurt the <hi>third part</hi> of Men, as in the former Trumpets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Invasions were not restrained to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but ran over other vast Tracts of the habitable world also. But they are said to hurt men five months, in allusion to the life of Locusts, as I noted above. And if mention be made of five months twice to remind us to double the number; that is another character, whereby we may discern, that the <hi>Saracens</hi> are here meant by these Locusts; twice five months of years, (<hi>viz.</hi>) three hundred years (saving that there is the difference of five single years, which is nothing in the numbering by months of years) being that most notable Interval in the Saracenical Kingdom, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the beginning of the <hi>Caliphate</hi> of the <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidae,</hi> who first made <hi>Bagdad</hi> their Imperial seat, to the taking of the said <hi>Bagdad</hi> by <hi>Togrulbec</hi> King of the <hi>Turks</hi>; that is, from the year of Christ 750, to the year 1055. But otherwise I conceive that five months do not signifie <hi>Arithmetically</hi> but <hi>Symbolically</hi> with an allusion to the time of the Locusts, and only stand for the time that the <hi>Saracens</hi> had to hurt men, not defining how long it was to be.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:98585:61"/>11. <hi>And they had a King over them, which is the Angel of the bottomless Pit.</hi> The same that the fallen Star, to whom was given the Key of the bottomless pit, it being an Ensign of his Power in the Kingdom of darkness, as I noted above. This was the Supreme Captain of these Troops of Locusts, that is <hi>Saracens,</hi> and his name denotes his nature as follows. <hi>Whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon</hi>; both which words signifie a <hi>Destroyer,</hi> which is a fit title, he being a Captain of such nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Troops, that destroyed so many mens bodies by war, and their souls by bringing a false Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him contrary to Christianity, reproaching it, as if it maintained the worship of more Gods than One: Which malicious pretense seems also to be glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at in both the name of <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and also of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollyon; Abaddon</hi> alluding to <hi>Adad,</hi> as if it were <hi>Ab-Addon,</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Apollo,</hi> both which names according to this allusion signifie ONE. As if this Angel of the Abysse and his Locusts stood up for the worship of one God, and that the Christians worshipped many, because they worship the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> which nothing but their ignorance of the Mystery, and their malice could make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to be inconsistent with the Unity of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which passage therefore of the Vision is no small countenance to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of the Godhead.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>One wo is past, and behold there come two woes more hereafter</hi>; namely, under the sounding of the next two Trumpets, which therefore as the former may well be called Wo-Trumpets.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98585:62"/>13. <hi>And the sixth Angel sounded, and I heard voice from the four horns of the golden Altar which is before God.</hi> For <hi>Iohn</hi> rapt thus into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Temple and the Throne of God was as it were continually represented to him, and so the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Altar, which is the Altar of Incense. And In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense is the Symbol of the prayers and breathing of the pure Apostolick Church oppressed and afflicted under that Antichristian or Pseudochristian and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Constitution of things established by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Saying unto the sixth Angel that had the Trumpet, Loose the four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates:</hi> That is, let loose the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the Idolatrous Empire. For that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels signifie Men under their conduct, is a frequent Apocalyptical Figure. And that the <hi>Turks</hi> are here meant is plain from those more notable four * <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> Sultanies or Tetrarchies on that and this side of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that of <hi>Bagdad,</hi> that of <hi>Caesarea Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docie</hi> or <hi>Iconii,</hi> that of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and that of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And the four Angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</hi> Which term of time is another indication, that the <hi>Turks</hi> are meant here. For <hi>Togrulbec</hi> Prince of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the City <hi>Bagdad</hi> being taken by him, had his Imperial Robes put upon him and was inaugurated Emperour of the <hi>Turks</hi> by the <hi>Caliph Chaiim Biamrilla</hi> in the year 1057.

And from this year to the year 1453, when <hi>Constantinople</hi> was taken, and the remainder of the Roman Empire in the East
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98585:62"/>
utterly lost, is a Prophetical day, and a month, and a year; that is, 396 years: So notable an Indication is this, that the <hi>Turks</hi> are here meant; and the sense is this, That these <hi>Turks</hi> were prepared <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a determined appointed time, even to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of 396 years, for to slay the <hi>third part</hi> of men, that is, that about that time they might not vex only as the <hi>Saracens</hi> did, but put an end to the Eastern <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For [<hi>third</hi>] is a character of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as I have already noted. Which accordingly came to pass at the taking of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and swallowing thereupon the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the East.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>And the number of the army of the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were two hundred thousand thousand, and I heard the number of them:</hi> whereby I understood how exceeding numerous they were; which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note of their being <hi>Turks,</hi> it being well known what vast Armies they bring into the field. And this number does not signifie <hi>Arithmetically,</hi> that is, precisely that number, but <hi>figuratively</hi> is put for a vast number in general, and so vast, that it could not be discovered by the eye, so well as signified by speech. And that there is no mention of Foot may be an allusion to their known name in Greek Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who usually call them <hi>Persians,</hi> which name signifies Horsemen: which is another note of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>And thus I saw the Horses in vision, and them that sate on them having breast-plates of fire and Iacinth</hi>; of <hi>Iacinth,</hi> that is, of a blue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; <hi>and of Brimstone,</hi> by reason that when they shot off, the air betwixt them and the sight of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder seemed fiery at the flashing of the powder, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98585:63"/>
then coloured with a blue smoke, and after filled his nostrils with the scent of sulphur; which shows, that this Vision * belongs to the times since the Invention of Gunpowder. <hi>And the heads of the horses were as the heads of Lions</hi>; not for their shapes, but for the roaring noise that seems to come from them at the riders discharging their Carbines or Pistols, as what follows plainly intimates. <hi>And out of their mouths issued fire, smoke and brimstone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>By these three was the third part of men killed</hi>; that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the East was not only <hi>vexed</hi> and annoied, but utterly subdued, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished and <hi>destroyed</hi> by these <hi>Centaures,</hi> as I may so call them, the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are called <hi>Persae</hi> in the Greek Historians from the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="21">21. <hi>Neither repented they of their murthers:</hi> that is, of their murtherous persecution of innocent Souls for not submitting to their Idolatrous Rites and Customs; <hi>nor of their sorceries,</hi> their imposturous exorcismes and enchantments of several things to holy pretended uses; <hi>nor of their fornication,</hi> their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural uncleannesses of all sorts upon an Hypocritical profession of a single life; <hi>nor of their thefts,</hi> their cunning tricks of cheating the people of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, by setting up Images for them to bring Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to, their merchandises of hallowed Crosses, Beads, Medals, and the like trumperies and deceits. For such like wickednesses as these was the wrath of God pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down upon the Eastern part of the Empire, by letting loose the <hi>Euphratean Horsemen</hi> upon them, so as to quite over-run them and vanquish them; and yet the Western Church, the more the pity, did not lay it at all to heart, while those Judgments were thundring against the Eastern, and these <hi>Euphratean Horsemen</hi> were let loose upon them. Which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little before the year 1300, after the <hi>Caliphate</hi> of <hi>Bagdad,</hi> with which the first Wo expired, had in the year 1258 been abolished by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and the Remainder of the <hi>Turks</hi> who had Reigned in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>

on the other side of <hi>Euphrates</hi> were cast out, as out of a sling into the parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire on this side <hi>Euphrates</hi> by the said <hi>Tartars</hi>; namely, in the year 1289, who winning <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Palestine,</hi> and dividing amongst themselves the greater part of <hi>Asia minor,</hi> at last joyning in one <hi>Othoman</hi> Empire broke also into <hi>Europe,</hi> nor ceased till they took <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and quite abolished the <hi>Constantinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Empire, and made themselves fully Masters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>But as for the close of this second Wo-trumpet, the most natural extent I discern thereof, is the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Impenitency of the <hi>Western</hi> parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, till some Country or Kingdom appeared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from such Crimes as the Eastern Empire was destroyed for by these <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen. And so we shall clearly observe with what succession of the Churches this sixth Trumpet, or second Wo-Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet expires; namely, it ends with the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. The six Trumpets added to the six Seals reach just so far and no further.

               <p>THe <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen having over-run and destroyed, and fully seized on the Eastern part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, natural method will prompt us to expect that what follows in this Prophecy of the sealed Book, should refer to the Western parts of the Empire, and concern the highest Dominion there, to wit, the Bloody, Idolatrous, Papal Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, that Antichrist that exalts himself above all that is called God or worshipped; the Prophet <hi>Balaam</hi> Lord of the People, and who had made the Secular Power a <hi>Balak,</hi> an empty cypher or an <hi>Ahab,</hi> that is wholly guided or directed by the Prophetess <hi>Ieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi> So that this Papal Hierarchy in the West, being in reality the Highest Power by Usurpation; and the Antichrist exalting himself against Christ, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him; we may rationally expect, that the last Wo-trumpet which contains the residue of the <hi>Sealed-Book</hi>-Prophecy, carries in it such things or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as tend to the downfall of Antichrist, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and enlarging the Kingdom of Christ in these parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and over the whole Earth. And therefore accordingly it is said:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>And I saw another mighty Angel come down from Heaven,</hi> one distinct from the seven Trumpet-Angels, <hi>cloathed with a cloud</hi>; that is, clouds and darkness were round about him, a thick cloud char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with thunder. <hi>And a Rain-bow was on his head</hi>; which betokens he came in the Glory of the Divinity, even in the Glory of God the Father, for the Rainbow in the Vision of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> so signifies. And therefore this mighty and victorious Angel must
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98585:66"/>
be Christ; and a further intimation hereof is from what follows; <hi>And his face was as it were the Sun:</hi> For so he appeared to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he cryed out to him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me</hi>; and such was his description when he appeared in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. <hi>And his feet as Pillars of fire,</hi> as it were coming out of the cloud and reaching to the Earth; which are tokens of the great wrath of the Son of God, or Christ, and his coming to judge and take vengeance of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: His feet was as fine Brass in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, here they are like a Pillar of fire.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>And he had in his hand a little book open</hi>; which contains all the Visions of the Prophecy of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> as we at first noted: <hi>And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth,</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Majestick manner, and laying claim to, or seizing himself, as it were, on his right by Sea and Land: See <hi>ch.</hi> 12.9. <hi>ch.</hi> 13.11.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>And cryed with a loud voice, as when a Lion roareth:</hi> which is another intimation, that it is Christ the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> And who in this majestick posture, and terrible roaring could so well be said to set himself against <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or the Papal Hierarchy as <hi>Christ?</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire Eastern and Western too was sorely vext and scourged by the <hi>Scorpio-Locusts</hi> the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and Eastern quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed after by those <hi>Euphratean Centaures</hi> the <hi>Turks:</hi> But the Papal Empire or Hierarchy here in the West, Christ himself with his Apostolical Legions of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christians will utterly demolish and destroy, as it is elsewhere said of the Ten Horns or Kings, that at last they shall <hi>hate the Whore, make her desolate, eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</hi> This loud roaring
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98585:67"/>
therefore of this Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> sets off, in general, the anger and victorious terrour of Christ in assaulting and overcoming the Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, or the Papal Hierarchy, and glorious Erection of his own Kingdom. These in general are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this last space of the <hi>Sealed-Book</hi>-Prophecy. <hi>And</hi> whereas it is said, <hi>when he cryed,</hi> or while he cryed, <hi>seven thunders uttered their voices</hi>; This is a distribution of the aforesaid space into seven parts, which will be very serviceable for the orderly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Visions of the <hi>Opened-Book</hi>-Prophecy. These seven Thunders may be seven <hi>Bath-Cols,</hi> that is, seven Oracles or Voices delivered in the midst of a Thunder; and the last Thunder, which betokens the turning of the Earth into a Lake of Fire by thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Lightning might happily send out some such voice as this: <hi>Go ye accursed into everlasting fire.</hi> This is the doom of them that adhere to the bloody, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posturous and Idolatrous Papal Hierarchy.</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write,</hi> namely what they said: <hi>And I heard a voice from Heaven, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto me, Seal up those things that the seven thunders uttered</hi>; with an allusion to this <hi>Sealed Book</hi> of Prophecies, as if he should say, Though the seventh Seal be opened, yet as to this part thereof, let it be as sealed again, for it is needless here so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to declare things touching the destruction of the Papal Hierarchy: which agrees very well with what follows, according to the reading of the <hi>Biblia Regia, Andreas</hi> and others. <hi>And thou shalt write them hereafter</hi> (not, <hi>And write them not</hi>) namely in the <hi>Opened-Book-Prophecies,</hi> where these affairs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Antichrist, and of the advancement of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98585:67"/>
Christs Kingdom shall be more fully and particularly delivered; which is a marvellous manner of transiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Sealed-Book-Prophecy</hi> to the <hi>Opened-Book-Prophecy,</hi> and sutable to the usual majestickness of this Book of the Apocalypse.</item>
                     <item>5. <hi>And the Angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as using that usual Ceremony of posture in swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</item>
                     <item>6. <hi>And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven and the things that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are, and the earth and the things that therein are, and the sea and the things that are therein.</hi> This is a mighty and vehement asseveration, but it is concerning a thing that sunk flesh and blood are too too incredulous of, which makes Christ in his Epistle to the Church of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his coming to judgment, and his putting an end to the Scene of things here on Earth, use as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement asseveration as might be, by calling himself the <hi>Amen, the faithful and true Witness, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation of God</hi>; and therefore he who could also put an end to it. And so here, there is the like vehement asseveration, that the stage of the Earth must have an end at the last Thunder, which will bring upon it the Conflagration. For so he saith, <hi>That there should be time no longer,</hi> that is, That there shall be here no more time upon Earth.</item>
                     <item>7. <hi>Saving in the dayes of the voice of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Angel when he shall sound, and the mystery of God be finished, as he has declared to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets:</hi> that is, Those predictions be fulfilled which in such a mystical and symbolical stile God hath foretold by his Prophets <hi>Isaiah, Daniel</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98585:68"/>
                        <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and others, which reach to the very end of the world, or of the stage of things on this Earth. And this is the first part of this marvellous <hi>Transition</hi> from the Prophecy of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> to that of the <hi>Opened Book.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>8. <hi>And the voice which I heard from Heaven,</hi> namely, at the beginning of the <hi>Sealed-Book</hi>-Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>spake unto me again</hi> in the tone of a Trumpet, suppose as it did before: <hi>And said, Go and take the little Book which is open in the hand of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, which standeth upon the Sea and upon the Earth:</hi> Namely, in the hand of Christ, now in the form of an Angel, as before in the form of a Lamb, but the same person still under another form, as it is the same Book, though opened now when sealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But this new change in both denotes a new se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Prophecies from the beginning of the Church to the end of the world, as those of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> were.</item>
                     <item>9. <hi>And I went unto the Angel and said unto him, Give me the little Book: And he said unto me, Take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey:</hi> that is, Though the knowledge of future things may be pleasant and tempting to the curious Reader of this Book, yet when he shall throughly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest it or understand it, it will be bitter by reason of the several sad and bitter things contained in it. As the sad persecution of the Primitive Christians in the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession of the Church, and the foul A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie of the Church into gross Idolatry under the Reign of Antichrist, or the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the most barbarous persecutions of them that will not submit to her wicked and Idolatrous Tyranny. And
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98585:68"/>
there is bitterness enough for her too at the last, which makes her paramours so loth to understand this Book of Prophecies aright.</item>
                     <item>10. <hi>And I took the little Book out of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter:</hi> that is, my stomach was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which is a prefiguration of the condition of those that shall read this Book and rightly digest it, that is truly understand it: Though there be pleasure in the understanding it, yet when these sad things touching the Church were to come, it could not but be bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them; that is, the Book is of that nature that it would so affect a Christian.</item>
                     <item>11. <hi>And he said unto me, Thou must prophecy again:</hi> that is, Thou must run over again from the same Epocha of time, this race of prophecying, that is, foretell, (as before the <hi>fate</hi> or state <hi>of the Empire,</hi> so now) the <hi>fate</hi> or state of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> from the beginning thereof to the end of the world. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Peoples, and Nations, and Tongues, and Kings</hi>; that is, to their faces: so that they may all understand how they are concerned in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the opened Book. And thus is the Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>Sealed-Book</hi>-Prophecy to the <hi>Opened-Book</hi>-Prophecy in both the parts thereof, fully finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now follow the Visions themselves of the <hi>Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Book</hi>-Prophecy, and that in a sufficiently natural and rational order, those Visions that reach from the beginning of the Church being placed first.</item>

The beginning of the seventh Trumpet is the beginning of the <hi>Sardian</hi> succession of the Church, and of the seven Vials; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of them all are with praises and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for this first auspicious victory of Christ over the Papal Hierarchy or Antichrist. For the word <hi>Sardis</hi> signifies a <hi>Song of Ioy,</hi> and here is the thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of the Elders, and at the beginning of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als there is sung the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the Lamb.

               <p n="18">18. <hi>And the Nations were angry</hi>; that is, the Gentiles that had trodden down the outward Court, and defiled it by a new kind of Idolatrous Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lism; the minds of these were exasperated and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated with wrath and envy at this sudden resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Witnesses, which is a short glance at the first Vial. <hi>And thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead</hi>; that is, of those that this Tyrannical <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Hierarchy had so often and in such multitudes so barbarously murthered for their witnessing to the Truth, the time is now come that Christ is to judge and revenge their Cause, which seems to allude to the third Vial, where it is said, <hi>Thou art righteous O Lord, which art, and wast, and shall be, because thou hast judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus: For they have shed the blood of Saints and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98585:75"/>
Prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink, for they are worthy,</hi> which is an easie comment upon what follows. <hi>That they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy Servants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to thy Saints, and them that fear thy Name small and great.</hi> The meanest that have died Martyrs and been murdered for the profession of the Truth, that thou shouldest judge their Cause, though they were despised by this Proud, Imperious <hi>Iezebel: And shouldest destroy them that destroy the Earth:</hi> that is, the men upon the Earth, for of this <hi>Iezebel</hi> or Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> it is said, <hi>And in her was found the blood of Prophets and of Saints, and of all that were slain upon the Earth</hi>; into such an Akel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama has that lofty Prelate the Pope ever and anon turned Christendom by his restless ambition and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>And the Temple of God was opened in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> Out of which the seven Angels having the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven last plagues are seen to come, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>And there was seen in his Temple the Ark of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament:</hi> Which answers to the great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the Throne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.17. under the seventh Vial: So that this time reaches to the very <hi>Sanctum sanctorum,</hi> or <hi>Holy of holies,</hi> betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most powerfull, pure and Apostolick State of the Church, as if we were come into the first Apostolick Times again in the beginning of the Church, as the outward Court is an emblem of the latter Apostated Times thereof.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>ANd there appeared a great wonder in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a Woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her féet, and upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi> This is the primitive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Church before the Apostasie. Where being clothed with the Sun signifies her being environed with the pure Light of the Gospel, or the Sun of Righteousness communicated to her. And her being crowned with twelve Stars denotes, that it was her Glory, and her Crown, that she was not yet degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the True <hi>Apostolick</hi> Faith and practice, nor did as yet either <hi>Iudaize</hi> or <hi>Paganize,</hi> but trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot both the <hi>Carnality</hi> of the Judaical Rites, (whose Feasts, and Legal Observances were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the course of the Moon) and also the gross <hi>Superstitions</hi> and <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the Pagans, which are rightly deemed the works of darkness, or of the night, of which the Moon is Governess.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And she being with Child cryed travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</hi> These sharp throes signifie the cruel cutting persecutions the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church was under, and the many martyrdoms
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98585:76"/>
they did suffer before that promise of Christ was made good to them, <hi>Fear not little stock, for it is my Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> This state therefore of the Church is contemporary with that of the earnest <hi>Ephesine</hi> and bitter <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession, and with the <hi>inward Court,</hi> where also stood the <hi>Altar of Holocausts,</hi> betokening the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians frequent <hi>sacrificing</hi> their <hi>lives</hi> in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to the Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And there appeared another wonder in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; namely, while this Woman was thus in travail; <hi>And behold a great red Dragon,</hi> that is, bloody and cruel, <hi>having seven Heads and ten Horns</hi>; on his seventh head suppose, but without Crowns, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate they are not yet in being, though the heads be said to be crowned as well the five past, and that one to come, as the present sixth head, the better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thereby, that they are <hi>Men</hi> or Magistrates, not <hi>Hills</hi> that are intimated in this place, that is the reason it is said, <hi>And seven Crowns upon his heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven, and did cast them to the Earth</hi>; that is, his Military Train or Armies had subdued in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, the third part of the Kingdoms and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities of the then known world. <hi>And the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon stood before the Woman which was ready to be delivered to devour the Child as soon as it was born.</hi> The Dragon, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> known by its seven Heads, which allude also to the seven Hills, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. as well as to the sevenfold succession of Government in it, but <hi>Pagan</hi> in that it is in the shape of a <hi>Dragon,</hi> as being under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion not of <hi>Christ</hi> but <hi>Satan,</hi> and also because <hi>seven</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:98585:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Heads are <hi>only</hi> named, and the <hi>Horns</hi> of the seventh Head yet <hi>uncrowned</hi>: Wherefore this Vision belongs to the Empire while it was yet purely Pagan, and the sense of that last clause is briefly this, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperours and their Ministers, the Devil as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, watched as close as they could, that the Church of Christ never should come to such Power as to have an Emperour of their own Religion, and so the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire come into their hands; but so soon as any such thing appeared, they endeavoured to quash it and defeat it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And she brought forth a Man-child who was to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all their envious and malicious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness the Woman brought forth a Man-child, a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Christ, or Christian People, that at last would make themselves Masters of the Empire, and Rule the wicked persecutive Pagans with such severity as they deserved, which is intimated by what follows: <hi>And her Child was caught up unto God and to his Throne.</hi> He was advanced to the Imperial Dignity, which is called here the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> in such a sense as Supreme Magistrates are called <hi>Elohim,</hi> Gods, in the Hebrew <hi>Idiom,</hi> because they are Gods Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Representatives here on Earth, whence their Majesty is also called <hi>Sacred.</hi> And this was plainly fulfilled when <hi>Constantine</hi> turned Christian. The watchfulness therefore of this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, this quick-sighted vigilant <hi>Dragon</hi> seems to be contemporary with the Travail of the Woman till she had brought forth a Man-child that might rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And the Woman fled into the Wilderness:</hi> But a little after this external prosperity of the Church,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98585:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and deliverance from the present Pagan persecution, she was yet fain to take shelter in the wilderness, the outward Catholick Church becoming little better in a short time: For which reason she is said to fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderness, being more safe in this <hi>Christiano-gentilism,</hi> than in that open furious oppression of the Pagan red <hi>Dragon,</hi> thought in propriety of speech the desart or Christiano-paganism came swiftly upon her rather than she by any will of her own fled into it, but it is a Prophetical <hi>Hypallage: Where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there:</hi> The Apostolick Church should be preserved by Gods Providence all the time of this her abode in the Wilderness or Christiano-gentilism, namely about the time of <hi>a thousand two hundred and threescore dayes,</hi> Prophetical, that is years: Or the time and times and half a time, as they are afterward called, and sometimes resolved into <hi>Dayes,</hi> sometimes into <hi>Months,</hi> for * particular symbolical meanings, and for the embellishing of the Cortex of the Apocalypse, but to be understood alwayes <hi>seven Semitimes</hi> in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other disguise expressed, whether of <hi>Dayes</hi> or <hi>Months:</hi> These 1260 dayes therefore is the same time with forty two months, of the treading down the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court by the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And there was war in Heaven</hi>; which beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the like affair to come upon Earth: <hi>Michael and his Angels fought against the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his Angels:</hi> which implies the invisible assistances and oppositions of Angels good and bad, the one on the Primitive Christians side, the other on the Pagan Empires side, during that strong conflict betwixt the Church and the Pagans their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> and <hi>Smyrnean</hi> succession, with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98585:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which the pangs of the Woman in travail also is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And</hi> the Dragon and his Angels <hi>prevailed not</hi>; that is, they were quite vanquished, <hi>neither was their place found any more in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent,</hi> with whom Christ had had no small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating long before, <hi>called the Devil and Satan</hi>; the reproacher and opposer of the Kingdom of Christ in all places and ages; <hi>which deceiveth the whole world,</hi> and seduceth them into false and idolatrous worship. <hi>He was cast out into the earth, and his Angels were cast out with him:</hi> This appearance thus in Heaven signified the destruction of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire as <hi>Draconick</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> that none of that foul stamp should be in high places of the Empire, but such as were professed Christians.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>And I heard a loud voice saying in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.</hi> This is contemporary to the affairs of the sixth Seal, or rather with the close thereof, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Interval. <hi>For the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before God day and night.</hi> What the Devil is said to do concerning <hi>Iob,</hi> accuse him before God, the Pagans are here understood to do before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and other Magistrates of the Empire, to raise most wicked calumnies concerning the Christians, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting against them <hi>Thyaestean</hi> Suppers, Incests, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, promiscuous Lusts, Murders, Conspiracies against Princes, Plagues, Famine, Mischiefs by Fire, or what other calamity happened in the Empire.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:98585:78"/>11. <hi>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,</hi> through the merits of Christ crucified on the Cross, <hi>and by the word of their Testimony,</hi> and spending their own blood also in way of Martyrdom, For it is said, <hi>And they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> This Verse makes it plain, that the Battel that is said to be in Heaven, denotes a Battel here on Earth betwixt the Christians and their Persecutors.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Therefore rejoyce ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them.</hi> Ye Angels and Holy Martyrs, not without an intimation also to the <hi>Political</hi> Heaven, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to those in high Places and Offices under the Christian Emperour. <hi>Wo to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth and of the Sea,</hi> that is, to the lower multitude: <hi>For the Devil is come down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you having great wrath,</hi> and will stickle to do as much mischief as he can amongst you, while he may, <hi>because he knoweth that he hath but a short time:</hi> For though the Great Ones of the Empire were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christians, yet many of the Common People were still Pagans, wherefore the Devil will find out a fetch to strengthen those in their Paganism, and dissettle the other in their Christian Profession.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And when the Dragon saw that he was cast unto the Earth,</hi> and reduced to such a low, base condition: <hi>He persecuted the Woman which brought forth the Man-child:</hi> An envious, revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, persecuting temper rose in him against her.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>And to the Woman were given two wings of a great Eagle:</hi> that is, by reason of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire becoming Christian (and now divided into two parts, <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> (and that the Eagle is the Ensign of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is notorious enough) which these wings might represent) she was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98585:79"/>
in such a state, that by a Prophetick <hi>Hypallage</hi> it might be said of her, <hi>That she might fly into the Wilderness into her place:</hi> that is, the wilderness condition of the Church would come shortly upon her, wherein she should by Divine Providence be ever safe from the red Pagan, persecuting, Dragon, as it follows, <hi>where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> That is, for three Prophetick years and an half, which is seven <hi>Prophetical half years,</hi> or <hi>semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> which are the measures intended, as seems to be insinuated, by expressing the one thousand two hundred and sixty days, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. by a <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>half a Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. But before the commencement of the Time, as if he had a mind to overwhelm her before she could reach the appointed place, it is said, <hi>And the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent cast out of his mouth water as a stood after the Woman:</hi> that is, the water of Heresie and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that sore division of the Church by reason of that Heresie of Arianisme, <hi>That he might cause her to be carried a way of the Flood:</hi> That the Church which stood out the hottest persecutions with invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible valour against the red <hi>Dragon</hi> may now perish by the over-speading of Heresie and Intestine Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this furious controversie hardening the hearts of the unconverted people, and staggering the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Faith and Profession.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>And the Earth helped the Woman, and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth:</hi> that is, the Church was delivered from this overflowing Heresie and Dissension by the Decree of an <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> Council, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98585:79"/>
opening their mouth in a Decree against <hi>Arianisme,</hi> and condemning it for an Heresie, was like the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mouth of the Earth to a flood that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sinks and never is seen any more. Partly this real Analogie is alluded to, and partly there may be an allusion to the title <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> which is from <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="17">17. <hi>And the Dragon was wroth with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and went to make war with the remnant of her Séed which kéep the Commandments of God.</hi> The former wicked project failing, the wrath of the Dragon was again incensed against the Woman, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Woman with the Crown of twelve Stars on her head, and the Moon under her feet, the pure <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church, and went to make war with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her Seed, those namely that she was to bring forth, while she abides in the Wilderness, which will approve themselves her genuine Off-spring by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Commandments of God,</hi> who forbids us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any graven Image to bow down to it or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it, and bids us worship, serve, and pray to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone. <hi>And have the Testimony of Iesus Christ.</hi> For the Testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy, in which sense the two Witnesses are said to prophecy as well as to witness. The Testimony therefore of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is to witness to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, not from mere custom or education, because others have told us it is true; but because we are assured of the truth thereof from the spirit of God, and in virtue of the spirit of life in the new birth. From this living Principle do these faithful Servants of Christ bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the truth of his Word revealed in the Gospel,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98585:80"/>
and witness against the wicked inventions of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized Church, and loath them and detest them. For they are not dead vessels that will receive whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some liquor and poyson alike, but the Living Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God: and therefore have an antipathy against all the works of the Devil, gross Superstition, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, Idolatry, Cuelty, lying Impossibilities, instead of true Miracles or Mysteries, and what other Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Old Serpent that seduceth the whole world. Against such Witnesses therefore you may be sure this Dragon will make war, who in this Chapter is described under one single Figure of a <hi>Red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Emperours being <hi>Pontifices Maximi,</hi> as well as <hi>Caesars.</hi> In the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Draconical power is divided into two, there being now such a state in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as that there may be said to be <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal or Sacerdotal Hierarchy distinct from the <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Majesty and Power.</p>

                     <hi>For particular symbolical meanings, and for the embelishing of the Cortex of the Apocalypse,</hi> &amp;c. This symbolical meaning, as I remember <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mede</hi> takes notice of. That the Time and Times and half a Time is expressed by one thousand two hundred and sixty days, when the time or continuance of the Children of Light, or of the Day is notified; but by forty two months, when the Children of Darkness or of the Night their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is signified. Thus the continuance of the Ten-horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beast, <hi>Chap. 13.</hi> is numbred by months; as also the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98585:80"/>
treading down the Outward Court by the Gentiles, <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> But the Womans stay in the Wilderness is expressed by Dayes, as also the time of the two Witnesses prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying in sackcloth. And it is manifest that the outward letter or cortex of the Apocalypse is better adorned this way, than if where ever we find forty two months, or one thousand two hundred and sixty dayes, a Time and Times and half a Time had been repeated. But these reasons of varying the phrase thus being so apparent (to say nothing of the use of turning <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Time and Times and half a Time</hi> into forty two months, or one thousand two hundred and sixty dayes, for the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly understanding that three Prophetick years and an half is meant thereby) we may be the better assured, that no greater accurateness of Time is intended by them, than if the phrase of a Time and Times and half a Time had been alwayes used. The not understanding of which has made sundry in vain attempt to predict events foretold in the Apocalypse to the accurateness of a Prophetical Day, whenas indeed there is no use of either Prophetical Day or Month, unless in saying, such a thing was to fall out, or did fall out in such a Day, or such a Month, or such a day of such a Month of, suppose, the seventh or last Semitime or Prophetical half year, which consists of one hundred and eighty dayes or six months. And the nature of the things foretold are such, that they are not to terminate on a year, but rather require that grosser numbring by Semitimes. But the several particulars of the completion of a Prophecy, suppose of the rising of the Witnesses, might be more distinctly declared by saying this part was, suppose, in such a month of the last semitime, and such in such, in the fourth month suppose of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth or last semitime, or Prophetical half year, and such a day of that month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>ANd I stood upon the sand of the Sea,</hi> that is, me thought I stood by the Sea side; or rather as the vulgar Latine reads it, (which not only M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mede,</hi> but <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> and <hi>Alcazar,</hi> and, as they say, the generality of Interpreters follow) <hi>And he stood upon the sand of the Sea,</hi> that is, The Dragon stood, <hi>&amp;c. And I saw a Beast rise up out of the Sea, having seven heads and ten Horns;</hi> which betoken the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>and upon his Horns ten Crowns.</hi> In the former Vision there were no Crowns upon his Horns, but here there are, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note that this is the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire divided into many Kingdoms, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the Vision reaches unto these times, or belongs to the times of this state of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which Division of the Empire happened betwixt four and five hundred years after Christ. <hi>And upon his heads the name of Blasphemy,</hi> that is, of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; which signifies to us, that this Figure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Empire only under that succession of Time, that it was more or less Idolatrous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And the Beast which I saw was like unto a Leopard</hi>; that is, it was like a Kingdom divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many parts, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Kingdom was. <hi>And his feet,</hi> that is, his forepart, which are as the Arms and Hands of the Bear, which are his strength and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of action to raven and prey with; these <hi>were as the feet of a Bear:</hi> Which denotes the likeness of it with the <hi>Persian</hi> Kingdom, who as they were governed by their <hi>Magi</hi> in their affairs, so these by the <hi>Papal Hierarchy,</hi> by the Power and Counsel of the Pope and his Clergy. <hi>And his mouth as the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98585:81"/>
mouth of a Lion</hi>; that is, It is like the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Kingdom in its cruel Decrees against such as will not obey their <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Edicts, nor worship the Golden Image that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had set up. Their stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness must be punished by an hot fiery furnace, Fire and Fagot must be prepared for them that will not submit to this New <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry. <hi>And the Dragon gave him his Power, his Seat and great Authority.</hi> His power here according to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal should be his <hi>Forces</hi> or <hi>Armies:</hi> And what are the <hi>Forces</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> of the Dragon, but his Evil Angels or wicked Spirits, and their Weapons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery the external pomp of Images or Idols, and such gross furniture of their worship, whereby they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and captivate the feeble phancies of the people? But his <hi>Seat and great Authority</hi> is the Imperial Crown and Authority: Which showes, that this Imperial Power as Idolatrous, is the genuine successour to the Pagan Imperial Power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death:</hi> namely, in the fight of the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> with <hi>Michael</hi> and the Holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> who were conquerours at last, and converted the <hi>Roman</hi> Pagan Empire to Christianity. <hi>And his deadly wound was healed</hi>; that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for that succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Time it was represented to me under, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto its former Pagan-like and Idolatrous plight and condition. This Panther-like Beast, who by reason of the beauty of his skin, and sweetness of his scent allures other Beasts to him, and whom the Dragon is said most chiefly to fly from, under this fair show, and yet with the assistances of the Dragon was easily reduced to the former Pagan-like state, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretense of Christianity they imposing the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98585:82"/>
Idolatries upon the People. <hi>And all the world wondred after the Beast:</hi> that is, they were all mightily taken with the Beast, he both gratifying them with his outward specious show of Christianity, that seemed so contrary to the Dragon, and from which he so much abhorrs, and also having the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Dragon, (viz.)</hi> the Dragon-like Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and carnal sense-striking Rites of worship, and the tricks and delusions of his wicked Spirits at their Images or Altars to deceive the people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And they worshipped the Dragon which gave Power to the Beast:</hi> namely, which had given him <hi>his Armies,</hi> his <hi>Throne,</hi> and his great <hi>Authority,</hi> that is to say, though he appears in the shape now not of the <hi>Dragon</hi> but of the <hi>Leopard</hi> or <hi>Panther,</hi> a Beast the Dragon is said so much to abhor, that is, in the gratefull shew of <hi>Christianity,</hi> yet so far forth as they gave obedience to the Paganical and Idolatrous part joyned with it, they indeed worshipped or obeyed the <hi>Dragon,</hi> whose Fiends or Goblins might please themselves to receive that worship at their Altars and Images that they had by their jugling tricks and false Miracles reintroduced into the Church, and flear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves at the Imposture, that they made the Church in so gross a sense become the worshippers of Devils, as it is said in the sixth Trumpet: <hi>And they worshipped the Beast:</hi> that is, they yielded obedience to the Beast, to the Imperial Power in such a state as it was, <hi>saying, Who is like unto the Beast, who is able to make war with him</hi>? Things are so well setled and strongly this way, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodately to all mens liking, that neither Jew nor Pagan can be able to dissettle the Peace of the Empire in this point, or make war and raise stirs against it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:98585:82"/>5. <hi>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies</hi>; that is, great and enormous blasphemies: which are injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for Idolatry of several sorts; for Blasphemy in Scripture often signifies Idolatry. <hi>And Power was given unto him to continue forty and two months,</hi> the same time the outward Court is trodden down by the Gentiles; that is, the entireness of his Dominion shall continue till the seventh <hi>Semitime,</hi> till about the fourth month thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And he opened his mouth in Blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God to blaspheme his Name,</hi> by giving his incommunicable Name to Idols or Images; or Name may signifie his person, and so his person is blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Idolatry committed against him by worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping any other person besides God or Christ. <hi>And his Tabernacle,</hi> namely, the Body of Christ, which is the Living Tabernacle of God, it is blasphemed more wayes than one, both in that they Idolatrously worship a mere Wafer instead thereof, and make it also so vile a thing, that it shall be at the command of every Priest for whatever uses he will please to fetch it down by his transubstantiating charm, to be devoured into the foul stomachs of the People, and as it may happen, to be eaten by base Vermine, such as Rats and Mice. <hi>And them that dwell in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; that is, the Saints and Angels they most wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blaspheme, in that they set up Idols by the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Evil Spirits, the <hi>Forces</hi> or <hi>Armies</hi> the old <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> delivered to the Beast, who no doubt are busie enough to assist there and play tricks, and do call these Idols by the names of the Saints or Angels, and impute these tricks there played in the behalf of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry by them to the Saints, when they are the mere
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98585:83"/>
delusions of these Goblins or Devils: Besides, it it a gross reproach to the Saints and Angels, to suppose they will accept of Religious Worship, and so prove Rebels to God: Wherefore that Power that esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished and decreed such enormous things as these, Image-worship, Saint-worship and Transubstantiation, may well be said to open their mouth in blasphemy for publishing such Edicts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And it was given him to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them;</hi> that is, to oppose them and subdue them, and keep them under all along, that they shall have no power in the Empire, as it was said before of the mournful Witnesses, that they were <hi>Politically</hi> dead all the three Times and an half in a manner. But in some part of this time the war and slaughter or killing is not mystical but proper: For of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses</hi> in <hi>France</hi> alone there is said to have been slain no less than ten hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand. And in the Inquisition within thirty years space no less than an hundred fifty thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were consumed with all manner of grievances and miseries, besides infinite numbers more. And <hi>Sanderus</hi> the Jesuite reports, that an infinite number of <hi>Lothards,</hi> as he calls them, and <hi>Sacramentarians</hi> through <hi>Europe</hi> were burnt with fire and fagot, but excuses it as not done by the Pope and Bishops, but the secular Magistrate: which is the thing this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy foretells, that it is the <hi>Beast</hi> with <hi>ten horns,</hi> the Secular Power of the Empire, not the Beast with <hi>two horns,</hi> that is the executioner of the cruelty, or that dooms to death. <hi>Iezebel</hi> excites, but <hi>Ahab,</hi> the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Powers execute, or command to be executed, her bloody suggestions against <hi>Naboth,</hi> that is, against those that have the Witnesses of Jesus, the Spirit of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98585:83"/>
Prophecy as is elsewhere explained. <hi>And power was given him over all Kindreds, Tongues and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> namely, that he might persecute and force men to Idolatrous worship in all the parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And all that dwell upon the Earth</hi>; that is, whose minds are fixed on earthly things, <hi>shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him,</hi> that is, obey his Idolatrous Edicts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: <hi>whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world</hi>; that is, are not of the number of the <hi>Called</hi> and <hi>Chosen,</hi> as they are termed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. nor of those that are <hi>redeemed from the Earth,</hi> as they are described <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. For those will ever stand out till they get the victory over the Beast.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>If any man have an ear let him hear:</hi> For this was a remarkable intimation, and worth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, as also that which follows.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>He that leadeth into Captivity shall go into Captivity: He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword:</hi> that is, That Power which now in this forty-two months of years of the Beast, domineers so, and forces men to their Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship shall at last be led captive into the Truth, and they that kill now with the sword of persecution shall be slain by the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God, answerably to the witnesses slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their enemies by the fire that came out of their mouth: Which victory was obtained in the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Witnesses in a degree in the third or fourth month of the seventh or last <hi>Semitime, (viz.)</hi> in the late blessed Reformation as I have above no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints,</hi> that they may stand to it with these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98585:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weapons till it shall please God to give them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, as he did in the time even now mentioned.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And I beheld another Beast coming out of the Earth:</hi> Why there is two Beasts here since the Empire became Christian in profession, I above inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, namely because there is as it were <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> a <hi>Secular</hi> Empire and <hi>Sacerdotal,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to an Universal Rule <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> whenas the Pagan Emperours were <hi>Pontifices maximi,</hi> as well as <hi>Caesars.</hi> But that this other Beast is said to come out of the Earth and not out of the Sea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies its more still and quiet growth, as of Plants out of the ground, or its baser extraction, the chiefest in the Sacerdotal Hierarchy being more usually of meaner Parentage. Or lastly, Earth may signifie here as it does <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. where <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are glanced at, which though laudable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet this <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast grew out of them by the abuse of that power of determining Controversies of Religion when once they had got the custom not to mind what was true and Christian, but what was for the Interest of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> though never so <hi>Worldly</hi> and <hi>Secular. And he had two horns like a Lamb:</hi> That Apostate Sacerdotal Hierarchy or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy pretend their Power from the Lamb Christ, of binding and loosing. It may allude also to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops two-horned Mitre, which the two-horned Beast wears, though it so ill beseems him; as also signifie the distribution of the Apostatized Church then into two parts as the Empire was <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token the two chief summities of this Sacerdotal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, the two <hi>Patriarchates</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. And he spake as the Dragon</hi>; namely, in that he made Decrees for Idolatrous practises, and for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98585:84"/>
the persecuting of such as would not submit to them. This was the voice of the Old Dragon.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>And he exerciseth all the power of the first Beast before him</hi>; that is, his whole power he hath in Religion: For the power of approving things in Religion, and passing it into a Law is in the Secular Supreme Magistrate, not in the Clergy: But this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Hierarchy claimed all this Power, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised it accordingly in the behalf of the former Beast, as he succeeded the Dragon in his Dragon-like power and properties. <hi>And</hi> under pretense of this power, <hi>in sacris,</hi> in matters of Religion, <hi>he causeth the Earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed</hi>; that is, represented so as to have been healed or recovered into its former Paganical or Dragon-like condition, but by the Authority of this Sacerdotal Hierarchy, which was so prevalent with the people as to effect it; and how he effected it now follows:</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And he doth great wonders, so that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fire come down from Heaven on the Earth:</hi> which is a proverbial expression of the notoriousness of a wonder, alluding to <hi>Elias</hi> his bringing fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon those fifties. But it is as childish to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this <hi>literally</hi> here, as it would have been to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the fire proceeding out of the mouth of the Witnesses, and their turning the waters into blood, and the like, <hi>literally. Fire from Heaven</hi> therefore here is the <hi>thundering excommunications</hi> of this Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal Hierarchy, whereby those that did not obey the voice of this Beast, though it was the voice of the <hi>Dragon</hi> appointing Idolatrous worship, * were rent off from the Church, and made obnoxious to eternal fire. What is a greater wonder-working-power than
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98585:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this? And yet this great wonder, this two-horned Beast does. <hi>In the sight of men</hi>; that is, they are such fools as to believe he does it; especially when a Pope thunders against a Prince and his Nation for their Heresie, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the relinquishing the Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Idolatry and Tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh when he had excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, said, he was <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine afflatus,</hi> thunder-struck by him. These things, I confess, are rather a show of Miracles than Miracles; but <hi>Antichrist</hi> was to come with Lying and feigned Miracles. And if there might be any thing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, it is imputable to the <hi>forces</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the Evil Spirits that were bequeathed by the Dragon to the Apostatizing Empire.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast:</hi> that is, In the sight of the Lay or Secular Empire, before whom he made a show as if he did these Miracles: And whatever was in truth extraordinary, they are to be imputed to the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast: For he claiming and accepting the Power of ordering the Empire in matters of Religion, the Forces of the Dragon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast fell naturally to his share. And by these assistances are done whatever looks really like something extraordinary or miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the promoting Idolatry and Superstition, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures and Visions, exorcising Spirits, and a deal of such stuff, whether feigned or true, these are justly imputed to the two-horned Beast, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr to the bringing the Empire again into a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Pagan-like or Dragon-like condition: For by reason of these he was listened to when he made his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98585:85"/>
harangue to the people: <hi>Saying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they should make an Image to the Beast which had the wound by the sword</hi>; namely, in the fight with <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who overcame this Beast, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and his pure Paganism. But this <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast revives his Image again by the means abovesaid, by the obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the belief of such Miracles on the people. <hi>And he lived</hi>; that is, the Old Dragon, or Pagan Superstition and Idolatry was very lively reintrodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this Image the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast made, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Empire thus Idolatrous.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And this Image was no spiritless Image, slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish and harmless like an inanimate Statue: For the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast had a way to transfuse Spirit and Life into it, as it follows: <hi>And he had power to give Life unto the Image of the Beast, that the Image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the Image of the Beast,</hi> that is, would not obey himself, the Secular Idolatrous Power of the Empire, <hi>should be killed:</hi> Which Power of so commanding to kill, which is the Spirit of the Image of the Beast, is derived from the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, or Sacerdotal Hierarchy; the Image of the Beast having no Power to kill any one for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, but whom the Sacerdotal Hierarchy has declared Heretick; then is he delivered up to the Secular Power, the Ten-horned Beast: For the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast kills none himself, but delivers up to the Secular Magistrate according to this very Prophecy.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>And he,</hi> this Image of the Beast, <hi>causeth all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,</hi> that is, all sorts and degrees of men, <hi>to receive a mark in their right-hand, or in their foreheads,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:98585:86"/>
as Soldiers or Servants do the name of their <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Master,</hi> that is, they must make open and express pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to whom they belong.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>And that no man may buy or sell, save he that had the mark or name of the Beast, or the number of his Name: (viz.)</hi> of the <hi>two-horned Beast,</hi> the very <hi>Antichrist,</hi> who will have his marked Soldiers as well as Christ hath his; that is, no man not markt with the name of this Beast, or the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his name, that has not either his name in letters plainly writ or in figures, that contain the number that the letters of his name make according to their numeral value (for every Greek letter has such a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meral value) those that are not thus marked, that is, profess not themselves of the Faith of this Sacerdotal Hierarchy signified by the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast, may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buy nor sell, but are excommunicated for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, with whom by the very Sentence of their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods there is to be no Negotiation. Now who this Beast, this two-horned Beast, or Sacerdotal Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy more particularly is, is enigmatically expressed in the following Verse.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Here is wisdom, let him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing count the number of the Beast.</hi> Here is a dark riddle, let him that has skill that way number the number of the Beast. <hi>For it is the number of a Man</hi>; that is, not so strange a number, but that it may be numbred by the Art of man. <hi>And his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is six hundred threescore and six</hi>; which is to be numbred no otherwise than by the extraction of the square Root which is 25, * which is marvellously applicable to the City and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as 12 the root of 144 to the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> And that you may be sure this Sacerdotal Hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> is more

               <p n="1">1. THere was mention in the foregoing Chapter of the Wars of the Beast, and his marked Soldiers, and of his continuance (<hi>viz.</hi> in his entire state) to the seventh <hi>Semitime</hi> of forty two months of years (which is one manner of expressing <hi>Daniel</hi>'s time and times and half a time.) Now in counter-correspondency to those Soldiers and that War, in this very first Verse there is exhibited the Lamb and his Soldiers: <hi>And I looked, and Lo! a Lamb stood on Mount Sion</hi>; which is <hi>Christ</hi> against <hi>Antichrist: And with him an hundred forty four thousands:</hi> that is to say, an hundred forty four Chiliads or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, consisting of a thousand a piece: <hi>Having his Fathers Name written in their foreheads:</hi> that is, making open profession of Christ and of God
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98585:87"/>
his <hi>Father</hi> against the <hi>pretended Holy Father</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope, as the word signifies. Instead of receiving the mark of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast in their right hand, or on their foreheads, they have the name of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and of his Son <hi>Christ</hi> marked on their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, that you may see whose Soldiers they are. And in that they are said to be 144 Regiments, it denotes that they are pure Apostolick Christians, the square root of 144 being 12. Here therefore the number 144 from its root 12 denotes the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Church, as the number 666 from its root 25, the Church <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatizing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And I heard a voice from Heaven as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of Harpers harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their harps.</hi> This is a description of the Angelical Musick in Heaven, where multitudes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels praise God and the Lamb, the voice of many waters and thunder, being symbols of a multitude speaking or singing together: But it is further said of this Angelical Quire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And they sung as it were a new song before the Throne, and before the four Beasts, and the Elders, and no man could learn that song but the hundred forty four thousand which were redeemed from the Earth.</hi> This Song of the <hi>Angelical</hi> Quire, which is the Joy that ariseth from the <hi>New Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> superadded to the <hi>Animal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and is the same in <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> I mean <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> men, who thereby are made partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as well as the <hi>Angels</hi>; None could learn this Song, that is, none could know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Joys of the New Birth, or Divine Life raised in us, that state of Righteousness, and Peace,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98585:88"/>
and Joy in the Holy Ghost, but the <hi>hundred forty four thousand redeemed from the Earth,</hi> that is, from the earthy sense and wisdom, that savours only the things of this world, and of the flesh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>These are they which were not defiled with women</hi>; namely, with the Daughters of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that famous strumpet the <hi>Mother of Harlots and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Earth:</hi> These would not submit themselves to the lewd debaucheries of that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Church. <hi>For they are Uirgins</hi>: For they have so holy and chaste a sense in the duties of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship, that they abhor from every thing that has any shew of violating that loyalty and fidelity they owe to God or Christ, to whom alone they are betrothed. <hi>These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</hi> These are they who are only led by his Word and Spirit, not by a blind and implicite Faith in a Church not only fallible but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious or deceitful, most of their corruptions both in Doctrine and Worship being upheld for their own worldly interest. <hi>These were redeemed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men,</hi> were rescued from being carried away with the stream of the rest of the Superstitious and Idolatrous Rabble, hood-winked and captivated by the false showes and subtil enticements of the most cunning Polity in the world, <hi>Being the first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb:</hi> namely, the first pure Apostolick Christians after the Apostasie, and but an handful in comparison of those multitudes that will appear after the dissolution of the Papal Tyranny.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And in their mouth was found no guile</hi>; that is, there was no hypocrisie nor dissembling in them, but they professed the Truth from their hearts, and concealed it not: <hi>For they are without fault before
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98585:88"/>
the Throne of God</hi>; that is, in the judgment of God they are holy and upright men, though at the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Antichrist they are condemned for Hereticks, and deemed men not worthy to live, or dye an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary death. Nay, besides what they call Heresie in them, (though according to that they do worship in purity the God of their Fathers, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ) they add a multitude of abominable lies to make them odious to the people, but the God of Heaven knows they are guiltless, whence it is said, They are without fault before the Throne of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And I saw another Angel</hi> distinct from that Quire of Angels taken notice of before, <hi>fly in the midst of Heaven,</hi> that he may be seen and heard over all the Christian world, as well the <hi>Western</hi> as <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire, as is intimated in what follows: <hi>Having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth, and to every Nation, and Kindred, and Tongue, and People:</hi> that is, to preach the <hi>Everlasting Righteousness, Law,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> that Christ according to <hi>Daniel</hi> was to bring in:<note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> Which is the pure and Apostolick Doctrine unsophisticated with the Superstitions and Idolatries of either <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which hay and stubble is to be burnt up, but that Apostolick Gospel to be <hi>Eternal,</hi> never to fail, and to spread over all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give Glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: And worship him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and the fountains of waters:</hi> And therefore none but God the Father and the Son, with the Spirit, who Created all things, is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped: <hi>The Gods that have not made the Heavens
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98585:89"/>
and the Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>they shall perish from the Earth, and from under the Heavens,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> foretells: This is a plain declaration against giving any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship to any but God alone: And therefore a commination against all <hi>Saint-worshippers</hi> and <hi>Image-worshippers,</hi> or whatever other Idolatry in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church. That this voice of the Angel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Edicts and Degrees of those <hi>Greek</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that protested so zealously against Saint-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Image-worship, namely the Decrees of <hi>Leo Isaurus, Constantinus Iconomaches, Leo Armenius, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Balbus</hi> and <hi>Theophilus,</hi> I do not deny, but this Angelical Monition was the most loudly and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged upon the Christian World at the dreadfull siege and storming of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole <hi>Eastern</hi> Church and Empire to the <hi>Turk.</hi> This was a plain manifestation that the hour of his judgement was come against such gross Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And yet though his judgements flew so high, and sounded so loud as to give notice to all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> yet the <hi>Western Church</hi> would take no notice thereof, as it is predicted <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues from the <hi>Euphratean Horsemen,</hi> which are the <hi>Turks,</hi> yet <hi>repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship Demons and Idols of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore if we hear news of the hand of God upon the <hi>Western Church</hi> also, I mean upon the <hi>Idolatrous Hierarchy</hi> thereof, which is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly stiled <hi>Babylon,</hi> we need not be much surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: And thus we read in the next verse.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And there followed another Angel saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great City,</hi> or Polity, <hi>bicause she made all Nations,</hi> the <hi>Eastern</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:98585:89"/>
as well as the <hi>Western</hi> Church (as may be observed in the Popes activity at the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and in excommunicating the <hi>Iconoclast</hi> Emperours) <hi>drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,</hi> of the <hi>Philter</hi> she had mingled for them, the <hi>Love-poison,</hi> or <hi>Love-potion</hi> of her fornication, by which is plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood Idolatry. To the voice of this Angel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Reformation, when so many Provinces and Principalities fell off from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was a pledge of her further ruine: Here therefore ends the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval, and that of <hi>Sardis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, in which is contained the effusion of the Vials, all but the last.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And the third Angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the Beast and his Image</hi>; that is, give obedience to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and Spiritual Power in such things as are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and are the very strokes and lineament of the Image of the Beast, <hi>and receive his,</hi> the Beasts, <hi>mark in his forehead, or in his hand</hi>; that is, make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of, or promote and countenance the Romish Idolatrous Religion:</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the cup of his indignation.</hi> He shall drink of the cup of bitterness and malediction from the Lord. <hi>And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever</hi>; that is, all they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to those infernal and eternal flames, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the voice of this third Angel shall persist in the gross Idolatries, and other foul corruptions of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98585:90"/>
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For under the voice of this Angel, the abominations of that Church will be so fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and convincingly, that the adherers thereto will be generally deemed uncapable of salvation, with any that have any remainders of judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in them. <hi>And they have no rest day nor night who worship the Beast and his Image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his Name.</hi> Truth against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be then so dear, that no man that has any Conscience can be of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Profession, but it will lye exceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenly in his mind, it will put him in restless and unsatisfied condition, it appearing so manifestly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all sense, all reason, all honesty and loyalty, and against all those sound and sacred Principles that God hath implanted in the nature of man: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in those dayes no honest-hearted man can endure to submit to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> From whence it follows,</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints.</hi> This is the time wherein the patience of the Saints will be tryed, the external carnal power of the enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to force them against so great Light, to submit to their Idolatrous and Antichristian usages by cruel and barbarous persecutions: Wherefore this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to that passage in the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which contains a commination for their more general deadness and degeneracy, whereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort amongst them are brought to this jeopardy and distress. <hi>Here are they that keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and the faith of Iesus:</hi> that is, Here are they that will say unto their persecutors, <hi>Whether it be right in the sight of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4.19.</note> 
                  <hi>to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge you?</hi> Here are they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98585:90"/>
that keep to the pure Faith and Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, and will not submit to any new-coined forms, invented for worldly Interest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Faith and Doctrine of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. And surely God will give at last to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of such holy and sincere souls sutable victory and success, as is intimated in the following Verse:</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And I heard a voice from Heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord:</hi> That dye as Martyrs in witness to his Truth against the abominable corruptions of that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Church. <hi>From henceforth,</hi> are they blessed, that is, from this time of the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval that here is intimated, a time when the Scales begin to turn, and nearer approach is made to the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> State, which commenceth with the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Cabbalists</hi> call it; and therefore it follows, <hi>Yea, saith the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit that is to bring on these days, sets his Seal thereto: <hi>That they may rest from their labours:</hi> For their martyrdom puts an end to their pains and toyles in this world: <hi>And their works do follow them</hi>; that is, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and success of their works and labour here, which are the hoped consequences thereof: Which expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effect and success is the restoring of the Kingdom of Christ upon the overthrow of the salvage and barbarous tyranny of a bloody Idolatrous Church, which murders and massacres men, and does all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable despight to them, because they will not sin against the manifest Laws of <hi>Christ</hi> to serve the lewd worldly ends, and interest of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>And I looked and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of Man, having on his head a golden Crown.</hi> This is <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:98585:91"/>
that Son of Man in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 7.14.</note> who is said to <hi>come with the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> as if they were his Chariot, and <hi>Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdome,</hi> as here a Crown is said to be given unto him; <hi>And in his hand a sharp sickle.</hi> That Christ himself here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with his sickle in his hand ready to reap, is very agreeable to what was intimated before of the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the approaching thereof: For what he is said to do by himself is by the Ministry of his Spirit in counterdistinction to humane and carnal means. This is about the time of the sixth Vial.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And another Angel came out of the Temple,</hi> representing the holy Church, and her earnest and sincere Devotions for the enlargement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ: And therefore it is added, <hi>Crying with a loud voice to him that sate on the Cloud, Thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap, for the harvest of the Earth is ripe:</hi> Like that of our blessed Saviour himself; <hi>Lift up your eyes and look on the fields,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4.35.</note> 
                  <hi>for they are white already to harvest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>And he that sate on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the Earth, and the Earth was reaped:</hi> namely, that crop that belonged to that season, which as I said, is about the <hi>sixth Vial,</hi> which contempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth with the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Lambs Bride:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this Harvest happily may be prefigured the gathering of the Jews to the Faith of Christ, which will prove a further enlargement of his Kingdom: But the most universal conquest of all follows in the next Vision, which contemporizeth with the <hi>seventh</hi> or <hi>last Vial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>And another Angel came out of the Temple which is in Heaven,</hi> [<hi>which is in Heaven</hi>] is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98585:91"/>
                  <hi>vers.</hi> 15. as needless, because the <hi>Reaper</hi> there is Christ himself, which implies his immediate assistance in that work. But this Angel being himself to be <hi>Vintager,</hi> there is mention made of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to intimate his <hi>heavenly mission,</hi> that he is sent from God, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately assisted by his Spirit. The appearance of which <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> will be eminent under this seventh Vial, which contemporizeth with the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Rider of the White Horse,</hi> with a sharp two-edged sword coming out of his mouth, this Angel also <hi>having a sharp sickle</hi>; which fitly answers to the <hi>sharp two-edged sword</hi> coming out of the mouth of the Rider of the white Horse: Both of them sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the cutting convictiveness of the Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the powerful Ministers of Christ in those days.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>And another Angel came out from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which had power over fire:</hi> The Altar, as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the Apocalypse, is a symbol of the sacrifice of Martyrdom. And here is mention of Fire, because that kind of Martyrdom was so frequently inflicted by that Murderous and Idolatrous Church of <hi>Rome</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Faithful Witnesses of Christ, who bore Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against the abominations of that bloody Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. <hi>And cryed with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle</hi>; namely, for vengeance against this den of cruel Murderers and Idolaters; <hi>saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the Uine of the Earth, for the Grapes are fully ripe</hi>; that is, some are in full ripeness and readiness for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and for others their sins are fully ripe for ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction and confusion. But I conceive this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion respects more especially the former, which yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the destruction and confusion of the latter.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:98585:92"/>19. <hi>And the Angel thrust in his sickle into the Earth, and gathered the Uine of the Earth, and cast it into the great Wine-press of the wrath of God</hi>; that is, men were pressed in conscience upon the sharp convictions of the powerful Ministers of Christ with sorrow for their sins; and the wrath of God against themselves was kindled in them: As the Apostle writes to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning the like conviction.<note place="margin">2 Corinth. 7.11.</note> 
                  <hi>What carefulness it wrought in you, what indignation, what vehement desire, what revenge.</hi> Here Christ, who is said to tread the wine-press of Gods wrath alone, treads and squeezeth out the corrupt blood of <hi>Edom.</hi> And in the Vision which is parallel to this <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. his <hi>Vesture</hi> is said <hi>to be dipt in blood,</hi> and that he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God: which plainly shows, that these two Visions tend to one and the same thing.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>And the Wine-press was trodden without the City:</hi> that is, this powerful conviction neither began in, nor reached to the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hierarchy</hi> or <hi>Polity</hi>; (for wood and stone is not here meant, but a <hi>Polity</hi> or Society of men) as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable in the <hi>seventh Vial</hi>; that though the <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>Nations</hi> fell by those powerful <hi>Boanerges's</hi> yet this <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, though hail-stones of a Talent weight fell upon them, were not converted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in their consciences, but <hi>blasphemed God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the plague of the hail, it was so exceeding great.</hi> And in the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Rider of the White Horse,</hi> the false Prophet and his adherents were taken, and their power abolished, as to that Tyranny and Idolatry they exercised before; but it was the <hi>rest</hi> only that were slain with the <hi>Sword</hi> that proceeded out of the

mouth of him that sate on the white Horse, it was they only that were converted and convinced by the powerful preaching of the Everlasting Gospel, the pure Gospel of Christ cleansed from all the filth and trumperies, all the Idolatries and Superstitions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. And they are the same that are pressed here by Christs <hi>Vintagers</hi> or <hi>Grape-pressers,</hi> but the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> proves obdurate and uncapable of any such <hi>pressure</hi> of <hi>conscience,</hi> or true contrition for her Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, so strongly is she hardened in her <hi>pretense</hi> of <hi>Infallibility. And blood came out of the Wine-press even to the Horses bridles.</hi> This again shows plainly that the Vision of the Rider of the white Horse and his Company, and this of the Wine-press is all one: But this signifies a full conviction in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and a perfect victory over the contumacious, which is further illustrated by what follows: <hi>By the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs,</hi> which signifies the exceeding largeness and universality, as it were, of the victory, if we read as we may, sixteen <hi>Hecatontads</hi> or <hi>Centuries</hi> of furlongs. And then as in the number 666, and as in the 144 Chiliads, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the square root we find the symbolical mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; so by the extracting the square root of sixteen which is four, we find the symbolical mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this: * For four is the symbol of <hi>Vniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> with the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Cabbalists</hi>: Which construction sutes wonderfully well with the Visions this is a parallel to, namely, that of the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> and the <hi>Battel</hi> of <hi>the Rider of the White Horse:</hi> Which is the Battel of that Great Day of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to which the Kings of the Earth, and of the <hi>whole</hi> world are gathered together; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat is proportionable: For upon this defeat all the

                  <hi>Chapter vers.</hi> 2, 3, 4. Which plainly demonstrates, that before the effusion of the Vials, there is a considerable victory over the Beast. For that Doxologie, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. is after the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses. And that triumphant acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. not before the fall of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And here most expresly of all in this Chapter, there is thanks for a notable lately gotten victory over the Beast, and over his Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before we come to the effusion of the Vials, so that these things notably confirm one another. To say nothing how the very name <hi>Sardis</hi> signifies <hi>Canticum laetitiae,</hi> a <hi>Song of Ioy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>And I saw another sign in Heaven great and marvellous, seven Angels having the seven last plagues, for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</hi> Namely, against the Beast or <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, that was punished considerably by the Reformation; but before there Vials be over, <hi>In the cup that she has fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it will be filled to her double: The seven last plagues,</hi> which therefore in all reason are to be in the <hi>last Wo-trumpet,</hi> and the second Wo-trumpet was past at the rising of the Witnesses: And therefore the effusion of the Vials must be after the rising of the Witnesses, and the rising of the Witnesses the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Reformation, when so many Provinces and Principalities had cast off the Yoke, and freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the sad bondage of that <hi>Roman Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Papal Hierarchy,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the slavery of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> And therefore it follows,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98585:94"/>2. <hi>And I saw as it were a Sea of glass min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with fire:</hi> This seems to have a double allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either to the <hi>Sea of Glass,</hi> like unto Crystal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 5. which the light of the seven Lamps there shined upon, or else to the <hi>Red Sea congealed,</hi> as it were, into two walls of Glass or Ice, on which the Angel in a pillar of Fire going before the <hi>Israelites</hi> shined also and the redness of the sand of the Sea made the mixture more like fire. <hi>And them that had gotten the victory over the Beast, and over his Image,</hi> such as had got free from both the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> and <hi>Secular</hi> Idolatrous Power, that they could not longer persecute them for not submitting to their Pagan-like Abominations: <hi>And over his mark, and over the number of his Name</hi>; that is, That now could neither be forced to swear into the forms of that false Church by a sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish implicite faith, nor to profess himself a <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, but a free Apostolick Christian: <hi>Stand on the sea of Glass,</hi> on the shore of that Sea that was converted into Glass or Ice when they passed through it, as newly escaped the persecution of that <hi>Roman Pharaoh,</hi> who was overthrown Horse and Man in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> that is, by the Protestants profession, that they were only justified by the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, and the sanctification of his Spirit, which is resembled by fire: <hi>Having the Harps of God,</hi> that is, Holy or large Harpe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And they sing the Song of Moses the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, and the song of the Lamb</hi>; that is, They sing the Song of the Lamb, of which the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> was but a Type, but the occasions so like one another, that the Song may indifferently serve both: But in the mean time, it is plain here, that

                  <hi>Rome</hi> is that Spiritual <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wherein the Witnesses were slain, and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thereof: <hi>Saying, Great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways, O King of Saints.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>And after that I looked,</hi> namely after this Triumphal Song of the Harpers, that had <hi>gotten the victory over the Beast, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the number of his Name:</hi> For it is absurd to conceive a triumphal Song before the victory, or this victory to be of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians over the Pagans, because of the Image of the Beast, and his Mark, and the number of his Name: And therefore it must be the victory of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> over the <hi>Paganochristians.</hi> Whence it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that the first Vial, and the first Trumpet should contemporize. <hi>And behold the Temple of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Testimony in Heaven was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Which answers to that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>And the Temple of God was opened in Heaven</hi>; which again assures us, that the effusion of the Vial is after the rising of the Witnesses; namely out of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

that is, being clothed in priestly attire, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavenly Priests belonging to that Heavenly Temple, that is to say, as being so represented.</p>

               <p>SOme strictures there were, and glances at the things that appertain to the <hi>Vials</hi> after the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses,</hi> Chap. 11. and after the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 14. but hinted very maimedly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, and interruptedly.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of the Temple,</hi> (out of which the Angels had come forth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>vers.</hi> 6.) <hi>saying to the seven Angels, Go your wayes and pour out the Uials of the wrath of God</hi> (which ye received from one of the four Beasts) <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth</hi>; that is, upon this Terrestrial or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous Globe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And the first went and poured out his Uial upon the Earth: (viz.)</hi> in that sense of Earth that was intimated before; for it means no more than on this Terraqueous Globe, unless there be an allusion to the ashes of the furnace from which the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> blains and boiles did arise, as certainly there is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to those <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plagues both in this and in other Vials; whereby we may be assured, that these plagues belong to that City or Society, that is <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called Aegypt,</hi> namely to the <hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98585:96"/>
Hierarchy,</hi> that has so long kept the Children of God in bondage, and in which the Witnesses have been so often slain. <hi>Earth</hi> therefore here is chiefly repeated to bear a correspondence in the outward <hi>Cortex,</hi> with <hi>Sea, Rivers</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> as if God would stir up all the Elements or Nature to fight against the Beast, and the Antichristian Powers. <hi>And there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the Beast, and upon them which worshipped his Image</hi>; that is, the minds of the Pontifician party were extreamly enraged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated with fury and envy against the risen Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses (as an Evil Spirit from the Lord troubled <hi>Saul</hi>) when they beheld them [<hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 12.] ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.14.</note> that is, called up to high places and dignities in Church and State, and that the Papal Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Power and Tyranny was abolished. This Cup of Bitterness, Wrath, Envy and intoxicating Zeal for so foul a Cause, was the effusion of the first Vial upon them, which did so work upon them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentate them, that they made themselves still more execrable and odious by their impotent and unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful attempts against them, that God had thus exalted above their reach. In the mean time we see how naturally (besides the letting loose Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits upon them) the first Vial follows the rising of the Witnesses accordingly as it is glanced at <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. immediately after their rising, and those Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Doxologies for the same, (those Songs of Joy from whence the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church has her Name, which here commenceth.) <hi>And the Nations,</hi>

                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:98585:97"/>3. <hi>And the second Angel poured out his Uial upon the Sea</hi>; that is, upon some parts of the Sea: And Sea in the Prophetick stile signifying the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the People into one Polity or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it must signifie some parts of this Kingdom or Polity; which is here the Jurisdiction or Dominion of the Papacy. Of some parts therefore of this Sea it is said, <hi>And it became as the blood of a dead man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every living soul died in the Sea: (viz.)</hi> in these parts of this Sea which were turned into blood there were no live fishes to be caught there any more: and fishes dead in the Sea signifie disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hope, and that what we expect will not come to pass. In such a state was the Papal Hierarchy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the settlement of the Reformation in so many Provinces, Principalities and Kingdoms; which dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and hopelesness of his affairs there, brought to pass by the good Providence of God, was the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the second Vial upon these parts of this Sea or Jurisdiction, and turning them into blood, and the quite spoiling any further fishing there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And the third Angel poured out his Uial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rivers and Fountains of waters, and they became blood:</hi> As <hi>Sea</hi> signified above <hi>Politically,</hi> so <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of Waters or Springs must, that are the Heads of Rivers, and both come from the Sea and return thither again, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the water of them. A <hi>Sea</hi> therefore here being a Kingdom or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Rivers must be Emissary Powers of the said Kingdom, whether Armies, or other Agents, with those that Head them or Govern them, who may be deemed the Spring-heads of them, they taking their directions and motions from them, and depending on them as Rivers do on their Springs: And this plague
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98585:97"/>
of turning Rivers into blood being manifestly one of the plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> these Emissaries must be the Emissaries of that City or Polity which is spiritually called <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which is the Papal Hierarchy: And the turning these Rivers into blood, is the putting to death such Emissaries for their treasonable attempts against Kings or Princes, and the setled Religion and Government of the place.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And I heard the Angel of the Waters say, (viz.)</hi> the Prefect of the multitudes of people, <hi>Thou art Righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shall be</hi>; that is, thou art just, O Jehovah, thou great Judge and King, <hi>because thou hast judged thus:</hi>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>And I heard another out of the Altar, say,</hi> that is, out of that place of the Temple where the Altar stood, and where so many Burnt-offerings were made: <hi>Even so Lord God Almighty, true and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are thy judgements:</hi> For I can witness what a number of Innocent Souls were burnt with fire and fagot in the <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not submit to the gross Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Idolatries, and incredible, nay, impossible figments of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, and so were made Burnt-offerings or Sacrifices to their intolerable Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Ambition, and Tyrannical Cruelty.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the Name of God which hath power over these plagues, and they repented not to give him Glory.</hi> They are so vext, that they blaspheme the Name of God, and rather vilifie the Scriptures, and the Spirit that wrote them, than repent them of their sins, and give Glory to God by acknowledging the Truth; as certainly the true sense of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Apocalypse where they are known and acknowledged, tend exceeding much to the Glory of God, and the illustration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of his Providence. And this may go for the mystical sense of the effusion of the <hi>Vial</hi> upon the <hi>Sun:</hi> But there may be also a Political one; and then Sun is to be understood of the greatest Secular Power within the Papal Jurisdiction; which therefore is the

was full of darkness:</hi> Which is again one of the plagues of <hi>Aegypt.

               <p>And this reaches to the end of all the Vials, as the Eleventh, Fourteenth and Sixteenth Chapters do: But the following verse might very well have been the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Nineteenth Chapter, and the four first Verses been adjoyned to the end of the foregoing Chapter. For, for the better understanding of things, here is plainly a going back to the sixth and seventh Vials, which, (as also the Visions of the Harvest and Wine-press) are marvellously illustrated, and have their meaning certainly discovered hereby, as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Explication; so that this will be found no vain repetition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And a voice came out of the Throne,</hi> or from the place where the Throne was, namely the voice of Christ. This answers to the Son of Man who puts in his sickle, and reaps the Harvest, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 16. which immediately precedes the treading of the Wine-press, which contemporizeth with the following Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Rider of the White Horse, as that with the seventh Vial: <hi>Saying, * Praise our God all ye his Servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings</hi>; which are the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98585:116"/>
symbols of multitudes of people, <hi>saying, Allelujah, For the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth</hi>; that is, his Kingdom begins to appear now most gloriously, the waters of <hi>Euphrates</hi> being dryed up to make way for the Kings of the East, to joyn in one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the pure Church of God. This therefore synchronizeth with the sixth Vial.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce and give honour to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her self ready</hi>; that is to say, the people of the Jews are now in a readiness to joyn in Communion with the truly Catholick and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of Christ, and that is a ground of the greatest joy indeed:<note place="margin">Rom. 11.15.</note> 
                  <hi>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?</hi> as the Apostle speaks.</p>

               <p n="9">9. <hi>And he saith unto me, Write</hi>; as being a thing of great moment, and never to be forgotten: <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that are called to the Marriage Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lamb</hi>; that is, O thrice happy they that shall see those Times, and partake of them, and shall celebrate the Espousals of the People of the Jews with
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98585:117"/>
Christ their <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and true <hi>Messias,</hi> as he will then be acknowledged: <hi>And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God</hi>; as unlikely as it may seem to men, that these dry bones shall live again, (as the Jews are represented in that Vision of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi>) yet the thing will certainly come to pass.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>And I fell at his feet, and worshipped him:</hi> This he did being so full of joy and transport at so transcendent good news touching his Countrey-men the Jews; for whom <hi>Paul</hi> also had such a zeal, that he could wish himself accursed from Christ, that they might be implanted into him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. Wherefore it is no wonder S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> did so profound Reverence to the messenger of News so unspeakably grateful, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and enravishing: <hi>And he said unto me, See thou do it not:</hi> For it should seem the mien of his face conjoyned with the posture of his body betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such a pitch of veneration and worship, as might seem more than Civil, and not due nor warrantable from one fellow-Creature to another; <hi>I am thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-servant, and</hi> the fellow-servant <hi>of thy brethren that have the testimony of Iesus, worship God.</hi> Reserve such high pitches of affection and veneration for God alone, whom thou art to love with all thy heart, and all thy soul, but thy Neighbour only as thy self. And if <hi>Iohn</hi>'s worshipping this Angel visible and present be thus reprovable, what is the worshipping of Saints and Angels invisible in Temples, and at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and Images consecrated to them, but the dregs of Idolatry? <hi>For the testimony of Iesus is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecie:</hi> He was not to be taken with so profound admiration and veneration of the Angel, for that he was such a Prophet, for he was yet but his fellow-servant, as also of others that had the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony

of Jesus,<note place="margin">1 Corinth. 12.3.</note> 
                  <hi>For no man can say Iesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> They cannot be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Witnesses of Jesus out of love and loyalty to him, but they must be inspired by his spirit; and so their witnessing of him is an effect of the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, the spirit enabling them firmly to believe and declare beyond what flesh and blood can attain to: Such a spirit of Prophecy was in the two Witnesses, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. whose faith was so strong, that they could suffer the utmost for the Truth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>And I saw Heaven opened.</hi> Now follows the Vision that contemporizes with the <hi>treading</hi> of the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> and with the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> which will give admirable light to both. <hi>And behold a white Horse:</hi> An Horse with his Rider doth signifie Rule and Command, and the colour white, Prosperity and Success: <hi>And he that sat upon him was called faithfull and true, and in righteousness doth he judge and make war.</hi> In the <hi>seventh Vial</hi> there was mention of the battel of <hi>that great day of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> but no mention there of any Armies, or any Captain of the Forces. Lo! here is the Commander of the Army, Christ himself, the <hi>Eternal Logos,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Humane Nature, who in Righteousness doth judge and make war.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>His eyes were as a flame of fire.</hi> Fire is a symbol of <hi>Intellectuality,</hi> especially a <hi>flaming</hi> fire that implies light. Thus we read of <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98585:118"/>
Intellectual Beings are, as also their Operations, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by virtue of the more pure etherial and <hi>igneous</hi> spirits: <hi>And on his head were many Crowns:</hi> For the Kings of the East by this time had submitted to him, besides what might be done under the fourth Vial. <hi>And he had a name written, that no man knew but himself.</hi> This in brief signifies the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibleness and imperscrutableness of the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Saviour; he alone that is it, being able to comprize it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And he was cloathed with a vesture dipt in blood:</hi> This partly relates to his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> and partly to the Vision of the <hi>treading</hi> of the <hi>Wine-press</hi> where blood is said to ascend up to the horse-bridles, whence his <hi>garments would be dipt in blood:</hi> And is a sign that these two Visions, this and that of the Wine-press, tend to the same thing. <hi>And his name is called the Word of God:</hi> which may include not only the <hi>Eternal Logos</hi> that was made flesh, but even the written Word of God also. The <hi>false Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Idolatrous Hierarchy of Rome,</hi> upon their pretense of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> had silenced not only the express Law of the written Word of God, but most coarsly and barbarously had trodden down those innate Principles of Morality and Reason, that the Eternal Word had implanted in the souls of men, and by terrour and cruel force did what she could to smother, stifle and extinguish them. But here the scene of things is changed, and the pure Word of God like a valiant Heros triumphs over the corrupt, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, idolatrous and contradictious Doctrines and Institutes of a company of deceitful and deceivable men, which in this Vision is called the <hi>false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>

               <p n="15">15. <hi>And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the Nations:</hi> This again showes, that this is no Carnal Warfare, but as it is said in the Epistle to the Hebrews; <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron</hi>; in allusion to the second Psalm, which is a Prophecie of these Times of the <hi>Messias: Thou shalt Rule them with a Rod of Iron, and break them in pieces like a potters vessel:</hi> which is a Prophetick symbol of that wonderful contrition of heart, that the word of God makes when it is sincerely, seasonably and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evibrated against the Enemies of his Kingdom: <hi>And he treadeth the Wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of God Almighty.</hi> This referrs to the Vision of the <hi>Wine-press, Chap.</hi> 14. whereby it is again manifest, that those two Visions belong to one and the same thing.

Wherefore it is plain, that those slain with the Sword are those that are converted by the powerful Preaching of the Word, which is sharper than any two-edged sword: And then this great Feast of the Fowles is the Joy of Angels, who if they

rejoyce so much at the Conversion of one single sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, what a feast of Joy is it with them, when whole Countries and Kingdoms are converted to the True Faith in Christ, and are made <hi>part</hi> of his Church or Kingdom. * And that Fowles signifie Spirits, and good Spirits here, or Angels, is plain from the Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listical signification of that Word, and the tenour of this Vision.</p>

               <p>In all which Visions, three parties of men are plainly distinguished. In the Vision of the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> the <hi>Vintagers</hi> or <hi>Treaders</hi> of the <hi>Grapes,</hi> are the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,</hi> or the pure Christian party. In the <hi>seventh Vial,</hi> the said party, are those that are the Armies of God Almighty at the battel in <hi>Armageddon,</hi> or those <hi>Boanerges</hi>'s with the third part of the City, which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98585:120"/>
they thundered over so divided, <hi>(viz.)</hi> into three parts. In this Vision the <hi>Heros</hi> on the <hi>White Horse</hi> with his <hi>Armies</hi>: This is the pure Christian party in all these three Visions. But the obdurate <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian party</hi> in the Vision of the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> is the <hi>City</hi> without which (as being a company uncapable of conviction and contrition) the Wine-press is trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. In the seventh Vial the <hi>Beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great, who pelted with Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones of a talent weight, blasphemes but does not repent. And in this <hi>Vision</hi> of the Rider of the White Horse, the <hi>Beast and the false Prophet</hi>: This is the Antichristian party in all the three Visions. But the <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> party is denoted in the <hi>Vision</hi> of the <hi>Wine-press</hi> by the <hi>Grapes</hi> there <hi>gathered</hi> and <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> and having their <hi>Edomitish</hi> blood squeezed out of them, (<hi>who is this that comes from</hi> Edom, <hi>with his died garments from</hi> Bozrah,<note place="margin">Isai. 63.1.</note> which <hi>Bozrah</hi> the very name signifies <hi>Vintage</hi>) In the <hi>seventh Vial</hi> by those under the <hi>Dragon,</hi> (for all Pagans or Infidels are so, he being the Old Opposer of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messias</hi>) and by the <hi>Cities of the Nations</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> who are said to fall, as being thunderstruck at the powerfull voice of those Evangelical <hi>Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>'s over the great City divided into three parts.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people; And God himself shall be with them</hi>; namely, by his Spirit, whose presence shall sensibly and feelingly be acknowledged by all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters of this New <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> For this is the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the Reign of Christ in the Spirit, of which the Apostles of old witnessed, <hi>Know ye not that your bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost?</hi>

to the Laws of God and Christ, unless they would be persecuted, and barbarously murthered: <hi>And be their God,</hi> that is, their Protector and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender from all manner of Evil: As it follows.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes:</hi> This Reign of Christ in the <hi>Millennium</hi> will be with that equity, goodness and sweetness, that no mans heart that is good shall need to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with grief, or express his grief by his tears: <hi>And there shall be no more death</hi>; no more bloody massacrings of the Faithful Witnesses of Christ, or burning them at the stake with fire and fagot, as was done under the Tyranny of the Great Whore: <hi>neither sorrow</hi> for the loss of Friends thus barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously and inhumanely murthered: <hi>nor crying,</hi> no clamours against gross injustice and cruelty, or cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for the tortures that are inflicted on poor innocent men for keeping a good conscience towards God: <hi>Neither shall there be any more pain,</hi> by noisom and wearisom imprisonments, or what other hardships they are put to for the testimony of a good conscience; <hi>For the former things are passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:</hi> The bloody Whore or false Prophet with the Beast are now in the Lake of fire burning with brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone: And <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great, like a milstone, sunk into the bottom of the Sea never to rise again: Such is the state of the blessed <hi>Millennium</hi> when it comes; nor shall <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> prevail against the Holy City in the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval.</p>

For I account it a juvenile piece of pride and wantonness in any one to innovate where things seem right already, unless he bring that which is plainly truer. For this affectation of bringing of something new in interpreting Scripture, does but dissettle the minds of those that are to be informed, and makes the Holy Writt to lose its scope and efficacy, and to seem more uncertain, and obscure than indeed it is.

of this Book, without carefully consulting the most likely Interpreters before them; it is no inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit in them, but a blind puff of pride and vanity of mind, a blast of self-conceitedness, that drives them upon such rash and dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, out of a bold presumption, that others have not attempted these things as much in the fear of God, and with as good assistances of his Spirit, as they can pretend to.

            <p>I will hint some few examples, as in the Prophecy of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> (my <hi>Exposition</hi> whereof is so confirmed in the tenth Chapter of it, to omit other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that I think it is impossible for any man that is not prodigiously laden with prejudice not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced) there, in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and again in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi> both which successions of the Church succeed the <hi>Smyrnean,</hi> which are those ages of the Church in which the Church suffered bitter Persecutions from the <hi>Pagans,</hi> doth the Spirit of God complain of their eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Idolothyta,</hi> which is turning the Lords Supper, which is a Feast upon a Sacrifice, into an Idolatrous Solemnity, like the eating of things Sacrificed unto Idols: In which the Idolatry of their Mass is plainly perstringed. And this is evidently in the successions of the Church, after she had got the victory over crude Paganism. Again in the <hi>Sealed-Book-Prophecie</hi> where such an Exposition we have given out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mede</hi> of the six first Seals, as against which neither Papist nor Protestant can justly except, and whence the six Trumpets must needs shoot into the <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi> and <hi>Thyatiran</hi> Successions of the Church; it is manifest that <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> under the fifth and sixth Trumpets, invade the Empire as a Scourge for their Idolatry, as plainly appears from <hi>Ch.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 20. where the rest of the men that were not killed by these Plagues are said <hi>not to repent them of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Daemons, and Idols of Silver, and Idols of Gold,</hi> &amp;c. Where <hi>Daemons</hi> according to the Greek idiom, signify either Angels, or the Souls of men, any Spirits out of Terrestrial bodies, the Souls
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98585:147"/>
of Saints and Spirits of Angels. And lastly in the <hi>Opened-Book-Prophecy, Chap.</hi> II. what is the <hi>tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under-foot the outward Court by the Gentiles</hi> for fourty two months, but the over-running the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire again with Idolatry and Persecution (of which <hi>Gentilism,</hi> or <hi>Paganism</hi> consists) for so many months, or <hi>Semitimes</hi> of months of years? And what the 7000. <hi>names of men, vers.</hi> 13. but Idolatrous Titles, or men of those Titles that belong to the <hi>seventh head</hi> of the Beast which is an Idolatrous head? And <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. the Beast there rising out of the Sea with ten Crowned Horns, plainly shows it is the Empire after its division into so many Kingdoms. Which therefore is under the seventh head. And all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads there are said to have names of Blasphemy upon them, that is of Idolatry. Besides, this Beast is said to be the healed beast, and the image of the Dragon that received the deadly wound in his fight with <hi>Michael</hi> and the Martyrs. Which plainly shows that the Empire after Christanity was setled in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came again an Idolatrous persecuting Beast, as the old Pagan Empire was. And lastly, (not to number up all we might) <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> with her cup of Fornication, that is of Idolatry, in her hand, as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself cannot but interpret it, and sitting upon a Beast full of Names of Blasphemy, that is of Idolatry, again, even according to <hi>Grotius,</hi> what can this be but the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire become Idolatrous? But they put it off by saying, it is the Pagan Empire, and <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan; which is a thing impossible. For the Woman here sitting upon the Beast, that <hi>was, is not, and yet is,</hi> which was never true of the Roman Empire, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had been Christian, it cannot be understood of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98585:147"/>
the Roman Empire Pagan. And that conceit of <hi>Domitian</hi> being this Beast, it is such a childish trifle or sleight whiffle, that it is a wonder to me that any one that had any freeness of judgment, or soundness of reason, should ever fancy such a thing: but having spoken of this in my Preface I will say no more of it here. From these few places to omit several others, it is abundantly evident that that truely infallible Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, even the Spirit of God himself, has decided the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie concerning the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and has declared them guilty of that crime, and the Protestants guiltless of any crime of Schism, in leaving the Communion of that Church. Which is a thing seriously to be considered by all the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Christendom, that they may not listen to the voice of the blood-thirsty <hi>Iezabel,</hi> when she shall solicite the Kings of the Earth, to the persecution of the Servants of God and Christ, because they cannot bow down to stocks and stones with her, nor submit to any other of her points of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Now for any invidious cavils against this firm <hi>Protestant Exposition</hi> of the Apocalypse,<note n="III" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Authors Answer to certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious Cavils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protestant Exposition of the seven Heads of the Beast.</hi>
               </note> I hope, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou wilt set as little by them as I do my self. For it may be it will be thought by some, an high piece of Rudeness and Incivility, in that this <hi>Protestant Exposition</hi> of the seven heads of the Beast, makes all the Emperours since the Apostasie of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatry, to be part of the seventh head, which is one of the heads of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> though otherwise never so noble and vertuous. And the like cavils may be raised touching the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they be never so Learned and Pious, that they will make part of the two Horned Beast, that has the Horns of a Lamb, but the voice of a Dragon. And
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98585:148"/>
I must confess the same may be alledged against mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those six forms of Pagan Government, Kings, Consuls, Dictators, Decemviri, Triumviri, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, six heads of <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> When amongst the Emperours it is well known, what an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of vertue <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> was, and that <hi>Tully,</hi> a Roman Consul, for Wit, Vertue, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, was the glory of the Roman Empire. But I can briefly answer for my self, that I never, since I understood <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> to be part of those two heads of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> had in the least the more diminishing thoughts of their Vertues and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections I had observed in them before. For I knew before, they were Pagan Idolaters, and that it was the privilege of their nature, to bear up so stoutly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the disadvantages of their Religion they were born under: And there is the same reason of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Emperors and other Princes of the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Religion. The profession of an Idolatrous Religion ought not to derogate from their natural, or acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfections; only all good men will heartily and solicitously wish that their souls were as safe as their personal reputation.</p>
            <p>And I charitably judge of them of the Roman Church, who do not stick to call all Protestant Kings and Princes, be they never so great or never so good, <hi>Hereticks</hi>; (and by the punishment they allot to those they call so, any one may judge what wretches and vile persons they deem them,) that they intend notwithstanding no derogation thereby to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal worth or vertue. But here is the great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we call them nothing but what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls them; but they nickname others against all reason and Scripture, adding to false and bitter
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98585:148"/>
words, unjust and barbarous persecutions: And what we have said concerning Emperours and Kings, the same is to be said of the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> No Popes personal perfections and vertues are touched, but the Idolatrous and Antichristian constitution and frame of things, such as every Pope is to succeed into, and which make a Pope a Pope.</p>
            <p>But as for my interpreting the two Horns of the Beast of the Episcopal Mitre,<note n="IV" place="margin">
                  <hi>His Answer touching his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the two Horns of the Beast of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and his sharpness of stile in his</hi> Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that no Protestant Bishop take exceptions, the interpretation is not mine, but <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi>'s, as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> cites him. <hi>De Tempor.

            <p>And as for the sharpness of stile in my Exposition against the Idolatry and blood-thirstiness of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hierarchy; I am satisfyed in my self, that I have not the least ill will to the persons of any Romanists, though I utterly abhor their Religion; and I had not been a faithful Interpreter of the Apocalypse, which in a great part of it is a very keen, but just Satyr against the gross wickednesses of the Roman Church, if my Exposition had not had also a due
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98585:149"/>
keenness and sharpness with it to awaken them, if it were possible, out of their errours, into the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the truth. And that a main body of them will continue obdurate, even to the effusion of the <hi>last Vial</hi>; the clearness of the Vision has driven me to acknowledge such a <hi>comminatory</hi> prediction too likely to come to pass, unless a timely and sincere Repentance open a way to them for the embracing of the truth.</p>
            <p>These few things I thought not amiss to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, Christian Reader, that thou mayst take no offence at any thing, nor be entangled.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it being a Prophecy, will be future: For it is nonsense to say Wings were given her to fly into a place into which she had gotten already. And therefore, <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. the Serpent casts out the flood of waters, whilst she was in her flight, that she might be drowned before she got into the Wilderness, where she was to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and nourished: And <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. the Earth opened her mouth and drunk up the flood, that she might pass safe into the Wilderness; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all this is before she gets into the Wilderness; and this casting out the flood by the Serpent, is his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi> persecution of her, mentioned <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. But that the Dragon, <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. went to wage War with a party of the Womans Seed, that had not gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderness, is a meer figment of <hi>R. H.</hi> There is no such thing in the Text, and it is contrary to the plain sense thereof: For no man can doubt, but that Woman is the whole Catholick Church;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98585:154"/>
whom to phansie not to have fled whole into the Wilderness, is as absurd, as to phansie a Woman to fly into the Wilderness, but to leave some limbs of her behind her; and the Seed of the Woman is part of the Woman her self. The Woman, is <hi>Ecclesia to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, semen ejus singuli qui ad ecclesiam pertinent,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> notes upon the place. And therefore if the Woman be in the Wilderness, her Seed must be in the Wilderness; and this Seed distinguished from her Seed before she came into the Wilderness. Whence the sense is clear, That as the Dragon persecuted the Womans Seed before she got into the Wilderness, so being he could not hinder her going into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by his spuing out of that flood; he maliciously meditated some mischief and hostility against her seed in the Wilderness: which he presently did, by raising the Healed Beast against them in the Chapter immediately following. Thus solidly has M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> evinced, that the time of the <hi>healed Beast</hi> and of the <hi>Womans remaining in the Wilderness,</hi> do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence together; and it plainly appears, that it is even nothing that <hi>R. H.</hi> has alledged against it.</p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s other proof of this Synchronism, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ending of the times of the Beast with the sixth Trumpet, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.14, 15, 17. to this <hi>R. H.</hi> speaks more materially than to the former. But for brevity sake, I will only note this, That there is nothing of moment alledged that reaches any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to prove that the Reign of the Beast does not end with the sixth Trumpet. Which is a thing I do easily grant, but yet in the mean time I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the fulfilling of his fourty two months is at the <hi>exitus</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, which respects the duration of his Kingdom in the <hi>Entireness</hi> thereof.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98585:155"/>
Which Entireness was broken at the Rising of the Witnesses, and therefore the Entireness of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is <hi>Synchronal</hi> to the two Witnesses Prophesying in Sackcloth, they being both <hi>Isochronal,</hi> or of equal time, as all those four <hi>Synchronals</hi> are expressly noted to be in the very Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hence by these two Arguments of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s demonstrated to be <hi>Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> namely the Womans abode in the Wilderness, and the restored Beasts Reign for forty two months beginning together, and being <hi>Isochronal</hi> are <hi>Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi> And the restored Beasts Reign for forty two months, ending with the Witnesses Prophesying in Sackcloth, and being <hi>Isochronal</hi> are also <hi>Synchronal.</hi> Therefore the Womans being in the Wilderness, and the Prophesying of the Witnesses in Sackcloth are <hi>Synchronal.</hi> And <hi>R. H.</hi> himself cannot deny, but the treading under foot the outward Court, and the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses prophesying in sackcloth are Synchronal: whence it is manifest that they all four Synchronize one with another. His evasion by asserting the Beast, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. and the Beast, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. not to be the same, is very sleight. For <gap reason="foreign">

is short and pithy. For they are, saith he, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Antecedents of <hi>Synchronals.</hi> The fight of the Dragon, and the Womans travailing with child to be delivered, and her difficulties in those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, the immediate Antecedents of her habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Wilderness, and of the ten-horned Beast. And the Inner Court the immediate Antecedent of the Outer. Here <hi>R. H.</hi> first in general denyes the first Synchronism, which I have maintained against him to be true, nor is it needful to repeat what I have already said. Secondly, in particular he says, though the Womans travail, and the fight of the Dragon with <hi>Michael</hi> do contemporate, and the flight of the Woman into the Wilderness immediately succeed them: yet the restored Beast does not immediately succeed the overthrow of the Dragon by <hi>Michael.</hi> For before he raises the Beast out of the Sea, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes the Woman. The Woman flyes into the Wilderness. He sends a flood after her to carry her away out of the Wilderness. The earth openeth her mouth and drinketh up the flood, and when all this is done, he leaves the Wilderness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I have answered already upon the first Synchronism that all this noise is nothing but this, That the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon persecuted the Woman in her flight into the Wilderness, by sending a flood to carry her away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she got thither, but that Stratagem not succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he raised the restored Beast to disturb her by that time she got thither. So that the Dragon is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his <hi>own person</hi> till that time, and continues the fight as it were though upon the ground. So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate therefore is the raising of the restored Beast to war against her Seed in the Wilderness, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the spuing out the water to hinder her
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98585:160"/>
flight thither was done of the Dragons side, before his raising of the said Beast. Which therefore de dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht by that time she had got into the Wilderness. This the Text plainly implies, even according to <hi>R. H.</hi> his paraphrase, who with the vulgar Latin and generality of Interpreters, and with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> himself reads <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. thus, <hi>And the Dragon was wroth with the Woman,</hi> (namely, when he saw his spuing out that flood of water after her in her flight towards the Wilderness did not succeed) <hi>and went to make war with the remnant of her Seed, which keep the Commandments of God, and have the testimony of Iesus Christ, and he stood upon the sand of the Sea.</hi> And then the next Chapter begins, <hi>And I saw a Beast rise up,</hi> as it were conjured up by the Dragon that stood upon the sand of the Sea, in a readiness to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render his power or forces, and his seat and great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to him, <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. Whence it is plain that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored Beast immediately succeeds the Womans flight into the Wilderness, and therefore begins with her arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val thither. No action of the Dragon besides that spue of his, which was in the flight of the Woman, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the beginning of her flight, and his raising the <hi>restored Beast.</hi> Which therefore is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceived to be dispatcht by that time the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man got into the Wilderness.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the <hi>Inner Court</hi> or the measuring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he grants it precedes the conculcation of the outer Court, and that the fourty two months of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles begin when the measuring of the <hi>Inner Court</hi> is ended, but he denies that the <hi>Inner Court</hi> Synchronizes with the Womans travail, and the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon. And why? because the concul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Outer Court,</hi> and the Abode of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98585:160"/>
in the Wilderness do not Synchronize. This is all the reason, which by what I have said upon the first Synchronism is no reason. For I have made it good there that they do Synchronize: And it is needless here to repeat the same over again.</p>

                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s mention of a repeated Prophecy, and says that, <hi>oportet te iterum prophetare, Chap.</hi> 10.11. does not signifie that he must begin a new Prophecy <hi>ab ovo,</hi> but go on to Prophecy of other things, and times.

                     <hi>Mede</hi> briefly proves thus. The Beast and Virgin Company sealed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporize by Synch. 4. Part. 1. This company sealed <hi>quatenus</hi> sealed commences with the seventh Seal, <hi>Rev. Chap.</hi> 7. namely it begins in that small Interim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the end of the sixth, and beginning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seal. For the nature of the Vision of sealing persons can imply no considerable time to break any square, as touching the commencing of these Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronals, especially it being performed by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Angels. Therefore says M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede,</hi> the ten-horned Beast and the rest of his fellow Synchronals begin with the seventh Seal.</p>
                  <p>But in the second place, The end of the Beast, saith he, contemporizeth with the end of the sixth Trumpet, the Reign of the Beast being Synchronal to the time of the mourning of the Witnesses, which
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98585:161"/>
ends at the <hi>exitus</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. And therefore the Reign of the Beast (<hi>viz.</hi> as to the <hi>Entireness</hi> of his Kingdom) ends with the sixth Trumpet. Which plainly proves this Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism of the Beast with the seventh Seal, as far as the first six Trumpets reach, which was the thing to be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R. H.</hi> in his answer to the first part of this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, is plainly not so much copious as loose and spungy, and not at all solid, offering eight particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but so weak and impertinent, that I profess I am half ashamed to recite them. The first of them supposes the events of the Visions to fall in that order the Visions are rehearsed, which is to beg the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The second, That two opposites may be actually opposite the one to the other, though only one of them be in being. The third, That the sealed Regiments of the Lamb, and the marked slaves of the Beast, are only opposite in respect of their Religion, and persecution for Religion, whenas they are opposite as the raised forces of two hostile parties, that swear them and retain them in pay and readiness, occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to assault one the other, till a conquest on one side or the other be obtained. The fourth, That <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.2. which mentions the victory over the Beast, implyes the sealed Regiments fought not till the latter end of the Reign of the Beast, which is a marvellous weak inference. For though they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally fought against him from the beginning, yet they might not obtain the expected victory before the last, or seventh semitime of his Reign. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such stuff there is which he brings, but I have answered it upon Synch. 1. Part 1. The fifth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, That the Beast has no being before the seventh
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98585:162"/>
Trumpet, which is built upon the first fond supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The sixth, That the fourth Synchronism of Part 1. is false, which I have maintained to be true. The seventh, That this present Synchronism is to be understood of the Servants of God simply; whenas it is understood of them <hi>quatenus</hi> sealed. The eighth and last, That the companies are sealed, not to call them out against the Beast, but to preserve them from the storms of the ensuing Trumpets (which plainly implies, by the by, that their continuance is all along the Trumpets, till they get a new denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.) But I say they are sealed in both regards, both to secure them from the ensuing storms, and to confirm them in a constant courage against the debauching decrees of the Beast. And their being twelve Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the order of the Tribes put according to the merits of their zeal against Idolatry, plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies as much. This little is more than enough to his pretended Arguments against the first part of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s demonstration.</p>
                  <p>What he says against the second part is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and express to the purpose. And I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess he does prove, That the latter end of the Beasts Reign does not Synchronize with the <hi>exit</hi> of the sixth Trumpet; but it is sufficient for my design, that the end of his Reign as to the <hi>Entireness</hi> of his Kingdom does Synchronize with it; and that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> has very firmly demonstrated. Lastly, two of those four things which he says M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> supposes, he does not merely suppose, but prove by vertue of his Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisms, <hi>viz.</hi> That the sealed Virgins, and the two Witnesses be all one Company, and That the 1260 days of the Witnesses be the same with the fourty two months of the Beast. But I confess one of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98585:162"/>
other two, <hi>viz.</hi> That the whole reign of the Beast is contained within forty two months, is false: but the other, that the Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. is the same with the Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. if he supposes it, it is an easy and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest supposition. For the Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. being the beast <hi>rising out of the Sea,</hi> as I noted above, as well as the Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. and the times of them both being not only equal but Synchronal, and they both perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the witnesses; for <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. those there whom the Beast is raised to persecute and who are said <hi>to have the testimony</hi> or <hi>witness of Iesus Christ,</hi> what can they be but the witnesses, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11? To all which you may add that even without the use of these Synchronisms Interpreters generally, as you may see in <hi>à Lapide</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> understood the same thing by these two Beasts, namely Antichrist, which is a sign they took the two Beasts to be one and the same Beast; so easy and modest a supposition is this, or rather more than a supposition, a truth demonstrable from his Synchronisms and other observations from the Texts of Scripture. And <hi>R. H.</hi> himself making this Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. the same with the <hi>Scarlet Beast Chap.</hi> 17. this last Beast being the same with the ten-horned Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. as I have demonstrated in my <hi>Ioynt exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the ten-horned Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. must be the same with the Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>

                  <p>This Synchronism in a more large and improper sense may be more passable.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98585:164"/>
of the Beast nor Synchronize with the thousand years, but succeed them.</hi> Which how false it is three or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s four arguments will give us to understand. For the first of them though it be too hard for <hi>R. H.</hi> to answer, yet I will decline as less firm. For the marriage of the Lamb <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. preceeds the seventh Vial, but the marriage <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 9. does follow the said Vial. But <hi>R. H.</hi> his answer is, That the first marriage is with the Spouse in grace, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is with the Spouse in glory; which is pointblank contrary to the text, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. where the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> is said to descend from God out of Heaven, and his Tabernacle is said to be with men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s second argument is from [<hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 9.] <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> their besieging the beloved City, at the end of the thousand years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here <hi>R. H.</hi> answers, That this beloved City is not the <hi>New Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> but that the <hi>beloved City</hi> is the Church in the state of grace, the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> the Church in the state of glory, whereby he intimates, were it not so, they would be one and the same City. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> should be any other than a state of the Church upon Earth, if you consider <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 10, 24. besides many other considerations which would be too long to mention here.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is from <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. where, IT IS DONE, implyes that the same time is indigitated, that is, the certain bringing in the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> that holy City, upon the destruction of the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Murderers and Idolaters. But here <hi>R. H.</hi> harps still upon the same string, that by the first IT IS DONE, is meant the finishing of the last Vial, and the full state of grace, and by the latter IT IS
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98585:165"/>
DONE, that the state of glory was to begin, which Answer how extravagant it is I have already noted.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last argument is from <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. where the Vial-Angel, as we may so call him, that had shewed S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the condemnation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Whore the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> shows him the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> as a City that should succeed in its place. To which <hi>R. H.</hi> returns this answer, That the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> does not succeed the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Beast and <hi>Babylon</hi> immediately, but that there is first the thousand years, then the insurrection and destruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> after that the last judgment and the lake of fire for the cursed, and then the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> for the blessed. For which he has no reason but that they are writ in this order, which is so gross and fallible that no Interpreters rely upon it alone. And these many Synchronisms of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> so firm and solid are a demonstration against this dull Hypothesis, and yet this is all the force of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But let me ask him a question or two: If this <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> be a state in Heaven, why is it said to come down from God out of Heaven, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 10? And why are the Kings of the earth said to bring their glory and honour into it, <hi>vers.</hi> 24? And how comes it to pass that the trees on this side and that side of the River of this <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> that the leaves of them are said to be for the healing of the Nations <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>vers.</hi> 2? shall there be any sores or maladies in Heaven?</p>

First because these <hi>Palm-bearers</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately succeed the <hi>Sealed company</hi> that Synchronize with the Beast, <hi>Synch.</hi> 4. <hi>Part</hi> 1. Therefore the Beast expiring they must succeed the Beasts expiration; partial at the beginning of the seventh Trumpet, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal at the beginning of the second Thunder. The second argument is, that these <hi>Palm-bearers</hi> are the Citizens of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> by comparing <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 4. And the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> Synchronizeth with the seventh Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>To the first <hi>R.H.</hi> answers, That these <hi>Palm-bearers</hi> immediately succeed the time of the sealing of the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin company,</hi> not the <hi>race</hi> of the sealed. Which is a wonderful weak cavil if we consider the end of their sealing, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should be kept safe in all the dangers and difficulties they were to grapple withal, and preserve their Virginity still against all the force, solicitations, and persecutions they should find under the six first Trumpets; For these sealed ones are the Souldiers of the Lamb. Now compare this true and undeniable Hypothesis, with <hi>vers.</hi> 14. which speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these <hi>Palm-bearers</hi> saith, These are they who came out of great tribulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Could these then immediately succeed the sealing, and come off victoriously before the conflict? What a shameful cavil was this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:98585:166"/>To the second he answers. That these <hi>Palm-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> are not any men upon Earth, but the Souls of Martyrs in Heaven while these Companies were seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Earth. And that the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> is after the general Resurrection, and that therefore the <hi>Palm-bearers</hi> cannot immediately succeed the sealed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by their being Citizens of that City. But as for this latter supposition how absurd it is I have shown already. And as for the former, he says it without any ground and against the natural tenour of the Text, which compares the great and innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Apostolick followers of Christ after the expiration of the six first Trumpets, with that smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and more definite number of the sealed under them. Besides <hi>R.

                  <p>But now that the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> and <hi>Opened Book</hi> be one and the same Book, I briefly prove by these two arguments. First from the intertexture of the Visions or dependance one of another, so that one could not be well understood without the other, which is a plain argument that they all belong to one Volume. But that they cannot be well understood one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, is admirably made out by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98585:167"/>
Synchronisms. And there is apertly mention made of the sixth and seventh Trumpet which belong to the Prophecies of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> in the Prophecies of the <hi>Opened Book Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>The other argument is, That whereas there are such high Encomiums of the <hi>Sealed Book Chap.</hi> 5. unless the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> and the <hi>Opened Book</hi> be all one, the <hi>Opened Book</hi> will have none of those Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums, though it contains the more concerning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the two.</p>
                  <p>But now lastly, That notwithstanding the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> Prophecies and the <hi>Opened Book</hi> Prophecies make but one Volume, yet at <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. there begins a new set of Prophecies commencing from the same Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha that the Seals do, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s arguments to me seem sufficiently solid.</p>
                  <p>The first whereof is his <hi>Synchronisms,</hi> which if true as I have maintained they are, plainly prove that the Prophecies of the <hi>Opened Book</hi> contemporize with the Visions of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> Prophecies.</p>
                  <p>The second, That there is a light touch <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. upon the seventh Trumpet. And the seven Thunders immediately succeeding the sixth Trumpet are in all reason to be conceived to fill the space of the seventh Trumpet, as the seven Trumpets fill up the space of the seventh Seal. Wherefore unless we will fancy the Prophecies of the Opened Book to run beyond the Goal of the Apocalypse; after this they are to begin from the same lists of the race a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that is to commence from the same Epocha that the Prophecy of the <hi>Seals</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>The third is taken from <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 11. where upon <hi>Iohn</hi>'s swallowing down the <hi>Opened Book</hi> it is said to him, <hi>Thou must prophesy again before many
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98585:168"/>
peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings,</hi> which seems to import that he was to run over the same space of time again, and that his Visions would be of the like large extent as before.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last is taken from <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>And the voice which I heard from Heaven,</hi> viz. as of a Trumpet, <hi>spake unto me again,</hi> which being an introduction to the Prophecy of the <hi>Seven Churches Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. and to the Prophecy of the <hi>Sealed Book Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and being set here again before the Prophecy of the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> it is a sign that the Prophecy of the <hi>Opened Book</hi> is a new System of Prophecies begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the same Epocha with the former.</p>
                  <p>Now to the first, <hi>R. H.</hi> his answer is very obvious, That he has confuted M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s Synchronisms. But what a nothing it is which he has alledged against them, let any impartial Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>To the second I do not see what material answer he does direct, unless it be, that the sixth Trumpet is continued to <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. where it is said, <hi>The second wo is past.</hi> Which arguments is repeated again with a pretense of five more, Disp. VII. Quaes. 1. but they being so lax and tautological I will comprise the strength of them, that pretend to have any, in these two. The first therefore is, That the close of the sixth Trumpet is not set down at the end of the ninth Chapter nor at <hi>vers.</hi> 6, or 7. of the tenth, but at <hi>vers.</hi> 14. of the eleventh. Nor are there in the other Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets any heterogeneous Visions interserted besides the <hi>Visum</hi> belonging to each Trumpet. Therefore all from the beginning of the sixth Trumpet <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 13. to the close thereof <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. is the <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trumpet, it not being there said, the first Vision of the little Book is past, but, <hi>the second wo is past.</hi>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:98585:168"/>
This is the very strength and quintessence of his first, second, third and sixth argument. And the fifth is but a toy fetched from a Supposition, that if they that divided the Apocalypse into Chapters had begun the tenth Chapter at <hi>vers.</hi> 13. of the ninth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it to <hi>vers.</hi> 14. of the eleventh, none would have questioned but all that were the <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>To all which I shall answer in order. And I. That there was no need of setting down at the end of the ninth Chapter a note of the close of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, it being to be observed in every one of the five foregoing Trumpets that each have but one <hi>Visum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them. Wherefore the description of the Vision of the <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen, which is the <hi>Visum</hi> of this sixth Trumpet, being dispatched, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to any one that is not over oscitant to conclude, the sixth Trumpet is past without its being said so. But again to awaken his oscitancy, immediately after the <hi>Visum</hi> of this sixth Trumpet, which the Interval of the seventh necessarily succeeds, is there the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>seven Thunders</hi> to fill the space of the seventh Trumpet as the seven Trumpets fill the space of the seventh Seal. And he must be in a great dulness if not a dead sleep whom these seven Thunders will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake into a certain assurance that the sixth Trumpet ended with the Vision of the <hi>Euphratean</hi> horsemen. And that he may not think there are any Visions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to any times beyond this Interval, or that the space of the seventh Trumpet was not indigita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before; the Angel swears there shall be no more time saving that wherein the seventh Angel sounds, and in which the mystery of God is finished, <hi>v.</hi> 7. whence what follows <hi>vers.</hi> 8. must needs be in order to a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98585:169"/>
new System of Prophecies beginning from the same Epocha with that of the Seals, the race of the Seals being arrived at the utmost goal already. 2. There is no reason that the close of the sixth Trumpet should be set at the sixth verse, the sense being there imperfect, nor at the seventh, it being not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the time and times and half a time expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but of the whole seventh Trumpet as the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical sense requires, and therefore it had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to put the close of the sixth Trumpet after the seventh. 3. Nor does the note of the ending of the second wo-Trumpet set <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. argue the <hi>Visum</hi> of that Trumpet to reach thither, but only the Vision there, to end with the ending of the second wo-Trumpets <hi>time.</hi> For the seven Trumpets are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notes of the Intervals of <hi>time</hi> than of the <hi>Visions</hi> of those Intervals, the Trumpets being nothing like them, though figuratively they may denote either. But here where it is said <hi>the second wo is past,</hi> the <hi>time</hi> of the second wo-Trumpet is understood, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the Vision of the mournful Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did expire with the end of that <hi>time.</hi> Besides if it were to be understood of all that occurrs from <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. to this Chapter <hi>vers.</hi> 14. there is more woes than one, the woful condition of the Witnesses as well as of those the <hi>Euphratean</hi> horsemen vex and destroy. 4. And what follows methinks is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against himself. For the things here that he would have all of them the <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, none of the other Trumpets being charged with such heterogeneous stuff, do the better assure us that the <hi>Euphratean</hi> horsemen are the only <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trumpet. 5. And to have put <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. <hi>The first Vision of the little Book is past</hi> instead of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98585:169"/>
                     <hi>the second wo is past,</hi> had been too bare and bald, contrary to the genius of this Book of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse which was not writ for either a prophane or stupid Reader. And besides it would not have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the end that the [second wo is past] does. Which is to be of the main hinges upon which all the middle Synchronisms hang, as shall be seen anon. 6. And lastly as to the toy I mentioned, though such a division of Chapters might have the more firmly fixt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>R.H.</hi> in his gross conceit, yet it could never have imposed upon so pious and sagacious a person as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>I. Mede.</hi> But it is plain that they that did divide the Chapters as they are, and begin the tenth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Vision of the <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen, took that to be the sole <hi>Visum</hi> belonging to the sixth Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>The other argument of <hi>R. H.</hi> which he calls his fourth, I will set down in his own words. <hi>Of all the six Trumpets none have a remarkable close added to them but the fifth and sixth Trumpets only: And wherefore were these closes added to them, but that we might exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know as well where they end as where they begin? Now the fifth Trumpet ends where the close thereof is set, and that is</hi> Rev. 9. vers. 12. <hi>And therefore also the sixth Trumpet ends where the close thereof is set, and that is</hi> Rev. 11. vers. 14. <hi>and not before.</hi> This looks most like an argument of any thing that he has brought yet. But I briefly answer, that the fifth and sixth Trumpets have not that remarkable Close added to them to know where they end, there being no need of adding them for that purpose, forasmuch as the ending of them is so easily to be known without it. Are not the endings of the four first Trumpets, well enough known without any such remarkable close? For they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98585:170"/>
are known to end where the next Trumpet begins. Now it is evident that the fifth Trumpet needs no such remarkable close because the sixth Trumpet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows it, which shews the ending thereof. And yet there is added as a close to the fifth Trumpet, <hi>The first wo is past.</hi> This is undeniably true of the fifth Trumpet. And that the <hi>Visum</hi> of the sixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, that is, the <hi>Euphratean</hi> Horsemen have no need of any such remarkable close, I have proved abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly already in my answer to the first particular of his first argument. From whence it is manifest that these remarkable closes of the fifth and sixth Trumpets, must be for some other use. And to answer <hi>R. H.</hi> his demand <hi>wherefore they were added,</hi> I shall tell him, not as Notes of the ending of the <hi>Visions</hi> of those two Trumpets, but as Notes of the expiration of the <hi>time</hi> of them, as I distinguished above. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I have demonstrated to be needless, but this latter admirably useful. In brief therefore, though the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>The first wo is past,</hi> in that place is needless as to the determining the <hi>time</hi> of the fifth Trumpet, yet because the spirit of Prophecy intended to make use of the like Note <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. to denote the ending of the <hi>time</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the sixth Trumpet, he prepared the mind of the Reader for the taking notice of it by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use of it here as a Note of the ending of the <hi>time</hi> of the first wo-Trumpet. Wherefore the sense is <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. of [The second wo is past] Here ends the <hi>time</hi> of the second wo-Trumpet or sixth Trumpet, namely with the Rising of the witnesses or inchoative destruction of the Beast or expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his 42. Months. Whence this Note is plainly intended for a Note <hi>Synchronistical</hi> to show that the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98585:170"/>
end of the fourty two Months of the Beast, and the end of the sixth Trumpet do Synchronize. Which therefore is a thing of admirable importance. For the Beast and 144000 sealed Virgins Synchronizing Synch. 4. Part. 1. and the commencing of the sealed ones being just at the beginning of the first Trumpet <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. the Beast also begins and ends with the six first Trumpets, whence the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>sealing</hi> of these Virgins and this Note, <hi>The second wo is past,</hi> are as it were the two hinges on which all the middle Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals hang, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> has very well observed. And this I think is a sufficient answer to <hi>R. H.</hi> his question, <hi>wherefore were those remarkable closes added to the fifth and sixth Trumpets.</hi> But the ends he would have them added for I have demonstrated cannot be. Which is the greater confirmation they were added for this which is a most worthy and admirable end and becoming the stupendious artifice of this Book.</p>
                  <p>To the third argument of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> he answers. Admit that passage, <hi>Thou must prophesie again,</hi> &amp;c. to emply two main Prophecies, one of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> the other of the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> or that the Book maybe divided into two Tomes and the second begin at <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. yet it does not follow that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part must begin <hi>ab ovo</hi> or from the same <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> with the former. But I answer, the Vision reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the very utmost Goal of the Apocalyptick race from such a time before we come at the eighth verse, as I have clearly proved, there is all the reason in the world S. <hi>Iohn</hi> being bid to prophesie again, that his prophesying should commence from the same <hi>Epocha.</hi> As if one should intend to write two Tomes of the affairs of any Kingdom, the one <hi>Secular</hi> the other <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and that in his first Tome he had
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98585:171"/>
deduced his secular History to the last year, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to imagin but in his next Tome he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Ecclesiastick story from the same Epocha that the secular began from.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth and last he answers not unapposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>We read not,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the voice</hi> Chap. 10. vers. 8. <hi>was as the sound of a Trumpet, and therefore not likely to relate to the voice</hi> Chap. 4. vers. 1. <hi>but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the voice</hi> Chap. 10. vers. 4. <hi>For that voice</hi> Chap. 4. vers. 1. <hi>is said to be as the sound of a Trumpet, but this not.</hi> This is the first part of his answer, but he proceeds. <hi>But to what purpose he would have the Reader,</hi> saith he, <hi>to take notice of this I cannot tell. Is this an Index that the Prophecy of the little Book, as he calls it, doth contemporate with the Prophecie of the Seals? No more than the voice</hi> Chap. 4. vers. 1. <hi>is an Index that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the Seals doth contemporate with the Vision of the Seven Churches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But I briefly reply to the first, That seeing Ellipses are so usual in the Apocalypse, that the sense may not lye over bare, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> has with judgment made this supplement [as of a Trumpet] it being in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood the same voice that spoke to him at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Vision of the <hi>seven Churches</hi> and of the Prophecy of the <hi>Seals Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Nor is it said here not to be as the sound of a Trumpet, but only that qualification is not mentioned for the reason above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. But that it should be the voice mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 4. of this tenth Chapter is not at all likely. First be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then it would have been only, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> would be superfluous. But then in the second place, it being added, there ought to be understood

                  <p>I confess comparing the citations of the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with that of the last, and which to me is highly probable, allowing that the same Churches are meant in both Chapters, these two arguments of his make a fair show. But those that expound the Vision of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> litterally, will deny that the same Churches are understood in the last Chapter, but that that passage signifies indefinitely all or any of the Christian Churches for whose use this Book of Prophecies was writ. But I will easily allow <hi>R. H.</hi> this liberty to expound it of the same Churches in my <hi>Prophetical</hi> sense, and of the same Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> too in the <hi>Cabbalistical</hi> sense of that word, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies this lower region of the world or terrestrial Globe containing not only <hi>Asia</hi> but <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>America</hi> too if need were. Which spoils the conceit of his making <hi>Asia</hi> only, in the usual sense, the scene
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98585:175"/>
of the Apocalyptick Visions, though his conceit in the mean time gives countenance to my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Churches <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. to be the very Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> in my sense, and to my making the Epistles to the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> to be a Prophecy.</p>

                     <item>1. A Revelation cannot be a Mystery nor a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Revelation. They are as contrary each to other, saith he, as light is to darkness. Wherefore the whole Book of the Apocalypse being a Revelation, it cannot be a Mystery or be expounded in a <hi>Mystical</hi> sense but only in a <hi>litteral,</hi> unless where the Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us it is a Mystery, and renders to us the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical sense of the Letter. To this effect is his first argument Disp. 1. Quest. 4. and Disp. 11. Quest. 2.</item>
                     <item>2. The second, Where things are mystically to be understod they are afterwards interpreted in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse, or in other Texts of Scripture which speak of the same or the like matter. As <hi>Rev. Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>Rev. Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>&amp;c. Dan. Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 17, 23, 24. Wherefore when there is no such interpretation, the Text is litterally to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. His third is, No Scripture is mystically to be understood without evident necessity; but there is no necessity, much less any evident necessity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those things in a mystical sense which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has interpreted in a litteral. Wherefore the things above mentioned and all the rest where the Spirit or Angel does not interpret them to a mystical sense, ought to be understood in a litteral. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

                     <item>4. The fourth and last, This mystical way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting makes the Scripture a nose of wax, which
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98585:176"/>
a man may turn which way he will, subjecteth it to our vain lusts and humours, and leaves us partially to apply the good things to ourselves and our own party, and the bad things to our enemies, Disp. 11. Quest. 2. These be the main arguments for his second Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. But to the first I answer, That a <hi>Revelation</hi> may be a <hi>Mystery,</hi> that is, <hi>mystically</hi> or hiddenly conveyed, but yet plainly to be known by them that have the <hi>Key.</hi> As it is in <hi>Steganography</hi> by which Secrets are certainly conveyed or revealed, but in such a mysterious way that none but they that know the <hi>clavis</hi> or <hi>Key</hi> shall be ever the wiser. Wherefore it is not at all repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that the Apocalypse may be a <hi>Revelation</hi> and yet a <hi>Mystery,</hi> that is, a Revelation <hi>Mystically</hi> conveyed. But where is that <hi>clavis</hi> will you say, that will so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unlock the Mystery? To that I shall answer after I have answered his three following arguments for this present Paradox.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And therefore I proceed to the second, which I say does not prove that where the Holy Ghost does not interpret, the Text is <hi>litterally</hi> to be understood, but that the Interpretation of those Texts that are interpreted are made with that skill and judgment that they give sufficient light to the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, suppose of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> or of the <hi>Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>Opened Book</hi> Prophecies. And of this kind is that <hi>clavis</hi> offered <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And concerning the third I demand, when he will allow that there is <hi>evident</hi> necessity of interpreting a Text <hi>mystically</hi>? when the letter it self is simply impossible? But this then argues his ignorance of the Apocalyptick stile and of the artifice of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98585:176"/>
                     <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Prophecies, in which so carefully is observed the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in speech (which figure you may call <hi>Pithanologia</hi> or <hi>Logoprepia</hi> if you will) that no representation be over extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly incredible in the very <hi>Letter,</hi> much less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. But if he mean by an evident necessity, a <hi>moral</hi> incredibility or impossibility in the litteral sense, I say there is such an evident necessity, the litteral sense putting him upon such an extravagant Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, as that none of the Prophecies are yet fulfilled nor will be God knows when. Which is little less than blasphemy against the Divine Providence, as if he had neglected his Church in this point for sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together. Besides that the Synchronisms demonstrable out of the intrinsecal characters in the Prophecies themselves, do necessarily imply that most of the Visions are fulfilled already, but not in a <hi>litteral</hi> sense, wherefore there is evident necessity they be interpreted in a sense <hi>Mystical.</hi> To all which you may add that the Holy Ghost his interpreting some parts mystically may justly be an intimation and animation to us to follow his example in the rest.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To the fourth and last I answer, This is but the old Popish allegation against all the Scripture, unless it be <hi>fixt</hi> by the sense of the <hi>Infallible</hi> Chair, as <hi>R. H.</hi> would have the Apocalypse by the <hi>litteral</hi> sense, that so it may not be a nose of wax but a brasen nose, or the same mettle that their foreheads are that can plead for such absurd Hypotheses. But I say this mystical way of interpreting the Apocalypse will not make it a nose of wax, if men will but make use of those helps that the intrinsecal characters of the Visions do afford to cast them into orderly Synchronisms, so as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi> has done. And those that have neglected
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:98585:177"/>
this necessary help, what pitiful Interpretations they have made <hi>R. H.</hi> himself can witness. Nay certainly, To the skilful the <hi>Mystical</hi> sense of the Apocalypse is as certainly determinable one way, as any Scripture is in the <hi>Litteral</hi> sense thereof. And if <hi>R. H.</hi> thinks it such a nose of wax, I challenge him or any one else whosoever to make a nose of wax if he can of my <hi>Ioynt Exposition</hi> of the thirteenth and sevententh Chapters of the Apocalypse in my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> and to show that the sense which I have given is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate sense of them. And that <hi>R. H.</hi> himself has so shroudly confuted the <hi>Grotian</hi> way of interpreting the Apocalypse, it may be an argument to him if he please, that it is not such a nose of wax that will stand any way, but that all false Interpretations, like a frozen <hi>Muscovian</hi> nose before the fire, will drop off. But there is one certain true way as firm as Adamant, which the fiery subtilty of no mans wit will be able to melt or dissolve. And those that go this <hi>Synchroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> way, to them the Prophecies are not left to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret according to their own humour in favour to their own party and to the disgrace or disadvantage of their adversaries, but the time of the Prophetical Vision being known and the acknowledged meaning of the Prophetical Iconisms observed in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of History belonging to that time the Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism makes the Vision point to, they are necessitated whether it be for or against their own party or others, to render the certain, clear and determinate sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so little fear is there that this mystical way will make the Prophecies a nose of wax, or leave men to the wantonness of their own humours to interpret as they please. But in pretense of taking away this abuse, to allow none but a litteral sense of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98585:177"/>
is indeed to take away all the use thereof, which those that favour the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> full willingly would do.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. As for his third Position, he pretends Disp. 6. Ques. 2. by many arguments to make it good, but I shall take notice only of the chiefest, by which you may judge of the rest.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is, That things revealed at once and not at several distant times, must come to pass in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they are revealed; but the Apocalyptick Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were revealed at once or at one continued time to <hi>Iohn</hi> without ceasing or intermission of his Ecstasy, and therefore they must come to pass in order as they were seen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Prophecies of the Revelation were all of them written in one Book, and therefore they are to be fulfilled in that continued order they are written, as Histories written in order as they come to pass.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. First, second, third, fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are <hi>Ordinal</hi> numbers not <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and shew not only the number of things spoken of but their order also. Now the Prophecies of the Revelation do all of them consist of these numbers, Seven <hi>Seals,</hi> Seven <hi>Trumpets,</hi> Seven <hi>Vials</hi> (and he might have prefixed <hi>Seven Churches</hi> too) and therefore they being set in order and called, first, second, third <hi>Seal, Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>Vial,</hi> shows plainly they are to be fulfilled in the order they are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth and last arguments is: where no instance can be given to the contrary, there things shall come to pass in order as they are revealed, and such are the Prophecies of the Revelation says he, no instance can be given of any Prophecy that comes to pass before or after the order of its Revelation. And therefore
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98585:178"/>
they shall come to pass Prophecy after Prophecy as they were revealed and presented unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But to the first I answer. The argument will not hold good there, if at all, where there are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Notes given of a new beginning of prophesying. For that is as much if not more than if the Visions had been exhibited to <hi>Iohn</hi> at several distant times or days. And that there are such Notes it is plain, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a new beginning of prophesying. For as the Prophecy of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> was ushered in with a sound of a Trumpet, so is the Prophecy of the <hi>Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book,</hi> betwixt which two Prophecies there was an intermission of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Ecstasy, as you may see <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. And then before the Prophecy of the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> besides other certain indications of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a new Prophecy as I have above shewed, there is again that voice like a Trumpet that talked with him at the beginning of the <hi>Sealed Book-Prophecy,</hi> which is a greater assurance that there are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Prophecies than if they had been revealed to him at three distinct times or days.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the second I answer, That there is no harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at all to conceive two Prophecies beginning at the same Epocha to be writ in the same Book one after another, it being impossible according to the usual wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Books, that they should be written together, no more harshness I say than to conceive that an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian in one Volume may write the lives of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Governours and Bishops of a City from the first times thereof to his own times. Is it any thing harsh or rather not necessary when he has gone through all the times of the Governours, that he begin at the first Epocha to write the lives of the Bishops of the said City?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:98585:178"/>3. To the third I answer, That the argument proves only that the Seals and Trumpets are to be fulfilled in that order they are mentioned, and the Trumpets after the six first Seals, they being the parts of the seventh Seal. But this does not at all hinder but that the Seven Churches in that order they are set, may commence with the Seven Seals, as also the measuring the Inner Court and the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon, as is plain to any one that attends to what is said.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And lastly to the fourth and last I answer, That it is demonstrable by vertue of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisms, that there are many instances of things coming to pass not in the order they are revealed, but before and after. This is most evidently true if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s Synchronisms be true, as most certainly they are, and I have mentioned them to be so against all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended cavils of <hi>R. H.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. As for his last Position, all the proof it has is from the arguments of the three former, which being so false and weak and this last Paradox but a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectary</hi> of them, it is manifest it falls to the ground with them, if they be sufficiently confuted, as they will all without question be deemed to be, after I have perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my answer to the first argument for the second pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, and shown what is the <hi>Clavis</hi> to the Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Steganography,</hi> which is such a mystical or occult way of Revelation.</p>
                  <p>I briefly therefore here answer,<note n="XII" place="margin">
                        <hi>The Key of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Seven Churches.</hi>
                     </note> Those two places <hi>R. H.</hi> himself notes, <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 20. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the two keys the one of the Prophecy of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> the other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> and <hi>Opened Book,</hi> in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof we may come to a clear and certain
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98585:179"/>
knowledge of this <hi>Steganographical</hi> Revelation called the Apocalypse. For as for the first, that is, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Seven Stars,</hi> and of the <hi>seven Golden Candlesticks,</hi> it is a plain intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any one that is not stupid, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more meant by these Seven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> than seven particular Churches in <hi>Asia minor</hi> at that time; and that indeed the Vision of the Seven Churches represented by the seven Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks is a Prophecy concerning the whole Succession of the Church to the end of the world, divided into seven Intervals. For if it were not so, what needed all the pomp of this Vision, and the explication of it, if concerning the seven particular Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> whenas <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. there was mention of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> and after seven Epistles writ to them by name? Wherefore he must be exceeding stupid and slow-witted, or of a course perverse Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that cannot, at least being advertised of it, discern the scope of the Spirit in this Vision of the Seven Stars, and Seven Golden Candlesticks, and the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, that it is a Prophecy in so large a sense as I have shown in my <hi>Exposition,</hi> and proved that it is such a Prophecy by twenty solid Arguments in the tenth Chapter thereof. Such intimations suffice to the pious, free and sagacious Reader: But for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Drolls, carnal Politicians, or prejudiced Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitionists, if seeing they see not, and hearing they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not, the fault lies at their own doors.</p>

the Interpretation of the Vision of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Beast with seven Heads and ten Horns ridden by her. <hi>The Beast that thou sawest,</hi> saith the Angel, <hi>was and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition.</hi> And here it is remarkable, how the Angel does not go about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what a Beast is, it being so well known that according to the Prophetick stile it is a Kingdom, State or Empire Cruel and Idolatrous, such as they were that are described in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and called there by the <hi>Septuagint</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is as much as to say, a Cruel wild Beast: Wherefore the Angels Interpretation plainly imports thus much; That the Beast which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw denotes a Kingdom, State or Empire Cruel and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and withall whose condition is such, that at some time it might be said of it truly, that it was a Cruel Idolatrous Kingdom, State or Empire, but is not, but will be again a Cruel Idolatrous Kingdom, State or Empire, and then afterwards quite perish, at least as to its Cruelty and Idolatry, that is, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiality of it shall perish.</p>
                  <p>This is the name or nature of this Beast in general. And though it may already very well be understood of that time of the succession of this Beast which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after it had ceased to be, yet for sureness, that you may not mistake, the Angel calls him at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of this Verse, <hi>The Beast that was, and is not, and yet is:</hi> Which therefore is necessarily understood of the latter part of his time after he once ceased to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>Beast,</hi> that is, after this Empire had ceased to be a <hi>Cruel Idolatrous Empire,</hi> but had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Cruel Idolatrous Empire again,</hi> though not <hi>perfectly</hi> the <hi>same</hi> Idolatrous Empire it was before;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98585:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is the natural and necessary meaning of [is not and yet is.]</p>
                  <p>But yet we are never the wiser what Empire cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to pitch upon if the Angel stick here; and therefore he holds on, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>The seven Heads are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Mountains on which the Woman sitteth,</hi> who is also said to sit upon the Beast. Now he comes up closer to the business, which plainly showes this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whether you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the seven Hills of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or both, they both belonging to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Wherefore it is manifest the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is here meant in that succession of Time, after it had ceased to be an <hi>Idolatrous Empire</hi>; which it did for a Time while pure Christianity prevailed, and till the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie came in: After which it became <hi>the Beast that was and is not, and yet is.</hi> It was of old, the Pagan Idolatrous Empire, but is not so now, and yet it is in a very considerable sense, it being a Pagan-like, or a Paganochristian Idolatrous Empire, and cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutive of the pure Christians.</p>
                  <p>And that you may still be the better assured, that this latter part of the succession of the Empire (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after it had become Christian, and Apostatized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into Idolatry) was aimed at; the Angel holds on, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. <hi>And there are seven Kings,</hi> namely, which are the heads of the Beast, and must take up the entire Times of the being of the Beast, both the former and latter part thereof, unless we will admit of a living Beast without an head: <hi>Five are fallen and one is.</hi> Now let any man living show five Heads, that is, five Supreme Governours to be fallen or past in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Consuls, Decemviri, Consular Tribunes,</hi> and <hi>Dictators.</hi> No five single Emperours can fill up that space of time; and therefore it must be understood of sorts of Governours: whereof five had ceased in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Beast that was and is not,</hi> that is to say, the Paganochristian Head, (be they Paganochristian Emperours or Popes that get the Soveraignty, it is all one, they make still, or continue the Paganochristian Head) of that Beast: For that Beast is the Empire, not the Head of the Empire; <gap reason="foreign">

of the Empire was purely Pagan, but when it was Apostatizing again into a kind of Paganochri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and Idolatrous condition.

                  <p>And who this Woman is, is plainly indigitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and more precisely than in the ninth Verse, <hi>(viz.) vers.</hi> 18. <hi>And the Woman which thou sawest is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> In the ninth Verse, the seat of the Woman are Seven Hills, and here in this Verse, She is that great City, that in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time is said to reign over the Kings of the Earth, which no City on seven Hills then did besides <hi>Rome</hi>: But the Walls and Houses of <hi>Rome</hi> did not then Reign over the Kings of the Earth; but the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity here signified by <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a <hi>City,</hi> did then Rule over the Kings of the Earth: And therefore the <hi>Roman Polity</hi> it must be, that rides the Beast <hi>that was, is not, and yet is,</hi> but not the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity Pagan. For that Beast which is here ridden is after the expiration of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism properly so called, and therefore it must be the <hi>Roman</hi> Polity Paganochristian, that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy which rides this Beast: Which Roman Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy the Spirit of God here calls the Whore of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. Quod oportebat demonstrare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what more assured demonstration of any thing can <hi>R. H.</hi> or any man living else desire than of this so concerning a truth? And what a notable Key this is to unlock the sense of the Prophecies of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> and <hi>Opened Book</hi> I will briefly show, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

I have smoothed the flawes, and wiped off the rust that <hi>R. H.</hi> seems to fancy to stick on it. I will produce his most material Cavils, that by them you may judge of the rest.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. And the like he objecteth concerning the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verse. That it does not speak of a City which raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Kings of the Earth in <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time, but which is to raign in the time of the seventh Vial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle writes not an History but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And lastly, that this <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot be the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> he proves by an heap of Arguments: 1.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98585:182"/>
strongest Cities in the world, <hi>Revel. Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. but <hi>Rome,</hi> but a weak City, in comparison of other Cities, and which was seldom besieged but taken. 4. <hi>Babylon</hi> one of the most prosperous Cities in the world, <hi>Revel.

And lastly, <hi>Babylon</hi> is a City with which the Merchants of the Earth have great Trade and Traffick by Sea, but <hi>Rome</hi> not so, nor can she be so, for since she became Pontifician, the mouth of the River <hi>Tiber</hi> hath been stopped up for fear of Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so that no Ships of any great magnitude can pass thither. These are the chief of his Arguments, to which I shall answer briefly and in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the first I answer, That those three Hills of less Note, added to the first seven, never were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as in History or Poetry to alter that Title of <hi>Rome, Roma septicollis,</hi> or, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-hilled Rome.</hi> And it is the most clear and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site way to speak in the language of Historians, when we would certainly define or describe things.</p>
                  <p>Again, as for <hi>Rome Pontifician</hi> standing upon two Hills and no more, which yet is not absolutely true, it standing upon two Hills more besides, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from a good hand, skilfull and curious in these things; the Text of the Prophecy does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that exactness, that <hi>Rome</hi> Pontifician should stand upon all the Seven Hills: For the words run thus, <hi>The seven Heads are seven Mountains,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which only denotes the place of her abode, or where she is seated. And the Woman,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98585:182"/>
which is not the Houses and Walls of the City but the Polity residing there, is possessed of the whole space of ground environed with a Wall that takes in all the seven Hills, so that all the seven Hill may be said to be the place of her abode. And if the being environed with a Wall be essential to a City, I do not see but that the name of the City is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to reach so far, and the Wall with all the space of ground contained in it, all of it, to be called <hi>Rome.</hi> To all which you may add, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, may be taken <hi>partitivè,</hi> as when it is said of <hi>Iephtah Iud.</hi> 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. that he was buried in the Cities of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and of <hi>Iosiah</hi> that he was buried in the Sepulchers of his Fathers, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. <hi>vers.</hi> 24. that is, in some one of the Cities, and some one of the Sepulchres. So <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> may signify upon some of the Hills, as well as upon them all.</p>
                  <p>And the character is as certain whether <hi>Rome</hi> now stand but on four hills or two, that <hi>Rome</hi> is meant, as if it stood still on all. As suppose <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Seven-mouthed <hi>Nilus</hi> his stream so lessen that it did nothing near fill the Chanel so much as of old, and that thence five of his Mouths being shallower than the rest should grow dry, no man notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will deny that it is <hi>Nilus</hi> still; and so this <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi> still though contracted suppose to two hills, and her walls stand at a great distance from the City, as the banks of <hi>Nilus</hi> from his now more narrow and shallow stream. So sure a character notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>R.H.</hi> his exceptions, are the seven hills that <hi>Rome</hi> is here glanced at.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the second I answer briefly, as to the former, If Prophecy describe things as they are described in History it self, the description is more certain and exact, and Historians generally make Dictators, Kings
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98585:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Emperours three several sorts of Government. Which answer being abundantly full and sufficient, for brevity sake I omit to prove they are three several sorts of Government as well as so called.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the third, That this is a distorted unnatural exposition in this place to understand a preterperfect Tense in a sense future, all Commentators that I have met with will testify. Who however otherwise they vary in their Interpretations, yet take it for granted that, <hi>Five are fallen,</hi> signifies had ceased to be in S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time. Which the varying of the Tense immediately in, <hi>And one is,</hi> would force any one that is not obstinately humorsome and perverse to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be true, as that also which follows must needs still put it further out of doubt, <hi>And another is not yet come.</hi> It is a mere madness to imagine in these circumstances <hi>Five are faln,</hi> not to signify time past, because forsooth the preterperfect Tense sometimes is used of a thing future in Prophecy as <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. where there are no such circumstances. But I add further, that it is impossible but it should be so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, the Roman State or Kingdom as Idolatrous having but seven heads in all, and the <hi>Pagan Ceasars</hi> or Emperours in S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time being the present head. Therefore of necessity those other heads must be past, unsess you will have the Roman State or Kingdom till the <hi>Caesars</hi> time to have been an headless Animal, which would be a very witless supposition. And lastly his grand argument is a gross mistake. For this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Angel is not properly a Prophecy but the interpretation of a Prophecy, which naturally requires plainness and propriety of speech, and therefore not to understand by, <hi>Five are faln, Five shall fall,</hi> but requires us to understand it of the time past according to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Grammatical sense thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:98585:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. To the fourth I answer as to this last, That the Objector forgets that this eighteenth verse is part of the interpretation of a Prophecy, not the Prophecy it self, and therefore is to be taken in the plain Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical sense, if there be no indication to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as there is touching that saying <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>For God hath put in their hearts.</hi> Where the preterper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Tense is used for the future, but <hi>safely</hi> and <hi>elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; safely,</hi> because the foregoing verse doth plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the sense to a futurity; and <hi>elegantly,</hi> that which it expresseth being a cause antecedent to what is said before, and therefore rightly intimated to have been first. And where the verb substantive [is] or [are] occurr we are carefully to distinguish when they signify the <hi>nature</hi> of a thing, and when <hi>existence.</hi> As when it is said, <hi>And there are Seven Kings,</hi> it does not signify the present existence of them, for it were a contradiction to what follows; but that there are seven several kinds of Governours that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Roman State or Empire whereby its <hi>nature</hi> or condition is illustrated as to this point, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet is defined touching their present <hi>Existence</hi> or <hi>Non-existence.</hi> But when it follows, <hi>Five are faln and one is,</hi> [is] here plainly signifies <hi>existence,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is in the present Tense, <hi>present existence,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the time he was to whom it was spoken. And so it is, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. And the Woman, which thou sawest, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>is that great City which raigneth.</hi> There <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> put together signify <hi>present existence</hi> in this Interpretation of the Angel, there being no indication to the contrary, but rather a forcible urging thereunto by that repeated demonstrative Article <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of which the full sense in English cannot be otherwise
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98585:184"/>
rendred than thus, <hi>that great City, that City that raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> &amp;c. Which plainly denotes a known City then existent and pointed to. But I cannot insist on these things, I hasten to the last objection.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To which I briefly answer, That the more true those particulars are, the more they confirm my My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Interpretation of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. I interpret not of <hi>Rome,</hi> against which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation all these Particulars run, but of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hierarchie.</hi> Whom I understand also by <hi>Babylon Chap.</hi> 17. So that all this hailshot flyes quite over my head and touches not an hair thereof.</p>

                     </note>We having thus brightened this <hi>Key</hi> and smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as it were, and freed it from all those flaws and rust that <hi>R.

For as that <hi>Key</hi> of the Prophecy of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> by taking notice only of the obvious order of the Churches as they are set down, and of the meaning of the <hi>Paronomastical</hi> allusions of the names of them and of the persons concerned in them, and applying them to History, gives the assured sense of that Prophecy: So by this present <hi>Key</hi> of the Prophecies of the <hi>Opened</hi> and <hi>Sealed Book</hi> taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the order into which the Visions of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are cast by vertue of the Synchronisms which I have maintained to be true, we are enabled to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply every Vision to its proper time in History, as there by <hi>Paronomastical allusions,</hi> so here by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Prophetical <hi>Iconismes,</hi> And so with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discern what events answer such and such Visions. And now more fully and orderly to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the admirable use of this <hi>Key,</hi> that is, of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98585:184"/>
                     <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Angel Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>vers.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>First, we may observe how it assuring us that <hi>the Beast that was and is not and yet is,</hi> is the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire divided into many Kingdoms and tainted again with new Paganlike Superstitions and Idolatries, which his very description also makes good; And that the <hi>Paganochristian head</hi> of this Empire should shortly succeed the <hi>Seventh King,</hi> the purely <hi>Christian Caesars</hi>; how it is manifest I say from hence, that this Beast with the Whore riding him began many hundred years ago, even as soon as the Empire was dividing into many Kingdoms and apostatizing into a Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochristian kind of Idolatry, which was about four hundred and odd years after Christ. Now let us see what further comes of this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By carefully comparing the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. with the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. and the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast with the <hi>Whore</hi> in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we shall find that the two Beasts be one and the same Beast, and that the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast and the <hi>Whore</hi> denote the same thing. This I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica</hi> Book 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. by no less than eighteen agreements betwixt the two <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beasts, and by nine agreements betwixt the <hi>two-horned Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore.</hi> So that no man that is in his wits can be so sceptical as not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Of the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. it is said <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>That power was given unto him to continue forty two months,</hi> I demand here of <hi>R. H.</hi> has the Roman Empire since the time of its being divided into many Kingdoms continued but forty two months or three years and an half? Is this a likely measure of time for the continuance of an Empire? Nay is it not plain
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98585:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that this divided Roman Empire thus apostatizing and apostatized more and more into a Paganlike Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry had continued so, near forty two Prophetical Months, that is months of years, <hi>viz.</hi> 1260. years, till in the last <hi>Semitime</hi> of these 1260. years, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation broke out, which was the expiration of the <hi>Entireness</hi> of the raign of the Beast. But in the mean time by vertue of this <hi>Key</hi> of the Angel it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evident that the forty two months are not to be understood <hi>litterally</hi> but of <hi>Prophetical</hi> Months, forty two whereof make 1260. years. And consequently that all the Visions that Synchronize with this <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beast have the same extent of duration: As the Two-horned Beast, The Whore, The Woman in the wilderness, The Sealed company of Virgins, The Outer Court troden down by the Gentiles, The two Witnesses mourning in Sackcloath, and The dead bodies of the witnesses lying three days and an half in the street of the great City. For I conceive that as the Womans abode in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is first denoted by 1260. days, and after in the same Chapter by a <hi>Time and Times and half a Time,</hi> so the continuance of the sad condition of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses is first set down by 1260. days, but after by <hi>three days and an half,</hi> to answer to a <hi>Time and Times and half a Time,</hi> which is <hi>three Times and an half.</hi> And that three Times and an half are signified by three days and an half on purpose to teach us to reckon the duration of all these <hi>Synchronals</hi> not by the curiosity of a <hi>Prophetical month</hi> much less of a <hi>Prophetical day,</hi> but as it is originally in <hi>Daniel</hi> by <hi>semidays</hi> or <hi>half-days:</hi> after the beginning of the expiration of the seventh of which <hi>Half-days</hi> the Witnesses were to rise, as they did. But this by the bye but very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98585:185"/>
the noting. All these <hi>Synchronals,</hi> I say, of the Prophecy of the <hi>Opened Book</hi> are necessarily to be measured by <hi>Prophetical Semitimes,</hi> that is, the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every one of them is to be about seven <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> a Semitime consisting of <hi>one hundred and eighty</hi> years. And so must also those two <hi>Synchronals</hi> of the <hi>Sealed Book-Prophecy,</hi> The six first Trumpets, and the <hi>one hundred forty four thousand</hi> sealed Servants of God, they being synchronal to these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> from whence it will further follow, that neither the <hi>one hundred forty four thousand sealed Ones</hi> are the same individual persons, continuing all the space of time near <hi>one thousand two hundred and sixty</hi> years, nor the Two-horned Beast some one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Witch or Magician, nor the Two Witnesses two particular persons, as <hi>R. H.</hi> with his <hi>litteral</hi> sense would have all these expounded, but all of them successions of such and such Bodies or Companies of Men for such a space of time together.</p>
                  <p>And before we go any further,<note n="XVI" place="margin">
                        <hi>The Cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity, or correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</hi> Middle Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</note> let us observe of those <hi>Synchronals</hi> we have noted hitherto, what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>correspondent opposition,</hi> or else close <hi>cognation</hi> or <hi>identity</hi> they have one with another, which is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marvellous confirmation of their Synchronizing. That the Two-horned Beast and the Whore signifie one and the same thing, and that the Ten-horned Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. and the Ten-horned Beast <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. are one and the same Beast I have noted already, and the cognation of the one two with the other two is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, the <hi>former</hi> being the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, (and more particularly the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, as appears by the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beast, and the <hi>Seven Hills</hi> the seat of the <hi>Whore,</hi> for which <hi>Rome</hi> is most remarkable; as

This sincere part therefore that run in <hi>correspondent opposition</hi> to the former are set out by The Woman (<hi>viz.</hi> crowned with twelve Stars, to denote her Apostolicalness though now) in the Wilderness, The two Witnesses prophesying in Sackcloth, The Servants of God sealed in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads; The bodies of the Witnesses lying dead three dayes and an half and unburied; which showes, that the Apostolick Christians though in being could not be a <hi>Living</hi> Body Politick, that is, invested with <hi>Open Power</hi> and Rule during the seven <hi>half-dayes</hi> or <hi>semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> of the Beast, till they were in the seventh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitime expiring: As the two mournful Witnesses could only protest and witness against the cruel Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous proceedings of the Beast, and denounce the judgements of God against them, but proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For that the <hi>three dayes</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> of their bodies lying unburied, is the same with the <hi>one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand two hundred and sixty dayes</hi> of their mournful Prophecy is plain from hence, that else no war was made against them, nor they either <hi>Politically</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>

slain, till the last three years and an half of their prophesying, whenas they were <hi>Politically</hi> slain all the while, and some hundred thousands of them in a <hi>Natural</hi> sense slain at times, some by the sword, others by fire and faggot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that the <hi>three dayes</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the same sense that <hi>three times</hi> and an <hi>half,</hi> or <hi>one thousand two hundred and sixty dayes.</hi> The <hi>Virgin Company</hi> also by their avowed and resolved Virginity was a perpetual reproach to the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi>; and the <hi>one hundred forty four thousand mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the <hi>Lambs Name,</hi> and the name of his Father in their forehead are in an apparent opposition to the marked slaves of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beast. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the state of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for about some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than <hi>four hundred years</hi> after Christ till the seventh <hi>Semitime</hi> was expiring, it is no wonder that the Judgements of God thundered upon them under the sounding of the six first Trumpets, and that at the beginning of their sounding, <hi>one hundred forty four thousand</hi> Servants of God are marked to save them both from these Judgements, and also from the debauchings of the <hi>Two-horned Beast,</hi> or <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>; which signifies that God would preserve to himself a pure Apostolick Church, notwithstanding all the Calamities, Persecutions, and gross Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Idolatries raging in the Empire. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the account of this period of time are the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Intervals: For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eight parts of nine of the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Interval, and all the <hi>Thyatirian,</hi> was this Pagan-like Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Idolatrous State of the Church, and there is express mention of the <hi>Idolothyta</hi> in both those Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, but in none else; and the persecuting the Pure
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98585:187"/>
Christians by the sword in one, and by fire and fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the other, is plainly made out in our <hi>Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> So admirably do the Visions correspond belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Time and State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which the <hi>Angels Interpretation</hi> hath pitched upon: So that there is all the assuredness of the truth of the thing hitherto that Humane Reason can desire, and that the middle Synchronals are to be expounded in such a sense, as I have expounded them in my <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </note>But let us now proceed, and see how the <hi>Anteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> Synchronals will sute with the Times which they necessarily run into; (for that they all precede these <hi>middle</hi> Synchronals, and so Synchronize one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, has been plainly proved in my Defence of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>) which <hi>Antemedial</hi> Synchronals, are, The six first Seals immediately preceding the six first Trumpets: The Inner Court, (which is the Court of the Temple and the Altar) symmetral or commensurate: The Woman clothed with the Sun, and crowned with twelve Stars not yet gone into the Wilderness, and The fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon while this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in travail. These are the <hi>Antemedial</hi> Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and therefore all of them necessarily run into the <hi>Primitive Times of the Church</hi> before its Apostasie, and reach up to its very first beginning, as soon as the Church, assisted by the promised aids of Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ascending to his Father, began to propagate his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>There was the beginning of the <hi>parturient</hi> state of the Woman, whose throes were great and sharp till <hi>Constantines</hi> Time, and the Dragon spued out a flood after her while she was making into the Wilderness, that flood of Contention about the <hi>Arrian</hi> Points.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98585:187"/>
Here I will appeal to <hi>R. H.</hi> or any man else living, what a fit resemblance the sharp throes of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is of those fierce resistances and cruel persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Church of Christ found in preaching his Gospel, and in their endeavouring to enlarge his Kingdom: And how naturally the conflict betwixt Christianity and the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Paganism is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Seven-headed Dragon: And how significative the <hi>Inner-Court,</hi> that is said to be measured and allowed (but the <hi>Outer</hi> rejected as incommensurable) is of the first Ages of the Church not yet lapsed into those gross Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Pagan-like Idolatries. And lastly, for the first six Seals, (though the <hi>Sealed Book-Prophecy</hi> respects the Fate and Affairs of the Empire rather than of the Church, yet) the first Vision, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of the first Seal, namely, the Heros on the White Horse, I doubt not but it is Christ more particularly guiding and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apostles and other Agents for the enlarging of his Kingdom in those Times, by sending of the Holy Ghost, and enabling them to do <hi>True</hi> Miracles, one of the greatest whereof is this Apocalypse written by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Iohn</hi>; and the mention of a <hi>Bow</hi> and a <hi>Crown,</hi> of which the Right was given him, denotes him aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the possession of the <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire his Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which causing such great mutations in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the fate of the Empire may very well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be concerned therein.</p>
                  <p>The three next Seals how exquisitely they fit with those Times of the Riders of the Red, Black and Pale Horses, the <hi>Exposition</hi> makes good, and they are in a manner merely touching the Affairs of the Empire, though useful also to the Church to know where or
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98585:188"/>
in what Times they were, and what to expect next: But the fifth Seal exhibiting the Souls of the slain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar martyred or sacrificed for their bearing Witness to the Christian Truth, is hugely congenerous with the sharp throes of the Womans Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Affairs of the Empire are here also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, great Calamities being to come upon it for the effusion of this Innocent Blood. And lastly, that great Earthquake under the sixth Seal, which brought the confusion and subversion of the Old Pagan Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; as the Fate of the Empire could not but be concerned therein, so also it doth fitly fall in with the Victory of <hi>Michael</hi> over the Dragon, and his cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him down unto the Earth: So agreeable are the Primitive Times of the Church to all these <hi>Anteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> Synchronals.</p>
                  <p>And what is still more admirable, we may further observe how exactly the <hi>Ephesine</hi> and <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Church agree with those Times, and with the said <hi>Antemedial</hi> Synchronals of the <hi>Sealed</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened Book.</hi> For as in the first Seal, the Heros on the White Horse is brought in earnestly aiming with his Bow and Arrow at a <hi>Crown,</hi> the Right of which is given to him; so the first Interval of the Church, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Ephesine</hi> has its name from a Paronomasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Allusion to <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that signifies an <hi>earnest desire</hi> after a thing, and in the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Interval (which with the <hi>Ephesine</hi> equalizes the Time of the Fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the Dragon, till his Victory over him under the sixth Seal, and is the Interval of the Ten noted Persecutions of the Church) it is said to the Church in that Interval; <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life</hi>; that is, the <hi>Imperial Crown, Constantine</hi> turning Christian under
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:98585:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the sixth Seal at the expiration of the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val so called from the <hi>bitterness</hi> of <hi>Persecution</hi> in that succession of the Church. But the great Encomiums of the Church in those two Intervalls answer hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly to the <hi>Inner Court</hi> of the Temple and Altar, which is said to be symmetral, and allowed; and the <hi>Altar</hi> there to the many <hi>Martyrdoms</hi> of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians sacrificed for the profession of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith in the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Interval of the Church: So wonderful an harmony is there of these <hi>Anteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> Synchronals of all sorts, with the History of those <hi>Primitive</hi> Times, and with one another: So that it must be mere stupidity, or obstinate perverness that hinders any one from assenting to the Truth in this point.</p>
                  <p>We have seen what a fit and effectual <hi>Key</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of the <hi>Angel</hi> has been for the opening the true meaning of all the <hi>Antemedial</hi> and <hi>Medial</hi> Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apocalypse:<note n="XVIII" place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Post-medial <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, their Order, and the Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of those that are made to Synchronize one with another.</hi>
                     </note> Which since they concern things past, the sense of the Visions is the more assured and certain to us: But the <hi>Postmedial</hi> Visions being all of them in a manner to come, the sense cannot be so precise, fixt and certain. But thus much is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest out of the Interpretation of the Angel, that they are to succeed the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> or the expiring of the seventh <hi>Semitime</hi> of the <hi>forty two</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical months of the Beast: which seventh <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> or seventh <hi>Semiday</hi> or <hi>Half-day</hi> by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Angel reaching to our Times, or the Times of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> it is evident that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses.</hi> After which immediately succeeds the seventh Trumpet; within which in gross or at large are contained, The Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Reign of Christ, The Ligation and Incarcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:98585:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Satan, The Palm-bearing Company, The time of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> or of the Lambs Wife; And this is so firmly proved by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisms, that there can be no doubt but that those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy times of the Church upon Earth are yet to come, which is the main scope of the <hi>Postme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> Visions. But in our Table of <hi>Synchronisms</hi> things are delineated more distinctly and particularly, and it mainly differs from that part of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mede</hi>'s Table, in that I have divided the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> into <hi>Seven Thunders,</hi> and placed the <hi>Seven Vials</hi> under the <hi>First Thunder.</hi> For in that they are the Seven last Plagues, that they should belong to the last <hi>Wo-Trumpet</hi> there is all the reason in the world. And that the Vials must of necessity follow the Rising of the Witnesses, I have elsewhere sufficiently demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>It remains only that we briefly note the Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>Postmedial</hi> Visions in my Table, and the Congruity of those that are set down as <hi>Synchronizing</hi> one with another, all which I have referred to the order of the Seven Thunders: And that we also observe how the expiration of the time of the Beast and his destruction, and so likewise of the Whore at the Rising of the Witnesses is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood only of the <hi>Entireness</hi> of their Kingdom or Rule. And that according to that analogy all the rest of the Synchronals are to be understood, namely as there is but a partial destruction of the Kingdom of the Beast and the Whore, so there is but a partial and imperfect advance toward the Millennial Reign of Christ, and the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This being premised we will take notice of the order of the Seven Thunders and what Visions Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronize with them. As, with the <hi>first Thunder</hi> Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronizeth
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:98585:189"/>
the effusion of the <hi>Seven Vials,</hi> as the Seven Thunders with the Seventh Trumpet and the Seven Trumpets with the Seventh Seal. With the <hi>Sixth Vial</hi> synchronizeth the <hi>Harvest,</hi> and also the <hi>Prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Spouse</hi> of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> Whereby the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> is intimated to be <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Sixth Vial,</hi> as also in part at least, <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Sixth Vial it self.</hi> And if this be not the time of their conversion, there appears none in the Apocalypse for them. And <hi>R. H.</hi> himself is very earnest for the conversion of the Jews, though he is utterly mistaken in the application of the Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Visions to that event. With the <hi>Seventh Vial</hi> synchronizeth the <hi>Treading</hi> of the <hi>Wine-press</hi> and also the <hi>Battle</hi> of the <hi>Rider</hi> of the <hi>White Horse</hi>; and how necessarily these three Visions are tied together in one time my Exposition of the Apocalypse does clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, &amp; that the fulfilling of all these three Visions are an utter destruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Roman Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, and as it were an universal conversion of the heathenish Unbelievers to the Faith of the Gospel. Wherefore the City <hi>Babylon</hi> being thus destroyed; with the <hi>Second Thunder</hi> naturally synchronizeth the <hi>Descent</hi> of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> that City or Polity coming down from Heaven, and quite contrary to the carnal and tyrannical City or Polity of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Under the Second Thunder therefore is the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws for universal Christendom by a truly holy and truly Oecumenical Council really inspired from Heaven. With which time therefore naturally synchronizeth the <hi>Laying hold of Satan.</hi> And this City or Polity the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> thus constituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of Christ, the <hi>duration thereof</hi> does of necessity immediately follow under the next, that is, the <hi>Third Thunder,</hi> and is that <hi>Millennial Reign</hi> of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:98585:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> properly so called, wherein his Laws and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline are vigorously and faithfully executed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. Whence, with this Millennial Reign the close <hi>Imprisoning</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> for a thousand years is rightly conceived to synchronize. Which time of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment <hi>his letting loose</hi> again immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is evident that his letting loose synchronizeth with the <hi>Fourth Thunder.</hi> And the <hi>besieging</hi> the <hi>Holy City</hi> by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> as an effect of this, with <hi>the Fifth</hi>; And the <hi>coming of Christ to judgment</hi> to defeat the <hi>Besiegers,</hi> with the <hi>Sixth Thunder.</hi> From whence it follows that the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> or <hi>Holy City</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues all the time of the Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Thunders, though the <hi>Millennial Reign</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called is contained within the space of the <hi>Third Thunder</hi>; and the <hi>Palm-bearing Company</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the space of the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third.</hi> For when the Devil has got loose again, their Palms may be justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to wither in their hands; and yet considering they are still in their hands, you may phansy if you will that they reach from the Second Thunder to the Seventh, as the <hi>Exclusion</hi> of the <hi>Wicked Rabble</hi> out of the Holy City reaches through the Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Thunders. And lastly with the <hi>Seventh Thunder</hi> synchronizeth the <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the Earth by Thundering and Lightning properly so called, as also the <hi>consummate Salvation</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> or their transvection into those eternal Mansions of glory.</p>
                  <p>These are the main <hi>Postmedial</hi> Visions of the <hi>Opened Book-Prophecy,</hi> and you see how natural their order is thus disposed under the <hi>Seven Thunders</hi> which fill the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> and what cognation there is betwixt those Visions that are made to synchronize one with another; We will only
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98585:190"/>
add how they correspond with the <hi>Intervals</hi> of the <hi>Churches.</hi> And it is observable that as the <hi>Ephesine</hi> and <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Interval did totally symbolize with the <hi>Antemedial</hi> Visions and eight of nine parts of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamenian</hi> and the whole <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Interval with the <hi>Medial</hi>; so the <hi>Sardian, Philadelphian</hi> and <hi>Laodicean</hi> Intervals do most conspicuously symbolize will these <hi>Postmedial</hi> Visions. For as the <hi>effusion</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> is ushered in with <hi>Musick Chap.</hi> 15. so the very name of <hi>Sardis</hi> is as much as <hi>Canticum laetitiae</hi> a <hi>Song of joy.</hi> And as the state of the first <hi>Six Vials</hi> is but an unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled imperfect state in comparison of what is to come, so the <hi>Interval</hi> of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> whose <hi>Works</hi> are said <hi>not to be perfect before God,</hi> is terminated with the <hi>Sixth Vial.</hi> But <hi>Philadelphia</hi> that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent state of the Church, that Interval reaches through the <hi>Seventh Vial</hi> and the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Thunder</hi>; it being the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Army which Christ so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in his Epistle to that Church that atchieves that notable victory under the <hi>Seventh Vial,</hi> and it being expresly said to that Church, That the name of the City <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> should be writ upon her, which cometh down from Heaven, which cometh to pass under the Second Thunder. And lastly, The <hi>Interval</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> synchronizing with the <hi>Fourth, Fifth</hi> and <hi>Sixth Thunders,</hi> The First whereof is the <hi>loosing</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> The next the Siege by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog,</hi> and the last, The <hi>coming</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Iudgment,</hi> how congenerous this is to the remisness of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> who brought this Siege upon her self, by her luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmness and laziness, is obvious to observe. And also how well the name of <hi>Laodicea</hi> which signifies the <hi>Iudging</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> agrees with Christs coming to judge the people under the <hi>Sixth Thunder.</hi>

                  <p>That Objection is more material touching the <hi>first Trumpet,</hi> where it is said, <hi>And the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</hi> Where <hi>Trees</hi> signifying the <hi>great Ones,</hi> and the <hi>Grass</hi> the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> or <hi>Common People,</hi> according to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

But he that understands the Prophetick stile, and observes in what various senses [all] is taken, will not in the least be scandalized.

And this latitude there is without any pretense that I can remember: But here it is a notable elegancy, For having said, <hi>the third part of the Trees were burnt up</hi> (where the <hi>third part</hi> does not signifie <hi>Numerally</hi> but <hi>Symbolically</hi> denoting the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) by a <hi>Logoprepia</hi> in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Vision, it was to be said, <hi>and all green Grass was burnt up:</hi> where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>All</hi> signifies no more than a good deal, though for decorum sake in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Vision, it was to be said [<hi>All</hi>] none of the <hi>Grass</hi> in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood escaping when the third part of <hi>Trees</hi> was burnt down to the root; for so <gap reason="foreign">

But I answer, the <hi>not killing</hi> is not understood of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> men, but of the <hi>Eastern Empire,</hi> that they should not make it cease to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire still, which the <hi>Turks</hi> did effect.

But that I may not seem less ready to take notice of his virtues, than I have been to expose his weaknesses, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else so far as I can find, but an high strain of Civility to that Lady City of <hi>Europe, Rome,</hi> the she may not be deemed the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> And deep pangs of kindness and charity to the Papists, that the Protestants may not begin a War with them upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Religion, <hi>Disp.</hi> 12. <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. and

lastly, no small measure of officiousness, and respect to our Church of <hi>England,</hi> that she may not be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Antichristian by the <hi>Mystical</hi> Interpretations of the Revelation, (<hi>Praef. pag.</hi> 2.) that has thus necessitated <hi>R.

                     <hi>Mede,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mystical Interpreters that insist in his footsteps, interpret of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy:) And I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no Resurrection first nor second, nor any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ to Judgement, (for these come two or three Chapters later than the Whore) till these two hundred thousand thousand bob-tailed Steeds with Lions heads and Serpents tailes spitting fire, smoak and brimstone at both ends have appeared in the Land of <hi>Asia.</hi> How ridiculous and prophane soever this may seem to the Serious, or grateful to the Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>R. H.</hi> notwithstanding is so gravely and devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confident on the matter, that in his Preface, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:98585:193"/>
the Reader <hi>to give God the Glory, and not him,</hi> for this his solid litteral Interpretation of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi> and desires also, <hi>That the Lord who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Prophecy, and revealed it to</hi> John, <hi>would reveal the Truth to him</hi>; as if the Reader was to find it in this his new and rare <hi>Litteral</hi> way.</p>
                  <p>But to examine now as briefly as we may the three grand causes or grounds of his betaking himself to this new Invention, never yet met with in any other Writer whatsoever, as he but truly and justly boasts of himself in the beginning of his Preface.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the first therefore I answer, That I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Civility</hi> and fair Language so far as is consistent with Truth: But if by the Interpretation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> that rides the Beast, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. is necessarily and inevitably the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy debauching the Empire with Idolatry, I will ask <hi>R. H.</hi> whether he takes himself to be a more wise and just Nomenclator than the Holy Ghost speaking by the voice of an Angel, and whether we have not sufficient warrant to call <hi>Rome</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> we having the Example of such an infallible <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or imposer of names: and whether he himself is not to take the less offence at it, he expresly declaring at the end of his Book, that God may permit the <hi>Turk</hi> for the punishment of Idolatry to take the City of <hi>Rome</hi> and possess himself of it.</p>
                  <p>To the second I answer, That I dearly embrace that Christian good Nature in him, and great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from War and Blood-shed, especially upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion, but withall I affirm, that with this Christian temper my <hi>Exposition</hi> of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, though I follow M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Medes</hi> Synchronisms for
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:98585:194"/>
the main, and interpret it <hi>Mystically,</hi> better agrees than <hi>R. H.</hi> his <hi>Litteral</hi> Interpretation, which seems framed in a tenderness to the worldly peace of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only, but mine tends to a peace and cessation of Wars and Persecution in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Let <hi>R. H.</hi> read my Preface, <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. and then tell me whether his <hi>Litteral</hi> sense, or my <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> sense is more abhorrent from persecution, war and bloodshed, and better consists with Christian peace and charity.</p>
                  <p>But he, while he seems so solicitous for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in his <hi>Litteral</hi> Interpretation of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, cares not to disarm all the Reformed Churches of that just defence which apparently they have out of the Apocalypse rightly understood for their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from <hi>Rome</hi>: whereby they can demonstrate themselves neither Schismaticks nor Hereticks, nor ought to have been massacred and burnt for such, to the exhausting of the lives of several hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand innocent Souls that could not stoop to their Idolatries: What a preposterous piece of Charity therefore is it in <hi>R. H.</hi> that in a tenderness to the peace of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he will despoil his own Church, and all the Reformed Churches of their just and most effectual defence against that blood-thirsty Hierarchy, who have drunk the blood of so many hundred thousands of innocent dissenters, and if their Interest require it, and opportunity give leave, are, it is to be feared, ready to drink as much more? But for my own part I am against all War upon account of Religion, and all bloody Persecutions of one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or other, nor doth my Interpretation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse require any such thing: But that they that are unjustly assaulted may defend themselves <hi>R. H.</hi>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:98585:194"/>
himself allows against the Papists in the Conclusion of his Book in these express words: <hi>And so stands the Case betwixt Vs and</hi> Rome, <hi>if they assault us we may assault them, if they begin with us we may defend our selves, and offend our foes, until they be minded to be quiet and agree on peace upon safe terms, and firm foundation.</hi> And the <hi>Mystical</hi> Interpretation of the Apocalypse implyes no more against the persons of the Romanists than thus. But that their Policy <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> Idolatrous and persecutive will be confounded, methinks <hi>R. H.</hi> should conceive there is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in that, unless he were a lover of Idolatry and Persecution more than of the purity of Gods Worship, Goodness, Equity and Truth. Therefore the second cause of his adhering to a <hi>Litteral</hi> Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Apocalypse is thus quite blown away.</p>
                  <p>And for his third and last, though the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot but take in good part his kindness and well-meaning in her behalf against such phancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sectaries as would prove her Antichristian out of the Mystical Interpretation of the Apocalypse, yet the most Orthodox, the most Pious, and the most Learned Clergy-men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to whom he dedicates his <hi>meaning of the Revelation,</hi> will easily understand that he does our Church a great disservice by exploding all <hi>Mystical</hi> Interpretations of the Apocalypse, the true Mystical Explication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (such as I have pitched upon, and such as I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>R. H.</hi> or any man else living to show any flaw of moment therein) excusing our <hi>English</hi> Church from all suspicion of that Antichristianism which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered in the Apocalypse, as doth appear by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Consectary of my <hi>Ioynt-Exposition, Synops. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. Besides what occurrs (in my

Not to omit also that according to our mystical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, Episcopacy was in the Church in the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral</hi> times thereof. And that there is no warrant for separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it being so considerable a part of the Reformed Church or the Church of <hi>Sardis.</hi> So plain is it that <hi>R. H.</hi> doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service to our Church by decrying all Mystical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the Apocalypse. In the mean time I have abundantly shown how altogether groundless as well as how extravagant <hi>R. H.</hi> his Hypothesis is who would have the Apocalypse expounded in a <hi>litteral</hi> sense, and supposeth the visions must be fulfilled in the same order they occurr in the Text; And how weak his objections have proved against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <item>1. First, That in neither of those that wrote his life any such thing is mentioned, nor in the Preface to his works in Folio, the writer whereof I know to have been so curious in all things touching M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Mede</hi> and so faithful and impartial, that if it had been true it had not been omitted.</item>
                     <item>2. That it was the Genius of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Mede</hi> as to be exceeding cautious how he entertained an opinion, so to be as fixt and immovable when he had once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained it.</item>
                     <item>3. He was an holy conscientious man neither co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous nor ambitious, and therefore devoid of all temptation to dissemble, and there was no persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in those daies to fright him into a fit of dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</item>

                     <item>5.

the Apocalypse, in which as we may see in his Epistles, he persisted to the very last, it is necessary that he should likewise retain the same opinion of his <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronisms</hi> to the very last. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                        <hi>What a true and clear Looking-glass of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the Apocalypse is, and of what great consequence it is for all Christians high and low to have a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>

True and Living Members; whenas in the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Hierarchy,</hi> they are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men that are exposed to danger, and have been slaughtered, and massacred, and burnt with fire and faggot some hundred thousands of them, (for keeping Faith and a good Conscience towards God) upon pretence of their being Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Of Heresie, and of the secularity of the Roman Hierarchy, and how they that suffer for that Church are no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi>
                     </note>Whenas there can be no <hi>Heresie,</hi> but it must be the profession of something contrary to the truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apostolick Faith; whereas the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches generally hold all those points of Faith that were professed in the <hi>Symmetral</hi> Times of the Church about four hundred years after Christ, before the Apostasie came in. And certainly the Christian Faith was abundantly complete in those Primitive Ages and wanted nothing. But the Dissenters from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are held Hereticks by them for not embracing such Articles, and Rites, and Usages as are maintained by them for mere <hi>worldly Interest</hi> for encreasing the Power and Revenue of Holy Church as they call it; though in what it differs from the Reformed Churches, suppose this of <hi>England</hi> for Example, <hi>Holy Church,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Hierarchy,</hi> are nothing else but a Body Politick of Men that drive on a <hi>Secular</hi> Design under a <hi>Religious</hi> pretense, and so may be looked upon rather as a <hi>Secular Polity</hi> than <hi>Spiritual</hi>; but Christian no further than as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of that Christianity, we both agree, in a subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to their worldly designs. For if they did in good earnest believe and love the Ancient Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christianity, which obtained in the <hi>Symmetral</hi> Ages of the Church, which was then consummate, and abundantly sufficient to Salvation, they could not murder those that do heartily profess it, the rest
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:98585:201"/>
being no part of that consummate Christianity, but at best mere moss and filth added to it.</p>
                  <p>From whence it follows that no one that suffers in the cause of the Roman Hierarchy or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as opposite to the Reformed Churches, suffers as a <hi>Martyr</hi> for Christianity, but as a <hi>Souldier</hi> of fortune that espouses the cause of a worldly Polity, that guilds it self over with a specious Title of holy Church. And truly it were very well if they quitted their lives thus as mere Souldiers of a secular Power. But they giving testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to all the Abominations of the Roman Religion by their thus suffering (for they suffer not for the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Apostolick Faith wherein we are all agreed) they giving testimony, I say, to all their Idolatries, gross superstitions, wicked and Tyrannical Laws against the true Members of Christ whom they nickname Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; (which things make the Roman Hierarchy the real Antichrist) they are not only not the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Christ but the real Martyrs of Antichrist, they suffering for such Doctrines and Practices as are against the law of Christ, and are the very support, constitution, and peculiar interest of Antichrist. But as many as suffer by this Roman Hierarchy as the faithful servants of Christ in Obedience to his Laws that are contrary to the Institutes, Doctrines, and Practices of Antichrist, they die as the real Martyrs of Christ and faithful witnesses against Antichrist, their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing serving no Secular design, but the keeping faith and a good Conscience and the approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the sincere servants of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The main thing therefore that I aim at is this,<note n="XXVII" place="margin">
                        <hi>That they that suffer for conscience sake by the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>are Christian Martyrs, and how much their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are against the Interest of the Secular Powers. And what a weight of guilt lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that have gratified the Papal Hierarchy by such persecutions of the conscientious.</hi>
                     </note> That they that suffer by the Roman Hierarchy (instigating
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:98585:202"/>
the Princes of Christendom to persecute the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious) being the real Martyrs of Christ, and their persecution only for such things as are both against the Laws of Christ, and only for the Interest of the Antichristian Hierarchy, nothing for the secular Powers themselves, (such as are the Invocation of Saints, the Worshipping of Images, the Adoration of the Host, the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be imagined more reproachful and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous against the person of Christ, it exposing him to be swallowed down into that bag of filth the bodies of men, or to be imprisoned in a <hi>Pyxis,</hi> to be gnawn with rats and mice, or if fallen to the ground (and he cannot stay himself, I mean this <hi>Deus Panaceus</hi> this <hi>Breaden-God</hi> of the Pontificians) to be licked up by every obscene dog. And yet as glibly as he goes down he is a <hi>whole</hi> man with head, arms and legs, with flesh and bones, and thus all swallowed down at once without gnawing or chawing, nay, and that which is still more prodigious, it is a whole <hi>living</hi> man in health and vigour, with arms and legs able to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from either mouse, rat, or dog, or chase them away from himself, and yet he suffers himself to be gnawn and eaten up by these vermin) I say these and such things as these Dissenters suffering for, which are against common Sense, Scripture and Reason, and against the honour and Institutes of Christ, and only make for the interest of the Antichristian Hierarchy, to enrich and magnify their Priesthood as if they were more Omnipotent than God Almighty, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Schools can do nothing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction to be done, whenas Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation is nothing but a fardle of flat contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it may justly amaze any considering person,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:98585:202"/>
that the Civil Powers in this long Reign of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ have been so little sensible of their own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Interest (<hi>For in the multitude of People is the Kings honour, but in the want of people is the destruction of the Prince,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks) as to have suffered so many thousands of their useful innocent Subjects to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the lust and ambition of that proud and bloody Hierarchy, to say nothing of that great guilt of blood that lay upon the Civil Powers themselves for listening to the counsels of that <hi>Iezebel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The account that lay upon them in those times was heavy enough, when <hi>the earth was</hi> as well <hi>full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as of <hi>cruel habitations,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks. But now the fuller light of the Gospel being so manifestly dispread through so great a part of Christendom, and the gross Idolatries, Impostures and Cruelties of the Roman Church so generally known (which cannot but take hold of the consciences of them that have the greatest sense and fear of God and the most sincere inclinations to approve themselves the faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jesus Christ, and therefore will be the most certain to suffer by the barbarous suggestions of that Woman that is said to be drunk with the blood of the Saints, and the blood of the Martyrs of Jesus) what a vast weight of guilt will lye upon such Civil Powers of Christendom as at this time of the day, shall listen to the wicked suggestions of the abovesaid <hi>Iezebel,</hi> for the destroying of the Prophets of the Lord, and whither and how far it will sink them, I dread to think and am afraid to speak out. But it may be easily collected from the voice of that Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>If any man worship the Beast and his Image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, he

And yet let me look never so earnestly upon things and never so favourably, I cannot perceive otherwise than that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is very grosly guilty of Idolatry
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:98585:203"/>
and consequently of most barbarous Murthers of conscientious men that cannot comply with her in that hainous sin against God. 2. Against my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and estimation in the World, the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to understand the Apocalypse seeming a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful ridiculous thing to the Wits of this age that are ready to snear and flear at any such profession, and indeed at the serious profession of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all, as if it were an indication of but mean parts and wit, and of great ignorance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Philosophy. 3. Against the civility of my nature thus to declare in such harsh terms, as they cannot but seem to more courtly ears, That so great a part of the Christian Church as the <hi>Roman</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, is the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which yet close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impartially attending to the Interpretation of the Angel, <hi>Revel.

                  <p>There being therefore thus many clogs in my way I think any man may be well assured as well as I am my self, that it is merely the Evidence of the truth that has driven me to assent thereunto. But they that are of another mind from me I will leave to themselves and others to consider, whether some carnal sense or worldly Interest hath not swayed their judgments.
