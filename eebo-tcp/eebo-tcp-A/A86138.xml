            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Myſterie</hi> here is not onely <hi>great,</hi> a <hi>Myſterie of Godlineſſe,</hi> but all this <hi>without controverſie.</hi> There are many <hi>great Myſteries</hi> in the world, but not <hi>great without controverſie;</hi> nay, not <hi>without great Controverſies.</hi> The world you ſee is full of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Diſputes about <hi>Truth,</hi> whileſt Truth her ſelfe lyes neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the middle; like <hi>Moſes</hi> his body, when the Devill and the Archangel ſtrove about it; dead, and buried, no man can tell where: Religion (as one complaines of old) is even loſt in Queſtions about Religion: wee pull ſo violently in our unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Diſputes, that at length breaking the Rope, wee ſall more aſunder, yea, the one ſide, if not both, muſt at laſt fall to the ground.

               <p>Not the Father, nor the holy-Ghoſt is made <hi>man,</hi> for then there ſhould have beene two Sonnes, but the middle perſon betweene both: as to preſerve the integritie of the bleſſed Trinitie, ſo the better to undertake the office of Mediation betweene God and man.</p>
               <p>But yet, though Father and holy-Ghoſt had no communion with the incarnation of the Sonne, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now this ſecond Perſon aſſumed not the perſon of one <hi>man;</hi> for then had that onely beene ſaved, which was aſſumed: but <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> to the end ſhee might ſave many, built her Houſe of that nature which is common to all: nor did he aſſume a perſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie made, for then ſhould he have two perſons, the one aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the other aſſumed: he tooke mans nature to his Perſon, that is, not onely the body; but the ſoule of man, that ſo the whole man, body and ſoule, might be ſaved.

Hee came of man, but not by man: hee was the immediate fruit of the wombe, but not of the loynes, and ſo is ſree from the touch and taint of our corruption; hee is the <hi>holy thing.</hi> Moreover, hee was <hi>conceived by the holy-Ghoſt:</hi> As <hi>Mary</hi> was the paſſive and materiall principle of this precious <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſo was the holy-Ghoſt the active and efficient; both ſtopping the courſe of originall ſinne in the Virgin, and ſanctifying the materials, from the firſt moment of her Conception.</p>
               <p>But is not <hi>Chriſt</hi> then the <hi>Sonne</hi> of his owne <hi>Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No: Fathers indeed beget their Children out of their owne ſubſtance, but the holy-Ghoſt onely framed <hi>fleſh</hi> for him, from whom he himſelfe proceeded: They both made the <hi>handmaid of the Lord,</hi> whom from thence, <hi>all generations ſhall call bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth, thirdly, Bredth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, not onely is God made <hi>fleſh,</hi> but made <hi>manifeſt in the fleſh;</hi> hee pitcht his Tabernacle among us: <hi>The Word</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>was made fleſh, and dwelt amongst us. He came</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>on the forme of a ſervant, he went about doing good. Wee have ſeene him with our eyes, wee have heard him with our eares, felt him with our hands,</hi> ſay his Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And why all this? Why made <hi>fleſh?</hi> And why made <hi>maifeſt in the fleſh?</hi> firſt, That God might be ſatisfied in the ſame nature wherein he was offended: ſecondly, That Satan might be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame nature wherein he deſtroyed man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>See here what God can doe in a piece of Clay. To worke curiouſly in Gold, or Silver, much commends the Workman: but to doe the ſame in mouldring Earth, commend: him more; ſo is it here: 'Tis a <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this is one of the ends why Chriſt came into the World; for firſt, hee came to <hi>Redeeme us,</hi> and then to <hi>ſanctifie us. This is hee</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>John) that came by water and blood;</hi> by <hi>blood,</hi> to take away the guilt; by <hi>water,</hi> to take away the filth of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, without this <hi>Imitation of Chriſt,</hi> no ſanctification; for we are ſanctified when wee are renewed unto God, re-indued with the Image of God, whereunto we were at firſt created. Now in an Image there are theſe two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſimilitude of one thing to another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a deduction, derivation, or impreſſion thereof on ſome other; from which againe wee take a third, a fourth, &amp;c. in want of which we alwayes run to the Originall, the prototype. Now as for the Image of God; its holineffe, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This in our firſt Creation did gloriouſly ſhine in our faces; in <hi>Adam</hi> wee loſt it; and therefore wee muſt all to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for it.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:116161:20"/>
               <p>But this cannot be, wee cannot come ſo neere him, as to looke into him, for he is a <hi>conſuming fire, hee dwells in light inacceſſible,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Who onely hath immortality, dwelling in the light, which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeene, nor can ſee.</hi> You ſee, if wee could come neere him, yet wee cannot ſee him, for he is inviſible: <hi>No man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>So that wee may as eaſily ſee that which is inviſible, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which is unapproachable, as of our ſelves to become holy againe, unleſſe the Lord ſhall pleaſe, through ſome veile, to exhibit his Image unto us; or through ſome Glaſſe, ſhall make the ſame to ſhine upon us: wee ſhall live and dye without it, ſtrangers from the life of God.</p>
               <p>Behold, the Sonne of God is made the Sonne of man, <hi>God made manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. So that through his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, as through a veile, wee have acceſſe to the holieſt of all: <hi>Hee is the Image of the inviſible God, Coloſ.</hi> 1.15. and <hi>by him are wee made the Sonnes of God, Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Wee all with open face, beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> So that as Chriſt is the Image of <hi>his Father, Heb.</hi> 1.3. ſo are we the <hi>Image of God;</hi> but with this difference, <hi>Chriſt us imago equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis, Chriſtianus imitationis;</hi> As the Image of an Emperour (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) is, <hi>aliter in nummo, aliter in filio;</hi> ſo the Image of God is, <hi>aliter in Chriſto, aliter in Christiano.</hi> The renewed are the <hi>Image of God, Non quantum ad naturalia</hi> (as the Schooles teach) though therein us yet be ſome remaines of our loſt glory; but as renewed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>quality</hi> of the myſticall body, where of Chriſt is the head and Saviour, requires this imitation; hee is our head, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſonnes unto glory, to make the Captaine of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings;</hi> For both hee that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all one; for which cauſe hee is not aſhamed to call them <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:116161:21"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is the ſumme of all Scriptures, and therefore neceſſarily the rule of all holineſſe: as the Apoſtles did, ſo muſt wee, preach nothing but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How too blame are thoſe,

                  </note> who are ſo farre from <hi>following Chriſt,</hi> that they <hi>follow man,</hi> any man, the worſt, the moſt, and thinke it their ſafeſt way. But if great men, if men in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie doe ſo, and ſo, then all is out of doubt. Their Religion is to them as their Coyne; all goes for Currant, that is ſtamped with Authoritie, and allowance of the State.

               </p>
               <p>But the men are good, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yet are they but men: and <hi>all men are Lyars;</hi> may both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and be deceived. <hi>Peter</hi> was a good man, yet once diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: ſo was <hi>Barnabas,</hi> yet ſnatcht away by example, into the like diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>You ſee in the Scripture, the failings of the Saints to hang on record; not that God either delights to ſee them, or others to gaze on them, for he hath caſt them all behind his back, and blotted them out of the Booke of his Remembrance; but that the Apoſtles admonition might ever be thought on, <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall: Cavenda tempeſtates flenda naufra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, Aug.</hi> And that wee might not thinke it ſafe to <hi>follow</hi> good men, no, not the beſt men in all things, nor would good men have us ſo to doe; <hi>Follow me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>as I follow Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1.</p>

               </p>
               <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. <hi>He that ſaith he is in Chriſt, ought to walke as he hath walked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Religiouſly:</hi> Beginning all things with God, ſanctifying every Creature and every Ordinance with prayer; and this longer or ſhorter, as the occaſions are more or leſſe ſerious, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things by the warrant of the Word; contemning our owne will, that wee may doe our Fathers: chuſing rather to loſe life then our obedience, as if there were but one will betweene God and us; doing all things for God, and reſerring all unto his glory.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:116161:22"/>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt walked <hi>holily,</hi> ſo muſt wee, for without <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt walked <hi>fruitfully</hi> in his Calling, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Hee went about doing good:</hi> hee watched and apprehended all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of being helpfull unto others, to their ſoules, to their bodies. Thus ſhould wee ſpend our dayes, and not as the moſt doe, who bring the day to an end without the performance of any thing, the remembrance whereof may comfort them at night; nay, doing things hurtfull both to themſelves and others, and thus continually. Thus account: So much time ſpent in idle Games, ſo much in unprofitable Companie, which might have beene ſpent in hearing, reading, praying, meduation, exerciſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for my ſoules health, or in workes of mercie, for the benefit of my afflicted Brother; did ever my Lord and Saviour thus <hi>walke,</hi> thus converſe?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt walked <hi>juſtly</hi> towards man; never deceived any by thought, word, or deed: <hi>There was no guile found in his mouth.</hi> Never covetouſneſſe entred his heart; hee gave every man his due: An admirable patterne of Civill Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This muſt wee <hi>follow,</hi> wee muſt <hi>walke as hee walked,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt walked in the <hi>Light;</hi> and this, a three-fold <hi>Light:</hi> firſt, in the puritie of his Nature; there was no <hi>darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him at all;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Thus muſt wee <hi>walke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, full of the Rayes of <hi>spirituall underſtanding;</hi> the Word of God not onely dwelling in our <hi>heads,</hi> but in our <hi>hearts;</hi> and in both, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, richly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, acting that <hi>Spirituall life,</hi> in our <hi>lives and converſation walking as Children of the Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Day: Qui male agit odit lucem.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:116161:22"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Embracing <hi>communion</hi> with our God, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing therein, as alſo in the place and meanes of his preſence. Though worldly men are then onely merry, when the thoughts of God are baniſhed their hearts, yet are the Saints of God no longer well, then in his preſence. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>If wee walke in the Light, as he is in the Light, wee have fellowſhip one with another, and the blond of Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne cleanſeth us from all ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye that have followed Chriſt:</hi> you that have framed your lives according to his <hi>example;</hi> you, who together with him, are of the ſame minde; <hi>thoſe are they that follow the Lambt, whither ſoever he goes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have the Saints; and in them their motion: but what of theſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones, and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> Here is their <hi>Quies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The degrees here are many; wee ſhall ariſe with them, in our diſcourſe, according to their order.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They ſhall ſit.</hi> Wee are here full of labour, ſubject to many changes, alterations, and diſcontentments. <hi>Man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>ſhooteth forth like a Flower, and is cut downe, he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth away as a Shadow, and never continueth in one ſtay:</hi> But a day is comming, wherein wee ſhall reſt from all our labours. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord, they reſt from their labours:</hi> wherein wee ſhall <hi>hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sunne light on us, or any heat, Revel.</hi> 7.16. Wherein <hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares from our eyes, Revel.</hi> 21.4.</p>
               <p>You ſee in nature, all things labour to attaine their laſt perfection: ſo our bodyes here, ſubject to mutabilitie, to Diſeaſes, the Stone, the Gout, Feavers, by which Death entring within our Walls, ſurprizeth the Caſtle of our hearts; and thus are wee ſtill in motion, to our laſt <hi>Exit,</hi> alwayes tending to perfection: whither when wee come, and arrive up above Sunne, Moone, and Starres, wee ſhall ſit downe with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:116161:23"/>
               <p>The Needle touched by the Load-ſtone, never gives over his trembling motion, till it ſtand againſt the North Pole, till it come to its Point: ſo wee, having once touched Chriſt, the true Load-ſtone of our Soules, by faith, neither are, nor can be at reſt, till wee reſt not onely in him, but with him; Then ſhall our bodyes be immutable; then ſhall wee <hi>ſit downe</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> for ever. Be of good comfort, your labours in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> your travailes in the Wilderneſſe ſhall not laſt for ever; a <hi>day of reſt</hi> is comming. In the meane time, let us take the advice and counſell the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.19. <hi>Repent, and turne unto the Lord, that your ſinnes may be done away, when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>followers of Chriſt</hi> ſhall one day <hi>ſit,</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> them. It followeth;</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They ſhall ſit on Thrones.</hi> What theſe Thrones are, is no leſſe unprofitable, then curious to enquire: its like they ſhall be of the Aire, becauſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>wee ſhall meet the Lord in the Aire;</hi> and if conforme to that of our Saviour, it muſt be ſo: for he ſhall <hi>ride in the Aire,</hi> and make <hi>the Clouds his Chariot, Revel.</hi> 14.14. <hi>I looked, and behold a white Cloud, and upon the Cloud one ſate like unto the Sonne of man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever theſe <hi>Thrones</hi> are, they promiſe two things, <hi>ſweeteſt Reſt,</hi> and <hi>greateſt State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sweeteſt Reſt,</hi> and tranquilitie, full acquieſcence, not onely to their bodies (as you have heard) but to their ſoules. Their bodies ſhall be free from the paine of travaile, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie of corruption: their ſoules ſhall be free from the waves of trouble, and the conflicts of paſſion: no feare, no griefe, no wrath, no deſire, nor carnall affection, ſhall any way diſturbe the quietneſſe of their <hi>ſweet Repoſe;</hi> they ſhall be, as ſatisfied with the fulneſſe of the Lord, ſo alſo ſecured by the omnipotencie of his greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>And as they ſhall enjoy <hi>ſweeteſt Eaſe,</hi> ſo ſhall they have <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt State:</hi> for as to <hi>ſit,</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Reſt;</hi> ſo to <hi>ſit in the preſence of God,</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> and <hi>Dignitie;</hi> and this infinite, and moſt incomparable.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:116161:23"/>
               <p>But why <hi>twelve Thrones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and his followers, confining the words to the Apoſtle, makes the ſoule of every Chriſtian to be a Throne, or place of reſidence, thus; They that receive the words of <hi>John,</hi> are the throne of <hi>John;</hi> they that receive the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> are the throne of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſurely the words extend farther, and have reſpect to CHRISTS Tribunall, where all the Elect have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places, and ſit at Table with him in the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinkes the number twelve therefore to bee here uſed, becauſe of the perfection of it, and ſo falls on a Platoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call myſterie.</p>
               <p>But not to trouble you with curioſities, the certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twelve, is here put for an incertaine, a finite, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; ſo that by <hi>twelve Thrones,</hi> wee are to underſtand an univerſality of <hi>Thrones,</hi> provided for the Saints in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places; For, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>in my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>On thoſe Thrones they ſhall ſit and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a judgement of power and authoritie, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God the Father, for <hi>hee is Iudge of the whole earthy:</hi> There is a judgement of honour, and delegates, that belongs to Chriſt, as hee is man; for <hi>the Father hath given all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Sonne:</hi> There is a judgement of aſſeſſion, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conſent and allowance, and this belongs to the whole company of Gods Elect.</p>
               <p>They <hi>ſhall judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not exempting <hi>Levi;</hi> yea, not onely all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but all the world, and all the creatures therein, though never ſo eminent and ſublime in glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Know you not, that the Saints ſhall judge the World?</hi> Yea, <hi>Angels, Devils.</hi> And how? as members of the myſticall body, whereof Chriſt is the head and Saviour. Chriſt and his Church are one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever is given to him, is alſo given to her. Chriſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116161:24"/>the primary Judge ſhall paſſe the Sentence, and the Saints ſhall approve it, and rejoyce therein; they ſhall triumph in the truth of divine Juſtice, with the ſweeteſt notes of praiſe and jubilation.</p>
               <p>See here the glory and honour of Gods people, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and ſuper-exaltation above the <hi>Starres of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> they are <hi>Citizens of Heaven. When God ſhall come to judge the world, thouſand thouſands of Angels ſhall come with him;</hi> but yet as his miniſters and ſervants: the Saints ſhall fit with him, as his familiars and aſſociates, <hi>upon Thrones,</hi> and that <hi>ever Thrones,</hi> and all the glorious hoaſt of his nobleſt creatures; their judgement (as the Schooles diſtinguiſh) is not <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis ſed manifeſtationis,</hi> they condemne none, onely they ſhew forth the praiſe and glory of God, in the juſtice of the Sentence on them whom Chriſt condemnes.</p>
               <p>Here then is ground of ſupport to all the people of God; you are now troubled and moleſted by the Devill and his agents, malicious adverſaries, you groane under unjuſt Cenſures and accuſations; bee content, a day is comming wherein the Saints ſhall judge both the <hi>evill angels,</hi> the <hi>Devils,</hi> and all their malicious inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Let our care be in the meane time, ſo to live and converſe here, as to be worthy of that honour then; farre bee it from them that are to judge the world, ſo to live, as to juſtifie the world by their prophane and impure converſation.</p>
               <p>Thus they that <hi>follow Chriſt, ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones, and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the regeneration, when the ſonne of man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his Glory:</hi> Wherein you have the determinate time of Glory.</p>

               <p>The Poſition,</p>
               <p>The <hi>regeneration,</hi> that is, the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> or otherwiſe the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116161:24"/>redemption of our bodies. A time is comming wherein all creatures ſhall be as it were <hi>new borne. Mortality</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of life,</hi> and <hi>this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Our bodies now ſubject to many infirmities, to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nakedneſſe, thirſt, cold, many diſeaſes, dull and heavie in the ſervice of God, ſhall then bee <hi>immortall,</hi> and therefore needing no bodily refreſhments: <hi>immortality</hi> ſhall chuſe death out of nature, and command ſleepe from the eyes; then ſhall our bodies have ſtrength to performe their owne actions: Were ſuch an <hi>Elixar</hi> to be bought, your Chymicks talke of, as would free us from all diſeaſes, and repaire the ruines of old age, who would not give all hee hath to have it? and ſuch an one there is in the hands of God, an <hi>Elixar of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis better</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.8.) <hi>for a man to enter into life, hurt and maymed, then having two hands, two feet,</hi> and ſo all parts intire, <hi>to be caſt into hell fire:</hi> True it is, were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but of this we may be ſure, we cannot goe to heaven, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imperfect, or without glory.

               <p>Firſt, wee ſhall have all the parts of our bodies <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>intire,</hi> though now maymed or deformed, yet than wee ſhall be perfect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe then all things ſhall be reduced to their former eſtate of beauty and perfection, that namely the body had in its firſt creation. <hi>The Heavens</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.21.) <hi>must containe Chriſt, till all things be reſtored.</hi>

               <p>Neither doth Chriſt there ſpeake of the body, but of the ſoule, and the concluſion would be this; that it is farre better for a man to loſe any, or all his limbes, for the ſaving of his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116161:25"/>ſoule, then to loſe his ſoule, and ſo to goe into hell with all his members. Feare not then to loſe a legge, or an arme, or an eye for Chriſt, every member then ſhall bee reſtored againe. Haſt thou loſt any member for Chriſt, or otherwiſe? trouble not thy ſelfe; remember, he that gave <hi>Malcus</hi> his eare againe, who was his enemy, will much more reſtore to thee thy parts who act his friend.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our bodies ſhall not onely be <hi>intire,</hi> but <hi>beautifull and lovely,</hi> though now deformed; much more, when ſtained with the pale and gaſtly colours of death; yet then we ſhall be exceeding faire, farre beyond the moſt exquiſite beauty of any that lived ever ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> for wee ſhall then be as <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie, on whoſe beauty and ſplendour the beaſts of the field ſtood gazing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple was full of beauty and glory; the ſecond Temple, the former being deſtroyed by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> was howſoever faire, yet farre ſhort of the former, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of beauty; but our bodies in that Day, ſhall bee reſtored to greater beautie and lovelineſſe then ever they had.</p>

How farre ſend they for complexion, and how deare doe they buy it? and this at laſt makes them more deformed; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beauty is not to bee had, till the <hi>Glorious morning of the Reſurrection;</hi> and the way to have it then, is to bee <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> now.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our bodies ſhall bee <hi>full of ſplendour;</hi> howſoever now darke and obſcure, yet then they ſhall bee as ſo many <hi>ſhining Starres, Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They ſhall ſhine as the Sunne in the Kingdome of their Father, Matth.</hi> 13.43. <hi>Moſes</hi> returning from God, after his fortie dayes conference with him, was ſo full of <hi>ſhining Glory in his face,</hi> by the <hi>Reflection</hi> of the <hi>Glory of GOD,</hi> that the people could not behold him: How full of Glory ſhall our bodies bee, when wee ſhall abide with God, not fortie dayes onely, but for ever and ever?</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:116161:25"/>
               <p>Fourthly, our bodies ſhall be <hi>immutable, and immortall,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no change, not needing the Elements, or Elementary food. God doth with us, as the Goldſmith with his Gold or Silver, firſt melts our bodies by death, and then makes us up againe to a more glorious forme, as <hi>Veſſels of Honour</hi> to ſtand before him in his Temple for ever. A ſweet meditation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the time of ſickneſſe, and in the houre of death, againſt the crawling wormes, and the place of ſilence. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>that my Redeemer liveth, and that hee ſhall ſtand at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin, Wormes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelfe, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another, though my reines be conſumed within me, Iob</hi> 19.25, 26, 27.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Our bodies ſhall bee <hi>ſpirituall: 'Tis ſowne</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>a naturall body, 'tis raiſed a ſpirituall body;</hi> For then they ſhall bee ſuſtained by the Spirit without meat and drinke; not as <hi>Moſes</hi> on the Mount for fortie dayes onely, but for ever and ever; and whereas now the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit; there being a <hi>Law in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, rebelling against the law of the minde;</hi> Then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall bee ſubject to the Spirit, and in all things attend on him.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly, <hi>This body</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is ſowne in weakeneſſe, it riſeth in power;</hi> whereas now wee are weary of kneeling in prayer, weary of Prayer it ſelfe; Inſomuch that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> muſt attend <hi>Moſes,</hi> to hold up his inſeebled hands; but then ſhall our bodies bee able to performe their owne actions, without deſatigation; they ſhall then bee able to move themſelves any way with eaſe, upwards, downwards, backwards, forwards, more eaſily then now to lift up an hand; and <hi>hee ſhall change our vile bodies, and make them like
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116161:26"/>unto his glorious body, according to his mighty working, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, not onely man, but the Heavens and the Earth, ſhall in that day bee as it were new borne. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I create a new Heaven and a new Earth;</hi> So it is likewiſe in 2 <hi>Pet. 3. Whereas the Heavens now give raine and ſnow, &amp;c.</hi> then they ſhall exhibit Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.64. <hi>Hereafter ſhall yee ſee the ſonne of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and comming in the clouds of Heaven:</hi> Whereas the Heavens are now ever whirling, and wheeling about, alwayes winding up the thread of mans life, then they ſhall ſtand faſt for ever; the Heavens ſhall reſt from their motion, and receive a greater perfection of brightneſſe and claritie: The ayre ſhall be purged from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; the fire from conſuming quality, the water from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, the earth from weeds and all hurtfull creatures, yea from barrenneſſe, ſhe ſhall bring forth as before the Fall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour and Husbandry.</p>
               <p>And all this for the comfort of the <hi>Saints,</hi> who are to paſſe this way into Heaven, in their <hi>long white Robes,</hi> as Princes through ſome Gallerie, into their Chambers of Preſence. Then this Earth, howſoever <hi>now a Valley of Teares,</hi> ſhall be unto us a <hi>Doore of Hope in the Valley of Achor.</hi> The wicked ſhall ſee this, and by it, as through a Creviſe, the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but themſelves ſhut out of both.</p>
               <p>But when ſhall this <hi>regeneration</hi> of the Creatures be? <hi>When the Sonne of man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt ſhall come to judge the quick and dead:</hi> ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. <hi>And he commanded us to preach unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to teſtifie, that it is hee which was ordained of God, to be the Judge of quick and dead.</hi> So againe in the 17. Chapter, verſe 31. <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which hee will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by that man whom he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that hee hath rayſed him from the dead.</hi> And ſo <hi>wee beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee knowes all, even our moſt ſecret thoughts: <hi>Hell and deſtruction</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>are before the Lord,</hi> how much more the hearts of the ſonnes of men? All things are naked
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116161:26"/>and broken up before him; and as hee knowes all, ſo hee is able to puniſh, and that not the body onely; hee can caſt both body and ſoule into Hell. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. <hi>Whoſoever was not found written in the Booke of the Lambe, was caſt into the Lake of fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, this ſhould teach us <hi>feare and trembling; Knowing the terrors of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>wee perſwade men. And</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter) if yee call him Father, who without respect of perſons judgeth every man according to his workes, paſſe the time of your ſojourning here in feare,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, learne from hence to looke to your <hi>Packes:</hi> ſee what <hi>Wares</hi> you carry with you; for in <hi>that Day,</hi> all muſt be opened.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, learne hence to <hi>agree with your adverſarie while you are in the way.</hi> If you were to dye to morrow, what would you doe to day, how ſpend your time? And yet you may dye ſooner: Take heed, <hi>At the Tree falleth, there it lyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Art thou injured, ſlandered, mifuſed any way? Remember, a <hi>Day</hi> is comming, wherein all muſt ſtand at Chriſts Tribunall. <hi>You</hi> (ſaith <hi>Corah,</hi> with his Complices, unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron) you take too much upon you, Numb.</hi> 16. And what doth <hi>Moſes</hi> anſwer? <hi>To morrow</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the Lord ſhall ſhew who are his.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>But with me it is a very ſmall thing, that I ſhon'd be judged of you, or of mans judgement; yea, I judge not mine owne ſelfe, for I know nothing by my ſelfe: yet am I not hereby juſtified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.</hi> Therefore judge nothing before the time, untill the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the heart; and then ſhall every man have prayſe of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Art thou afraid to appeare before the <hi>Judge?</hi> Remember, it is thy Saviour th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> dyed for thee. If <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler feared not to got before him, becauſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116161:27"/>him of Libertie; how comfortably then are wee to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the Judge, being alreadie aſſured, all ſhall goe well with us? Hee is our <hi>Judge,</hi> who is our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour:</hi> a moſt comfortable Meditation. <hi>I am your Brother</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſeph</hi> unto his Brethren) <hi>I am your Brother Joſeph:</hi> This could not but comfort them, howſoever conſcious of their injuries done him. So it is here.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be our <hi>Judge;</hi> how warily then, and holily, are wee to live <hi>now,</hi> that wee may not be aſhamed at his <hi>Comming? Peter</hi> being on the Seas, and ſeeing his <hi>Maſter</hi> on the yonder ſhoare, <hi>girds his Coat about him:</hi> One would thinke, hee ſhould rather have caſt his Coat from him: No, no, hee was to appeare before his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and hee would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare comely. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For wee muſt all appeare before the Iudgement-Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that hea hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, Happie are all they, that are gone out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them which are in Chriſtleſus, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve further:</p>
               <p>As <hi>Chriſt ſhall come to judge the world;</hi> ſo being <hi>come,</hi> hee <hi>ſhall ſit in the Throne of his glory. Dun.</hi> 7.9, 14. <hi>I behold, and lee are like the Some of Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>If wee tell you of <hi>Chriſts Glory</hi> at his <hi>Transſiguration in the Mount,</hi> you will tell us of that of <hi>Moſes</hi> comming from his fortie dayes conference with the Lord.</p>
               <p>But the difference is grear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> was onely in his <hi>face;</hi> that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> all over his <hi>Body:</hi> ſecondly, when <hi>Moſes</hi> veyled his <hi>face,</hi> none could ſee his <hi>beautle;</hi> but that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> appeared through his <hi>garments.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> made the people <hi>afraid;</hi> but that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>lovely: Bonum eſt, eſſe hit,</hi> ſaid they that were with him. Fourthly, <hi>Moſes</hi> could not communicate his <hi>glory</hi> unto any, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall make our bodyes like unto his glorious Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the <hi>Glory of Chriſt</hi> was ſuch at his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> what will his <hi>Glory</hi> be in that <hi>Day, when hee ſhall ſit in his Throne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee came in the forme of a ſervant,</hi> was a man of <hi>ſerrowes, knowning infirmities;</hi> Our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> like continuall <hi>droppings</hi> of water, putting out the <hi>Lumpe</hi> of his life. But when hee comes againe, O what beauty, what reſplendant Majeſty!</p>
               <p>But what of all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In that day, they that have followed Christ, ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones, and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve, Firſt, the Saints ſhall partake of CHRISTS GLORY.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This point, like the Red Sea, opens it ſelfe for the paſſage of Gods people into Heaven, and then cloſeth againe on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, to their deſtruction.

               </p>
               <p>Gather hence a neceſſity of a <hi>godly life;</hi> if wee will be <hi>happy,</hi> wee muſt be <hi>holy; Revel.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that doe his Commandements, that they may have a right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City.</hi> This alſo the

               <p>Thirdly, as the <hi>followers of Chriſt</hi> ſhall bee partakers of <hi>Chriſts Glory,</hi> and <hi>they onely,</hi> ſo <hi>they onely</hi> in the <hi>Regeneration, when Chriſt ſhall come in his glory,</hi> not till then, that is the day of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore, wee are to long and look out for this <hi>Day. Job</hi> 14.14. <hi>If a man dye, ſhall he live againe?
