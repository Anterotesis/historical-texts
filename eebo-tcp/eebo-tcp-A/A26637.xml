            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Certain Predictions of the Great <hi>ALCOS,</hi> Aſtrologer and Mathematician in Ordinary to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> upon the Two Comets which have Appeared in our Hemiſphere <hi>1681,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AFTER having diligently Conſidered the Courſe of the <hi>Planets,</hi> made Obſervations upon the Malignant Influences of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and paſſed whole Nights in Contemplation of the <hi>Comet</hi> which Appeared in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, in the Cloſe of the Evening, and of that which Appeared in the Morning before <hi>Break of Day;</hi> And having Conſidered by the <hi>Rules of Astrology,</hi> That the Evening Comet entring into <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and going out by the <hi>Scorpions Tayl,</hi> which extends it ſelf 800 Leagues, threatens a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Plague, Terrible Earthquakes,</hi> and <hi>Prodigious Thunders,</hi> by which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Towns in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> will be ſwallowed up and laid in Aſhes. The Comet which Appears in the Morning, having <hi>Cancer Reverſt</hi> underneath it, viſibly declares that the <hi>Angel Abiron,</hi> Puniſher of the Sins of the World hath a Sword drawn for the deſtruction of a <hi>Maritine Prince,</hi> who hath drawn on himſelf the juſt Anger of God, but that the Preſence of the Sun which hides this Angry and Fiery Comet from our Sight, aſſures us, That the Religious Valour of the Knights of <hi>Maltha,</hi> encouraged by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Zeal of our Holy Father the Pope, will appeaſe the God of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> and that their Armes will be ſo Victorious over the Turks, that their Succeſs ſhall amaze all the World. The approaching Summer ſhall be dry ſo long, that the greateſt Rivers ſhall be dried up, and the Ground ſo hot, that the Beaſts, Serpents and other Animals, ſhall be forced to come out of their Dens and Holes; And Men ſhall be Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with <hi>burning Feavers, Swellings</hi> and <hi>bloody Fluxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ram</hi> aſcending towards <hi>Libra</hi> ſhews us, That the laſt year in the Month of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> the <hi>Mart</hi> is entred into the Barr before <hi>Gri Riere</hi> after ſhews, that in <hi>April</hi> of this preſent year the Sovereign Abeſse of <hi>Franconia</hi> ſhall be delivered of a Son, which ſhall neither be of <hi>Cap</hi> nor <hi>Ville,</hi> but of <hi>Mart</hi> and of <hi>Rig,</hi> who ſhall be an Aſtrologer in our Dutchy of <hi>Parma,</hi> and ſhall one day be acknowledged Prince of <hi>Franconia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 22 <hi>July Mars</hi> following at the Heels of <hi>Sagittary</hi> with his Dart, we may expect ſo general a Hail, that it will be very prejudicial to all Grain that is not gotten in; And <hi>Bacchus</hi> will be ſo afflicted, that he exhorts his good Children not idly to empty all the Veſſels this year.</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>Heaven</hi> is ſo angry, and the whole World ſo laden with Sins, Diſorders and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, that Nature her ſelf ſhall be ready to Expire, and the Earth hold as it were but by a Thread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Vices,</hi> as <hi>Ambition, Jealouſie, Envy, Impiety,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> of all Nations ingeneral, and every Man in particular have drawn down the juſt Anger of God upon us</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Europe</hi> will fall quickly; I know no Eſtate whoſe Ruine we may not fear. This Age perhaps ſhall be the laſt of all Empires, and (may be) we ſhall hear, That the Univerſe is at its End; All Mountains ſhall be brought low, the <hi>Alpes</hi> ſhall be Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſtricken, the <hi>Pireneans</hi> beaten down and levelled; The Sins of Men are grown ſo great, and their Diſorders ſo Monſtrous and Prodigious, that we may well expect to ſee this laſt Moment, if we Repent not, and Mortifie our ſelves; which only can A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſeverity of theſe terrible Judgments of God.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>God through his Love to us doth ſhow,</l>
               <l>By th' Stars what he intends to do;</l>
               <l>That thereby knowing his Intent,</l>
               <l>We may of our ill Works Repent.</l>
