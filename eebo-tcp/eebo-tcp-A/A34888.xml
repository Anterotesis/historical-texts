            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full <hi>and</hi> Clear REPLY To a Paper INTITULED, REASONS For a Limited <hi>EXPORTATION</hi> OF WOOLL.</head>
            <p>BEfore I come directly to reply to the ſaid Anſwer, I ſhall premiſe a few things; Firſt, though my Antagoniſt finds his Deſign Oppoſed by ſeveral Diſcourſes under the Name of <hi>W. C.</hi> (and chiefly by one called <hi>Englands Intereſt</hi>) yet he hath done me the Honour to Front his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38256:2"/>
courſe with divers Propoſitions, allowed even by himſelf;</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore anſwerably endeavour to treat the ſaid <hi>Author</hi> with all that Civility, that is neceſſary in this Caſe, granting to him what is true, rectifying what I conceive to be miſtaken; and anſwering ſuch objections, as are materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs ſay, that I had no thoughts of appearing in Publick any more, and could not eaſily have been moved thereunto, had not my Zeal to the Commerce of the Nation (which is at preſent ſolely maintained by the Woollen Manufacture of it) Raiſed my fears ſo far as to believe a great Prejudice is coming upon Us, and ſo far as to doubt alſo that we may be haſtning of it, by thoſe very means we would endeavour to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot but like the dumb Child ſpeak, when he ſaw a Knife at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throat, I mean, when I conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity we are like to be in from the <hi>French</hi> Kings Vigilancy, and the great Endeavours that he hath of late uſed to acquire the making of the Woollen Manufacture in his own Kingdome,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38256:3"/>
and what Artifice and vaſt Expence he doth uſe to effect his ſaid deſign, both in <hi>France,</hi> and by his Agents here in <hi>England,</hi> even at this very day, notwithſtanding his Mind is and cannot but be ſo much engaged in the preſent Wars: And if he doth this in the very midſt of his diſtractions, what will he not do, or what may we not expect hereafter from him when he ſhall be at Peace with all his Neighbours, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially having already gotten ſuch Quantities of our Wooll, as he hath.</p>
            <p>And to encourage the Manufacture thereof in his own Kingdom, he hath even very lately iſſued forth his Edict, for the erecting Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in many Towns in <hi>France,</hi> both for the ſetting all ſorts of Perſons at work (that are able) in the Woollen Manufacture, and for the Maintenance of all Indigent Perſons, and not to ſuffer a Begger there.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>French</hi> King, how fair ſoever he pretends a Friendſhip to us, be Deſigning by all wayes and means, to Undermine our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and by it to prejudice us in our Trade and Strength by Sea, I may I hope be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if I am more than indifferently concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38256:3"/>
or more than ordinarily warm, to think that we our ſelves ſhould endeavour to perfect His Deſign by delivering up our Wooll, the. Foundation of ſo Rich a Manufacture, into His hands; for that which is moved, is moved principally (if not ſolely) for the <hi>French</hi> Kings advantage, and that which is deſired (if granted) tends to our own Inevitable ruine.</p>
            <p>Nor can we hereafter think of ſo Vain and Idle a Vhing, as to recover our Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture once loſt, or to preſerve the Kings Cuſtoms, or the Strength and Shipping of this Great Kingdom without it.</p>
            <p>Upon all which conſiderations, I cannot but humbly entreat the Nobility and Gentry, (and more eſpecially ſuch as have the Honour to ſerve their Country, in Parliament) ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to reflect upon the wiſdom of that Great Prince, King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. and upon the Method which he in his Reign uſed, now ſo long ſince to gain the Woollen Manufacture out of <hi>Flanders</hi> into this Countrey, and withal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially compare that with the preſent Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>French</hi> King before mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:38256:4"/>And then to Conſider whether, we have not Reaſon to do the utmoſt we may to Prevent his Deſign, or whether we have Reaſon to do all that we can (nay more than he himſelf doth ask or expect from us) by a Law to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and Incourage his Deſign.</p>
            <p>We muſt be very ſhort-ſighted, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not that after he hath ſupplyed his own Country, he will not only endeavour, but will ſoon be able, to ſupply <hi>Flanders, Portugal, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Streights,</hi> to gain an Advantage to his own Subjects; for if he may break the Laws of Commerce, and lay what Impoſitions he pleaſeth upon our Cloth, and all other our Native Commodities, even while we are at Peace with him, why may he not alſo lay an Impoſition upon all our ſhips that paſs rhe <hi>Streights,</hi> or that ſhall dare to Trade or bring the ſame Commodities that he doth in any Port of <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> where the Subjects of his Greatneſs comes? And when our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is loſt and our Manufacture gon, and our Ships impoſed upon that ſhall paſs the Seas, what ſhall be left to defend our ſelves in caſe we will not alſo receive his Codex, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38256:4"/>
he ſhall (for the greatneſs of his name) think fit to require of us.</p>
            <p>All which things, whether they be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient not only to be wiſhed but to be Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to by a Law, I humbly leave to my Opponents themſelves to judge. For when the Trade that not only brings ſuch a Revenue to his Majeſty, but is the Riches and Strength of this Kingdom ſhall be loſt, as is now attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what Way or Means may we as Rational Perſons, think (on) to prevent any of thoſe Miſchiefs before mentioned.</p>
            <p>This General being premiſed, I ſhall now enter upon the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> it ſelf: the main Aim or Scope of my Antagoniſt divides it Self into two Parts, the one to prove that there ought to be a <hi>Limited Tranſportation of Wooll;</hi> the other that by a <hi>Limited Exportation of Wooll</hi> the Price of it may be <hi>Raiſed:</hi> and by the <hi>Raiſing</hi> of this, the Rents of Lands, may and will be encreaſed, and his Majeſties Cuſtomes greatly Advanced; and if theſe things were Really Practicable, I ſhould not only be ſo Juſt to my Self, and to my <hi>Opponents,</hi> but ſo juſt to the <hi>Nation,</hi> as not to put Pen to Paper to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38256:5"/>
my Reader, and much leſs to expoſe my ſelf to a Stage of Contention, as I am now like to do; but for as much as the quite contrary will (if I miſtake not) appear, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Examine</hi> and <hi>Weigh</hi> thoſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> which my <hi>Oppnent</hi> hath brought for thoſe <hi>Aſſertions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas my Opponent doth endeavour to Alarm the Nation, <hi>that for want of the vending our ſuperfluous</hi> Wooll <hi>abroad, that the</hi> Farmer <hi>and the</hi> Landlord <hi>are ſo much damnified, that the one cannot pay his Rent, nor the other ſuſtain his Taxes, and that this is the chiefeſt, if not the ſole Reaſon of ſinking our Rents, and throwing up Farms, and the Miſery of the whole Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conſiquence is not allowed, that being aſſigned for a General Cauſe, which is but one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many, and that a very ſmall one; the true Cauſe of the abateing the Price of Land, and leſſening the Rents, ſhall be given in the Anſwer to the next pretence in this Head; (Viz.) <hi>That it is much more the Concern of the</hi> Nation <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Nobility, Gentry, and thoſe that the</hi> Land <hi>of this Country belongs unto; rather than regard a few Artifficers, who are employed in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:38256:5"/>
               <hi>up of the</hi> Wooll <hi>of this Nation, or to regard the Merchant, who gains by the Exportation of our Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Humbly crave leave to ſay, that the ſaid Argument doth wholly depend upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is no way fit to be Granted, (<hi>Viz.</hi>) as if the Intereſts of the <hi>Merchant, Mariner,</hi> and <hi>Artificer,</hi> were not only Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to, but wholly Inconſiſtent with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Farmers,</hi> whereas there is nothing more evident than the contrary; ſo that the whole Argument it Self falls for want of a Foundation. For the clearing of which let us conſider, that in as much as it is Impoſible, that we ſhould defend our ſelves, as an Iſland, otherwiſe than by the ſtrength of our Shipping, and ſeeing this is much leſs poſible to be done now, at ſuch a Juncture of Time when our neareſt Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours do (partly out of Fear, and partly out of Emulation) multiply Shipping upon us, and uſe all endeavours that are poſſible to gain the Dominion of the Sea from us, it is hence clear, that we muſt either ſay, that the Intreſt of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Farmer,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:38256:6"/>
is not the ſame with the Intereſt of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or if it be the ſame with the Intereſt of the Nation, it muſt be their Intereſt then, to uphold the Trade and Shipping of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Conſequently to uphold the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <p>But for as much as all that underſtand Trade, do well know that all the Commerce of this Nation, doth for the value and bulk of it, Intirely depend upon the <hi>Woollen-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,</hi> Conſequently it muſt be the Intereſt of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Farmer,</hi> to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Woollen-Manufacture,</hi> as much as 'tis to uphold Trade, or to uphold the Strength of our Shipping by Sea: For what will the Lands of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> proffit them? or what will become of the Privilidges and Rights of Engliſh Men, if through the Loſs of our <hi>Wollen-Manufacture,</hi> we Looſe our Trade, and by the Loſs of this, we want Shipping to Defend our Selves?</p>
            <p>To this Argument let us alſo add, that if there be no oppoſition between the Intereſt of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> and the Intereſt of the <hi>Farmer,</hi> (as no Man doth pretend
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38256:6"/>
there is) than there can be no Oppoſition between the Intereſt of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and the Intereſt of the <hi>Artifficer,</hi> who Works up the <hi>Wooll</hi> of all he Country.</p>
            <p>For beſides the Proffit that doth ariſe to the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> by the Houſes which are taken, and by the Lands that are Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and by the Workmen under them, it's well known, that the ſaid <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and Workmen are Serviſeable to the <hi>Farmer,</hi> not only for the buying up of his <hi>Wooll,</hi> but for the buying up all manner of Victuals alſo; by the which not only one, but all the parts of the <hi>Farmers</hi> Rents come to be diſcharged, one <hi>Clothier</hi> Imploying not only one or two Hundred Perſons, but ſometimes one or two Thouſand; and Conſequently, if we ſhall admit that there are in <hi>England</hi> not above five Thouſand <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and that each of theſe (one with anothet) do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but two Hundred and Fifty Workmen, the whole will amount to upward of one Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; wherefore if we allow for each of theſe People, but four pound <hi>Per. An.</hi> one with another; the whole will amount to between
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38256:7"/>
four and five <hi>Millions</hi> of Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> Per. <hi>An.</hi> which <hi>Yearly</hi> Sum the Farmer doth Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately receive, and Conſequently the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> from the Poor and Contemptible <hi>Artificer,</hi> over and above what is further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by them to the <hi>Shoomakers, Taylors,</hi> and other <hi>Trades,</hi> that could not live and be Maintained without them, nor the Farmer himſelf, if all theſe <hi>Trades</hi> ſhould Fail.</p>
            <p>And this leads us alſo, to take notice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother miſtake in my <hi>Opponent,</hi> and ſuch as is no ſmall one, which is, that in aſmuch as it is Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and ſuch as may be clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated; that there is at leaſt if not much more than a <hi>Milion</hi> of Perſons, employed in the <hi>Clothing-Trade,</hi> and hath their dependance wholly upon the ſaid <hi>Manufacture:</hi> It's hence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, how much my <hi>Opponent</hi> hath miſtaken himſelf in ſuppoſing, that though our <hi>Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Trade</hi> ſhould be loſt, yet all the Perſons that are now employed in it, might find work from the <hi>Farmers,</hi> foreſeeing it's Matter of Fact, that the <hi>Farmer</hi> is able to ſupply himſelf with as many Labourers, and more than he hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for, without ſomnch as medling with that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38256:7"/>
of the <hi>Clothing-Trade:</hi> It muſt unavoydably follow; that if our <hi>Manufacture</hi> ſhould be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally loſt, as there will be above a <hi>Million</hi> of People; that muſt either Starve, or Beg, or be put to the Charge of ſeveral Pariſhes, ot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Steal or Rob, or leave the Kingdom; ſo it's as evident, that the <hi>Farmer</hi> after all this, will not only be leſs able to employ Labourers, than he was before, but leſs able to pay his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, by Four or Five <hi>Millons</hi> every Year.</p>
            <p>And when ſuch an Abatement as this ſhall be made of the <hi>Farmers</hi> Income: I ſhall leaveit then to any wiſe Man to Conſider what will become of the Price of Lands, or Value of Rents, and how much this will advantage the Grower or Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Wooll?</hi> and to make good this Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and free it from all Suſpiſion of Slightneſs, we ſhall further offer to Conſideration, that whatſoever is the true Vallue of all the <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len-Manufacture</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rty,</hi> and <hi>Commonalty</hi> do receive among them, near, if not more than Nine Parts of Ten. For inaſmuch as all who are well acquainted with the <hi>Clothing-Trade,</hi> do know that it is not a Tenth Part of the Proffit, nor ſometimes the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38256:8"/>
Twentieth that is gained by the <hi>Clothier,</hi> or firſt <hi>Employer,</hi> who frequently looſeth of the very Intereſt of his Mony; conſequently it muſt of neceſſity follow, that Nine of the Ten Parts, if not Nine-teen of Twenty Parts of the whole Value of the ſaid <hi>Manufacture</hi> muſt be diſtributed to the Nation; ſo that admitting the whole <hi>Wollen-Manufacture</hi> of this Nation, comprehending <hi>Cloath, Stuffs, Bays, Stokings,</hi> and all other of the ſaid <hi>Manufacture,</hi> do amount to Four <hi>Millions</hi> of Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> Per. <hi>An.</hi> (more or leſs) there will not come of that Great Sum to the <hi>Clothier,</hi> or firſt Employer, much above <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand</hi> Pounds (if ſo much;) ſo that <hi>Three Millions and Eight Hundred Thouſand</hi> Pounds <hi>Per. An.</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be diſtributed to the Nation by Virtue, of the <hi>ſaid Clothing-Trade;</hi> whereof we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſuppoſe the <hi>Farmers,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Noblity</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> muſt receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Part.</p>
            <p>It is well known alſo, that it is ſolely by our Trade, that not only this Great City of <hi>London</hi> it Self, but ſeveral other Large Cities of this Nation do wholly Depend; and which if our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38256:8"/>
Trade were removed, they would ſoon be deſerted by their reſpective Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>And then we cannot but offer to Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> or <hi>Farmers,</hi> would find a Market for their Commodities, or find a Price anſwerable to them.</p>
            <p>All which Particulars I have been the larger in, to remove that Miſtake, which is almoſt as Diſtructive to the Nation, as the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> it Self; which is that mentioned by my <hi>Opponent (Viz.)</hi> that the Intereſt of the <hi>Merchant,</hi> or the Intereſt of the <hi>Cloathier</hi> and <hi>Artifficer</hi> is not Conſiſtent with the Intereſt of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry;</hi> the contrary being made ſufficiently to appear.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Opponents</hi> Third Argument is, <hi>that</hi> Wooll <hi>was at twelve pound Per Pack in the Year 1647, when</hi> Wooll <hi>was Prohibited, and that in the following Year, it was ſold for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pound Per Pack, but that</hi> Wooll <hi>ever ſince by reaſon of the ſaid Prohibition, (as is pretended) is fallen of its price, and is now not worth above four or five pound Per Pack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Argument, there ſeems to be a Failure in two Reſpects, one, as if the <hi>Wooll</hi> of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38256:9"/>
the Nation hath never bore any Price ſince the time of the Prohibition, whereas it may be made appear, that after the Year 1650, <hi>Wooll</hi> bore a very conſiderable Price, from ten pound <hi>Per</hi> Pack to twenty foure Pound <hi>Per</hi> Pack, according to the goodneſs of the ſaid <hi>Wooll,</hi> and continued ſo for ſome time, which ſhews us another miſtake in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if the fall of the price of <hi>Wooll</hi> were wholly to be aſcribed to the Prohibition of it, whereas indeed there are two other cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that are very evident.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> From the diſcouragment that hath been put upon the <hi>Clothier,</hi> and upon the Vent of our <hi>Woollen-Manufacture,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Kings Arbitrary Impoſitions upon it, to the almoſt utter Prohibition of it; whereby now there cannot be ſo much wrought of it as formerly, which had otherwiſe certainly been, and then no ſuch occaſion or pretence as this would have been taken to complain of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous <hi>Wooll,</hi> and therefore as this cannot be denyed to be a true cauſe why more of our <hi>Wooll</hi> comes to be unwrought than formerly, ſo 'tis clear that thoſe very Men that are now
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38256:9"/>
pleaded for by my <hi>Opponent,</hi> (I mean the Stealers and Tranſporters of <hi>Wooll</hi> about <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and the places adjacent, not for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but for filthy greedineſs of Gain and Lucre) have highly contributed to it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lawes of the Nation againſt it, and notwithſtanding the Ruine of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is Dayly Jeoperdied by it, in which reſpect I cannot but Confeſs, that <hi>Rumney</hi>-Marſh hath indeed Created an Intereſt by it ſelf, but it's ſuch an Intereſt, which neither is, nor hath been Conſiſtent with the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Nation, nor with the Intereſt of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> in General, ſo that the ſaid Stealers or Tranſporters of <hi>Wooll,</hi> have been the main and principal Cauſe of both theſe Inconveniences, (<hi>viz</hi>) both of the Loſs of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> and the Loering the Price of our <hi>Wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Cauſe of the Fall of the Price of <hi>Wooll,</hi> eſpecially of late Years, hath been the Neceſſitating of <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſtock their <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Ground with <hi>Sheep,</hi> inſtead of great <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and thoſe of the beſt-Breed of <hi>England,</hi> by which meanes, as <hi>Wooll</hi> hath of late Years
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38256:10"/>
been more encreaſed, then ever at any time before within his Majeſties Dominions, ſo the Conſequence of this Extraordinary Increaſe (and not any Fault in the <hi>Clothier</hi> or <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturer</hi>) is that which hath not only brought down the Price, but hath occaſioned ſo great a quantity to be ſent Abroad into Forreign Parts, as it bears now almoſt as ſmale a Price beyond Sea as Here; and therefore in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, my <hi>Opponent</hi> hath Aſſigned that for a Cauſe; which is no Cauſe at all, may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Appear, becauſe it's matter of Fact, that <hi>Wooll</hi> bore as good a Price, if not a better (after the ſaid Prohibition as it did before) for many Years, till that breach of Commerce which was put upon us by the <hi>French</hi> King; which wee before mentioned, and until that Unfortunate <hi>Act</hi> (for ſo I muſt Humbly crave leave to call it) was made againſt the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle, upon ſuppoſition that it would Raiſe the Price of Land here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereas the quite contrary Effect hath been too much Experienced (<hi>viz</hi>) that it hath Laid ſuch a Foundation for the Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38256:10"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> as will not quickly (I fear) be Recovered.</p>
            <p>The next thing Alleged by my <hi>Oppoent,</hi> is, <hi>that a Limited Exportation of</hi> Wooll, <hi>will be more for the Advantage of our</hi> Woollen <hi>Trade, and leſs for that beyond the Sea, than the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of it hath been.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Aſcertion, if my <hi>Opponent</hi> had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, Sufficiently, and Effectually made good, he might juſtly have Merited the Name, for being the greateſt Maſter of Reaſon in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed ſeeing a <hi>Paradox</hi> more ſtrange, and more hard to be Conceived, could not eaſily be ſtated, I could not but expect, that ſome Arguments more Remarkable than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, would Immediately have followed it, but finding (contrary to my Expectations) nothing beyond a bare Affermation, <hi>that if Strangers had a Liberty to Buy what</hi> Wooll <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleaſe, they would Pay Dearer for it, then now they do, and that our Clothiers would therefore have it the Cheaper, and by this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage would be able to under-ſel the Strangers in their Manufacture:</hi> I ſay finding litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, to be brought, either by way
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38256:11"/>
of Reaſon, or of Argument, to maintain this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, I was ſoon convinced that it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as uncapable to be proved as it was before, and a little to evidence the Improbability of the ſaid Conſequence, we ſhall here offer ſome few Reaſons to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi> I crave leave to ſay, that it's no way likely that the Grower in any part of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould not be willing to get the utmoſt Price for his <hi>Wooll</hi> that he can, and therefore not likely that any Grower what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, will ſell his <hi>Wooll</hi> to the Natives of this Countrey, for a leſs Price than he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes he may have of Strangers: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not at all likely, that our own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers ſhould Buy it Cheaper than others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Admiting that it ſhould be made Unlawful, for any Stranger to Buy up <hi>Wooll,</hi> till ſuch a time or ſeaſon of the Year, to the end that our Clothiers might firſt Provide themſelves of what they need, yet it would no way follow, but Strangers may have their Agents and Factors here, that may Purchaſe it at the ſame eaſe, with the ſame conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and at the ſame Rates that our Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38256:11"/>
are like to do, nor can I perceive any thing propounded by my <hi>Opponent,</hi> that would be able in the leaſt, either to Prevent it, or Obviate it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> And this great Omition in my <hi>Opponent,</hi> I could not but take the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, becauſe if no <hi>Expedient</hi> can be found out by him (which I doubt there will not) to prevent Strangers, from giving what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mſſions they pleaſe, to Buy up what Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of <hi>Wooll</hi> ſoever they ſhall think fit, here in this Countrey; as I ſee not how, or by what meanes, the Exportation of our <hi>Wooll,</hi> ſhould be any way poſſible to be <hi>Limmited,</hi> ſo neither do I ſee how the <hi>Clothier</hi> here, ſhould be ſufficiently; and certainly Furniſhed, or how the <hi>Manufacture</hi> it ſelf ſhould be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being any way preſerved, and if theſe Miſchiefs, and Inconveniencies cannot but follow, and cannot but be a Neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch a Law, as is propounded by my <hi>Opponent;</hi> and that nothing to Obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or prevent theſe Inconveniencies, hath been either Regarded, or ſo much as attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him: I cannot but take it to be a very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38256:12"/>
great Blot to his Judgment, barely and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Offer at ſuch a thing, which is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſo much Hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Becauſe my <hi>Opponent</hi> ſeemes to to put his cheifeſt Streſs in this, (Viz.) <hi>that a large Cuſtome may be put upon all</hi> Wooll <hi>that is Exported by Strangers, and that at leaſt by this meanes, they may come to Pay double the Price of what our</hi> Clothiers <hi>do, and not only ſo, but by this means alſo, his Majeſtie may receive an Advantage by the Cuſtome, that is Impoſed upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To try the weight or ſtrength of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, or rather to ſhew the Vanity of it. Let us ſuppoſe that <hi>3d.</hi> or <hi>4d. Per</hi> Pound, ſhould by a Law, be Impoſed upon all <hi>Wooll,</hi> that ſhall be Shipt out by Strangers; or others, as it will not follow, that the ſaid Cuſtome ſhould be Paid to his Majeſtie, for one half of the <hi>Wooll,</hi> that ſhall be ſo Shipt out: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Colour of one <hi>Hundred</hi> Packs, many <hi>Hundred</hi> may be Exported. So this will much the leſs follow, from the very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; which my <hi>Opponent</hi> himſelf hath made, of the nature, of the <hi>Stealers</hi> or <hi>Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:38256:12"/>
of <hi>Wooll;</hi> for if as he Confeſſeth they will be contended with <hi>12d.</hi> a day profit ſo they may play the <hi>Merchants;</hi> &amp; if they are content to run the hazard of their Necks, and to be tryed as Fellons, for ſo ſmall a matter as this a mounts to, which cannot be above 8, or <hi>10s.</hi> upon a pack, how much more then, will they bee encouraged to ſteal the Cuſtom of it when their excuſe ſhall be fairer, and their advantage much greater, and the hazard leſs a hundred times then now it is? but in the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> place, let us admit for Arguments ſake, that if <hi>4l.</hi> was impoſed upon every Pack of <hi>VVooll</hi> that was Tranſported, and let us admit, that all this Cuſtome was duely Paid, yet I ſee not the leaſt Ground for my <hi>Opponents</hi> Confidence, that we ſhall for this Cauſe be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell the <hi>French,</hi> in the <hi>VVoollen-Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For beſide that the Nature of their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture being but ſlight; and ſuch as takes up much leſs <hi>Wooll</hi> then ours doth, and a great part of their warps, being made of their fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun Linnen and their own courſe <hi>VVooll:</hi> I ſay beſides this, the Impoſitions that have been of late, Arbitralily put upon all our <hi>VVoollen-Manufacture</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:38256:13"/>
in <hi>France;</hi> and conſidering alſo there is no Cuſtome at all put upon <hi>Wooll</hi> there, when Imported, both theſe will utterly prevent, our Selling the ſaid <hi>Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> there, Cheaper than the <hi>French</hi> can make it, though they ſhall not only give double, but treble the Price, that we our Selves do give for <hi>Wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing Alledged by my <hi>Opponent</hi> is, <hi>that our Fore-Fathers did never Prohibit the Tranſportation of</hi> Wooll, <hi>unleſs upon ſome great Occaſion, and for a certain Seaſon, till of late Years,</hi> for makeing good of which, a Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſeveral Statutes, are brought from the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> downwards to our Times.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to all which Statute, I ſhall make uſe of no other Argument, than what my <hi>Opponent</hi> himſelf hath put into my Mouth, which is; that <hi>Wooll</hi> was for many Ages, by the Wiſdom of the Government, at leaſt very often Prohibited; and that whenſoever the Govenment it ſelf ſaw, there was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Occaſion than ordinary for it, they did alwayes Prohibit it; and Conſequently, if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38256:13"/>
the Intereſt of the Nation at preſent be ſuch, and the circumſtances relating to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about us, be not only ſo great, but ſo Inſtant and Importune, that theſe two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, there will be much more Reaſon, and much more Neceſſity, for the Prohibiting of it now, than formerly.</p>
            <p>Then all that my <hi>Opponent</hi> labours at, in producing Inſtances of other Kinds, and where the Circumſtances are not the ſame, falls wholly to the Ground; for the clearing of which, let us conſider, that the Circumſtances peculiar to this preſent Time are, that we have not only been Poſſeſſed for many Ages, of the <hi>Manufacturing</hi> of our <hi>Wooll,</hi> but have of late ſo Improved our <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> by it, that we have Exported it by Shipping of our own, not only into <hi>France, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> but into <hi>Italy, Turkey,</hi> and to the remoteſts Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>By which means, as our Wealth came greatly to Increaſe, ſo we our ſelves became more Powerful in Shipping than ever, which greatneſs of our <hi>Trade</hi> and the <hi>Strength</hi> of our Shipping being not only Obſerved, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38256:14"/>
Emulated by ſome of our Neighbours, and ſeeing it was likewiſe clearly diſcerned, that the cheifeſt meanes for the Maintenance of it proceeded from our <hi>Woollen-Manufacture,</hi> as the <hi>Hollander</hi> therefore firſt, ſo the <hi>French</hi> ſince, have by many undue Lawes and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon us, contrary to the ancient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace and <hi>Commerce,</hi> endeavoured to Rob the ſaid <hi>Manufacture</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>Nor is the ſtate of the Conteſt now at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent between us only, who ſhall have the <hi>Trade,</hi> but who is fitteſt to have the Strength and Dominion of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if my <hi>Opponent</hi> be not only an <hi>Iſlander,</hi> but ſo much an <hi>Engliſh-Man,</hi> and be ſo true a Subject to the Intereſt of his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which I doubt not but he is, as to think there is none ſo fit as his Majeſtie to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Sea, then my <hi>Opponent</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity grant, that nothing ought at this time to be done by us, that may hazard the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that nothing ought to be ſuffered by us, (ſo far as we are able in any wiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it) that may either leſſen or endanger
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38256:14"/>
our <hi>Woollen-Manufacture,</hi> and Conſequently, if nothing can ſo much hazard it, and hazard the very loſs of our <hi>Trade,</hi> and of the Dominion of the Sea it ſelf through it, as the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and contributing to the <hi>Woollen-Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> now ſet up in <hi>France,</hi> then this is not to be done by us, but is rather, if we will purſue the Intereſt of the Nation, by all means to be prevented by us.</p>
            <p>And Conſequently till my <hi>Opponent</hi> ſhall be able to make it appear, that the Dominion of the Sea, if loſt, will be no great harm to us, or till he make it appear, that we are able to keep the Dominion of the Sea; even, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> ſhould be utterly loſt, and notwithſtanding our <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len-Manufacture,</hi> ſhould be wholly carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Or till he make it appear by other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than hitherto he hath done, that the <hi>French</hi> though they encreaſe their <hi>Woollen-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,</hi> will neither be able to Under-ſell us abroad, nor be able to prevent our <hi>Clothes</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> from going into <hi>France,</hi> as formerly.</p>
            <p>I ſay till my <hi>Opponent</hi> ſhall be able to make good all theſe things, I muſt crave leave to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38256:15"/>
differ from him wholly, and plainly to affirm on the contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Tranſportation of <hi>Wooll,</hi> if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a Law, can no way be Limited. Becauſe if the Tranſportation of <hi>Wooll</hi> ſhall be allowed by a Law, no meanes, (ſpeaking rationally) is able to prevent the <hi>Hollanders, Flandrians,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to give each of them ſuch Commiſſions as they pleaſe, to Buy up here what quantity of <hi>Wooll</hi> ſoever, they ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard that this can no way be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and that my <hi>Opponent</hi> himſelf offers not the leaſt grain of an Expedient towards it: I therefore farther affirm, that it cannot appear that our <hi>Clothiers</hi> or <hi>Manufacturers</hi> here, ſhall have the leaſt Priviledg above the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; either in poynt of Proviſion, or point of Price.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That our <hi>Clothier,</hi> or <hi>Manufacturer</hi> here, muſt of neceſſity have a far greater diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, with reference to the furniſhng himſelf, than the Stranger abroad, in regard it cannot be thought, he ſhall be able to raiſe any ſuch
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38256:15"/>
ſtock of Money as the Stranger can, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Strangers Forſtaling of him; and Conſequently (if it be Lawful to talk Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) there can be no ground to Imagin, that our <hi>Manufacture</hi> ſhall not in ſhort time be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt, and this being loſt, as our <hi>Trade</hi> and ſtrength at Sea muſt be Inevitably loſt with it, ſo not only the Honour, Wealth and Rents, but the very Priviledges, Liberty, and Property of the Nation, muſt be hazarded to ſuch Strangers as ſhall carry away the <hi>Trade</hi> and ſtrength from us.</p>
            <p>As to the next Allegation, made by my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, (Viz.) that the Tranſportation of</hi> Wooll, <hi>will better his Majeſties:</hi> Cuſtoms I ſee but little in it that may require my Anſwere to it, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as I have ſpoken already to this, under the <hi>Fourth</hi> head: Nevertheleſs I muſt crave leave to ſay, that my <hi>Opponent</hi> here alſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon an extraordinary Miſtake, it being not at all in diſpute between us, whether his Majeſties Cuſtomes would be bettered if a Subſidy were paid only for that <hi>Wooll</hi> that is now Exported, inſtead of haveing it all ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: But the diſpute between us ſtrictly is, what
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38256:16"/>
his Majeſties Cuſtomes will hereafter amount to, Comparatively to what they at preſent now are, in caſe there ſhould be a Law for the free and Unlimited Exportation of <hi>Wooll,</hi> and that by reaſon of this Law, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that muſt follow from it, our <hi>Woollen-Manufacture</hi> ſhall come to be wholly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loſt: For it becomes not a wiſe <hi>Man</hi> (and ſuch I muſt in Civility Judge my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> to be) in making ſuch Propoſals as tend to the altering of Lawes, to look at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only, but to look more principally at the time to come.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is not in this caſe at all, to be conſidered what the advantage will be, that may come to his Majeſties Cuſtomes for a few moneths, or a ſingle <hi>Year,</hi> but it is to be conſidered, what the advantage or diſadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age will be to his Majeſties Cuſtomes for the time to come; admitting theſe Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which I have before mentioned to be unavoydable, from the Law which is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by my <hi>Opponent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides my <hi>Opponent</hi> cannot doubtleſs be ſo Ignorant, as not to have Conſidered, that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38256:16"/>
greatneſs of his Majeſties Cuſtomes (which is at this Day greater than ever) is not at all Raiſed Comparatively from the Export but from the Import, which is 10. if not 20. times greater than the Export, the Vallue of all which Import muſt proportionally fall, as the quantity of our <hi>Manufactury</hi> ſhall faile to be carried out, and as our raw and unwrought <hi>Wooll</hi> alone ſhall inſtead of it be Exported, and Conſequently to pretend that by ſuch a Law as is deſired, his Majeſties Cuſtomes would be advanced, is either greatly to betray Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or greatly to betray the Revenues of the Cuſtomes it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The next thing alledged by my <hi>Opponent</hi> is, <hi>that the cauſe of the decay of our</hi> Clothing <hi>doth not lie in the Exportation of our</hi> Wooll, <hi>but on the contrary,</hi> (Viz.) <hi>becauſe our</hi> Wooll <hi>is no more freely Exported than it is, and that we may be ſure not to miſtake his Senſe, herein he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds, that inaſmuch as the decay and fall of our</hi> Manufacture, <hi>comes properly from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of our</hi> Wooll, <hi>the ſtopping or hindring of it is but the applying to our Diſeaſe a wrong Remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:38256:17"/>Which Argument, had it been brought by a Stranger, we ſhould immediately have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into Merriment, as ſuppoſing that he thought us ſuch Children, that any thing would eaſily Deceive us? but being brought by a Gentleman, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I could not poſſibly think what might be the meaning of it, unleſs it were, that my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> was reſolved to croſs the Proverb for a while, and by a piece of Wit to make it appear, that it is not always <hi>True,</hi> that <hi>Intereſt cannot Lye;</hi> for that nothing can be more contrary to <hi>Truth,</hi> than what is here alledged, ot more againſt the Intereſt of the Nation, and of an <hi>Engliſh-Man</hi> than what is here Aſſerted, (if that be the very Intereſt of my <hi>Opponent</hi>) is moſt Cleare.</p>
            <p>For if it be <hi>True</hi> which my <hi>Opponent</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the decay of our</hi> Clothing-Trade, <hi>is not from our Exportation of</hi> Wooll, <hi>but rather the Contrary, becauſe no more of our</hi> Wooll <hi>is not Carried out Raw and</hi> Un-Manufactured, it muſt follow then, by how much the more our <hi>Wooll</hi> is thus Exported, by ſo much the more our
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38256:17"/>
               <hi>Manufacture</hi> will not only be Preſerved, but Encouraged, and the Reaſon for this muſt needs be, that if we are once rid of our <hi>Wooll,</hi> and have got a good Price for it, we need not trouble our heads ſo far as to Imagin, that they who Buy it will do any thing with it, but only will lay it up to look upon it: For if we ſhall Seriouſly Believe that they will have ſo much Wit as to make Uſe of it, and to make Uſe of it as becomes Rational Perſons, in order to the Increaſe of their own <hi>Clothing</hi> by it, we cannot be ſo ſottiſh as to think, that they do intend after this to Buy our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture</hi> any more, but do on the contrary deſign to prevent, and ſhut out the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as a thing not Expedient for them.</p>
            <p>And if this and no other be really the intent of Buying up of our <hi>Wooll</hi> by our Neighbours, then muſt it not neceſſarily follow, that by how much the more <hi>Wooll</hi> they have, by ſo much the more <hi>Manufacture</hi> they will make for the Furniſhing themſelves, and Furniſhing their Neighbours, and then by ſo much the leſs Place, or Poſſibility, there will be that we ſhould be able to Furniſh them, and then alſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38256:18"/>
by ſo much the greater ſtop muſt of neceſſity be put to the Vending of our <hi>Cloths:</hi> And is it not plain that by how much the leſs we Vend of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it abroad in other Places, by ſo much the more our <hi>Manufacture</hi> muſt decay: Not only in point of Price, but in point of its Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Uſe?</p>
            <p>And is it not then as manifeſt, that by how much our <hi>Manufacture</hi> Decayes, our <hi>Trade</hi> muſt Decay, and our Wealth muſt Decay, and the Strength of our Shipping muſt Decay, and we our ſelves muſt be the more made a Scorn, a Prey, and a Laughing-ſtock by it to our Neighbours: And if all this be not for the Intereſt of the Nation, but the contrary whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is it not plain that my <hi>Opponent,</hi> ſeeing he is an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man, and ſeeing it is for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Nation that he Writes, doth croſs the Proverb, and give us a Demonſtration by his thus Arguing, that Intereſt may now and then Lye, though not alwayes?</p>
            <p>But in the next place, to try whether my <hi>Opponent</hi> be in earneſt, or not, let me humbly Beg of him, to tell me truly, why
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38256:18"/>
thoſe naughty Men that Uſurped the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the <hi>Year</hi> 1647. did upon ſuch Penalties ſtrictly Prohibit the Exportation of our <hi>Woolls;</hi> if he ſaith, it was becauſe they were not only Rebels, but Men of no Reaſon, and Underſtood not the Intereſt of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Will he not by this brand many of the Parliament alſo that now ſits? who though they did not Confirm the Rebels Law, did think fit at leaſt to make a new Law to the ſame purpoſe, even ſoon after his Majeſties moſt happy Reſtoration.</p>
            <p>Granting then that the Laws now in force of the 12 <hi>and</hi> 14 of his Majeſties Reign, were not made by other, than by the Wiſeſt and moſt Loyal Perſons of this Nation, the ſaid Perſons muſt conſequently have ſome grounds or other for making of the ſaid Laws, and if we may gueſs at their grounds by their own words in the preambles of the ſaid Lawes, they appear mainly to be theſe three following, (<hi>Viz.</hi>)</p>

            </list>
            <p>WHerefore, either theſe <hi>three</hi> grounds, when the ſaid Lawes were made, were either good and ſufficient Motives for the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our <hi>Wooll,</hi> and for the laying ſo great a Penalty upon ſuch as ſhould Export it, or they were not: If my <hi>Opponent</hi> ſhall ſay, they were not good and ſufficient Grounds, then he muſt ſay that the Wiſdom of theſe Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Loyal Perſons, who at that time ſerved in Parliament, were indeed not much better than that of the Uſurpers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the <hi>Year</hi> 1647. But if the ſaid

               <item>1.

               <item>5.

            <p>But on the other hand, if none of all theſe <hi>Five</hi> Caſes can poſſibly be put, and that thoſe very Reaſons and Grounds do ſtill remain, and are the ſame now, which they were when the ſaid Acts were made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:38256:20"/>Then my <hi>Opponent</hi>'s motion to Repeal the ſaid Laws, muſt be againſt the Intereſt of the Nation, or Intereſt doth not alwayes ſpeak True; which was the Paradox intended to be Argued by my <hi>Opponent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is clear then, that by both theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, my <hi>Opponent</hi> hath wholely miſtaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Cauſe of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> decay, to evidence yet farther the manifeſtneſs, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſs of this miſtake, we affirm that it is Matter of Fact, that our <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> did greatly encreaſe after the <hi>ſd.</hi> Prohibition of <hi>Wooll;</hi> and not only encreaſed, but bore a good Price, and that I may not be found like ſome others, who regard not the Credit of what they affirm (and particularly, like him who hath contracted the Arguments of my <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,</hi> and hath publiſhed them together in one Sheet of Paper) I ſhall to juſtifie what I ſay, appeal for the Truth of it, not only to the <hi>Cuſtome</hi>-houſe Books, and to the quantity of the <hi>Woollen-Manufacture</hi> there entered; but to the <hi>Gentry</hi> themſelves: And to the Price that the Land bore (and Victuals) for many Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after the <hi>ſd.</hi> Prohibition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:38256:21"/>Yea, as our <hi>Manufacture</hi> did encreaſe for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years together, after the <hi>ſd.</hi> Prohibition of the Exportation of <hi>Wooll,</hi> ſo it had to this day ſtill encreaſed, had not thoſe accidents happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that laid ſo effectual a Foundation for the ruine of it, as it was neither in the Power of the <hi>Clothier,</hi> nor in the Power of the <hi>Grower</hi> to prevent: I mean thoſe new and immoderate Taxes, which were laid upon our <hi>Manufacture</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> King, on purpoſe to encourage his own workmen to gain the ſd. <hi>Manufacture</hi> from us; and on purpoſe to prevent our <hi>Cloths</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> from being brought into his Country, (the Fruits of Exportation of <hi>Wooll</hi>) although we yearly take of his Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to the value of above a <hi>Million</hi> of Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> and I mean in the ſecond place, the making of that unfortunate <hi>Act</hi> againſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle, which hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tended to the ruine of the <hi>Grower,</hi> but to the ruine of the <hi>Clothier,</hi> and to ruine of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf; and which if it ſhould continue to ſtand un-repealed, muſt neceſſarily, and inevitably ruine more and more:

            <p>And therefore as a further Proof of what I ſay I ſhall give one inſtance inſtead of many, and leave the Truth of it to be ſtrictly examined, and judged accordingly; which is, that ſince the ſaid accidents have befallen us (I mean of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Arbitrary Impoſſitions upon us, and that Act againſt the Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel) <hi>Exeter</hi> alone, hath loſt of what it did formerly Vend, near, if not above <hi>three Hundered Thouſand</hi> Pound <hi>Sterling</hi> every <hi>Year:</hi> And if we ſhall reckon Proportionably for all other Countries and Cities, we ſhall then ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee there is a Juſt Ground for the Decay of our <hi>Woollen-Manufacture,</hi> and for the fall of the Price of our <hi>Wooll</hi> by it, and for the fall and ruin of our Rents, not as my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> Allegeath by reaſon of the Prohibition of of Tranſporting our <hi>Wooll,</hi> but truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by reaſon of the Multiplication and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our <hi>Wooll,</hi> to that degree, that the Exportation of it hath almoſt been Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:38256:22"/>The ſerious conſideration of which true and real cauſe of the decay of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> I ſhall humbly leave to the Wiſdom of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

conceive there is ſcarce any thing can be inſtanced that might, or would tend more to the general good and advantage of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the promoting and recovering of our <hi>Manufacture</hi> again, and Conſequently for the Conſumption and Advancing the Price of our <hi>Wooll,</hi> which is the thing mainly my <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent</hi> ſeemes to drive at, and in thatwe ſhall agree.</p>
            <p>But here my <hi>Opponent</hi> may parhaps ſay, that after all I cannot deny, but there is a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of <hi>Wooll</hi> which cannot be wrought up by the <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and that I offered not one word, how it ſhould for the future be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of: (to which I anſwer)</p>
            <p n="1">1.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:38256:24"/>
ſo neither can he or ought he to be Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſible for the Glut proceeding from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of it, or for the cheapneſs of the ſaid <hi>Wooll,</hi> by reaſon of the ſaid Glut. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which Glut I may preſume to ſay, (or at leaſt to ſuppoſe) that if an account was taken both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> before the time of ſhearing, there will not be found one quarters Gronth, or at the moſt 6 <hi>Months <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-manufactured,</hi> in the greateſt <hi>Year</hi> of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Wooll</hi> and dulneſs of <hi>Trade;</hi> which duly confidered, doth require more care for a ſtock beforehand in <hi>England,</hi> and not to ſuffer it to Engroſſed and Stored up in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as now it is: And for ought I know would there be a Peace concluded abroad, that our <hi>Trade</hi> was Revived, and our <hi>Clothiers</hi> were Incouraged, we might find a want of <hi>Wooll</hi> before the next ſhearing; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our great complaint of a Surplus of <hi>Wooll,</hi> as it hath frequently accurd in <hi>Corn</hi> very lately, and more formerly as in St. <hi>Walter Rawly</hi>'s Remains.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the proper and only way for remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all evil effects, be to remove their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38256:25"/>
cauſes, and that this is and muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgec by all rational Perſons, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what we have ſaid before, and not only ſaid but proved and made it appear, (<hi>Viz.</hi>) that the cauſe of the ſaid Surplus of <hi>Wooll</hi> (with the Cheapneſs of it at preſent) among us, is partly from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act that Prohibiteth the bringing in of live Cattle, and puts the Kingdom upon the Breeding of <hi>Wooll</hi> whether they will or no, and partly by the Decay of our, <hi>Manufacture,</hi> through the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that we our ſelves do make to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of our own <hi>Wooll,</hi> fur the Promoting of their <hi>Manufacture,</hi> to the Ruine of our Selves.</p>
            <p>The proper Remedy then, for the remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cheapneſs of our <hi>Wooll</hi> on the one hand, and Employing our Poor, and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of our <hi>Trade</hi> on the other hand, muſt neceſſarily be the Stoping the Exceſive Grouth of it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and as Strictly Stopping, and Reſtreining the Export of it from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from hence.</p>
            <p>And here Imuſt take the Boldneſs to ſay again, what I have in part ſaid already in my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38256:25"/>
ſecond Argument, (<hi>Viz.</hi>) that where a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not Rich in Mines of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> it is not capable of being Enriched any other way, than by its <hi>Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſequently if it be from our <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures</hi> alone, that the Riches of this Nation comes, and if it be from our <hi>Manufacture</hi> cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that our Shipping is Imployed, and our <hi>Marriners</hi> bred, if it be from our <hi>Trading</hi> alone, and from the Riches which our <hi>Trading</hi> brings in, that his Majeſties Cuſtomes are Raiſed, and that our Fleet have been hitherto Built and Maintained, and the Dominion of the Seas hath been Preſerved, than it is and muſt be from our <hi>Manufacture</hi> only that our <hi>Bullion</hi> hath been brought in, and that the Rents of our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> doth Depend and are Suſtained.</p>
            <p>And therefore it muſt be granted me, that there is no higher Intereſt in the Nation, than that which preſerves his Majeſties Cuſtomes, and that which Suſtains the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys</hi> Rents, and that which Supports our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Shipping.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:38256:26"/>Then in regard our <hi>Manufacture</hi> alone doth by all this, our <hi>Manufacture</hi> alone and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of it muſt neceſſarily be the greater Intereſt of the Nation it ſelf: And I muſt crave leave to ſay that whoever placeth it in any thing elce (as the circumſtances of this Nation ſtands at preſent) muſt either miſtake the Intereſt of this Nation, or can be no Freind to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore if it be granted by the Wiſeſt of <hi>Layers,</hi> that a Miſcheif is better than an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, ſome privat Men ought to ſuffer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the whole Nation: Which I humbly conceive is a ſollid and ſufficient anſwere to my <hi>Opponent,</hi> as to this part of his Objection.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing alſo that our <hi>Manufacture</hi> and the Encourageing of it, is the main and cheif, if not the ſole and only Intereſt of the Nation, then as no Intereſt beſides can, or ought in reaſon to ſtand in Competition with it, ſo much leſs the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act, without the Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which; Nevertheleſs it is ſimply Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that either our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> or that the <hi>Trade,</hi> or <hi>Navigation</hi> of the Kingdom ſhould be preſerved: For if there be no reaſon to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38256:26"/>
make a Law that they muſt Starve in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there can be no reaſon to forbid their breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Sheep,</hi> if we will not let them employ their Lands in the breeding of <hi>Cattle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admitting alſo that the paſture Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> are proportionable to the bigneſs of that Kingdom, far larger than the paſture Lands of <hi>England,</hi> as they are and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be, partly through the ſmalneſs of their Tillage, (their <hi>Corn</hi> being not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be Exported) and partly through the thinneſs of their Inhabitants, and it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that theſe being converted moſtly to the feeding of <hi>Sheep,</hi> muſt breed a vaſt quantity of <hi>Wooll,</hi> and ſuch as muſt equal, if not Exceed the quantity bred in <hi>England,</hi> by our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it muſt needs be plain to every perſon, that not only the breeding of <hi>Wooll,</hi> but the diſpoſing of it, andt he diſpoſing of it to moſt Advantage, is now become the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry, Yeomandry,</hi> and of all others whatſoever that have a concern in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which if it were poſſible to prevent, it ought to be allowed to none beſides our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38256:27"/>
Selves, whoſe whole proper and intire Intereſt it is, to be Sole <hi>Manufacturers,</hi> or Workers of it.</p>
            <p>The Breeding, Growing, Diſpoſing and Improving of <hi>Wooll,</hi> being now by our Selves, made the intire Intereſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not of us, and would have been very well Content without it, if we cannot deſire their <hi>Nobility,</hi> or <hi>Gentry,</hi> to burn their <hi>Wooll,</hi> we cannot then deny them, to take all ſuch Lawful and Juſt Courſes, whereby they may Improve their <hi>Wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing theſe Courſes can be but two wayes, either to ſend it where it is moſt wanted, and where it will yeild the beſt Price, which is to our Neighbours, to Improve and Increaſe their <hi>Manufacture,</hi> or elſe to keep it themſelves, and <hi>Manfacture</hi> it up in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing one of theſe Courſes are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inevitable, and that both one and the other do not only tend, but muſt and will certainly, and effectually bring an utter deſtruction to the <hi>Trade, Commerce, Strength, Shipping</hi> and <hi>Navigation</hi> of this Kingdom, we have ſmall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38256:27"/>
reaſon to expect our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or our Neighbours the <hi>French</hi> ſhould help us, or pitty us, when we do wilfully contribute to the Ruin of our Selves, and may (if we will) either prevent it, or eaſily remedy it.</p>
            <p>And indeed if our All be at ſtake, by reaſon of the continuance of that Unfortunate Act; and if this All, I mean the very Intereſt of the Nation it ſelf, will not move us to alter it, I think it would be very Impertinent, to inſiſt upon leſſer Arguments.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though it would be for the Intereſt of the Nation greatly, to arreſt this occation, I mean the cheapneſs of <hi>Wooll,</hi> to beat out our Neighbours, in the Forraign <hi>Trade</hi> of our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> and by Under-ſelling them at leaſt Abroad.</p>
            <p>And though this might now more eaſily be done then ever, ſeeing our <hi>Mauufacture</hi> is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of late <hi>Years</hi> in the Goodneſs of it, and might ſoon as we ſaid before, be brought to an Abſolute Perfection.</p>
            <p>And though it be but Equal and Juſt, to Forbid the <hi>Commodities</hi> of thoſe Countries that are near us, who refuſe to deal with us for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38256:28"/>
our <hi>Commodities,</hi> or by Exorbitant and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Impoſitions laid upon them, do in efect Prohibite them; and though the doing of this, is but agreable to the rules of Juſtice, and to the Law of Nations, and Law of <hi>Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though alſo it cannot be denyed, that it muſt be greatly conſiſtant with the publick good of the Nation, to make ſumptuary Lawes, and to reſtrain the exceſs that is at preſent among Us; yet I muſt humbly crave leave to ſay, that this is but like the taking much paines, to ſtop the leaks of a Barrel, and let the Liquor run out at the Bung; for theſe are all petty things to the main Concern of the Nation which muſt be Ruin'd, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, as I humbly Conceive Irrecoverably, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act doth ſtand.</p>
