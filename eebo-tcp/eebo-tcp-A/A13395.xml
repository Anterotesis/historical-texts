            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in Matrimony with a greater deſire of Children than of Husbands, they had more joy in being Mothers than in being Wives; for in the old Law, it was a curſe upon Women to be Barren: and ſurely if there had beene any lawfull way for them to have had Children without Husbands, there hath beene, and are, and will bee a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe number of Women that would or will never be troubled with wedlocke, nor the knowledge of man.

               <p>Drink is of that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in operation, and of ſuch celeritie to inſpire the Braine of man, that I did once know a Gentleman that rode to the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who entred the City about two of the clock afternoone, and at his comming thither, hee
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1864:98"/>
could not ſpeak any <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> at all, but by the <hi>Enthuſiaſme</hi> of Drinke, and drinking roundly and ſquarely, and with briefe and diligent potting and cupping, hee profited ſo well, that in leſſe then four houres hee had forgot all his <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake or underſtand any word of his Mother tongue. One boaſted what a Traveller hee had beene, and how hee had beene rob'd and cheated in every Country where hee came: As he had the luck to loſe his Manners in <hi>Barbary,</hi> the <hi>Wild Iriſh and Red-ſhanks,</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1864:99"/>
ſtole his Civilitie, the <hi>Welſhman</hi> gull'd him of his truth.

He brags further, that he hath been at <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> where ſome Ladies doe ſay their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and many Courtiers
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1864:99"/>
doe keepe their words, where the Uſurers do lend and take no intereſt, and prodigall Gallants erect Almſhouſes, where Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and publike Notaries do weare long eares, and Towneſmen have very ſhort fore-heads; all theſe Rarities hee ſaw in a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Dreame.

               <p>And can any woman (that hath reaſon) or any man that hath ſence blame us poore weak <hi>Feminines,</hi> to bee grieved at theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities; I, with the beſt of all my ſexe doe appeale to all whomſoever have but indifferent capacitie and judgement, bee they of what degree ſoever,

either male or female.</p>
               <p>But yet I remember a few miſcheifs more which drunkennes hath and doth daily overwhelme us with all; ſometimes they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and not onely quarrell but kill on another in their drunken roring vaine, and oftentimes for very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cauſes, theſe Taverne frayes or brawls have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as ſometimes becauſe the one had not his Cup fill'd as full as the other, ſometimes for not drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all out <hi>(which is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd, winding up your bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome) footing off your Bowle, ſup up your Cider)</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1864:101"/>
or ſome other ſuch like learned phraſe, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away of a ſmall ſnuffe hath often bred a quarrell, or the not pledging a Health, which was begun to ſome unworthy perſon: perhaps, ſome oppreſſing inhoſpitable Great Man, or to a Begging-making Project-monger (whom a Commonwealth is bound to pray for over the left ſhoulder) or the Health may bee perhaps to ſome muſty Madam, or Muskie Gentlewoman, or to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proſtituted Whore, and ſuch vile occaſions as theſe many men have
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1864:101"/>
ſtab'd and ſlaine one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There hath been two kill'd in the ſame unkinde kinde, within theſe few yeeres, with onely being ſtab'd into the eyes with Tobacco pipes.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe, or more properly) in the like foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh way, they have thrown pots down the ſtaires, and a Drawer, or ſome other perſon (at the ſame time) hath bin comming up the ſaid ſtaires, who hath met the ſaid pot (being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently caſt) with their faces or heads, and beene kill'd out right: Thus have they by theſe mad-braind cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1864:102"/>
too oftentimes made hazard of ſouls, by diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing them from mens bodies ſo ſuddenly and unprepared, alſo they have runne their necks into the nooze of the Law, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king untimely worke for the Hangman. And laſtly, (too many of them) have made forfeite of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, goods and Lands, leaving their wives beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd, and their children nothing but a ſcandal, that their father died an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death for killing of a man when hee was drunk.</p>
               <p>But though this be bad
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1864:102"/>
which I have related, yet there is worſe then this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, for as wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do no murder, (which is not to murder, others) Then ſurely they are moſt inhumane and uncharitable, who doe murder themſelves; which bloudie and barbarous fact is not to bee excuſed in ſuch as doe wilfully drinke themſelves to death, as Maſter <hi>Iohn Stowe,</hi> in the 385 page of his Folio Chronicle, or Annals, doth recite a lamentable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable accident, of 180 perſons that died in their Drunkenneſſe in leſſe then
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1864:103"/>
three daies ſpace, and in the 753 page of the ſaid Booke, hee relates the like that happened to our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen</hi> at the ſiege of the <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>Gallizia,</hi> where many hundreds loſt their lives with drinking. And if you but conſider &amp; take notice of our Weekly Bils for the Sickneſſe, you ſhall finde that everie Weeke ſome doe end their daies onely having kill'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Surfets, of which all men doe know that drunkenneſſe is the chiefe occaſion. And in the Generall Bill for the yeere 1636, it is ſet downe, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1864:103"/>
within <hi>London</hi> and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties thereof, there died no fewer then 371 perſons all of ſurfeiting, and alſo 24 ſtarved with famine in the fields &amp; ſtreets, whom halfe the ſuperfluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of thoſe that kill'd themſelves with ſurfeiting might have relieved. There are three words or names of ſeverall things which doe begin with the letter H. All which are good (if well uſed, but as they are too much abuſed, they have beene the overthrow and ruine of many; they are <hi>Horſes, Hawkes</hi> and <hi>Howndes</hi>; ſome Horſes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1864:104"/>
have prooved like <hi>Sinons</hi> jade to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> their hungry entrailes have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and deſtroied their Maſters <hi>Illion,</hi> and ſcarcely left them a Cottage to hide their heads in, ſome have found their <hi>Hawkes</hi> like the <hi>Vulture</hi> to <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> after they have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away their ſubſtance, they have prey'd and tir'd upon their verie Hearts. And ſome their have been ſo addicted to <hi>Hownds,</hi> that in the end their Dogs have devoured them like ſo many <hi>Acteons.</hi> Now likewiſe there are three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, whoſe names
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1864:104"/>
do beginne with the letter D, of which (two of them never were, are or will bee commodious for man, and the third (which is moſt uſefull and neceſſary) is by the abuſe of it) the onely bane of miſgovern'd man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; They are <hi>Drabbes, Dice,</hi> and <hi>Drinke:</hi> I will not ſay but Drabbes may prefer the Prodigall from the Palace to the Pig-ſtie, where hee (being leaden with want, miſery, and diſeaſes) may bee brought to learne and feele the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of repentance. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Dicer may (by his often ſlurring the bones of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1864:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the dead) be brought to have a feeling acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own living and moſt wretched condition: But the <hi>Drunkard</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably obſtinate to bee ſo, he is, (as it were) rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>drinke,</hi> he is inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably rooted in his vice, and ſo unmoveable in his affection to be <hi>drunke,</hi> that though there be remedies for all other ſins, yet there is nothing but death it ſelf that can turn an old <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard</hi> into a ſober courſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides the moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and frequent offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that are addicted to any other vice, be it what
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1864:105"/>
it will be, they have ſome ſhew of modeſty, or deſire of privateneſſe in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or committing of any of their ingrafted or inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted enormitie. The theife will warily watch that hee may not be ſeen when hee ſteales. The Whoremaſter will be cloſe, the Bawd will be ſecret, and though the Whore bee common, yet ſhee trades privately. Hee that takes bribes will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them ſecretly, though the Projector doe ayme at every mans goods, yet hee covers his intentions, that it is for all mens
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1864:106"/>
good, though the cauſe went againſt the Client, yet the Lawyer and his fee told him other ways at the firſt, and though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill do day and night (with all diligence) ſeek our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, yet hee can ſweetly allure us with cover'd ſlights &amp; poyſoned baits, that hee hides his uglineſſe under the ſhape of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of Light. But the <hi>Drunkard</hi> is more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſhameleſſe then either <hi>Whoremaſter, Whore, Bawd, Thiefe,</hi> wicked <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector,</hi> corrupted <hi>Lawyer,</hi> or the <hi>Devill</hi> himſelfe. For although
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1864:106"/>
all theſe before named, are as bad, as wickedneſſe can make them, yet I did never reade or heare of any of them that at any time were ſo fooliſhly paſt ſhame, as to boaſt or glory in any of their villanies, as many Drunkards will; I have heard ſome to brag, how many they have out-drank and drank drunk in a day, as he <hi>payd one,</hi> hee <hi>pepperd</hi> another, he <hi>ſawced</hi> a third, hee <hi>anointed</hi> a fourth, hee <hi>ſcowred</hi> a fift, hee <hi>dranke</hi> 27 Glaſſes or Cups, and wonne the <hi>Rumpe</hi> of a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> and bravely made all his Company as fox'd
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1864:107"/>
as fooles, and as beaſtly as Swine, and all the while this mighty and precious piece of ſervice was doing, hee plyde it hard, and in concluſion, hee was not much worſe when hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then he was when hee began. And indeed, it is to be believed, that as one days worke cannot make him much the worſe, ſo it is to be doubted, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes and nights, with the friendlieſt counſels, the godlieſt admonitions, the ſharpeſt reprehenſions, the ſevereſt excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, the dreadfulleſt execrations; all theſe can
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1864:107"/>
neither mend or move him; but that he hath not onely reſolved to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but alſo to continue ſo, and to boaſt and glory in it. <hi>But to boaſt of ſinne is a degree beyond ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To lay theſe abhominable enormities aſide, if wee ſhould conſider the good a drunkard doth, you will acknowledge him to be a moſt neceſſary evill: and (not to bereave him of his due) though hee be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well imployed, yet he he is never idle; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he ſets many people a worke, that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be idle (or not have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1864:108"/>
much to doe:) As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; He puts the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable into buſineſſe, hee keepes the Watch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; he viſits the Juſtice; he ſees the Clerke; hee is profitable to the Chandler, Tobacco-Pipe maker, and potent Patentee; hee keepes the Drawer in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall motion; he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the Glaſſe-houſe; he enricheth the Wine-merchant, the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Cooper, the Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Victuler, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, and the Jayler; and many times hee is ſo great an enemy to idleneſſe, that hee makes worke for the Hang-man.</p>

                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:1864:108"/>And now (ſweet Sir <hi>Seldome Sober</hi>) I pray your gravity to take it into your conſideration, that theſe fore-named ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are no Womens Workes. Alas, poore ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wretches as wee are, our weake capacities can never reach to the height of ſuch worthineſſe, wee have not the Art to ſwill and ſmoak away our huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, our owne, our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, our Families, and our Landlords food, health, raiment, and rent.

large promiſes they will make, what reformed Men they will bee, if ever they may recover their Healths; and when many of them are well againe, the moſt part or great number of them doe keep their words like men of <hi>Durſly.</hi> As a pretty Jeſt happened lately at a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per amongſt ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Women, where one of the gentlemen <hi>tooke</hi> a Cup in his hand, and ſaid to a little Girle of 4.

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1864:109"/>
Why, ſaid he? <hi>Becauſe you were drunke yeſterday,</hi> ſaid ſhe: with that they all laught heartily.

               <p>It is reported, that a yong fellow was told his Fortune once by a Witch, or a Wizard; which was, that he ſhould commit one
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1864:110"/>
of theſe three moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and abhominable Facts, and that it was in his choiſe to chuſe which of them hee would: the one was, he ſhould kill his Father; the other was, that hee ſhould defloure his Mother: And the third was, that hee ſhould bee moſt deeply and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Drunke: Hee in his Heart abhorring the two firſt, deteſting to bee the Death of his Father, (from whom he had Life) or to pollute and defile his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that bore him: to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd both which exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable deedes, he made
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1864:110"/>
choiſe to be Drunke (as thinking it the leſſer Crime of the three.) But being bruitiſh Barbarous, and beaſtly poſſeſt with too much Drinke, ſo that he knew not what he did, or ſaid, hee then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all the three faults, of which hee made a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſhift to avoyd but two.</p>
               <p>And what woman can be ſuch a Tame Foole, as to hold her tongue in her mouth, and (like a dumbe Beaſt) ſay nothing to her unthrifty Husband, that ſhall day and night waſh downe his throate, with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1864:111"/>
all, or the moſt part of their maintenance, and piſſe againſt the Wall his health, wit, money, and credit; and all her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that hee comes home, ſtinking, ſpewing, Belching, ſpetting, ſpaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſlavering, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once laid) ſnoring, like a Hogge in a Stie: or if he be not in that veine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he is in a worſe mood to ſweare, curſe, fight, fling, and throw. As one of your Water-men (<hi>Sir Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome Sober</hi>) the firſt letter of his name is <hi>J.</hi> came home Delicately mad Drunke, and pluckt a

Ropes end out of his Pocket, wherewith hee moſt ſorely beate his wife; which ſhee poore woman was faine to ſuffer with griefe and impatience: but within a weeke after, they being friends, ſhe provided him the ſame Ropes end for his ſupper, boyld in Broth, like an Eele, and when hee had eaten the Broth out of the Platter, hee tooke his Knife, with intent to cut part of the Eele, and finding it to be hard for his cutting, hee asked his Wife what it was? Truely Husband, ſaid ſhee, it is no worſe than
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1864:112"/>
what you gave mee; and therefore I thought good to make it ready, and Cooke it for your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Sir, it is a griefe to ſee, that a Gentleman of your great Calling, is ſo ill attended in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noones: for commonly the greateſt number of your ſervants and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doe lye long a bed, ſo that you have but ſmall and ſlender ſervice of them, till three or foure of the Clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, and from that time, till paſt Mid-night: the Tavernes, Ale-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſtreetes are furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

and throng'd with all ſorts of people, that for your honour are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Drunke, and for your further repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in all places by their drinking, ſpeaking, going, or any other action or poſture of theirs they doe declare themſelves to bee Sir <hi>Seldome Sobers</hi> men.</p>
