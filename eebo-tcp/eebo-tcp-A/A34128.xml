            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <item>1. We find that the same note is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verified, and maintained by the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals.</item>

We find that there hath beene a strong current of practise of proceeding in Chancery after Judgement, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times after execution, continued from the beginning of H. 7. Raign, unto the time of the Lord Chancellor that now is, both in the Raignes (<hi>separatim</hi>) of the severall Kings, and in the times of the severall Chancellors, whereof divers were great learned men in the Law: It being in cases, where there is no remedy for the Subject, by the strict course of the common Law, unto which the Judges are sworne.</item>
                           <item>3. We find that these proceedings in Chancery, hath been after Judgements, in actions of severall natures, as well reall as personall.</item>
                           <item>4. We find it hath beene after Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in your Majesties severall Courts, the Kings Bench, common Pleas, Justice in Oyre, &amp;c.</item>
                           <item>5. We find it hath been after Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments obtained upon verdict, demurres, and where Writs of error have beene brought.</item>
                           <item>6. We find in many of the Cases, That the Judgements are expresjudgementsly mentioned in the Bills in the Chancery themselves
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56698:68"/>
to have been given, and reliefe prayed thereupon, sometimes for stay of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sometimes after execution, of which kind wee find a great number in King H. the 7. his time.</item>

                           <item>9. We find in some of the cases in this very point, that Judgement hath been given, hath been stood upon by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, and alleadged by them by way of demurrer, and overruled.</item>
                           <item>10.

                        <p>According to your Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, we have deliveratly advised of the case sent unto us by the Lord Chancellor; and of the Statutes as well those of Praemunire as others, as far as we take it may concerne the case; and for our better information therein, wee have thought fit to send for, and peruse the originall Records themselves remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> of those Statutes not onely appearing upon the Roll of Parliament with the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, which is the warrant to the Roll of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>We have also taken into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well Booke Lawes, as divers other Acts of Parliament, which may give light
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56698:71"/>
unto the Statutes, whereupon the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion properly growes, together with such ancient Records and presidents as we could find, as well those which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the authority of the Chancery, as those which seeme to impeach the same; and upon the whole matter we are al of opinion, that the Chancery may give reliefe to the case in question; and that no Statute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> &amp;c. or other Statute restraines the same.</p>
                        <p>And because we know not what use your Majesty will be pleased to make of this our opinion, either for the time present or future; we are willing to give some reasons of the same, not thinking fit to trouble your Majesty with all those things whereupon we have grounded our selves, selecting out some principall things, which moved us to be of this opinion, to the end this same may be a fuller object of your Majesties Princely Judgement, whereunto we alwayes submit our selves.</p>
                        <p>And first we must lay for a sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that which was contained in our former Certificate, concerning the continuall practise, by the space now of six score yeares, in the times of King
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56698:71"/>
                           <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7. King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> of this authority; and that in the time, when the same authority was mannaged, not onely the Bishops which might be thought lesse skilfull, or lesse affectionate towards the Lawes of the Land, but also divers great Lawyers, which could not but know and honour the Law, as the meanes of their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Audly,</hi> the Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Bromley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Pucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>; and further that most of the late Judges of the Kingdome, either as Judges when they sate in Chancery by Commission, or as Councellors at Law, when they set their hands to Bills, have by their judgement and councell, upheld the same authority; and therefore for as much as it is a true ground That <hi>optimus legum interpres consuetudo,</hi> especially when the practise or custome passeth not amongst vulgar persons, but amongst the most high and scient Magistrates of the Kingdome: And when also the practising of the same should lye under so heavy a paine as the <hi>Praemunire</hi>: This is to us a principall and implicit satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56698:72"/>
and those Statutes ought not to be construed to extend to this case; and this of it selfe, we know, is of far more force to move your Majesty, then any opinion of ours, because Kings are fittest to informe Kings, and Chancellors to teach Chancellors, and Judges to teach Judges; but further out of out own science and profession, we have thought fit to adde those further reasons and proofes very briefely, because in case of so ancient a possession of jurisdiction, we hold it not fit to amplifie.</p>
                        <p>The Statutes upon which the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grows, are principally two; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is a Statute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and the other is a Statute of simple prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that of <hi>Praemunire</hi> is the Statute of 27. <hi>E.</hi> 3. cap. 1. And the Statute of the simple prohibition is the Statute of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. There are divers other Statutes of both kinds; but the question will rest principally upon those two, as we conceive it.</p>

                           </note>For the Statute of 27. E. 3. it cannot in our opinions extend unto the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, for these reasons.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. First out of the mischiefe which the Statute provides and recites, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56698:72"/>
That such suites and pleas (against which the Statute is provided) were in prejudice and disinherison of the King and his Crowne, which cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Chancery: for the King cannot be disinherited of jurisdiction, but either by a forreigner, or by his Subject; but never by his own Court.</item>
                           <item>2. Out of the remedy which the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute points; <hi>viz.</hi> That the offendors shall be warned within two moneths, to be before the King and his Councell, or in his Chancery, or before the Kings Justices of the one Bench, or of the other, &amp;c. By which words it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in it selfe, that the Chancery should give both the offence and the remedy.</item>
                           <item>3. Out of penalty which is not only severe, but hastily, namely that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders shall be put out of the Kings protection, which penalty altogether savors of adhering to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56698:73"/>
and cannot be applyed but to forraigne Courts; for the word <hi>alibi,</hi> or elsewhere is never used, but where <hi>Rome</hi> is named specially before.</item>
                           <item>5. The disjunctive in this Statute (which onely gives the colour) <hi>viz.</hi> That they which draw any out of the Realme in plea, whereof the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance pertaineth to the Kings Court (or) of things whereof Judgements be given in the Kings Court, or which doe sue in any other Court, to defeat or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the Judgements given to the Kings Court; this last disjunction wee said (which must go farther then Courts out of the Realme, which are fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the former branch) hath sufficient matter and effect to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in respect of such Courts, which though they were totally within the Realme, yet in jurisdiction were subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <item>6. In this the sight of the Record of the Petition doth cleare the doubt,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56698:73"/>
where the Subjects supplicate to the King to ordaine remedy against those which pursue in other courts then his own against Judgements given in his court, which explaines the word (other) to be other then the Kings courts.</item>
                           <item>7. With this agreeth notably the book of entries, which translates the word (in other court) not in <hi>alia Curia,</hi> but in <hi>aliena Curia.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>8. This Statute of <hi>vicesimo septimo, E.</hi> 3. being in corroboration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law (as it selfe recites) we doe not find in the Register any presidents of the Writs of <hi>adjura regia,</hi> which are framed upon chiefe cases that were afterwards made penall, by the <hi>Praemunire,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Ecclesiasticall courts.</item>
                           <item>9. Lastly we have not found any president at all, of any conviction upon the Satutes of <hi>Praemunire</hi> of this nature for suits in Chancery, but onely two or three Bills of Indictment preferred, <hi>sed nihilinde venit,</hi> for ought appears to us. For the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 4. that we doubt was made against proceeding within the Realme, and not against forraigne; and therefore hath no penalty annexed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse we conceive that it extends
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56698:74"/>
not to the Chancery in the case delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for these reasons.
<list>
                                 <item>1. First this Statute recites where the parties are made to come upon grievous paine, sometimes before the King himselfe, sometimes before the Kings Councell, and sometimes in the Parliament to answer thereof anew, &amp;c. Where it appeareth that the Chancery is not named, which could not have been forgotten, but was left out upon great reason, because the Chancery is a court of ordinary Justice for matter of equity; and the Statute meant onely to restraine extraordinary Commissions, and such like proceedings.</item>
                                 <item>2. This appeares fully by view and comparing the two Petitions, which were made the same Parliament of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. placed immediately the one before the other. The first which was rejected by the King, and the second, whereupon this Statute was made; whereof the first was to restraine the ordinary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Justice, that is to say in the Chancery by name, in the Exchequer, and before the Kings Councell by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of privy Seal; unto which the King makes a Royall and prudent answer in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56698:74"/>
these words: The King will charge his Officers to be more sparing, to send for his Subjects by such processe then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have beene; but notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is not his mind, that the Officers shall so far obtaine, but that they may call his Subjects before them, in matters and causes necessary, as it hath beene done in the time of his good Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and then immediatly followes the Petition, whereupon the Act now in question was made, unto which the King gave his assent, and wherein no mention is made at all of the Chancery or Exchequer.</item>
                                 <item>3. If the Chancery should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be within the Statute, yet the Statute extends not to this case; for the words are, that the Kings Subjects are driven to answer thereof anew, which must be understood, when the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter formerly judged, is put in issue or question againe, but when the cause is called into the Chancery only upon point of equity, there as the point of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity was never in question in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law Court, so the point of Law or of fact (as it concernes the Law) is never in question in the Chancery; so
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56698:75"/>
the same thing is not twice in question, or as answered anew: for the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth supply the Law, and not crosse it.</item>
