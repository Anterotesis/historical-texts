            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration with ſome Propoſals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Parliament, Council of State,
and Army, and unto all others
of all ſorts.</head>
            <p>BEholding the glory of that pure God of nature, who
hath wonderfully cleared my ſight, and quickened
my benummed ſenſes; I ſay, that bleſſed good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
enforceth me to declare my ſelf at this time, or elſe
I can have no peace. Bleſſed be the Lord, the Heavenly
Powers, that created all things good. Praiſe ye the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>And I muſt ſpeak to all, without reſpect of perſons. I
beholding the whole Creation to be very good, and very
comely, in order to uſes and ends; (for they were not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in vain;) I being but a little while in the School of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
began to compare Gods Creation with mans Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and upon conſideration, I wondered not why man
was ſo confounded, ſo out of order, and ſo full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and concluded that the worlds glory is vanity
and vexation, and that man is the cauſe of his own confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
O <hi>England,</hi> if thy glory be thy invention, how vain,
and vexatious, and ugly faced is thy glory?</p>
            <p>I ſay, that Good Nature is pure, and is not in vain, but
is of, and from the great Powers, and is in order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
within its own Lines of Communication: The voice
of the Turtle is heard there and no where elſe.</p>
            <p>But thou Oh <hi>England!</hi> canſt not hear the Voice in thy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45302:3"/>
own inventions; The trampling of Horſes, the noiſe of
the Drums, the claſhing of Swords, the noiſe of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
the ratling of Coaches, the obſerving of Faſhions,
the fine things on your backs, and the many projects in
your heads, your great gains, and ſometimes great loſſes,
the diſtractions in your families and amongſt your friends,
hinder you from hearing the Voice.</p>
            <p>Therefore my work is to ſhew you where you may hear
it pleaſantly, and be delighted in it. It is <hi>(my Friends)</hi> in
Natur's School; It is Univerſal and Divine, like God,
univerſally good. You of the Univerſal Spirit underſtand
me, the others do not; But let me ask them; Will ye
come into the univerſal, divine School of Nature? I
mean Gods Creation, that is the School.</p>
            <p>But before you come, let me ask you this queſtion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you are, you great-Ones, you Kings, Princes, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
you great-Ones in the world, and you ignorant little
ones alſo; What have you, that you have not recieved
from that Univerſal, Divine Store-houſe of good Nature?
How came you, you Great-Ones, by ſo much, when others
have ſo little of the glory of the world of invention? Your
eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, you have more then you can
wiſh for; was it for you onely created? It appears ſo by
your holding it ſo faſt.</p>
            <p>But how came you Poor-Ones by your poverties and
miſeries? you anſwer me, and ſay, Ever ſince the people did
chooſe Kings, and put their Images on Silver and Gold,
and with that bought and ſold: Ever ſince the people did
forſake good Nature, and fell to invention, to build Cities,
and to get Charters; to buy the poors labours for half the
worth, that they ſcarce have bread for them, their wives
and children, becauſe they have none of the Kings and
Queens Images: Oh how the buyers and ſellers are guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
fenced with walls, and defended with Lawes! what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45302:3"/>
cannot buyers and ſellers have, if that they ask for it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Trade?</p>
            <p>Oh Engliſh hearts! conſider ſoberly! Have not Kings
and ſingle Perſons been very chargeable to the Nation?
Are not all vain things chargeable to you? Are not the
learned Fraternities of Lawyers, the Eccleſiaſtical powers,
your Merchants, your Tradſemen, chargeable? have
they not all ſpongy Tongues, to lick up the golden and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Idols? the people being made happy by having thoſe
Idols, or miſerable by not having of them: How they
draw the heart of man? What ſlaves men are made to
fetch Gold out of other Nations? How many looſe their
lives before they bring it? What tricks the people are fiegn
to uſe before they can get it? how they ſtudy and ſtrain
their wits, and lay ſtumbling-blocks before their brethren?
Do you not ſee the poſſeſſors of it lift up themſelves, and
ſnuff up the winde, and have ſcornful eyes, and taunting
ſpeeches for the poor? but you ſhall ſee that they have a
ſmile for their Lovers. In this age the Proverb is made
true, <hi>Birds of a feather will flock together.</hi> Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and wonder not, they ſtand but in ſlippery places;
behold the golden and ſilver Idols, your great Idol, the
mother of the little Idols! behold the great Cathedrals,
the mothers of the little Churches! Behold, I ſay, what
whoredomes and fornications are committed! what lyings!
what cheatings! what blood! what murders! what
diviſions! what tumults! what pride! what covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!
Oh how many Religions there are! what brave
Cloaks and Coats they are made to cover the ſins of the
world!</p>
            <p>There are but two ſorts of people, the good and the bad,
according to your own accompt: the good man muſt be
the univerſal man; one that lives in the Univerſal and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
School, whoſe object is good Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45302:4"/>
The other is the narrow covetous man, whoſe heart is ſet
to get wealth, and he lives in the worlds School, which is
Invention; and his object is gold, ſilver, honour, and the
pomp of the world. Behold the ugly-faced glory of the
world!</p>
            <p>Do but ſet the ugly cheating world of Invention aſide,
and you will ſee, that man was made to ſound forth praiſes
to his Creator, and with delight to read the book of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Come you learned wiſe men, from all parts of the whole
world, with all your skill and Learning! there is a book,
the book of Creation for you to read; all your time is too
little, your skill is too weak, you want underſtanding, you
dare not look on the King, he is ſo glorious, he is pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
there is pure orders, pure method, pure Lawes; there
is no confuſion, there is no pain or vexatious thing. You
univerſal Ones! do you ſing Praiſes to our Heavenly King:
Let the dark covetous men be in burnings in their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
with their Idols, and with their worſhips, until
the matter that hinders them be conſumed.</p>
            <p>Before they can be univerſal, they muſt be Students in
the univerſal School of Nature, which is divine; and all
Schools ſet up by man are but humane, men made them;
Oh my dear brethren, take heed how you hear, and what
you hear! will any come to the work prepared? Rouze
up your ſpirits you <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, you great-Ones, you Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers!
I fear that word will be made good in our days; <hi>Not
many wiſe men, nor many mighty men, but God hath ordeined
the fooliſh to overcome the wiſe things, and the weak things
the mighty things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief end of my Declaration is, to hint unto you
what a Common-wealth is, and how happy <hi>England</hi> may
be, before any part of the world, if they will: Indeed it is
an hard work for poor men to act it; many know how to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45302:4"/>
act it, but have not power and ability; many that know
how, and are able, but will not, they are ſo covetous. Now
the Parliament, (the peoples Repreſentatives,) hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for a Common-wealth; therefore I hope I do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
you to ſpeak concerning what it is, or how in ſome
meaſure it ought to be.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to the Parliament and Armie, and to the
Armie and Parliament jointly, who are all of them the
peoples Truſtees; Therefore, I ſay, to them I ſpeak in the
firſt place; the one to do the work, and the other to ſee
it done:</p>
            <p>For me to hold a little Candle to the great Lights of
the world, it will but turn to my ſcorn and reproach; but
all is one to me; if the work of the Lord be done, (which
work is the Reſtoration of the Creation of God,) I care
not.</p>
            <p>There are certain Rules of Policy the wicked world
ſtands upon; the foundations and grounds whereof are good,
were they well obſerved and applied.
<list>
                  <item>1. The Firſt is, <hi>Strength united is ſtronger.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Second is, <hi>Divide, and ſpoile.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The Third is, <hi>Make poor enough, and you will Rule
well enough.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Pray Parliament, Council, and Armie! Conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly;
Oh Engliſh hearts obſerve and conſider! If good
things be aſſociated, then wicked things will be ſcattered;
if good things be uppermoſt, then wicked things will be
undermoſt; whereas now things are quite contrary.</p>
            <p>2ly. Divide the good things from the wicked things, and
ſpoil the wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>3ly. If nothing will deſtroy wickedneſs, but poverty,
Then do it wiſely; but certainly there are other waies.</p>
            <p>Now indeed wickedneſs is ſo aſſociated, that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is eſtabliſhed by a Law: Men dare ſet up their poſts by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45302:5"/>
Gods poſts; men and women will have their wills, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,
and rule, and be upermoſt, or they will divide and
ſpoil, or make them poor. Behold there the ugly-faced
glory of the inventing world; take away the traſh and
trumpery from before the peoples faces: I ſpeak to you
that are intruſted.</p>
            <p>Conſider, are not Kings aſſociated to uphold each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
glory? Are not the learned Lawyers aſſociated?
Behold their Halls and Charters! Are not your Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Powers aſſociated? they uſe to ſay in your Newes-Books,
<hi>The aſſociated Miniſters of the Weſt!</hi> Are not Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Corporations aſſociated? witneſs their Halls,
Companies and vanities; the great ones eating up the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones; the great Tradeſmen living on the ſweat of the
brows of Handy-crafts men, and inventing bables and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
which are uſeleſs; Nea, the Merchants of the Land
carrying out of the Land Engliſh Commodities, and for
them bringing in things of vanity and pride: The Idols of
Gold and Silver are the mark that they all ſhoot at; to
ſome it is a ſigne of glory, but to others a ſigne of death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray you tell me how the Plow can goe, or the Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts,
which are uſefull, can work with comfort, when all
theſe, with all the idle perſons, depend on them; they are
made the very ſcorn of the Nation. We know the Army
are an Aſſociation, and an Heavenly one too! but it is in
caſe of neceſſity; and the tumultuous people is the cauſe
of it; let them bear the burthen, and pay the charge.</p>
            <p>My humble Requeſt is therefore to the Supreme Powers
of this Nation, to grant unto the people theſe following
neceſſary things.</p>
            <p>1. That a Common-wealth may be really acted; deeds
are better than words.</p>
            <p>2. A Tolleration of Religion; no more perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45302:5"/>
3 Equal Privileges to all Societies and Manufactures,
without reſtriction, or exemption, and all Charters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation
taken away.</p>
            <p>4 An univerſal Magiſtracie to hold the Ballance equal to

            <p>5 Eccleſiaſtical powers aboliſhed; if any will hear Pariſh-Miniſters,

            <p>6 Let the Tithes pay publick debts, and after ſerve

from their enemies: Beſides the Tithes that are pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
every year, the charges of repairing the Churches and
painting them, (to bewitch the hearts of the youth,) with the
Bells, (to draw the hearts of the people, ſounding forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but inventions, and taking the ſenſes, and miſ-placing of
them,) might be better imployed and converted to publick
uſes. Behold, and wonder! The high places of Idolatry ſtand
and are preſerved, when the Temples of the holy Ghoſt
(mens Bodies) are neglected, periſh and ſtarve! Oh horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wickedneſs in the Land! the teachers of the people runn
to ſhed blood!</p>
            <p>7 All the waſt earth to be improved to the beſt advantage.
The Patents and Grants by the Kings to Lords of Mannors
may be well ſearched into, for they are Incroachments upon
the people, the Lords of Waſts are known to be cruel to
the poor, not permitting them to gather a bagge of chips in
ſome places.</p>
            <p>8 That all uſeful &amp; neceſſary arts &amp; handy-crafts may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
&amp; that the things uſeleſs may die in courſe; I mean
whatſoever is hurtful to man; for man is naturally to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
above and before all things, which he himſelf makes.</p>
            <p>9 That in <hi>En<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>field</hi> (which is a very poor Town) there may
be 500: acres of land taken from the 1500: acres, which is for
the Commonets; and that the reſt of the Commons may be
divided to the Commoners to be improved; and that on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45302:6"/>
the 500: acres the Pariſh may ſet up 24: Alms-houſes for the
aged; and a work-houſe for the youth, in which ſhall be a
manufacture, where the Idle perſons may be ſet to work;
the 500: acres to be managed with a manufacture on the
earth; And a manufacture ſet up together, will in ſhort time
raiſe all things neceſſary; the disjoynting of them ſpoils all:
experience makes it true all over England: the uniting the
plow, and handy-crafts, and mariners, and arts recovers it all
again: It was never done in the world yet.</p>
            <p>10 That all Idols may be deſtroyed, I ſay, and all other
things whatſoever that are uſeleſs &amp; hurtful to man; for, I
ſay, man was created to ſerve his Creator, and to read him
in all his works.</p>
            <p>11 That a Bit of earth about the bigneſs of a Nut may be
given for a ſign, and for exchange of Commodities amongſt
our ſelves: the Coyns may ſerve other nations, and deſtroy
them, as the picture of the Owl on Braſs did deſtroy the
<hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> Common-wealth: and truly the pictures of
Kings and Queens put faire to deſtroy England; experience
ſhewes us that many in England are deſtroyed by them, with
them, and for want of them. Oh people of England rage
not at me! for the earth is in conjunction with the greateſt
Powers, and thou thy ſelf art a flower of her, and ſhortly
the Powers will ſummon you: be it known unto you, the
earth will ſwallow you up, and the ſpade will bury all, both
you, and the Images that you make, and all the works of
your hands.</p>
            <p>Now while we live here, let us conſider ſoberly of ſome
order and methods for the Society, which hereafter may be
gathered together; for we want method excedingly in aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
together in good things: we ſee it practiſed in wicked
things.</p>
            <p>Let ſome rich men give out of their abundance ſome
lands or goods to raiſe a Stock, never to expect any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45302:6"/>
or profit thereof: Theſe are Fathers that lay the
foundation; they may give advice and counſel in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Method. I commend <hi>London</hi> for their wiſdome;
they are too wiſe in their Common-wealth for all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
&amp;c.</hi> yet ſhe wants that which ſhould make her happy
ſhe is in confuſion.</p>
            <p>2ly. A well qualified people may come together, not
in Handy-crafts and Arts onely, but to mix the Arts and
Handy-crafts together with earth; that every <hi>Genius</hi> may be
delighted in what it pleaſeth, by improvements of that
which is good in Nature and in Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that which is
good in Natures School. There needs not any Society to
be above 100 houſes, whereof 40 families may live Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free;
which are the poor Handy-crafts-men.</p>
            <p>3. That every Society may have its Government within
its ſelf, according to order and Method; to learn <hi>Hebrew,
Greek, Latine,</hi> Natur's Arts, Handy-c<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ts; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to do that which is moſt neceſſary for the well-being
of it.</p>
            <p>4. That the greateſt gifts of God in nature, may be
known freely, without making ſale of them, as they
commonly are.</p>
            <p>5. The matter on which the Handy-crafts-men work,
muſt be a common Stock to them onely; and the profit to
them only.</p>
            <p>6. All neceſſaries by them raiſed, are to be kept in a
Store-houſe for the uſe of them only, the over-plus ſold,
or exchanged for other Commodities for them by their
Stewards, ordered in a Method by the Fathers and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and their Succeſſors for ever.</p>
            <p>7. No buying and ſelling amongſt themſelves: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and their ſucceſſors muſt take care of their own Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,
that the Stock be encreaſed, and that made out once
or twice in a year: A good encouragement it will be to all
rich people, either in their life time, or at their death, to
give ſomething to ſo good a work,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45302:7"/>
8. Being aſſociated with Mariners, the Fathers may
trade, and that with their own Proprieties, for their own
benefit, and follow the earth and Plantations, in which they
moſt delight; for ſure <hi>England</hi> with care may be made as
rich again as it is; and no beggars in it.</p>
            <p>9. The Fathers purchaſing Lands, may know their own
propriety, although they be in one Society: which may
conſiſt of 1000 or 2000 Acres to every Society: they may
encreaſe it, and diſpoſe of it by Will as they pleaſe, to wife,
children, or friends.</p>
            <p>10. Therefore it will be fit for every Proprietor to have
his Will lye in the Office where he is a Father.</p>
            <p>11. That the encreaſe of Societies will ſoon take up the
people, that you will want people in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. That as Societies are encreaſed, (as) to four or five
in ſome Pariſhes, and that the people come to underſtand
the benefit <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that Rule, that <hi>Strength united is ſtronger,</hi>
they will come in with Lands and goods; and by degrees
the whole earth will become a Paradiſe: I ſay, the earth
hath more work in it, and upon it, then there are now peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to do it: The people are wearyed, (being but few) with
the burthen, and run to Arts and Handy-crafts, and there
they cannot live one by another; ſo that the poor cry all
over the Nation: (indeed they are very poor, and very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)
they are idle, and ſo en-forced to ſteal; Some
would work, and ſome would ſet them to work, but there
is not money to pay them; Conſider in time, before it be
too late; all men are weary, and at their wits-ends, unleſs
it be a few, whoſe hearts are as hard as a neather mil-ſtone.</p>
            <p>Much hath been ſaid, but nothing yet done to recover
the Nation, but who regards it? nea, we have fine tricks;
we can tell how to blaſt every good work, by loading them
with Reproaches, and cry down good things as bad things,
and cry up bad things as good things. Be wiſe oh people!
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45302:7"/>
He that created you is coming to ſift you; We cheat one
another, but there is a diſcerning Eye that beholds all, and
the Nations of the world will find it true.</p>
            <p>1. Therefore obſerve and Aſſociate in good things; it is
but to ſtrengthen your ſelves, and gather together: adviſe
firſt, and then put into action.</p>
            <p>2ly. In every Mile, and half Mile, where there is
matter in the earth, or upon the earth let Societies and
Manufactures be ſettled; firſt, one for a pattern, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may ſee, learn, and teach the right uſe of the
things that are. Here is work for all the rich; for the
Kings, Nobles, for the Ladies and Gentry, for uſeful
Handy-crafts, to repair to the places; where the matter is,
<hi>Them that have skill,</hi> there to be imployed, and to make
what is neceſſary, without running to Markets; ſo that
every Society may be ſupplyed, one from another by land
or by water, in order and method by exchange; and that
by the Governours and reſpective Fathers of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The ſole end is, that all people may enjoy the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of each other at the firſt and beſt hand, with peace
and reſt, and leſs trouble. Food and Rayment, all over
<hi>England</hi> may be raiſed with diligence; and it will be found
better work to raiſe Commodities, than to raiſe moneys.
Oh <hi>England!</hi> thou wants but Method; Bleſſed art thou
above other Nations! but thy Ignorance, and wilfull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
is thy curſe.</p>
            <p>3. Bleſſed and Praiſed be the greateſt Powers! Good
Nature come forth! thy people are many of them willing
to ſee thy beauty; and it lyeth in the works of thy hands.
Behold the Wonders! behold the Divine univerſal Good!
the Philoſophers Stone! You beholding the Work, will
then inquire for the Work-man: Doth not the great <hi>God</hi>
with the Heavens, and the earthly Powers, work you
bread, cloaths, things for your need, delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45302:8"/>
whither runne you? you ſeem to out-run God and
nature! Come back you Gallants! Is it gold or ſilver that
makes you happy? n<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> is not rather the Picture of a King
on it? and a Law of your own making, that you ſo much
doat on? Let me call you fooliſh <hi>Galatians,</hi> you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiched;
and you have done it your ſelves. Call all the
gold and ſilver, and lawes of men, and books of mens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and Images, and ſee if you can be delivered; give
them for a bribe to the earth! ſhe will not accept of them:
for ſhe tels you, theſe are all hers, they came out of her; by
the powers they were created in her, and ſhe will command
you, and them. Therefore trouble her not, for ſhe is firmly
ſet, to command you; therefore, I ſay, you are not happy to
ſee any other unhappy.</p>
            <p>The well qualified people, men skilful in the things that
are, are deſired to be in the firſt Society to be a pattern; for
the ſpongie tongues will blaſt it ſufficiently, and if devils
and men can deſtroy it, it muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Therefore, oh Parliament and Army! take care herein,
and ſtand upon the foundation, <hi>divide and ſpoil:</hi> Divide the
Oppreſſor from the oppreſſed, and ſpoil the oppreſſing
thing. Here is work when you call a Faſt; take off every
yoak, let the oppreſſed go free; hide not your face from
your own fleſh; reſpect not perſons as you doe, but be like
God, who is univerſally good, and ſo is his whole creation
good, it is a learned Book; there is more Letters in that
Book, then 24. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptians, and <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
were made to read the hand-writings, and letters with
a witneſs. Therefore when you come to deſtroy the Idols,
doe not doe as <hi>Saul</hi> did, ſpare the Amalekites; for, for that
his kingdom was rent from him. You Rulers! Rebel not
againſt your maker, make a Through-work of it now; yea,
let the work be wrought in you, and through you, or you
will be made Ciphers, and your work will be done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45302:8"/>
for this is a day of Burnings, Confuſions, Tumults,
and Cryes: Me thinks! all look to be Rulers, but none will
be ruled; all will be Teachers, but none will be taught, &amp; all
is to get places of honour, pleaſure, profit, that they may
have the Capp and knee, that they may dominere, and have
their wills. Man is ſo ignorant, that he centre's his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
in having his own will obeyed, more than in having
his will ſubject to the will of God: he that ſubmitts to God
is at reſt; and in his ſilent reſting in God, and beholding
the great wonders, (the workes of God ſtanding firmely,)
the wonderful Powers let into that man wiſedome, diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the things that are, and the things that are to come.
But oh man! never do you exſpect this ſtate, until you have
ſubmitted without making conditions: It may be you pray
that way to God, and your prayer is rejected: Know this,
that before ſubmiſſion, you are not fit to recieve of his
fulneſs, or to have the ſecret of the Lord revealed to you.
Oh! who can ſubmit? Oh how hard it is to be a Chriſtian!
where are you, that I may know you? I ſay to you, although
you are black, with the ſcorchings of the world, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
of tongues, you are happy and bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſend greeting to you all, where-ever you
are, that you may conſider, and gather your ſelves together,
and be hid in the day of the fierce wrath of the Lord,
what Language, Nation, or Tongue ſoever you are: for
our God is no reſpector of perſons. And as I have been
bold to ſearch into the heart; ſo you muſt give me leave
to ſearch into mens callings: I onely ſpeak to that, which
I ſee at preſent is neceſſary, and call to them, that they will
conſider, and hearken to heare the voice of the Turtle-dove
in the divine School of Nature.</p>

are good Ancient Lawes and Cuſtomes, which were before
the <hi>Norman</hi> yoak; as that of the Gavel-kind; that is, that
Eſtates got by the induſtry of Parents were leſt equally to
their Male children; the forſaking that good old Law,
gave an advantage to the raiſing of Families to Titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
without deſerts, being graced by the Kings; the

ſo that a man knowes not how to live, nor what to

tell you to your faces, that they will have it one way or
another, and that a ſhort death is better than a lingring
death: And truly there is but death in hanging, and it is no

more in ſtarving. Where are you Gentlewomen? you

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I expect that if you can: you will either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
or privately: I do here declare, that I have no evil
deſigne towards any of you, neither do I know of any evil
deſigne, but would gain you from your trouble, and your
care and confuſions, which you are in, and are like to come
upon you.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Ob.</hi> You ſpoil us of our delights, and comforts, we
will not bear it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You part with a little ſhort comfort, which in
your inventions is mixt with trouble: which of you can
deny it, that hereby you ſhall enjoy an eternal weight of
glory, here and hereafter: You ſhew me mans works, and
I ſhew you Gods works. Pray which of them affords you
the beſt comfort?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Ob.</hi> But you ſay, I ſpeak that which is true; but you
have Lawes to maintain you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But how came you by them; and if you have
Laws, they are but of mens making, and them they may
<hi>null,</hi> if they pleaſe: but if they will not, I hope they will
not ſay, they are as good as Gods Lawes, Orders, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
and Decrees are: And I dare ſay, that not any
man ſhall be judged at the great Day by any Lawes of
mens making, but by the Lawes of Gods making; which
are the book of the Creatures, and the book of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
It is but fit you ſhould be acquainted, and well read
in theſe Books: and it highly concerns you to take care in
this point.</p>

6. <hi>Ob.</hi> You talk of a Common-wealth; but what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
have you to ſhew us, to Act it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſome that have made that Objection, I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That the Parliament hath declared <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> to
be a Common wealth, and I doubt not, but they will make
good what they have Declared. Therefore ſeeing that <hi>End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
was firſt in the laſt Tumult, I propoſe, that 500 Acres
of the Commons, which are ſet out, may be ordered for to
act the Common-wealth on, for the benefit of the poor in
that Pariſh; for although <hi>England</hi> be a Common-wealth in
general, yet by little Common-wealths it muſt appear; as
many Towns make one County, and many Counties one
Nation; And I dare ſay, in a ſhort time you may behold a
Pattern, which may be fit for <hi>England,</hi> and the whole
world to follow.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>LIft up your hearts yee Rulers, and yee of our Engliſh
Nation! For you are deſigned for a General Work;
be not afraid; and let all your enemies know, both beyond
the Seas, and at home, (which are not to be valued,) that
ſo long as you of the Parliament and Armie are found do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the work of Reformation, that there are ſeven thouſand,
and ſeven times ſeven thouſands, which have not bowed the
knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> neither will they, who will ſtand by you: I
ſpeak to you, which I hope do underſtand me; As for the
others, let them ſcoff, tumultuate, and rage! He that
made them are mightier than they; one ſhall chaſe a 1000.
and ten ſhall put ten thouſand to flight: I ſay fear not, but
come forth in well-doing, and the God of all health, and
wealth be with you, and lead you forth to do his works,
and not your own.</p>
               <p>But if you neglect that duty, and diſ-unite, the people
then will make their applications for relief in theſe their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
requeſts, to ſuch of you as ſhall be moſt propenſe
and ready to effect their Deſires.</p>

            <head>My Canto on the Times.</head>
            <l>COnſidering of things, I then look't about</l>
            <l>Times clear forgot, and almoſt worn quite out:</l>
            <l>The people were willing in the year forty two,</l>
            <l>But ſince by experience it hath proved their woe;</l>
            <l>For faith and good works are even now forgot,</l>
            <l>The peoples Teachers faithfull are not.</l>
            <l>To ſay and to do, is the Righteouſneſs of man,</l>
            <l>But to doe that without money who can?</l>
            <l>It makes men honeſt, and that wicked too,</l>
            <l>For, moſt men for that will each other undoe.</l>
            <l>I was not afraid, but ſerv'd the State eight years;</l>
            <l>My name in their Muſters moſt clearly appears;</l>
            <l>Suffering hardſhip, impriſonment, and loſs of my blood;</l>
            <l>But if we act for Common wealth, 'twill be good.</l>
            <l>We then fought againſt wickedneſs, and all evil things,</l>
            <l>Which began, when the people cryed up their Kings:</l>
            <l>But when the danger was paſt, and in place was found gain,</l>
            <l>I wanted not accuſers, to make me Heretick amain;</l>
            <l>For ſo was I tryed by Articles, (which were but their Traſh,)</l>
            <l>In <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> with their pretended Zeal ſo raſh;</l>
            <l>And for their good works were ſo well rewarded,</l>
            <l>Encreaſing in Honour and wealth, and are ſo much regarded:</l>
            <l>And now to ambitious and covetous men all's but a prey,</l>
            <l>Crying Religion, and Juſtice, and that is their way.</l>
            <l>What running and riding! what whipping they make</l>
            <l>Each one of the other, and how they miſtake!</l>
            <l>For to be Honourable, Great, Rich, and Upper moſt,</l>
            <l>Nature, and their brethren muſt be made their poſt.</l>
            <l>But where is their one who will regard the poor?</l>
            <l>Will you ſtill buy, ſell, lye, and paint o're the Whore?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45302:12"/>
Let me look but a little, and ſee well about,</l>
            <l>And I will ſoon find all the wickedneſs out,</l>
            <l>Both in mine own ſelf, and alſo in my brother,</l>
            <l>Oh! that, that might be destroyed in each other!</l>
            <l>To ſtrengthen each other in any wicked thing,</l>
            <l>Shall they finde reſt? No! nor ſee the face of the <hi>King.</hi>

            <l>Unite and ſtrengthen thy brother, and do it ever,</l>
            <l>Let good be your object, and gather your ſelves together,</l>
            <l>Not with the Drum, the Sword, nor the battle ſpear;</l>
            <l>For the univerſal Magiſtrate you ſhall not need to fear:</l>
            <l>The univerſal, divine School of Nature will you and them teach</l>
            <l>And every one there will learn for to preach,</l>
            <l>And there find him truly, who giveth all reſt</l>
            <l>Before your inventions can, though you think them beſt:</l>
            <l>There ſhall they ſing Praiſes unto their Creator,</l>
