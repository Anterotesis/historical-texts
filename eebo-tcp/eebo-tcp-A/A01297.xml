         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

what these wonders ment, answerd, That Nature was in trauail with the <hi>LORDE</hi> of all thynges created. There testeth no more nowe, but to dissolue Cunynghams confutatione (set forth by hym iwa certain Epistle, whiche he calleth his Inuectiue) by lyke force as we haue doon the test. Master Cunyngha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath reduced al aduersaries calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niations vnto ij. poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: The fyrst is, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knowlege of Astro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logie, is enemy to the most laudable scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of phisike: The other, That the Astrologia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not foreshewe thynges to come by his starres. Concernynge the former parte he sendeth us ouer to <hi>Hipocrates</hi> the prince of phisike, in his boke <hi>De aëre, aqua, &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> Seyng therfore it was nedefull for me to reade ouer that booke (although not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable with my study and profession) yet hauyng one lent me, according to the smal leisure that I had, and the litle capacitie of my poore wytte, I redde hym ouer bothe in Greke and latin. And truely as farre as I remembre the notes of the margent in the latin translation proclaimed open war betwene <hi>Hipocrates</hi> and me: but when I looked nerer to hym selfe, I found no man so frendly to me, whiche prescribed so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable necessary vse of astronomy (not
<pb facs="tcp:17051:25"/>
ones dreaming of fatal signs, as they wold seme to haue hym. But seing peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture I shal seme to dispute on these matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde my cunnyng, I wolde sayne learne of doctour Cunyngham what argumentt to confirme Astrologie he can gather out of that booke. In the meane tyme suche thynges as I redde and vnderstode, I wil briefely recite. <hi>Hipocrates</hi> speaketh muche of the risyng of certayne signes and stars, as of the <hi>Pleiades, Arcturus, Canis,</hi> and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che other, all the which sayenges are most plainly to be referred to the state of Tyme that is, when those signes rise or go down. And not here onely, but also in his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes, Hipocrates dryuethe to the same ende. Wherefore he concludeth, That the knowledge of Astronomye, not of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, is profitable to the science of phisike Bicause that by the course of the starres the phisition may forsee many thynges ne cessary to his science. Not that the starres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>oo foretell hym of any thynge, but that their risynge or fallyng is coincident with suche state of tyme. Secondly, master Cu nyngbam concludeth, that things to come may be forsene by aspect of the starres, by this argument. If the Maryner by his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes can forshe we the tempest to folowe,
<pb facs="tcp:17051:26"/>
the Phisition by his tokens, can forsee the increace or declination of the liknes. The husband man by his argument can fortell the state of the yeare to folowe, why may not the learned Astrologian by his star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res haue knowledge of thynges to come? As for example, <hi>Mars</hi> is whotte and drye, nowe yt he see many fyery thynges mete with hym, may he not boldely pronounce that the yeare folowyng shalbe muche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to heate. But of howe smalle force this argument is, we shal vnderstande by the easy solution thereof. For grauntynge that the maryner, phisition, and husbande man can forsee thinges by his certayn sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes and tokens: Yet what fatall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (in gods name) compelleth vs to think likewise of thastrologians. For the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is brought to confirm the matter, is more doubtfull then the matter it selfe: for we can not tell of what nature Mats is, nor thastrologians them selues, so that is they wyl proue any thyng by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they must fyrst shew by what reson they call Mars whote, or Saturne colde.</p>
            <p>For except they bee sure of this, that they make their priciples tru, thei may at their pleasure conclude what thei list. But their propositions shall haue no more credite
<pb facs="tcp:17051:26"/>
then truth &amp; certayntie. Wherfore not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the phisitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or the mariner can know any thing, therfore the astrologians shall do the lyke, except they fetch theyr premo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strations of as sure groundes as the other do. But lest we should to insolently inuey agaynste these false tellers (foretellets I wold say, master Cunyngham hath geuen vs ensaumple of two yeares that chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced accordyng to the predictions of moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, 1524, and drynesse. 1540.

            <p>Fyrst therfore that their significations coulde not so be learned, it is manyfest by this reason: That those thynges whyche chaunce or come to passe bee infinite, that is innumerable to men, howe then coulde a certayn numbre of men know or learne whether all those thynges came to effecte as they had marked in a few? for although they had taken their obseruation in as ma ny as they coulde, yet were there manye mo, yea tenne thousande tymes as manye whiche they knew not of, that myght hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen clean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whiche I haue not without a cause before touched (although some wold think

to doo a good thyng it is good at al tymes: The mariage it selfe taketh not effecte (as these superstitious diuinours saye) of the daye or tyme but of the cause and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce in whiche it is contracted. For yf those bee nought, not Uenus nor Iupiter nor all the louynge sygnes can make that mariage good: And yf thou marry in the feare of God, though Mars and Saturne satte ouer thee, and thoughe it were on the moste dismall daye that euer Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Chaldean obserued, thou shalte be sure of the Lordes blessynge, whyche he promiseth to all them that in his feare and loue entreth into that honourable estate. So muche the more is theyr vnholsome harmonie to be hissed oute, that appoynts certayne days, in whyche yf a man shuld marry, the parties shoulde neuer agree or loue one the other.</p>
            <p>But I leaue the rest vntyl such tyme as I shall bee dryuen to answer them, where yf they keepe not modestie, as I thynke I haue doone, I wyl yet vtter more to the confusion of theym, and theyr arte.</p>
