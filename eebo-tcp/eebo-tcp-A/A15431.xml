            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Since that time I confesse my selfe a debtor to your Lordship: and therefore haue strained my selfe for kindnesse receiued to shew at the least thankefulnesse againe, and to recompense the meannes of that gift by an other of that sort. <hi>Iubemur</hi> (saith one) <hi>colligere frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta<note place="margin">Barnard. Cant. ser. 5.</note> ne pereant, id est, ne minima beneficia obliuisci: Wee are bidden to gather vp the verie fragmentes and crummes,</hi> that is, not to forget the least benefites. First then J will declare the contentes of this present treatise: Secondly, the reasons that mooued mee thereunto: Lastly, why I would haue it passe vnder your honors name.</p>
            <p>First of all therfore, as in my former booke I haue gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one summe (the Lord by the gracious assistance of his
<pb facs="tcp:20647:3"/>
spirite directing me) the whole doctrine of the Church of Rome, and opinions of Papistes: in that worke but plainely and nakedly offering to the Readers viewe, the substance of the controuersies, and state of the questions betweene vs: So further I thought it not amisse, to bring to light, and to shew as in the face of the Sunne, the manifold absurdities, inconueniences, shiftes, subtilties, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which our aduersaries in defense of their errours are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to vse in oppugning the trueth. This I haue accordingly perfourmed, I trust, in this worke, that the weaknes of their cause, the beggerie of their Religion, the vanitie of their Councels, and deceite of their heartes might appeare and be made knowen to all the worlde.</p>
            <p>This booke I haue intituled, the <hi>PILLERS OF PAPISTRIE:</hi> which is built vpon lies and vntruthes, faced out with rayling, and bitter speech, propped vp with blasphemies, and patched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with dissonant &amp; contrarie opinions among them selues. The proofe of these particulars followeth at large discoursed in this treatise. First, as touching thir lying and vntruthes, I could haue wished that they had embraced his wise counsell, that saith: <hi>Aut cauenda sunt mendacia rectè agendo, aut confitenda pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitendo, non autem cum abundent infoeliciter viuendo, augenda sunt &amp; docendo.</hi> August. lib. 2. de mendac. cap. 21. But they are so farre from correcting by repentance, that which they haue offended in practise, that they are not onely become lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, but lie-maisters, not practisers of this craft, but teachers &amp; defenders. Concerning their railing speech, it is al the Rhetorike they vse: Such are no better then sheep-biters, &amp; meacockes among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that haue not filed &amp; whetted their toongs to smite &amp; wound vs withall. But here I say vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Augustine did to the heretike <hi>Pascentius: Literae tuae nec ad reddenda conuitia me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 177.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:20647:3"/>
               <hi>nec a reddendis literis me reuocare potuerunt: So neither shall their rayling writinges prouoke vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to passe the bondes of modestie, and to pay them home in the same kind, neither yet cause vs to cease from answering their follies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe as for their blasphemies, it woulde offend a chast and a Christian eare, to heare what horrible and vngodly sayings doe passe from them: in the second piller of this booke we haue set downe a whole kenning of them. But as Augustine saieth to some, who the more readily to descrie heretikes, them selues also fel into blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie: <hi>tolerabilius in suis foueis delite scerent vulpes, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <note place="margin">De men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacio. lib. 2. cap. 9.</note> propter illas capiendas in blasphemiae foueam caderent venatores: The Foxes might more safely lurke in their holes, then the huntsmen, to take them, should fal into the pit of blasphemie.</hi> So though we were the foxes, and they the huntsmen, it is no good way for the huntsmen to snare themselues, to entangle the foxes. But we in deede are the huntsmen, and they the foxes, as it is said, <hi>take vs These foxes, these litle foxes, that destroy the vines.</hi> Cantic. 2. 15.</p>
            <p>Concerning the dissensions and diuisions among papistes, it is no strange thing, as he saith: <hi>Omnia vitia errores<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                  <note place="margin">August. in Math. ser. 11.</note> diuisi sunt inter se &amp; contrarij: apud Idolorum cultores diuisi sunt spiritus Iunonis &amp; spiritus Herculis; Paganus &amp; Iudaeus hostes sunt Christi, sed diuisi inter se; Arrianus &amp; Photinianus haeretici, &amp; diuisi inter se; sic Donatistae, sic Maximinianistae.</hi> All vices and errors among men are deuided and contrary to themselues: among the Idolatrous Heathen, the spirite of Iuno and Hercules are diuided; the Paganes &amp; Iewes enemies to Christ, and yet diuided: the Arrians likewise &amp; Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tmians, the Donatistes and Maximinianistes: ad also the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes

and Thomistes among the Papistes deuided betweene them selues, yet <hi>Ambo pertinent ad regnum diaboli,</hi> Both doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the raigne or kingdome of the Deuil.</p>
            <p>Now the reasons that haue moued me principally to enterprise this businesse, were these. First in respect of those countrie men of ours, which haue suffered themselues a long time to be seduced and deceiued with false opinions, and a vaine shew of holines, beeing as it were made drunke with the whore of Babylons intoxicate cuppe: that they now at the length seeing the nakednes &amp; beggerie of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish religion, would take heed to themselues in time, and thinke it enough, yea &amp; too much, to haue sipped of that poisoned cuppe, lest drinking more deepely thereof, they afterward bee constrained to draw out the dregges, &amp; to be partakers of their plagues: of them we say with Augustine, <hi>Licèt non timentur vt perdant, non<note place="margin">Epist. 105.</note> negligendi sunt tamen, vt pereant:</hi> Though we feare them not to hurt vs, yet they must not be neglected and suffered to be lost.</p>
            <p>As for their ring-leaders, and sect-maisters, our counsell also to them is, that they would learne at the length to giue place to the trueth: <hi>Augustine</hi> said of some Heretikes: <hi>Puto, quòd ipse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolus,<note place="margin">Epist. 167.</note> si authoritate iudicis, quem ipse elegerat, toties vinceretur, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esset tam impudens, vt in ea causa persiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi> I thinke if the deuill had beene so often ouercome before a Judge of his owne choosing, hee would not bee so impudent as to persist still in an euill cause. But our aduersaries haue bene often vanquished euen by their owne iudges, the testimonies of auncient writers and consent of antiquitie, and yet for all this will not yeld. Well, as one saith, <hi>Non oramus vt moriantur inimici, sed vt corrigantur, sic mortui erunt inimici, iam enim correcti non amplius erunt inimici:</hi> Wee desire not, that our enimies were dead, but amended, and so our enimies shoulde bee deade,
<pb facs="tcp:20647:4"/>
for beeing once amended and corrected, they would no longer bee our enemies.</p>
            <p>There are other also of our countrimen, who (though not so far gone as the other, yet) are not sufficiently grounded in knowledge, or setled in iudgement to be able to discerne betweene the truth &amp; errour: <hi>Qui breuia non valent intelligere, prolixa non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant<note place="margin">August. Epist. 101.</note> legere,</hi> Who can neither vnderstand briefe matters, nor will abide to read long: for their sakes also haue I compiled this treatise, neither verie long to worke vnwillingnesse, nor yet too shorte, to hinder vnderstanding. But euen as they, which<note place="margin">Aug. solis loq. ca. 14.</note> haue tender etes, do not first behold the sunne, but the fire or the starres, or some such like, and then turne them to looke vppon the sunne: so must wee deale with these men, <hi>Gradibus perducendi adsu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma sunt:</hi> By degrees they must be brought to vnderstande the higher points: For their cause cheifly haue I vndertaken this labour, that they which are not able to conceiue the chiefe matters in question, yet may safelie take knowledge of the nakednesse and poorenesse of our aduersaries cause.</p>
            <p>Concerning my selfe also, some what there was, which in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect induced me to sei hand to this plough: for as he saith, <hi>Vt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus<note place="margin">August. ad Dulcit. qu. 4.</note> inuitare nos debet suauitas veritatis, vt doceamus cogere debet necessitas charitatis:</hi> As the pleasantnes of the truth doth entise vs to learne, so the bond of charitie should vrge vs to teach. And the rather considering that now is the time or not farre off, wherein the fall of Babylon is to bee expected and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, according to the prophesie in the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> Euerie<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> man, that beareth hatred to the scarlet and bloodthirstie whore, ought to shewe his readinesse in defacing and pulling downe the Kingdome of Antichrist. As Christian Kinges
<pb facs="tcp:20647:5"/>
and Princes then by their sacred authoritie haue begunne for their part to lay Babylon wast, so is it our part to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her nakednes: they are the Lordes Captaines to slay the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, wee his watch men to descrie the enemies comming: They with battaile, canons and engins, do batter the walles, wee come with ropes of argument and perswasion to pull downe the towers:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 17. 23.</note> They fight with <hi>Sauls</hi> sword, and put on his kingly armour, wee must assault <hi>Goliah</hi> with <hi>Dauids</hi> sling &amp; stones out of the brook. The text saith, they shal make the whore desolate and naked, eate<note place="margin">Apo. 17. 16</note> her flesh and consume her with fire.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the common and vsuall practise of wrangling and cauilling spirites, who to preuent other mens accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doe themselues first begin to accuse and challenge others of the same crimes, which they are guiltie of: Thus Sathan the accuser of the brethren, sometime dealt with <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 1</note> saying vnto God, that if he would but stretch foorth his hand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and touch all he had, hee would not spare to blaspheme God to his face, whereas nothing is more common with that old Serpent, then to curse and blaspheme God. Thus our aduersaries of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish religion (which indeed is no religion, but meere superstition) haue subtillie sought to vndermine vs, crying out against vs, that wee are lyers, Idolaters, blasphemers, and such like, which are titles and epithetes fitter and more proper to themselues. They charge vs with rayling: <hi>Harding Confut. apolog. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>diuis.</hi> 2. with lying: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens. apolog. pag.</hi> 597. with corrupting and altering of scripture: <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.</hi> 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 8. with fables. <hi>Rhemist.</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. with execrations and blasphemies: <hi>Iud.</hi> 3. with heresies, <hi>Bellarm. de notis eccles. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.

<pb facs="tcp:20647:7"/>
to this ende I haue vndertaken this labour in this treatise, to detect and bewray their guiltines in this behalfe, that we may bee purged from their slaunders, and our cause iustified, and that the shame &amp; blame may fall vpon them, that haue deserued it.</p>
            <p>As for vs, wee raile not, neither vse reuiling speech, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time we tell them roundly their owne, and this may bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rayling: vnlesse they will say Christ rayled, when he tolde the Iewes, that they had made his fathers house a denne of theeues. But their rayling, and venemous dartes, which they shoot at vs, are notoriouslie knowen and cannot be hide. It is the grace of popish writers both old and new, to stuffe their bookes full with cursing &amp; rayling: <hi>Stapleton,</hi> that blacke-mouthed Sophister of <hi>Louaine,</hi> hath of late set foorth a booke against <hi>D. Whitakers,</hi> wherein beside the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his cause, he hath disgraced his profession, with bitter and filthie tearmes, calling that learned and godly man, <hi>Rusticum, fatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, asinum, asininum professorem, morionem, stolidum:</hi> Foole, clowne, asse, doit: yea he is so impudent, that he spareth not to reuile the deade,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such intemperate and railing speeches then of Papistes, we attribute either to their childish ignorance or phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike malitiousnes.</p>
            <p>Concerning the other accusations, of heresie, blasphemie, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, corruption of scriptures and such other, it shal appeare, I trust, in this discourse, that they are the men, &amp; none other, that are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie herein. As for fables, they do vs great wrong to cast them vpon vs: their owne legend of lies and infinite fabulous stories, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie tell vs, that poperie is fuller of fables, then the heresies of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians</hi> or the <hi>Manichees.</hi> Their other charge concerning iunoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dissention is returned vpon themselues: for who knoweth not, that the Iesuites of these daies, haue innouated and changed in the most pointes, the old popish profession, and haue cast it into a newe mould, and brought in a new forme of Pope catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: But we in substance retaine the same Religion, which at the first reuiuing of the Gospel was maintained 40. yeares ago by the Protestants. As for dissensions in fundamental pointes and articles concerning faith, we haue none. In other matters, there haue bene some contentions among vs, more we graunt then needed, &amp; more hotely pursued of some then was requisite: yet they are neither in weight so great, or in number so many, nor so egerly prosecuted, as dissentions among papistes haue beene, for <hi>anno.</hi> 1509. wee reade that the <hi>Franciscane</hi> friers pursued the poore <hi>Dominicks</hi> to death: and the contention began about the conception of the Virgin Marie. <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 802. Such rigour and fiercenes hath not yet beene seene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong protestantes, neither I trust, shall.</p>
            <p>But in saying that Protestants are Idolaters, they make too lewd a lie, for it is wel knowen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we haue no Images or Idols of brasse, woode, stone, siluer, at all in our Churches, as they haue nor any pictures, carued, painted or grauen, set vp to bee worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: If two men shoulde bee set before vs: the one lifteth vp his, eyes to heauen, and calleth vppon the name of God, hauing no
<pb facs="tcp:20647:8"/>
similitude or resemblance before him, the other praieth before a stocke or stone Image: is anie man so senseles, as to say the other is an Idolater, rather then this? But thus blinde and sottish are the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes in their iudgement. Take heede ye English pope catholickes, doe ye not see, how your ghostly fathers goe about to make fooles of you?</p>
            <p>Now then, to the intent our aduersaries slaunderous mouthes should be stopped, and their falsehoode descried, I haue giuen a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall taste in this worke, in euerie kinde of their fraudulent dealing with vs, and of their vnseemely behauiour, &amp; vngodlie shifts, which they vse in oppugning of the trueth, and defense of their bad cause. The whole booke I haue deuided into 4. partes, shewing the foure principall pillers of papistrie, and euerie piller conteineth diuerse partes beside, as it is set foorth in the title of this booke: I trust, throughout this treatise, that our aduersaries shall not iustly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge me for dealing vntruely or deceiptfullie with them, seeing I haue set downe their sayings and opinions, as I find them, quoting the places, and citing the authors, whence I haue them: so that I doubt not to say with Augustine, <hi>Ego omnia, quòd bona fide coram deo dixerim, sine vllo studio contentionis, sine aliqua dubitatione veritatis, sine ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo praeiudicio diligentioris tractatus exposui:</hi> I trust I may say, with a good<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de genes cap. 29.</note> conscience before God, that I haue set downe all things without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of contention, or doubting of the trueth, and without preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing other mens more exact labours herein. If sometime I shall seeme to speake somewhat roundlie or sharply, I hope the discreete reader will iudge it to bee done, not without cause, &amp; to say, as that good father in the like case: <hi>Noui fratrem meum, si quid in disputatione</hi>

            <p>Concerning our aduersaries, I would haue them thinke, that I haue vndertaken these labours for their good, if they could so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue it, that seeing now the nakednes of their cause, they may at the length be better aduised: We haue not cast off all loue and care of our enemies: We say of them, as Augustine did sometime of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius the heretike, <hi>Nos non solum diligimus, sed dileximus eos, sed aliter</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:20647:8"/>
               <hi>vunc diligimus, aliter aliquando dileximus, tunc, quia nobis rectae fidei videban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, nunc vt ab errore liberentur:</hi> Wee both loue them now, and loued them before, but otherwise now then before, then we loued them, because we thought they were of a right faith, but now we loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end they might bee deliuered from errour. Now vnto my brethren of the same faith and religion, thus much I say, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer blasphemies, heresies, absurdities, they reade here to bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and maintained by papistes, they would take no offence thereby, nor seeme to stumble thereat: <hi>Sed facite inde quod fecit domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>

               <hi>cum illi obtulerunt amarum potum, gustauit, &amp; respuit, sic vos audite &amp; abijcite:</hi> But doe ye as Christ did, when they offered him vineger to drinke, he tasted and refused it, so giue you the hearing and reading of these things, but in iudgement cast them away, and reiect them.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue, by the Lords assistance finished my taske, &amp; ended my trauell for this time: I will now sit me downe a while and rest my wearie penne, and giue place to others. This I haue done, partly to discharge my duetie to God, and debt to his Church; partly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke others by this example to put foorth their talent: who for skill are more able, for their leasure more fit, for outwarde helpes haue better incouragement, &amp; in respect of their reward are more bound: I would we might now at the length spare our selues at home, and forbeare to prouoke one another by writing, and ioyne our strength against the common aduersarie. If our wittes want whetting, our pennes exercise, our bodies labour, our aduersaries abroad can and may afford vs worke enough: we need not hew one at another. Let vs do as Moses did, slay the Aegyptian, it is not seemely for one He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew to striue with another. The timber, that must make the house, should be prepared and hewen in the fielde, Prouerb. 24. 27. when it commeth to be set together, not so much as the noise of an ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer should be heard, as we read of Salomons temple: so we should labour to hew and cut off popish superstition &amp; corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as in the field abroad, but we ought to build peaceably, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noyse among our selues. One saith well, <hi>Omnia alia bona, aurum, argentum, diuitiae diuidi possunt; non potest diuidi (pacem meam do vobis:)</hi> Al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods, gold, siluer, riches, may be deuided; this inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce onely cannot be deuided, my peace I leaue with you. And therefore, saith he, <hi>Christus noluit fiers iudex ad diuisionem:</hi> Christ refused to be a iudge
<pb facs="tcp:20647:9"/>
or deuider of the inheritance. God grant, that we may at the length, learne, as carefull children, or faithfull stewardes, to keepe whole Christes inheritance lent vnto vs, that rich patrimonie of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue and peace: that we may one yeeld to another in the trueth, euerie one to studi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to amend what is amisse, and all ioyne together to seeke Gods glorie.</p>
            <p>Thus shall we be sure to imbrace and enioy peace: for what else is the cause of contention among vs: <hi>Nisi</hi> (as one saith) <hi>quia displicet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus angelica illa partitio, qua gloria deo, pax hominibus nuntiatur: quonam</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bernard. epist. 127.</note> 
               <hi>modo stabit pax hominum coram deo, si deo apud homines non potest tuta esse sua gloria?</hi> Because mortall men like not that Angelical partition, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they pronounced glorie vnto God, and peace in earth: for howe can the peace of men stand in force before God, when Gods glory is not kept safe and sound amongst men? This then is the way to procure peace, and to nourish it, to remoue and auoid dissention, euery one in his seuerall place and calling to labour to amend what is amisse, to restore what is decayed, to supplie what is wanting, and to redresse what is out of order, and so to seeke chiefly to aduance Gods glorie. Thus shall we haue peace at home, &amp; peace abroad, our dissensions shall slacke within, and by our peace our strength and courage shall increase against our enemies without. We shal runne vpon them, as one man: ten shall chase an hundred, and an hundred a thousand. Thus the Gospell by Gods grace shall still florish in this land, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition shall decrease and weare away, and poperie shall bee weeded and rooted out, which God grant for his welbeloued and onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonnes sake Iesus Christ our Lord, to whom bee praise for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</p>

               <p>That wee refuse all mans attestation and approbation, and will bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> tryed by Scriptures onely: and that wee count it a great absurditie to haue the Scriptures approued by the Churches testimonie: <hi>Galath. 2.

peace, and orders sake, were limited to euery one, <hi>Galath. 2.

               <p>They say, wee applie that text of Saint Paul: Hee that will not labour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> let him not eate. <hi>2. Thessal. 3. 2.</hi> against the vacant life of the Clergie. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in hunc locum.</hi> But wee require no such thing, as to labour with the hands, of such of the Clergie, as labour in studie and teaching. Against the idle life of Monkes, Nunnes, Friers, and the rest of that crue, as also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst idle Masse-priests this text is strong.</p>
               <p>That we hold nothing to be necessarie to saluation but the Scriptures.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
                  <hi>2. Timoth. 3. Sect. 3.</hi> We hold no such thing: for so wee should exclude Christ him selfe, as vnnecessarie to saluation. But we affirme, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture containeth all things necessarie to be learned to saluation, and this is the true state of the question.</p>
               <p>That wee plainly denie <hi>Melchisedech</hi> to haue bene a Priest. <hi>Hebr. 7.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> 
                  <hi>Sect. 8.</hi> Here without shame they slaunder vs. This wee neuer denied, neither by Gods grace will euer: though we affirme, that his Priesthood consisted not in offering of bread and wine: neither doth the Apostle, or any text of Scripture so teach.</p>
               <p>They charge vs with this heresie: That Christ was not the first man that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> entred into heauen. <hi>Hebr. 10. Sect. 1.</hi> They belie vs, to say we holde, that Christ was not the first man that entred into heauen, with his bodie or whole humanitie, as the text is. <hi>Hebr. 10. 20.</hi> And that dedicated and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared away for all his members to enter into heauen, both with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their soules: by vortue of whose death, all the faithfull from the beginning were receiued into heauenly rest in their soules.</p>
               <p>That we will haue no difference betweene the laitie and the Clergie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> 
                  <hi>1. Pet. 5. Sect. 2.</hi> It is false, which here they obiect against vs. Wee onely mislike their Popish difference, who do in such sort set apart their Clergie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20647:17"/>
from the rest of the people, as though they onely were the Lords lot and inheritance, the rest excluded.</p>
               <p>That we say, the Scriptures be so easie, that they may be not only safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> read, but also expounded boldly of all the people, as wel vnlearned as learned: and consequently, euery one by himselfe, and his priuate spirite, without respect of the expositions of the learned fathers, or expectation of their pastors iudgement, may determine &amp; make choice of such sense as himselfe liketh, <hi>2. Pet. 3. Sect. 1.</hi> All these are great vntruthes. In deede we do hold, that the people may safely be admitted to the reading of the Scriptures, though we denye not, but that there are certain places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hard to be vnderstoode: yet we giue them not libertie to expound scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as themselues listeth, not staying for the iudgement of their pastors: For we plainly protest, that whosoeuer despiseth the ordinarie Ministerie of the word, which God hath established in his Church, for the direction of vs in the truth, shal neuer attaine vnto true knowledge. As for the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the fathers, we are so far from reiecting them, where they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete according to the sense of the Scriptures, that they do in a manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now all our interpretations, which you mislike.</p>
               <p>That wee affirme, that wee neither keepe, neither possiblie can keepe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Gods commandements, <hi>1. Iohn. 2. Sect. 7.</hi> Wee say not so, but that we can not keep them in such perfection, as the iustice of God requireth, though by his grace we doubt not, but we are enabled in such measure to keepe them, as his mercie in Christ accepteth, <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee see with how many slaunders our countrimen of <hi>Rhemes</hi> doe vnkindly charge and load vs withal: neither are these all: more, who plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth may collect out of that blacke booke of theirs. The want of the rest, which I haue not here set downe, I will supply out of another countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans booke of ours, to whome we are much beholding for afoording of<note place="margin">Harding.</note> vs such plentie of so good stuffe. First, <hi>P. 146.</hi> He thus friendly saith vnto vs, <hi>If you do not allowe euerie man, yea, and euery woman to be a Priest, why driue</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> 
                  <hi>ye not some of your fellowes to recant, that so haue preached? Why allowe yee the bookes of your new Euangelistes that so haue written?</hi> An odious vntruth: for touching the Ministerie of the Church, wee haue none that either haue preached so, or written so, <hi>Iewel. defens. Apolog. pag. 146.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That wee saye, all things necessarie to saluation are expressed in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> Scriptures, <hi>pag. 240.</hi> But so wee say not: Wee holde that all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie are either in the Scriptures expressed, or therein contained, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie collection and diduction to be drawen from the same.</p>
               <p>That wee, which say wee can by no meanes fulfill the law of God, doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> make God vniust, euill, impotent, and not able to giue so much grace, as may helpe to fulfill his lawe, <hi>pag. 368.</hi> Wee make not God vniust or impotent, but wee confesse our selues to be sinners. Neither is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

here, what God is able to doe, but what he hath promised: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God be able, by his abounding grace, to make vs perfect in this life, and altogether voide of sinne, as wee shall be in the life to come: yet his power is not contrarie to his will reuealed in his worde, which saith, that all men haue sinned, <hi>Rom. 3. 23.</hi> And as many as are of the workes of the lawe, are vnder the curse, <hi>Galath. 3. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That wee tell Christian men, they may worke as much as they will,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> but all in vaine, <hi>page. 371.</hi> Vntruth, for wee saye with <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> your woorkes shall not bee in vaine in the Lorde. Although wee doe exclude them from being any cause, or meane of our saluation, and that by the warrant of the Scriptures, <hi>Roman. 3. 28. Ephesian. 2. 10.</hi> and in other places.</p>
               <p>That wee professe, that the faith of the Catholike Church may faile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and fall, <hi>page 493.</hi> Wee speake not of the vniuersall Catholike Church, but of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of any other particular Church, which may faile in faith, as wee see the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> are nowe thoroughly departed from the faith, and are wholly subiect to the Turke.</p>
               <p>That wee animate temporall Magistrates, by the pretensed example <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> to intermeddle with Bishops offices, <hi>pag. 689.</hi> Vntruth, it is not our doctrine: But they rather embolden the Pope to meddle with Princes offices. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> a great Champion of theirs doeth free vs from this slaunder, who confesseth of vs, that wee holde <hi>Regimen ecclesiasticum spirituale esse, &amp; distinctum a politico:</hi> That the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall regiment is spirituall, and a thing distinct from the politicall, or temporall.</p>
               <p>That wee teach, that the Lordes supper is verie bakers bread, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> wine, with the onely figure of Christes bodie and bloud, <hi>pag. 320.</hi> But wee neuer so vnreuerently called that holy Sacrament. It is your selfe (master <hi>Harding</hi>) that doeth so vilely disgrace this holie Mysterie, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it <hi>A piece of bread not woorth a point: a leane and carrien banket; a toye.</hi> Wee call it the Sacrament of thankes-giuing, the Sacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of Christ, with other names fit for so great mysteries. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe wee make them bare figures and signes, but as the Apostle saith, seales of the righteousnes of faith. <hi>Rom. 4. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, hauing seene thus farre, with what false opinions they charge our Church generally, in respect of our doctrine, let vs take some triall also of their iust and true dealing with vs, in matters belonging to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And here I doe not thinke but wee shall finde them halting, as before.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Harding</hi> chargeth vs with continuall aduoutrie and incest, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> without all honestie or shame, Ministers lawfull wedded wiues,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20647:18"/>
                  <hi>their filthie yokefellowes, pag. 439.</hi> Yea, hee saith, that our Gospel hath no substance, beside carnall libertie and licentious liuing, <hi>pag. 289.</hi> And that thorough our euill teaching, the worlde groweth more to be dissolute and wicked, <hi>pag. 382.</hi> But if master <hi>Harding</hi> had remembred the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenes, and licentiousnes of life that is at <hi>Rome:</hi> Hee could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blushing haue charged vs with incest, aduowtries, and all Carnall libertie. He had forgotten belike that olde English prouerbe, <hi>Hee that goeth once to Rome, seeth a wicked man: hee that goeth twise, learneth to know him: hee that goeth thrise, bringeth him home with him, Fox pag. 843.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rhemistes</hi> doe accuse the Protestants (whom they call heretikes)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> for their lightnesse in admitting euery one without discretion to the Clergie, <hi>1. Timoth. 3. 6.</hi> But, as for that vncharitable name of heretikes, wee shall shewe anone, that it is more proper vnto them, than vnto vs. And neuer any heresie admitted more vnworthie persons to the Clergie, than Papistrie hath done: not onely into the inferiour places, but euen into their chiefe Bishops see: for as <hi>Alphons.</hi> testifieth, whome wee cited before, Manie of their Popes did not knowe so much as their Grammar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harding</hi> chargeth the Protestants in diuers Countries to haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> to wrest the sworde out of the Princes handes. <hi>Were the hundred thousand Boures in Germanie</hi> (saith he) <hi>consumed by the sworde of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie there for their obedience? P. 441.</hi> So hee slaundereth <hi>Luther</hi> also, that hee stirred vp <hi>Thomas Munzer</hi> in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> who was the Rebels prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <hi>pag. 447.</hi> Thus the <hi>Rhemistes</hi> deale with <hi>Caluin,</hi> calling him one of the principall Rebels of this time, and moste falsely giue out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, that their Consistories are shoppes of rebellion.</p>
               <p>Thus also they report of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> that hee should teach, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not to be obeyed being in deadly sinne. <hi>Annotation. 1. Peter. 2. Sect. 8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these are malicious slaunders deuised against vs. First the boures of Germanie were most of them aduersaries to <hi>Luther,</hi> and vnderstoode no parte of the Gospell, but conspired together, as they saide, onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the crueltie of their Lordes, as they had two and twentie yeares before in the conspiracie called <hi>(Liga Sotularia,) Anno 1503.</hi> fifteene yeares before Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> began to preache, which was <hi>Anno 1518. Iewell. pag. 441.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Luther</hi> was so farre from stirring vp <hi>Thomas Munzer,</hi> that hee called him the preacher of Sathan, <hi>Sleidan. li. 5.</hi> Thirdly, Neither did <hi>Wickliffe</hi> teach any such thing, for he him selfe was obedient both to <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and to <hi>Richard</hi> the second; both which princes, as wee knowe, were guiltie of some notorious sinnes. Fourthly, you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shewe your selues the rebelles of this age, who make no conscience
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20647:19"/>
in mouing the subiects to rise vp and conspire against their naturall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes. And <hi>England</hi> knoweth by experience, that your <hi>Seminaries</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Rhemes,</hi> are the shops of rebellion, which haue forged so manie conspiracies against our Soueraigne, but all hitherto in vaine, the Lorde be thanked, and wee trust in God shal be so still: yee might therefore haue beene ashamed, to haue cast vs in the teeth with that, which your owne consciences may accuse your selues of.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the slaunders in generall, which they belch out against our whole Church: now wee will a little touch those Popish forgeries, which they haue in their idle and phantasticall braine, deuised against some particular men amongest vs, sorted out from among the rest.</p>
               <p>And first of all, they lay load vpon poore <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> charging him with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> many things which he neuer helde: As that he should teach, that a Prince is not to be obeyed being in deadly sinne, <hi>Rhemist. Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. which wee haue shewed before to be a great vntruth.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Wickliffe</hi> did condemne degrees of schooles, &amp; titles of Doctors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> and masters, <hi>Rhemist. Math.</hi> 23. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. This is a meere slaunder of <hi>Wickliffe: Fulk. ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he should saie, that God ought to obey the diuell, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

                  <hi>Praefat. in controuers.</hi> and addeth for the proofe hereof, that this his heresie was condemned in the Councel of <hi>Constance. Sess.</hi> 8. Wee take this to be a meere slaunder as the rest: for there is no such thing found obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> neither in those 18 articles exhibited against him in the conuocation of certe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet concerning this matter, three schollers of the said <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> that followed not long after, shewed their opinion, namely, <hi>Nicholas Herford, Phillip Repingdon, Iohn Ayshton.</hi> And thus they say, that God ought not to obey the diuell in his owne person, or essence, nor with the obedience of necessitie: for so to affirme, say they, it is heresie, <hi>Fox P.</hi> 438. And againe they graunted, that they meant an obedience of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oue, because God loued the diuell, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him as he ought, <hi>P.</hi> 439. The phrase and maner of speech is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what strange: but who seeth not, that their meaning is sound and good. First, that God not in his owne perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in his creatures yeeldeth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the diuel: that is, sometime giueth him power ouer his creatures. Secondly, yet not of necessitie, for God, can when it pleaseth him, tie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than short<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; exempt his creatures from his power. Thirdly, that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him as his creature, &amp; so he doth also the wicked, suffering the Sunne to shine vpon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. Fourthly, that the Lord in his iustice is to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the diuel, &amp; so doth: they are reserued in euerlasting chaines of darknesse, <hi>Iud.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:20647:19"/>In this sort also they dealt with <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> deuising strange Articles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> against him which he neuer thought: As that he should saye, that Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> when they alleaged his authoritie against him, was but a rime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: wherein <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> himselfe aunswered, that they did him great iniurie, for so much, as he alwaies esteemed and reputed S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> for a most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Doctor of the Church: <hi>Fox pag.</hi> 606.</p>
               <p>Thus it was falsly obiected against the same <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> in the Councel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of <hi>Constance,</hi> where he was most vniustly condemned: that he saide, there should be a fourth person in diuinitie, and that a Doctour heard him to speake the same. <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> desired the Doctour might be named, which not obtaining, he thus cryeth out: O miserable and wretched man that I am, which am forced and compelled to beare such blasphemie and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>Fox P.</hi> 622.</p>
               <p>This was, as wee see, the guise of the olde Papistes, thus without all feare, to slaunder the children of God, whose of-spring, I meane the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists of latter time, do tread in the same their fathers steppes.</p>
               <p>So was <hi>M.

                  <hi>Euaristus</hi> Bishop of Rome is saide to haue decreed, that no priest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> should be ordained without a title. But it is not like, that the Church of Rome was in those daies of persecution deuided into cures and parishes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20647:25"/>
whereof they shoulde haue their titles: And this constitution see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth rather to take his beginning at the Councell of Chalcedone, where it was enacted, that no priest, no entituled should be ordained: neyther is there any mention made in that place of any former decree prouided by <hi>Euaristus, Fox pag. 39.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Zepherinus</hi> be 2. epistles ascribed, one written to the Bishops of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Sicilia, the other to the Bishops of the prouince of Egypt: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine no manner of doctrine or consolation fit for those times, but certaine rituall decrees to no purpose, which argue the said epistles, neither to fauor of that man, nor to tast of the time: for the poore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted Bishops in that time, were so farre from hauing any lust or lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to seeke for any primacie, or to driue other Churches to appeale to the sea of Rome, or to exempt priestes from the accusation of lay-men, as in those epistles is to be seene, that they would haue beene glad to haue had any couert at all, to put their heades in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calixtus</hi> Bishop of Rome and martyr, hath 2. epistles decretall appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him: wherein these ordinances amongest other are founde, that no action or accusation against the teachers and prelates of the Church should be admitted. And in the ende of the epistle hee confuteth the error of them which hould, that they which are fallen, are not to be receiued againe. But <hi>Nouatus</hi> was the first author of this error, wo followed in <hi>Cornelius</hi> time, after <hi>Calixtus:</hi> how then is it like that <hi>Calix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> could confute him? And againe concerning actions and accusations,<note place="margin">Plura Fox pag. 58.</note> it is not like that the time of so grieuous persecution would serue them to commense any law against their Bishops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vrbanus</hi> followeth, to whome also is ascribed an epistle decretall (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> out of the same forge) containing not one worde of consolation fitte for those times, but certaine straite preceptes for not transporting or alienating of the goods of the Church, and to pay truely their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes, which they vowe and such like.</p>
               <p>But it is not like that in those heauie times of persecution, the Church was so greatly enriched (the constitution for tithes and oblations being not yet ordained) and when as men sought generally rather to spoyle and take from the Churche, then to giue vnto it, that there needed such straite prouision for disposing of Church goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pontianus,</hi> who succeded <hi>Urbanus,</hi> and was banished for the name of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Christ, is fained in his epistles decretall thus to write: <hi>That God hath priestes so familiar with him, that by them he accepteth the offeringes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of other, and forgiueth their sinnes and reconcileth them vnto him.</hi> What could be said more of Christ, whome the Scripture maketh our onely mediator and aduocate?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:20647:25"/>The decretall epistles of <hi>Fabianus</hi> Bishop of Rome, are euen as good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> stuffe as the rest of that sort: vnto him are ascribed these ordinances: as of accusations against Bishops, of appealing to the Sea Apostolike, which decrees, how vnfit and vnbesitting they were those times of persecution, we haue shewed before: as also of not marrying within the fift degree, of communicating thrise a yeare: whereas <hi>Augustine,</hi> lyuing after this <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> almost 200. yeares, writeth thus of this matter, <hi>Omnibus diebus domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicis communicandum suadeo &amp; hortor:</hi> Vpon euery Lords day I doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and exhort all men to communicate: <hi>De eccles. dogmatib. cap. 54.</hi> How then is it like that <hi>Fabian</hi> decreed the contrarie of manie yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Also it is to bee seene, that the most part of the third Epistle stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth worde for word in the epistle of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the third, who followed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 200. yeares after him: Beside the vnseemely doctrine conteyned in the end of the epistles, where hee contrary to the tenor of the Gospell applyeth remission of sinnes (onely due to the bloode of Christ) vnto the offerings of bread and wine by men and women euery Sunday in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> succeeded next to <hi>Fabianus,</hi> who is slaundered with 2. epistles decretall, which are apparant to bee none of his, both by the stile, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> is most rude and barbarous (but <hi>Hierome</hi> reporteth of him, that hee was a verie eloquent man) and partly also by the matter: for in the first he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to all Ministers and brethren of the Church concerning the lifting vp of the bodies and bones of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, De catechumenis,</hi> &amp; transposed to <hi>Vaticanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In the second writing to <hi>Ruffus</hi> a Bishop of the east, he decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that no cause of Priests or Ministers be handled in any strange or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Court without his precinct, except only in the court of Rome by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation. Who seeth not now by this litle, that these epistles were rather forged by the ambitious latter Bishops of Rome, who labored altogether to aduance the dignitie of their Sea, then by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whom the troubles of the Church would not suffer to thinke of any such matter? And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie like, that he would haue interserted some word of comfort and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation fit for those times, and made some mention of the great stirres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and <hi>Nouatus:</hi> whereof there is not one word, in these decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
               <p>Vnto <hi>Lucius</hi> Bishop of Rome is referred by <hi>Gratian, distinct. 81. Ministri,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> this constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that no Minister whatsoeuer, after his ordination, should at any time reenter into the chamber of his owne wife. Such homely stuffe is not like to haue proceeded from those good Bishops, that died in Christs cause.</p>
               <p>Vpon <hi>Stephanus</hi> Bishop, are also fathered certayne epistles decretall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> which by this may be gathered to be none of his. In the end of the second
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20647:26"/>
epistle, hee saith thus: <hi>Which thing is forbidden both by lawes ecclesiastical, and also secular.</hi> But what secular lawes could bee in that time in fauour of Bishops, as that no accusation should be laid against them, till they were restored to their estate? when as the Iudges were all then heathen, and their lawes tending to the destruction of the Christians and their faith. Againe in the 5. canon of the said epistle, he intreateth verie solemnlie of the difference betweene Primates, Metropolitans &amp; Archbishops, which distinction, of titles and degrees rather sauouring of ambition, then of persecution may verilie giue vs to suppose, that these epistles were not written by that <hi>Stephanus.

               <p>Of the same stamp are the epistles ascribed to <hi>Caius Marcellinus, Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Milciades,</hi> Bishops of Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caius</hi> in his epistle decretal, willeth and commandeth all difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> in all prouinces whatsoeuer emerging, to be referred to the Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike: How is it like that this was decreed by <hi>Caius,</hi> when as aboue an hundred yeare after, ann. 420. in the 6.

Pauls</hi> epistle to the Ephesians word for word. And how is it like that <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> which died in the 20. yeare of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> could write of consubstantialitie of the diuine persons, when that controuersie and terme of consubstantialitie was not heard of in the Church, before the Nicene Councell, which was 23. yeares after him? <hi>Fox</hi> ibid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eusebius in his decretall epistle writeth thus, In sede apostolica extra macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi>

And yet his late predecessor <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> within his time and remembrance, did fall grieuously in sacrificing to Idols, though afterward hee repented thereof, and was condemned for the same, and expulsed the citie by the Councell of 300. Bishops. How then could <hi>Eusebius</hi> (this fault and error of his predecessor beeing so fresh in memorie) so report of the Apostolike Sea, that it was neuer stayned with any blemish in the faith? therefore it is apparant, that it was none of his doing.</p>

               <p>Thus I hope, it is a cleare case to anie man, that is not wilfully blinde, that those decretall epistles, are but forged and bastard writings, &amp; those holy Bishops and Martyrs to be falsely reputed the authors thereof: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering

               <p>All this notwithstanding, which we haue not barely and nakedlie affirmed, but I trust, sufficientlie prooued, and to the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by more then probable argumentes demonstrated, that our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries haue vsed much deceit, in conueying false and forged writinges, vnder auncient authors names, yet they will needes beare the worlde in hand, that there is no such matter, but that they are those authors proper and peculiar workes.

               <p>Thus we see both the great boldnes of our aduersaries, in vrging such authorities which they knowe to be counterfeit, as also the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant weakenesse of their cause, that are constrained to vse such beggerlie shiftes. But let them vse and vrge these stragling runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and fatherlesse bookes neuer so much, wee will still holde vs to this point, wherein they shall neuer be able to disproue vs, that they do deceiue them selues, and abuse the world, in making men to beleeue that they are the fathers owne writinges. Wee say therefore of these, and of all such other bookes, as <hi>Augustine</hi> did of that, which went in <hi>Henoehs</hi> name: <hi>Libriisti ob nimiam antiquitatem reijciuntur:</hi> These bookes are too old to be true: <hi>De ciuitat. dei. lib. 18. cap. 38.</hi> And concerning some of them, as those which are fathered vpon the Apostles, and them that followed in the next age, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of the epistle, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees ascribed to Christ: <hi>Si aliqua huiusmodi epistola fuit, ab eis proferri</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:20647:28"/>
                  <hi>potuit, qui illi adhaerebant:</hi> So if they wrote any such bookes, it is like they would haue brought them to light, that were the Apostles schollers, <hi>cont. Faust. lib. 22. cap.</hi> 79. And of them all, and the rest of that sort, wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this sentence with the same father: <hi>Quae proferuntur ab errantibus sub nomine ipsorum, quia non sunt ipsorum, improbantur, nec acceptantur ab ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia:</hi> Those bookes which are brought forth vnder the name (of the Apostles, and other auncient writers) because they are not theirs, are reiected, and not receiued, or acknowledged of the Churche, in <hi>Psal. 130.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus hauing in part declared (so much as I thought necessary for the matter in hand) how deceitfully our aduersaries haue dealt with the worlde, giuing them, <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi> as wee say, one thing for an other, in falsely entituling their friuolous pamphletes, with graue and good authors names: I will spende a little time, before I leaue this place, to shewe how they haue not onely thrust vppon those aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctors and fathers false writinges, but haue also falsified their good woorkes, by putting in, and putting out, by clipping, chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and altering, lines, wordes, sentences: And no maruaile then, if by such cunning (rather cousoning sleightes) they make those good authors to speake what they list them selues.</p>

Hereupon the councell sent their Legates to <hi>Cirillus</hi> patriarke of Alexandria, for the auncient copies in Greeke of the Nicene councell: wherein they found no such canon as was pretended: but the contrarie, howe the decrees of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene councell had committed all and singular persons Ecclesiasticall, vnto the charge of their Metropolitanes. Thus then, to beginne this game withall, the Bishops of Rome them selues are proued to bee forgers and falsifiers of auncient writinges. <hi>Plura apud Fox. pag. 10.</hi>

               <p>And as they are not ashamed thus boldly and wickedly to defaulke &amp; clippe from the Scriptures, so an otherwhile, they will bee so saucie as to adde thereunto, and put to of their owne.</p>
               <p>Thus Pope Sixtus the 4. added this clause to the salutation of Marie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> which is commonly called the <hi>Aue Marie: hayle Marie full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongest women,</hi> then followeth that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous addition, <hi>Et benedicta sit Anna mater tua, de qua sine macula tua pro cessit caro virginea,</hi> And blessed is <hi>Anna</hi> thy mother, of whom thy Virgines

               <p>So in the Idolatrous canon of the Masse, they haue thrust in (<hi>Enim</hi>) into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> the words of institution: <hi>HOc enim est corpus meum,</hi> For this is my bodie: that they might haue fiue consecratorie words, as they call them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Gospell affoordeth them but foure.</p>
               <p>Likewise in the same canon: the Gospell saith, who the same night <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> that hee was betrayed: but they contrary to the trueth of the scripture, say thus: <hi>Who the next day afore hee suffered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like libertie also and boldnesse <hi>Hosius</hi> an other Arch-papist vseth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> in corrupting of scripture, who to prooue popish satisfaction, In steed of <hi>sanctificatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> readeth, <hi>satisfactionem:</hi> where <hi>S.

               <p>Thus wee see, what great libertie the Papistes take vnto themselues, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> chaunging, and chopping, minsing and mangling, not the writings onely of men, but euen of the holy Ghost.

As that <hi>Iohn 5. 46. Had yee beleeued Moses, yee would haue beleeued me.</hi> Christ say they, would not so speake of <hi>Moses:</hi> for hee saith, that all that went before him, were theeues. <hi>Iohn 10.</hi> But Christ in that place speaketh of hirelings onely, he condemneth not faithful shepheards that went before him, <hi>August. lib. 16. cont. Faust.</hi> That also seemeth (they say) to bee thrust in, <hi>Math. 5.</hi> That Christ sayth, He came to fulfill the law, when as he neither obserued their ceremonies, nor offered sacrifice according to the law. <hi>To this Augustine answereth: That these were but figures, Quarum figurarum veritas Christus.</hi> Of which figures Christ was the trueth: he therefore fulfilled the law, in that he was the verie bodie and substance of the types and figures of the law, <hi>cont.

Because say they <hi>Luke</hi> hath it not. <hi>Augustine</hi> aunswereth, that the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes are not contrarie one to the other, if one set downe that which the other hath omitted. <hi>cont.

                  <hi>Harding</hi> saith, that Christ neuer saide to any of the Apostles, as vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>

And Christ said vnto all, Go &amp; teach all nations, <hi>Math. 28.</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> then had no more the Holy ghost than the rest: if he had no more authoritie to preach to the whole world than the rest: it belonged no more to <hi>Peter</hi> to feede the Lords flocke than to the rest: for what is it to feede, but to preach? what is it to feede, but to receiue the gifts of the Holy Ghost, to teach and instruct?</p>
               <p>It is in vaine for you to say, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> the Holy Ghost hath signified, that it cannot erre, <hi>Hard. pag. 485.</hi> But where euer, I pray you, did the Holy Ghost make any such promise? if in that place, as you beare vs in hand, where Christ saith: I praied for thee <hi>Peter,</hi> that thy faith should not faile: S. <hi>Augustine</hi> may answere you, <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid pro Petro rogabat, pro Iohanne &amp; Iacobo non rogabat?</hi> did Christ praye for <hi>Peter,</hi> and did he not pray for <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> also? <hi>in quaestion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nou.

Here then is another bold &amp; true affirmation, without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounded vpon Scripture.</p>

Our saluation then can not be of grace and workes together, for the

               <p>Many such like blasphemies are contained in that Idolatrous and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous psalter: for what greater blasphemie can there be, then to ascribe vnto a creature the titles, and honor due &amp; proper vnto God onely?

               <p>Great store of such like blasphemies are euery where to be founde in popish treatises: my purpose is not to bring them al into the readers view, it were too long a peece of worke, and I thinke, needelesse: neither doe I in this booke promise or professe so much: but my intendment is onely in euerie place to giue the Christian Reader a taste, of the bitter and sower fruites of poperie.

If they therefore had the spirite of God, as they boast, they would not in such sort as they do, with such vile termes depraue the holy scriptures: nor so extenuate the precious death of Christ, adding other helpes, and supplies thereunto, nor so defile that onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie sacrifice, which was once offered vpon the crosse, by foisting an other in the place thereof, namely that abominable Idoll of the masse,

                  <p>In the Idolatrous sacrifice of the Masse, they affirme and practise many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> thinges contrarie to scripture, 1.

                  <p>Wee wil then this doe: first examine those pointes particularlie, which they obiect for heresie: and this being done, we will afterward requite them with as many hereticall opinions, as they haue inuented against vs, but more iustlie, and with a great deale more trueth.</p>
                  <p>The first heresie, which the Iesuite obiecteth against vs, is of the Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and heretikes called <hi>Eunomiani.</hi> The Simonians held opinion, that they were saued only by the grace of <hi>Simon</hi> their sectmaister, whom they made their Christ and sauiour. The <hi>Eunomiani</hi> taught that no sinnes could hurt them if they had faith: Such also, saith he, are the heretikes of this time, that would be iustified onely by faith. We aunswere, who seeth not with what impudencie, these thinges are obiected against vs? The Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians said, they were saued by the grace of <hi>Simon:</hi> we by the grace of Christ: is it all one with papistes to be saued by <hi>Simons</hi> grace, and by the grace of Christ? their heresie therefore was condemned, not because they

ascribed all to grace, but in that blasphemously they set vp <hi>Simon</hi> to be their sauiour. The Eunomians were such enemies to good workes, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> testifieth, that they affirmed: <hi>Quod nihil homini obesset quorumlibet perpetratio peccatorum:</hi> That the committing of the most heynous sinnes could not hurt a man, <hi>Heres.</hi> 54. But God be thanked, we are not enemies to good workes: for we hold them to be necessarie, and without them it is impossible to be saued: for a liuely faith cannot be void of good workes: yet by them we are not iustified before God, neither in part, nor in whole. And if therefore they condemne vs as heretikes, because we affirme iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith onely, let <hi>Augustine</hi> also go in the number of heretikes: <hi>Nostra fides (inquit) iustos ab iniustis non operum, sed ipsa fidei lege discernit. cont.</hi> 2. <hi>epist.

                  <p>Fourthly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiecteth the heresie of the Pepuzianes, who do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> women to be priestes: So <hi>Luther</hi> teacheth (saith he) that a woman or a boy may as well absolue in the sacrament of penance as a Bishop or a priest. And now in England saith he, a certaine woman is the Caluinistes chiefe bishop: speaking thus in contempt of our gracious Soueraigne.</p>
                  <p>Ans. 1. <hi>Luther</hi> is belied by the Iesuite, he saith onely, that where a priest cannot be had, there a Christian man or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may stand in as good steed: but he maketh no mention of boies. <hi>Fox pag.</hi> 1281. <hi>articul.</hi> 13. condemned by <hi>Leo</hi> the x.

We acknowledge no sacrament of penance, and therefore whatsoeuer <hi>Luther</hi> thought of that sacrament, it is no matter to vs. But the other is a foule lie, and a monsterous slaunder vttered of our Prince: for her Maiesty doth not take vpon her any part of the pastoral office of Bishops or other ministers: She neither handleth the word nor sacramentes, nor exerciseth ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal discipline, nor ordaineth ministers, neither doth any thing else proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie incident to the office of ecclesiasticall persons. The Church of England doth giue vnto her that lawfull power, that Christian princes alwaies had: as to ordaine &amp; constitute ecclesiasticall lawes, to see that ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons do faithfully execute their office and charge, and to prouide for the encrease and establishment of true religion.</p>

Florea.</note> to giue remission of sinnes: wherein they goe further then euer <hi>Luther</hi> did, who alloweth Christians onely and faithfull men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to supplie the want and absence of the priest or minister, not heretikes or infidels: the Iesuite therefore might heere haue plucked
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20647:49"/>
himselfe by the nose, who so affirmeth, and not haue twitted, or cast an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the teeth with that heresie, which hee himselfe mayntayneth: <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. de baptis. lib. 1. cap. 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fift place hee obiecteth the heresie of <hi>Proclus,</hi> who affirmed, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> concupiscence verily was sinne, and that sinne did raigne in those that were borne anew.</p>
                  <p>Ans. First that sinne reigneth in the faithful that are regenerate we, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denie, being so taught by <hi>S. Paul, Rom. 6. 12.</hi> Secondly that sinne not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding remaineth in the regenerate, &amp; that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence or lust of the flesh euen in them is sinne, wee learne out of the same Apostle, who doubteth not to call Lust sinne: <hi>I knew not sinne, but by the law:</hi> and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he sheweth, what sinne hee speaketh of, <hi>I had not knowen lust, except the law had said, thou shalt not lust, Rom. 7. 7.</hi> likewise ver. 14. 17. 20. of the same chapter, he giueth it the name of sinne. So Augustine calleth concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, <hi>Per peccatum accidens malum,</hi> an euill brought in by sinne: <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnost. articul. 4.</hi> And againe, <hi>Aduersus libidinem si certas, malum est:</hi> this is a signe that concupiscence is euill, because we striue against it, <hi>cont. Iulian. lib. 3. chap. 21.</hi> To affirme then, that concupiscence is sinne, and properly euill of it selfe, is by Saint Pauls rule no heresie.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, hee compareth vs to the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> who denied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that the Church had any power to reconcile men vnto God but onely by baptisme: Such are wee, he saith, because wee take away the Sacrament of penance.</p>
                  <p>Answ. First the <hi>Nouatians</hi> denied recouerie or forgiuenesse of sinnes, to those that fell after baptisme: But wee affirme no such thing, holding no sinne to be irremissible, but blasphemie against the spirite, according to the scripture: and that it is neuer too late for men, while they liue here vpon earth, to repent them of their sinne, and returne vnto God: all this wee graunt, and yet acknowledge no sacrament of penance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we are therefore heretikes because we refuse the popish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of confirmation and penance, receiuing onely two, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptisme and the Lords supper: let <hi>Augustine</hi> beare vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, who acknowledgeth no more, <hi>Dormiente Adam fit Eua de latere, sic de Christi latere effluebant aqua &amp; sanguis, sacramenta, quib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firmatur eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi> While Adam slept Eua was made out of his side, so out of Christes side issued water &amp; blood, the sacraments, whereby the Church is established.</p>
                  <p>In the 7. place <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiecteth the heresie of the <hi>Sabellianes,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> affirme one person onely to be in God, and not three: of this opinion was <hi>Michael Seruetus,</hi> saith he. Answ. True it is, that this impious wretch <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetns</hi> for this, and such like heresies, was worthily put to death at <hi>Geneua.</hi> Is it not then great impudencie, for the Iesuite to vpbrayde vs with those heresies, which he himselfe knoweth, are condemned by vs, and iudged
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20647:49"/>
worthie of death? So diuerse amongest them, haue bene discried of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, yea diuerse of their pope-holy fathers: <hi>Marcellinus</hi> sacrificed to Idols, <hi>Liberius</hi> subscribed to the Arians: <hi>Honorius</hi> 2. was a Monothelite: <hi>Siluester</hi> the 2. a Magitian, and Necromancer: <hi>Iohannes</hi> the 22. affirmed, that the soules of the dead see not God before the resurrection. These and diuerse heresies haue bene found, euen in the popes chaire: Woulde they now thinke them selues wel dealt withal, if we should charge their whole Church, with these heresies, that haue bene maintained by some amongst them? yet this hard measure they offer vs, in blaming our whole Church for <hi>Seruetus</hi> heresie and such other.</p>
                  <p>Eightlie, the Iesuite chargeth vs, with the damnable heresies of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> First, they did not ascribe the beginning or cause of sin vnto free will, but vnto the prince or God of darknes: But wee, saith the foule mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed Iesuite, are worse then the Manichees, for we make God the author of sinne. Ans. Here this malicious man doth shamefully belie vs: for which of vs euer said that God is the author of sinne? or who euer denied, that mans free will was the cause of sinne? A free will we confesse in man to doe euill, without constraint or enforcing, but not free at all, to make choice of good, as <hi>Augustine</hi> confesseth: <hi>Liberum arbitrium non est idoneum, quae ad Deum pertinent sine Deo aut inchoare aut peragere, cont. Pelag. hypognost. articul. 3.</hi> Mans free wil is not fit in diuine matters to beginne or finish any thing without God. Secondlie, saith the Iesuite, the Manichees did accuse the fathers and patriarkes of the olde testament: so saith he, doth <hi>Caluine</hi> and the rest. Ans. The Manichees did not onely condemne the patriarkes, but reiected also the olde testament: But wee both receiue the law &amp; the prophets, as the oracles of God: neither dowe condemne those holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as wicked men, though wee excuse not all their infirmities: but say with <hi>Augustine: Sic ita<expan>

Faust. lib. 22. cap. 45.</hi> We aunswere them further, as <hi>Augustine</hi> doth the Manichees: Be it, saith he, that the patriarkes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were such euil men as the Manichees slaunder them to be: <hi>Etiam sic non dico electis eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sed ipso etiam deo illorum demonstrarentur meliores:</hi> Yet in that case being, we can easely shew, that they are much better, not onely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their chiefe doctors &amp; ringleaders, whom they cal elect, but then their God, whom they imagine to be polluted &amp; defiled, with mixing him selfe with the kingdome of darkenes, &amp;c. <hi>Ibid. cap. 98.</hi> So we say to our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries: that if we should yeelde, that the patriarkes had greater infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then in deede they had, yet confessing that their soules after death were presently receiued vp to heauen, we should more honor them, then

the papistes, who, howsoeuer they magnifie their holy and vertuous liues, yet allow them no place in heauen till the comming of Christ, but thrust them downe into a place of darkenes, which they affirme to bee a part and member of hell. Wherein they doe offer the vilest disgrace, to those holy men, that can bee.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> accuseth vs of Donatisme: The Donatists denied,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> that the Church consisteth of good and bad, and so (saith hee) doe wee. Answ. Wee confesse that the visible Church vppon earth hath not onely good, but bad therein: and therefore is compared to a house, wherein are vessels of al sorts: to a barne floore, which hath both chaffe &amp; corne: to a nette, that conteyneth both good and bad fishe. But the holy inuisible Catholike Church consisteth only of the elect, &amp; such as shal be saued, for which Church Christ gaue himself, to sanctifie it, &amp; make it vnto himselfe a glorious Church, <hi>That it should be holy &amp; without blame,</hi> as Saint Paul saith: <hi>Ephes. 5. 25. 27.</hi> And <hi>Augustine</hi> being taught by the Apostle saith: <hi>Illa Columba, vnica, pudica, casta, sine macula &amp; ruga, non intelligitur nisi in bonis, iustis, sanctis:</hi> That Doue, which is but one, chast, vndefiled, vnspotted, without wrinkle, is not vnderstood but of the good, righteous, holie, <hi>De baptism. lib. 6. cap. 3. Bernard</hi> also saith: <hi>Sponsa est ecclesia electorum, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio iustorum:</hi> The spouse is the Church of the elect and the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the iust. <hi>Cantic. 68.</hi> Yet neither <hi>Augustine,</hi> nor <hi>Bernard</hi> were for so saying counted <hi>Donatistes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> layeth Arrianisme to our charge, because they in no wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> receiued vnwritten traditions. Answ. If this be a point of Arrianisme, then <hi>Augustine</hi> was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> who writteth thus of a certaine booke that treated of saint <hi>Thomas: Cui scripturae licet non credere, non est enim in catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico canone:</hi> Which booke, it is lawfull for vs not to beleeue, because it is not in the catholike Canon of the scripture. Therfore we are not bound to beleeue more, then is contained in scripture, and so consequently no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, and vncertaine traditions.</p>
                  <p>Our kinde countrimen of Rhemes, doe charge vs with a deeper point of Arrianisme, because wee affirme that Christ was our priest and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor both as God and man: for this were, say they, <hi>to make Christ his fathers priest, and not his sonne,</hi> and so inferior vnto him, <hi>Heb. 5. sect. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. In the office of the priesthood of Christ. 2. thinges must bee considered, a ministerie, and authoritie: the ministeriall part of his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as his obedience, his sufferinges and sacrifice, Christ executed as he was man: but the authoritie of reconciling vs to God, he wrought both as God and man: So saint <hi>Paut</hi> sayth, <hi>that Christ through his eternall spirit offered himselfe, Heb. 9. 14.</hi> Therefore not as man onely. And <hi>Augustine, Diuina humanitas, &amp; humana diuinitas mediatrix:</hi> The diuine humanitie, and humane diuinitie is our me diatrix: <hi>Homil. de ouib. cap. 12. Bernard</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:20647:50"/>
also though a writer in a corrupt time, might easily haue resolued them in this point, <hi>Sicut mediator noster duas naturas humanitatem scilicet &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitatem coniunxit in vnapersona, ita singula eius opera, ad hanc siue illam necesse est pertinere naturam: quicquid ergo miseriae passus est, ex homine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxit, quicquid potenter operatus est a patre habuit:</hi> As our mediatour hath ioyned two natures, the humanitie and diuinitie in one person, so all his workes must necessarily be referred to either one of them: whatsoeuer he suffered in weaknesse he tooke of his manhood, what soeuer he wrought in power, hee receiued of his father, <hi>Serm. de verb. sapient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thrusteth vpon vs as an heresie, that opinion of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> that no prayer or oblation is to bee made for the dead, which was, saith hee, in time past in the auncient Church condemned for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</p>
                  <p>Ans. Wee denie not, but that diuerse of the auncient writers did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline too much this waye, to maintaine and commende prayer for the dead: yea, and <hi>Augustine</hi> seemeth somewhat to bee infected with this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, though sometime his speech soundeth to the contrarie, as where he saith, <hi>Pompa funeris, agmina exequiarum, viuorum sunt qualiacunque solatia, non adiutoria mortuorum: impleant ergò homines ista erga suos postremi mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris officia:</hi> The pompe of funerals, the rites and solemnities of buriall, are comfortes of the liuing, no helpe to the dead: let men therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme this last duetie to their friends, <hi>De verb. Apost. serm. 34.</hi> But prayer and supplication pertaineth to the rite of buriall: <hi>ergo,</hi> it auaileth not the dead. And if the honest buriall of our friendes be the last duetie wee owe vnto them, the duetie of praying for them afterward is cut off. But whatsoeuer some auncient writers thought of this point, wee do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther credite the Apostles wordes, who saith, That euerie man shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue according to the things done in his bodie, <hi>2. Corinth. 5. 10.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in vaine to praye for the dead, seeing they cannot vndoe that which was done in their flesh, or do what was left vndone. If <hi>Aerius</hi> then held no woorse opinion than this, wee see no cause, why they shoulde condemne him for an heretike.</p>
                  <p>12 Now followe the heresies of <hi>Iouinian,</hi> which the Iesuite with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> mouth casteth vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>The first of <hi>Iouinians</hi> heresies was this: Hee affirmed, that a man once endued with faith, can no more sinne: And so <hi>Caluin</hi> (saith hee) affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that faith once had cannot be lost.</p>
                  <p>Ans. First, who seeth not the Iesuites bad dealing: as though it were all one to saie, The faithfull cannot sinne, (which <hi>Iouiuian</hi> affirmed, but wee instantly denie) and to holde, that the faithfull cannot loose their faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that true faith, whereby wee are iustified, once graft in a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20647:51"/>
faithfull mans heart, cannot be lost, and vtterly extinguished, though it may sometime be hid, and lie as it were a sleepe. Wee learne out of the Scripture, <hi>The giftes and calling of God are without repentance, Rom. 11. 29. Whome Christ loueth, he loueth to the ende, Iohn. 13. 1. Augustine</hi> also saith, <hi>Horum fides, quae per dilectionem operatur, profectò, aut omnino non deficit, aut siqui sunt, quorum deficit, reparatur, antequam vita ista siniatur:</hi> Their faith, which worketh by loue, either faileth not at all, or if it doe, it is repaired before their life be ended, <hi>de correption. &amp; grat. cap. 7. Bernard</hi> also saith, <hi>Iustus quis est? nisi qui amanti se deo, vicem rependit amoris; quod non fit, nisi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelante spiritu per fidem homini aeternum Dei propositum super sua salute futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi> Who is a iust man? but he, who seeing God to loue him, loueth again; which cannot be, but by the spirite reuealing by faith vnto a man the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall purpose of God concerning his saluation to come, <hi>epist. 108.</hi> By faith then a man commeth to knowe his election: but his election can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change, therefore neither can that faith in him bee lost, by meane whereof he knoweth his election. The second heresie of <hi>Iouinian</hi> was, that he affirmed fasting not to be meritorious. Ans. A monstrous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie sure: let <hi>Augustine</hi> then the heretique speake, <hi>Dona sua coronat Deus, non merita tua:</hi> God crowneth his owne giftes, and not thy merites: <hi>De grat. &amp; liber. arbitr. cap. 6.</hi> And againe, <hi>Ita<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> vita bona Dei gratia est, &amp; vita aeterna, quae vitae bonae redditur, dei gratia est,</hi> A good life is the gift of God, and life eternall the reward of a good life, is the gift also of God, <hi>ibid. ca. 8.</hi> If life aeternall then be a gift of fauour, it is not of det, <hi>Rom. 4. 4.</hi> Where then is there any place for merite?</p>
                  <p>The third heresie of <hi>Iouinian,</hi> that hee should make the married state equall with virginitie, which he chargeth vs withall. Ans. True and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled virginitie wee preferre alwaies as the more noble and excellent gift in them to whom it is giuen. But wee doubt not to saie, that mariage is better in those that cannot containe. And generally, wee dare preferre the honest mariage of Christians, before the proude and fained virginitie of manie Monasticall votaries: As <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Melius est humile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugium, quàm superba virginitas:</hi> Lowly and humble mariage is better than proude and hautie virginitie, <hi>Psal. 99.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth heresie of <hi>Iouinian</hi> was, that <hi>Marie</hi> in the birth of Christ lost her virginitie: of this heresie the Iesuite accuseth <hi>Bucer,</hi> because hee saith, that Christ did open in the birth the wombe of his mother.</p>
                  <p>Ans. First, the Iesuite here playeth false plaie: for it is not all one, to saie, <hi>Marie</hi> lost her virginitie, and that holy ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e opened her wombe: the one <hi>Bucer</hi> affirmeth, the other he neuer thought. Secondly, and is this (I pray you) such an hereticall point in Popish diuinitie, that Christ opened his mothers wombe? whereas they are the flat wordes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist, <hi>Luke. 2. 23.</hi> where he sheweth, how Iesus was brought to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:20647:51"/>
to be presented vnto the Lorde, as it is written in the lawe of the Lord, <hi>Euerie man child, that first openeth the wombe, shall be called holy vnto the Lord:</hi> But how could this accordingly be verified of Christ, if he had not opened the wombe? <hi>Hierome</hi> also so writeth, <hi>clausas portas vuluae virginalis aperuit,</hi> Christ opened the closed passages of the virgins womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>Augustine</hi> seemeth so to say, speaking in the person of Christ, <hi>Ego vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am meo itineri praeparaui:</hi> and againe, <hi>Transitu meo illius non est corrupta vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitas:</hi> I prepared or made a way for my passage, and by my passing thorough, her virginitie was not corrupted, <hi>de 5. heresib. cap. 5.</hi> There was therefore a way made and prepared, and as it were laid open for Christ to passe thorough, which was no more an hinderance or losse to <hi>Maries</hi> virginitie, than that shee went with childe, and bare Christ in her wombe, till her monethes were expired: and thus much for <hi>Iouinians</hi> heresies.</p>
                  <p>13 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> chargeth vs with foure heresies of <hi>Uigilantius,</hi> as he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> them: but neither <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was an heretike, nor his opinions he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, nor yet condemned of the fathers. <hi>Hierome</hi> in deede was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him, betweene whome there was great contention: but <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> doth not count him among the number of heretikes.</p>
                  <p>1 The first paradox, or singular opinion of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Saints were not to be reuerenced or worshipped. Ans. If this be heresie, <hi>Augustine</hi> also was an heretike: <hi>Nec tamen nos martyrib.</hi> (saith he) <hi>templa, sacerdotia sacra aut sacrificia constituimus: quoniam non ipsi, sed Deus eorum, Deus nobis est, honoramus sanè memorias eorum, tanquam sanctorum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum:</hi> Neither do we set vp temples, priestes, or erect sacrifices to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, because, not they, but their God, is also our God: we do honour the remembrance of them, as of holy men, <hi>De ciuit. Dei, lib. 8. 27.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 The second opinion of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> obiected against vs, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Saints are not to be inuocated, or called vpon in prayer. Ans. This heresie is confirmed by the Scripture: <hi>Call vpon mee, in the day of trouble</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>Psal. 50. 15.</hi> God onely, and no other, is to be called vpon. Let <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> also go for an heretike, if this be heresie: <hi>Vni Deo, &amp; martyrum &amp; nostro sacrificium immolamus, ad quod sacrificium sicut homines Dei, quimun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in eius confessione vicerunt suo loco &amp; ordine nominantur, non tamen a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdote inuocantur:</hi> We do immolate or offer sacrifice vnto one only God, both of the Martyres &amp; ours, in the which sacrifice, they as holy men of God, that by their faithfull confession ouercame the world, are named in their place and order; but they are not by the Priest or Minister prayed vnto, <hi>de ciuitat. Dei. lib. 22. cap. 20.</hi> And what sacrifice <hi>Augustine</hi> meaneth, he sheweth els where, writing thus: <hi>Sipro suis peccatis humilitatis, &amp; mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationis, &amp; orationis sacrificium verè immolare non negligunt Deo suo, tales im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratores Christianos dicimus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oelices:</hi> If they do not neglect truely to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or offer vnto their God, the sacrifice of humilitie, sorrow, and prayer,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20647:52"/>

                  <p>4 <hi>Vigilantius</hi> fourth heresie, as it pleaseth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to call it, was, that it profited not a man to leaue all his riches, and to betake himselfe to a religious, that is, a Monasticall life: and the same, saith he, is defended by vs. Ans. Is not this a great heresie? As though it were an euil thing to be rich, or riches might not be well vsed. S. <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth not rich men cast away their riches; but that they do good, and be rich in good works, <hi>1. Timoth. 6. 18.</hi> So saith <hi>Augustine, Diuitiae seculares, si desunt, non per opera mala quaerantur in mundo: si autem adsunt, per opera bona seruentur in coelo:</hi> Worldly riches, if they be wanting, do not seeke them by euill doing, in the worlde: and if thou haue them, by good workes, lay them vp in store in heauen, <hi>epistol. 1. epistolar. 21.</hi> And againe, speaking of <hi>Lazarus</hi> he saith, <hi>Non est in hoc Lazaro meritum paupertatis, sedpietatis:</hi> There was not in <hi>Lazarus</hi> any merite or worth of pouertie, but of godlines, <hi>in Psal. 51.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14 In the next place, the Iesuite laboureth by his cunning to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> vs with the heresies of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> but he speedeth no better here, than he did in the rest.</p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresie is, they denied that there remained any ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne in the faithfull. Of this heresie, the Iesuite falsely accuseth <hi>Bucer, Zwinglius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caluin.</hi> Ans. First, the Papistes themselues rather are guiltie of this heresie, who affirme, that concupiscence in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is no sinne, nor against the commaundement, <hi>Rhemist. annot. Rom. 6. 8</hi> What is this els, but to take away originall sinne cleane? which if it be at all, must of necessitie be sin. Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did not here remember
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20647:52"/>
that olde saying, <hi>Mendacem oportet esse memorem:</hi> a lyer had neede to haue a good memorie: for a little before, <hi>Haeres. 5.</hi> he accuseth the Protestants, as if they should affirme, that sinne, euen in the regenerate, raigneth, and is aliue: but here he casteth vpon vs the cleane contrarie opinion, that wee should holde, no originall sinne at all to remaine in the faithful. See, so well the Iesuite agreeth with himselfe. Thirdly, Our opinion then concerning originall sinne is this: that it neither ruleth in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nor yet is cleane extinguished; but as <hi>Augustine</hi> confesseth, <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscentia Lex peccati cum paruulis nascitur, in paruulis baptizatis a reatu sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitur, ad agonem relinquitur:</hi> Concupiscence the law of sinne commeth with children into the worlde, the guilt thereof is loosed in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, but yet it remaineth still, that wee may haue somewhat to striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.</p>
                  <p>The seconde heresie of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> was, that euerie sinne was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and worthie of death, which the Iesuite also saith is affirmed by vs.</p>
                  <p>Ans. First, <hi>Augustine,</hi> in none of his large and learned treatises, which hee wrote against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> (with whose heresies hee was as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted as either <hi>Hierome,</hi> or any els) doth charge them with this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Secondly, And no maruell; for if this were a point of <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi> hee was a <hi>Pelagian</hi> himselfe, who thus writeth, <hi>Inexcusabilis est omnis peccator, vel reatu originis, vel additamento propriae voluntatis, siue qui nouit, siue qui ignorat: Quia &amp; ipsa ignorantia, in ijs, qui intelligere noluerunt, sine dubitatione peccatum est, in ijs, qui non potuerunt, paena peccati:</hi> Euerie sinner is left without excuse, either by the guilt of originall sinne, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of his owne will: whether hee that sinneth of knowledge or of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: for ignorance it selfe, in those, which refuse to vnderstande, is sinne without doubt, in those that can not, the punishment of sinne. <hi>Ergo in vtrisque,</hi> (saith hee) <hi>non est iusta excusatio, sed iusta damnatio:</hi> Therefore in both, there is no iust excuse, but iust damnation, <hi>Epistol. 105.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Augustine</hi> is of opinion, that euen the least sinnes, those which proceede of ignorance, are in themselues mortall, if God should deale with vs in the rigour of his iustice: As the Scripture testifieth, The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of sinne is death, <hi>Rom. 6. 23.</hi> which wordes are generally pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all sinne: Can it then be heresie in vs, to affirme by the worde of God, that all sinne is mortall?</p>
                  <p>15 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> accuseth <hi>Beza</hi> of <hi>Nestorianisme:</hi> that hee shoulde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> two persons or hypostases to be in Christ, which was the heresie of the <hi>Nestorians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ans. Whatsoeuer <hi>Beza</hi> hath thought or write in times past, as that there are two hypostaticall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> who should say, that Monasteries ought to be free from perpetual vowes, that the parties might at their choice goe backe from their vowes. So, saith he, doth <hi>Luther</hi> hold and the rest.</p>
                  <p>Ans. Is not this now a damnable heresie? As though it were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for those which haue rashly vowed, and aboue their strength, euen by the rules of the Gospel, to be sorie for their rashnes: and feeling their owne weaknesse, to desire to be loosed from their vow, and to take heed, that they do no more presume beyond their strength: As if a man hath foolishly vowed to liue a single life, and afterward is inflamed with lust, and seeth he cannot containe, the Apostle giueth him leaue to marrie, To auoide fornication, let euery man haue his wife, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 7. 2.

The other of those, who should say, that the Eucharist was a figure onely of the bodie of Christ: and both these heresies, as he calleth them, are, saith he, maintained by vs.</p>
                  <p>Ans. First, wee do not say, that the Eucharist is a bare signe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, but that Christ is verily present with all the benefites of his death to the faithfull, and worthie receiuer. Secondly, yet wee vtterly denie, that the same flesh which Christ tooke of his mother, which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon the crosse, and where withall hee ascended vp into heauen, is now really, substantially, and carnally present in the sacrament at all, much lesse that it remaineth there afterward.

Their mouthes wee cannot stoppe, yet prooues they neuer shall haue any against vs.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as wee see, the Iesuite hath almost runne himselfe out of breath, in following vs with open crie of heresie: might and maine hath hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to charge vs with twentie heresies: but hee hath tolde as manie vntruthes, and lies. Let any indifferent man now consider, how the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite hath paltred with vs.</p>
                  <p>First, he obiecteth those heresies, which we our selues condemne, &amp; that they know, as the heresies of <hi>Seruet. haeres.</hi> 7. and of <hi>Swinkfeld. haeres.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he forceth those heresies vpon vs, which doe with better right rec oyle vpon themselues, as <hi>haeres.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he slaundereth vs with those opinions which we holde not, as <hi>Luther, haeres.</hi> 4. <hi>Caluine &amp; Bucer, haeres.</hi> 14. <hi>Beza, haeres.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he calleth those heresies, which we doubt not to defende, as Catholike opinions, howsoeuer they displeased some of the olde writers: Such is that of <hi>Aerius,</hi> that prayer is not to be made for the dead, <hi>haeres.</hi> 11. And that of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> that the reliques of Saints are not to be adored, nor themselues to be prayed vnto, <hi>haeres.</hi> 13. All the rest for the most part, which the Iesuite calleth heresies, are by <hi>Augustine</hi> defended &amp; maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his works: As therfore <hi>Hierome</hi> said to <hi>Augustine, epist.</hi> 11. <hi>inter epist. Aug. Si me reprehendis errantem, patere me quaeso, quasi errare cum talibus.</hi> If you reprehend me for my error, giue me leaue to erre with such notable men: After hee had alledged diuers auncient writers of his opinion: So if wee were in some errour, as wee are not, neither shall the Iesuite euer prooue it against vs, hee might somewhat beare with vs, because wee erre and are deceiued with <hi>Augustine.</hi> Although in deede, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> aunswereth <hi>Hierome: Puto, quia cum his errare nec te ipse patieris:</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:20647:56"/>
I thinke you would not willingly your selfe erre, no not with these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men, <hi>epist.</hi> 19. So neither will wee with <hi>Augustine, Hierome,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willingly (by Gods grace) maintaine any error, much lesse heresie.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I trust, we haue for this time, and for our purposed breuitie, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aunswered the Iesuite: hee hath hitherto but spent his breath, &amp; laide his nettes in vaine. The pitte of heresie, which they digged for vs, them selues (as it shall now appeare) are fallen into: Wee will therefore, seeing the Iesuite hath first prouoked vs to this cumbate, a little requite his kindnes, and bestowe vpon him and his fellowes a full scoace of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, not deuised or imagined by vs, but such as were condemned by the fathers of the Church for heresies, and are nowe either in part, or in whole maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And herein I will rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Augustine,</hi> than either <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or <hi>Philoster,</hi> to whom the Iesuite seemeth to be more addicted: for <hi>Augustine</hi> hath written more exactly, and with better iudgement of this argument than either of them.

So it was concluded in the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, that the image of God is to be adored with the same worship that is due vnto God, which idolatrous decree is defended by <hi>Thom. Aquinas, Bonauenture, Caietanus. Bellarmine</hi> also alloweth censing and burning of odors before images, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de sanctor. beatitud. cap.</hi> 13. which is a part of diuine worship: for therefore <hi>Hesekiah</hi> brake downe the brasen serpent, because the people burned incense vnto it, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the heretikes called <hi>Heracleonitae,</hi> did after a new sort purge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and redeeme their dead, by anointing them with oyle &amp; balme, <hi>haeres.</hi> 16. So the Papists haue excogitate a sacrament of extreme vnction, wherein they annoint their sicke with oyle for remission of their sinnes, their eyes, their nostrels, eares, mouth, hands, reynes &amp; feete: of this popish custome of aneeling, see the <hi>Rhemist. annot. Galath.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the heretikes called <hi>Caiani,</hi> did highly extol <hi>Iudas,</hi> as a diuine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and holy man, and they counted his wicked act in betraying of Christ, for a singular benefite, <hi>August. haeres.</hi> 18. So some of the Papists haue written, <hi>Iudaei mortaliter peccassent, nisi Christum crucifixissent:</hi> the Iewes had sinned mortally, if they had not crucified Christ, <hi>distinct.</hi> 13. look before <hi>Blas.</hi> 59.</p>
                  <p>4 The heretiks called <hi>Taciani,</hi> did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demn mariages, &amp; made no better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> account of them, than of fornication, neither do they receiue any maried

person into their order, <hi>haeres.</hi> 24. That the Papistes are not farre off from this heresie, it appeareth both by their doctrine and practise: First, for their doctrine, thus they write, That the order of the Priesthood is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by mariage, <hi>Greg. Martin, discou. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. Whereas the Apostle saith, Mariage is honourable amongst all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. The <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistes</hi> also are not a whit ashamed to say; that the mariage of Priestes is the woorst sort of incontinencie, <hi>Annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. Pope <hi>Siricius, epist. ad Himerium. Taraconens.</hi> applyeth that saying in the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst marriage: <hi>Qui in carne sunt, Deo placere non possunt:</hi> They that are in the flesh, cannot please God. Now, as their doctrine is, so is their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: whereby they do not onely make fornication equall to mariage, but euen preferre it. It was one of the greeuances of the <hi>Germanes,</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to Cardinall <hi>Campeius:</hi> that the Bishops and their Officials, did not onely suffer Priestes for their money to haue Concubines, but compelled continent and chaste Priestes to pay their tribute to the Bishop, and so it might be lawfull for them to liue chaste, or keepe Concubines, <hi>Fox, pag.</hi> 862. But honest mariage in Ministers, they punished with death: as <hi>anno</hi> 1525. <hi>Petr. Sponglerus</hi> was condemned to die for no other cause, but that hee had married a wife, <hi>ex Oecolampad.</hi> Thus it is manifest, both by the doctrine and practise of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they do not only with these heretikes, match fornication, and honest mariage together, but giue it the preferment before mariage.</p>
                  <p>5 The <hi>Cataphriges</hi> did make or mingle their Eucharist with the bloud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of children, <hi>haeres.</hi> 26. The Papistes much like vnto them, haue shewed the people in the sacrament the bloud of Duckes and Pigeons, making the people beleeue, that it was the bloud of Christ: as here in Englande, the bloud of <hi>Hales,</hi> which men from all partes of the lande came in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage vnto many yeares, taking it to bee the bloud of Christ, was in the ende found to be but the bloud of a Drake, and openly shewed at Paules crosse by the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> the King himselfe being present, <hi>Fox.</hi> 1188.</p>
                  <p>6 The <hi>Pepuzians</hi> allow women to be priestes, <hi>haeres.</hi> 27.

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:20647:57"/>8 The heretikes (<hi>Angelici</hi>) were so called because they worshipped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the Angels, <hi>haeres.</hi> 39. which sect <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) thought to be worne out and extinguished. But if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> were now aliue, hee should see this heresie reuiued by the Papistes: for they doe maintaine the worship and adoration of Angels, <hi>Rhemist. Apocal. 3.

                  <p>9 The heretikes called <hi>Apostolici,</hi> did not receiue into their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> those that had wiues, or proper possessions, <hi>haeres.</hi> 46.</p>
                  <p>10 The <hi>Hierachites</hi> did receiue onely Monkes and Nunnes to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> societie, <hi>haeres.</hi> 47. Papistrie sauoureth strongly of these heresies: for professed Monkes are with them the deuoutest men, how impure soeuer their life be: in so much, that the profession of Monkerie hath obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them the name of religion: the rest that liue in the world, they call <hi>seculares &amp; mundanos,</hi> secular men, and of the world. The <hi>Rhemistes</hi> affirme, that Monkes come neerest to the imitation of Christ, 1. <hi>Thessal. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6. That maried priestes cannot conueniently be occupied about prayer, or the Sacraments, but ought to abstaine from all matrimoniall actes, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 5. contrarie to the Councell of <hi>Gangra, cap.</hi> 4. where it was decreed, that if any man make difference of a married priest, &amp; by occasion thereof refraine from his oblation, should be accursed. Lastly, the <hi>Apostolici,</hi> would in no wise suffer those, which had vowed single life, afterward to marrie, though they found themselues vnable to keepe their vow, <hi>Epiphan. haeres.</hi> 61.

                  <p>11 The <hi>Euchites</hi> did nothing els but pray, &amp; helde, that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> for Monks to labour with their handes for the sustenance of their life, <hi>haeres.</hi> 57. The Papists encline to both those heresies: for first, what els do their Monks &amp; Nunnes, but mumble vpon their beads a certaine stint of praiers in the Latine tongue, which most of them vnderstand not, at all times &amp; houres almost both of day &amp; night: as they haue their Nocturns, &amp; Primes, their morning, euening, midnight seruice: their third, sixt, and ninth houres, <hi>Rhemist. annot. act.</hi> 10. <hi>sect.</hi> 6. Secondly, we see, that most of the Cell-birds, both cockes &amp; hennes, Monkes &amp; Nunnes, I would say, do liue idlie: and they beare them out in it: for religious men (say our <hi>Rhemistes</hi>) such as they count their Masse-munging Monkes to be, are not bound to worke, <hi>annot,</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>12 There is another heresie, saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> or sect, that walketh with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> bare feete, because God said to <hi>Moses,</hi> put off thy shooes, <hi>haeres.</hi> 68.

                  </p>
                  <p>13 The <hi>Priscillianistes</hi> did make the Apocrypha, that is, bookes not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> canonical, of equal authoritie with scripture, <hi>Haeres.</hi> 70. So do the papists:

                     </note> scripture saith, it was done by Gods hand &amp; counsell, which is more then permission: and so indeed God did not onely permit, but vse the malice of the Iewes most holily and most iustly to bring his purpose to effect. The Rhemistes also affirme, that sinne standeth not with Gods will, intention nor honor, <hi>Annot. Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4. True it is, that sinne is against the reuealed will of God in his worde, but nothing can come to passe against the secret wil &amp; determination of God: Neither is God the author of sinne, which proceedeth from mans owne corruption, but as it is a demonstration of his iustice in the punishment thereof, as Augustine saith: <hi>Creat Deus mala poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas iustissimas irrogando.</hi> God createth euil, by inflicting of most iust punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Haeres.</hi> 66.

The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinaristes</hi> also affirmed, that Christ tooke humane flesh without a soule. <hi>August. Haeres.</hi> 55. I pray you how far are the papists from this heresie? who affirme, that Christ suffered not in soule: Nay the Rhemists hold it to be a blasphemous assertion so to say, <hi>Annot. Hebr.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. What is it else, but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20647:58"/>
eyther with <hi>Marcus</hi> to say, that Christ suffered but in shew, and that hee felt nothing in soule, when hee cryed out vpon the Crosse, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? (for if there were no such matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Christ must haue vttered these wordes onely in outward shew and pretense) Or else they must fall into the Apollinaristes heresie: for why did Christ take vppon him our flesh and soule, but to redeeme man that was lost, both in body and soule? And therefore hee must needs haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered both in bodie and soule: for if there were no vse of the humane soule in the worke of our redemption, you might as well say with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinaristes, that <hi>Christ had no soule at all:</hi> Thus <hi>Augustine</hi> reasoneth: <hi>si to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus homo perijt, totus beneficio saluatoris indiguit: si totus beneficio saluatoris indigebat, totum Christus veniendo saluauit. Cont. Felician. ca.</hi> 13. If the whole man both body and soule were lost, hee wholy had need of a Sauiour: &amp; if hee wholy needed a Sauiour, Christ by his comming did wholly saue him: <hi>Ergo</hi> it followeth, that Christ must wholly haue dyed and suffered in body and soule to redeeme man (for our redemption was wrought by his death) that was lost in body and soule.</p>
                  <p>17 The <hi>Anthropomorphits</hi> did imagine, that God was in shape and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> proportion like a man, <hi>Haeres.</hi> 50.

                  <p>18 The heretikes <hi>Seleuciani,</hi> or <hi>Hermiani,</hi> denied that Christ did sit at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> the right hand of God in his flesh, but that hee had left or put off his flesh, and placed it in the Sunne. <hi>Haeres.</hi> 59. The papistes now, though in words they affirme not this, yet by a necessary sequele of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they must leaue Christ without his flesh in heauen, as often, as they would haue it present in the masse: for it seemed an absurd thing euen to those grosse heretikes, that the body of Christ should bee in many places at once: for if they had knowen the shiftes, which papistes now haue found out, to establish their Reall presence, who doubt not to say, that the body of Christ may bee in many places: to place Christes flesh in the Sunne, they needed not to haue remooued it out of heauen: They might haue said he was in both places at once. Yet here in the <hi>Seleuciani</hi> seeme to be more reasonable then papists, that they haue prouided so glorious a place for the body of Christ, euen the beautifull tabernacle of the Sunne: but the other thrust the flesh of Christ into a narrow roome, &amp; bring him within the compasse of a thin cake, or put him into a boxe, and housse him in their bellies, yea send his bodie to a viler place then so, euen to the draught, where their bellies are purged, as some of them haue beene driuen to graunt: But that the flesh of Christ cannot bee in many places at once, <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus vppon those wordes in the Gospell, <hi>What if you see the Sonne of man ascending where hee was before?

What is this else, but that his free will is made more free, and that grace helpeth him not wholly to worke, but more easely onely? Thirdly the Pelagians holde: <hi>Gratiam Dei non ad singulos actus dari:</hi> That the grace of God is not needefull to be giuen at euery assay, but that their free will in most thinges is sufficient: <hi>August.

                  <p>21 The Manichees condemned the eating of flesh as beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> and impure: <hi>Haeres.</hi> 46. So the papistes at certaine times forbid the eating of flesh. And heerein perhaps they differ from the Manichees, They held that flesh was vncleane by creation, the papistes by reason of the curse: for God cursed the earth, and not the waters, say they: and therefore vpon fasting daies fishe is preferred before flesh. <hi>Durand. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap. de alijs ieiunijs.</hi> So they both agree in this, that flesh is a thing vncleane and impure: for if they had not so thought, why did not the popish Bishop of London <hi>Stokesly</hi> rather suffer the pigge to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which was found in one <hi>Frebornes</hi> house in Lent time, his wife great with childe longing for a piece thereof, then commaund it as an vncleane thing to be buried in <hi>Finsburie</hi> fieldes, and so the good creature of God to be spilled and lost? <hi>Fox pag.</hi> 1585.</p>
                  <p>22 There was also another most blasphemous opinion of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:20647:59"/>
for they held, that the partes and members of Christ were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed euerie where, and that in their meates and drinkes, they did deliuer the members of Christ, which were tied and bounde in the creatures:<note place="margin">August in Psal. 104.</note> 
                     <hi>Tales,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine, sunt electi eorum, vt non sint saluandi a Deo, sed sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatores Dei, liberant enim membra Christi, cum manducant:</hi> The elect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them (for so they call their principals and ringleaders) are such, that they looke not themselues to be saued of God, but professe rather to be the sauiours and redeemers of God: for they doe set at libertie, as they imagine, the members of Christ in their daily eating. Compare now the opinion of the papistes with these heretikes: see if they be not cosen germanes: for as they made them selues, <hi>Saluatores Christi:</hi> The sauiours of Christ: so is it a saying among papistes, that, <hi>Sacerdos est creator crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris sui:</hi> That the priest doth make his maker, by fiue wordes speaking in the masse. But herein the papistes goe beyond the Manichees: for they deliuered the bodie and members of Christ from the prison of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and sent them vp to heauen: but the papistes bring them down from heauen, and close them in the creature vnder the shape of breade and wine.</p>
                  <p>23 Lastly there was a notable heretike one <hi>Rhetorius,</hi> who affirmed, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> all other heretikes did, <hi>Rectè ambulare:</hi> Walke the right way, and holde the trueth. <hi>Haeres. 72.</hi> But this seemeth so absurd a thing to <hi>Augustine,</hi> that he doth not giue credit vnto it: Who if he were now aliue, woulde not thinke it so incredible a thing: for excepting those heresies, which haue beene raised concerning the natures of Christ, &amp; his person (where notwithstanding the papistes are not free from error) what heresie hath there bene held about the officies of Christ, his kingdome, priesthoode and propheticall office, which is not this day, either in whole or in part, maintained by the Church of Rome? as it may partly appeare by that which we haue said alreadie.</p>
                  <p>And thus, I thinke, we haue in some measure recompensed our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries courteous dealing, who so kindly vpbraid vs with heresie: Let all the world now iudge who are neerest cosens to heretikes, they or we.

The papistes being further vrged, that if the pope were aboue councels, there shoulde bee no waye to resist a wicked pope. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aunswereth like a Clerke, that there is no other remedie left in such a case, but to pray to God, who will eyther conuerte or confounde such a pope. <hi>Lib. 2. de Concil. cap. 19.</hi> An answere as absurde, as the opinion is: for by this meanes the Church shall runne into ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and decay, when it is in mens power to helpe it, which is nothing else but to tempt God, then to depend of his extraordinarie worke, when he hath appointed an ordinarie meane of redresse.</p>

                     <hi>simplex repraesentatio,</hi> a simple &amp; plaine representation, and that is in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Eucharist: and there is <hi>repraesentatio ad viuum,</hi> a full and liuely representation of Christ, &amp; that is vpon good Friday, when Christs death is set foorth by diuers gestures, actions, instruments, copes and vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. <hi>Bellarm. lib. 1. de Miss. cap. 1.</hi> But how absurde a thing this is, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may see: that the representation of Christes death in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, instituted of the Lord himselfe to be a shewing foorth of his death, should be but a plaine and simple representation: and the other deuised by man, being done without a Sacrament, should bee called a liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation: What is this else, but to set the spirit of God to schoole, as though a more liuely shewing foorth of Christes death could bee deuised by man, then was ordained by Christ?</p>
                  <p>It is not necessarie (they say) in euery Sacrament to haue a visible signe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> and therefore the wordes of absolution (which are audible, though not visible) may bee the externall signe in penance. <hi>Bellarm. lib. 1. de poenitent. cap. 11.</hi> See what an absurde saying this is: for by this reason the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word may be a sacrament, because there is an audible sound.</p>
                  <p>Likewise in the Popish Sacrament of matrimonie, the Iesuite maketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> the parties contracted, both the matter of matrimonie, and the Ministers, and the forme to be these words: <hi>I take thee &amp;c. Bellarm. de matrim. cap. 6.</hi> Here are two great absurdities: for first the preachers &amp; Ministers of the word only are the dispensers of the mysteries &amp; sacraments of the Church, 1. <hi>Cor. 4. 1.</hi> therfore the parties themselues cannot be the ministers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, which they say is a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Secondly it is not euery word that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20647:62"/>
sanctifieth but the word of God. <hi>1. Timoth. 4. 5.</hi> but these wordes, <hi>I take thee, &amp;c.</hi> are no part of the word, therefore they haue no power to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie.</p>
                  <p>The Rhemistes holde opinion, that <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> doe yet liue in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> their bodies in Paradise: <hi>Apocal. 11. sect. 4.</hi> But paradise is nowe no other place but heauen, <hi>1. Corinth. 12. 2. 4.</hi> But there (they say) <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> are not, for they shal come againe in their own persons (as they hold) and resist Antichrist, and in the end be stayne of him: but bodies once glorified in heauen, can no more die, neither are subiect to violence: If then they bee not in heauen, they are not in paradise, which is no other place but heauen. Let now any indifferent man iudge, how handsomely these things agree together.</p>
                  <p>That the Angels shall be are the signe of the Crosse before Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> to iudgement, <hi>Bellarm. de sanctis, lib. 2. ca. 28.</hi> This also is a phantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conceite of theirs, without any ground of Scripture, or anie good reason.</p>
                  <p>But of all other popish absurdities, these are most grosse and palpable, which they are driuen to confesse about their deuise of transubstantiation in the Eucharist.</p>
                  <p>First, they doe graunt, that the body of Christ may bee and is in many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> places at once locally and visiblie, that his flesh is at the same time in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and in earth in the Eucharist, <hi>Bellarm. de sacram. Eucharist. lib. 3. cap. 4.</hi> Yet the Angell sayth contrary, <hi>Hee is risen, for hee is not here. Math. 28. 6.</hi> Which had beene no good argument, if Christes bodie be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places at once.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they further affirme, that Christes body in heauen, and at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> same time in earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not sundry bodies, or diuers partes of one body, but one whole body, not deuided or discontinued from it selfe, <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi> Thus they make Christ a monstrous body, that can fill heauen, and earth, and indeed they in so saying, destroy his humanitie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they graunt that the body of Christ is in the Sacrament with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> all his partes and dimensions, hands, face, feete. <hi>Bellarm. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 7.</hi> But what an absurde and impossible thing is this, that the body of a man, as of three cubites in height, and hauing other dimensions answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the proportion and stature of an humane body, should bee inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a thinne wafer cake, such as they vse in their Eucharist, not a spanne in breadth, without destruction of the partes and dimensions of the bodie?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that one and the same body of Christ, in the same instant, may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> bee sayd to bee, <hi>Sursum, deorsum,</hi> Aboue and belowe, <hi>Remotum, propinquu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> Neare vnto the earth, and farre distant from it, that it may bee in motion in one place, and yet rest and bee at quiet in an other, as the soule in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20647:62"/>
body, as it is in the feete, is neere to the earth, as in the head, it is further off, <hi>Bellarm. de sacram. Eucharist. lib. 3. cap. 4.</hi> These are absurdities contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the rule of reason, that contradictorie speeches should in one instant be true of the same bodie or subiect. And what is heresie, if this bee not, to resemble and compare the fleshe of Christ to a soule or spirit, that as the soule is in the body in no certayne place, but euery-where, so the flesh of Christ should bee in the world? for this followeth of the Iesuites com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison betweene the soule of man, and the flesh of Christ.</p>
                  <p>5 <hi>Corpus Christi incipit esse in altari,</hi> (sayth <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>per conuersionem</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> 
                     <hi>panis in ipsum,</hi> The bodie of Christ beginneth to be in the altar by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion or turning of the bread into his body, <hi>Lib. 3. de sacram. cap. 4.</hi> What great blasphemie is this, to affirme that Christes fleshe is made of bread? for these are their owne wordes, that the bread is not <hi>annihilate,</hi> that is, turned into nothing, but into the body of Christ. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so confesseth, that Christes body in the Eucharist is made of bread, as the wine was of water by our Sauiour Christ, Iohn 2. But in that myracle it is certayne the water was the matter whereof the wine was made, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise Christ would not haue bid the seruauntes fill the water-pottes with water, if hee had purposed to create wine of nothing rather then to chaunge water into wine. <hi>Bellarm. de sacram. Eucharist. lib. 4. cap. 24.</hi> Thus Christ by popish diuinitie shall haue a breaden body.</p>
                  <p>6 That after the words of consecration, there remayne onely the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> of bread and wine, as their colour, taste, roundnesse and such like, the substances of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being changed: And so they confesse against the rule of nature and reason grounded vpon scripture, that accidentes haue a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and substance of their owne without a subiect, <hi>Harding defens. apolog. 305. pag.</hi> And it is the generall opinion of all papistes: So in their opinion there may bee the whitenesse, roundnesse and taste of bread, and yet no bread: the rednesse, tartnesse and other properties of wine, and yet no wine. If a man then should aske, what round or whyte or red thing is this? they can not say bread or wine, for there is none left: Neither will they say, that the body of Christ is eyther white or red, and thus are they dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to their shiftes. Whereupon some of their schoole-men haue sayde, <hi>Accidentia illa sunt in ae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re, tanquam in subiecto:</hi> The accidents are in the ayre as in their subiect, <hi>De consecrat. distinct. 2. Species, in glossa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7 They are the accidents of bread &amp; wine, which are eaten, &amp; chawen,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> or rent by the teeth, <hi>Bellarm. lib. 1. de sacram. Eucharist. cap. 11. respons. ad argum. 5.</hi> And which goe downe into the bellie, and nourish and feed the body, <hi>Harding defens. apolog. pag. 305.</hi> Thus by popish philosophie, the accidentes of wine make a man drunke, the accidentes of breade may feede a man and make him fatte, without eyther bread or wine.</p>
                  <p>8 That Christ would not haue the externall figures and shapes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:20647:63"/>
elementes chaunged, but remayne still, because man woulde abhorre to eate humane flesh in the proper shape, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de sacram. Eucharist. cap.</hi> 22. But what an absurde thing is this? as though Christ would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund any vnseemely thing, or contrarie to humanitie. And how could the Apostles commaunde the Gentiles to abstaine from strangled, and from blood: Actes 15. when as by their doctrine they did cate daily in their assemblies the raw flesh and blood of Christ?</p>
                  <p>9 If the consecrate host, as they cal it, chaunce to putrisie and corrupt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> or to be burnt with fire, or deuoured of a Mouse, or any other vermine by the negligence of the priest, they say, it ceaseth to bee the body of Christ, and that God in that verie instant supplyeth some other matter, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eucharist. cap.</hi> 24. <hi>ad argum.</hi> 6. Or else it returneth into the nature and substance of bread againe, as other papists affirme, <hi>Fox p.</hi> 496. So there is no lesse myracle wrought by occasion of the priestes negligence, then was before by the words of consecration. And it is not enough for God to worke miracles for men, but euen for Mise also: yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth vs very soberly, that all this is done, <hi>Sine miraculo,</hi> without a miracle: But how I pray you, can bread be turned into flesh, &amp; flesh againe into bread without a miracle?</p>

Is not this deepe diuinitie, and fit matter for the king and states of a land to busie their heades about? And had the countrey no neede to be reformed touching the doctrine of faith or maners, but all must be laide aside, and care onely taken for shauing of crownes?

               </p>
               <p>The superstitious dedication of their Churches they borrow from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> practise of the people vnder the law: as the Church was solemnely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in <hi>Salomons</hi> time, in <hi>Esra</hi> his daies, <hi>2.

And therefore Christian Churches ought to be dedicated in like sort, <hi>Bellarmine, de cultu sanctor. lib. 3. cap. 5.</hi> Whereas it is certaine, that the solemne dedication of the Iewish tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was a liuely resemblance of the dedication of the true tabernacle, which was the bodie of Christ, <hi>Heb. 8. 2. And of the newe and liuing way, dedicated vnto vs by the vayle, that is his flesh, Heb. 10. 20.</hi> And yet neuer did the Iewes vse halfe of those ceremonies (but such toyes none at all) in dedicating the temple, as papistes doe in hallowing of theirs: Such are the burning of tapers, picturing of Crosses vpon the walles, sprinkling of water, and of ashes vpon the pauiment, making of characters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Iewes themselues would blush to behold such things, <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi>

               <p>The adorning of their Churches, with Images, crosses, vestements, of siluer, gold, silke, precious stone, their gorgious and sumptuous buildings, warranted by the example of Salomons temple, which was beautifull both within and without, <hi>Bellarm. ibid. cap. 6.</hi> yet they might haue knowen this, that the beautie and glorie of the first house did shadow foorth vnto the Iewes the spirituall comelinesse and excellencie of the last house, that is, the Church of God vnder Christ. <hi>Haggeus. 2. 10.</hi> And so saith the Prophete <hi>Esay,</hi> speaking of the spirituall Temple: <hi>I will laye thy stones with the Carbuncle, and thy foundations with Saphirs. Chapter 54. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet we denie not, but that the externall Churches also of Christians,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20647:68"/>
ought to bee built, and adorned, with moderate cost after a decent and comely sort.</p>
               <p>The priestes in the lawe, were to iudge of leprous persons, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> their leprosie, <hi>Leuitic. 13. 14.</hi> Therefore Christians are nowe also bound to make particular confession and enumeration of their sins in the eares of the priestes, <hi>Bellarm. de poenitent. lib. 3. cap. 3.</hi> Yet the priestes were not to take knowledge of euery infirmitie or disease, but of this contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and infectious kinde: howe then can they hence conclude, that the knowledge of all sinnes both great and small belongeth to the priest? And who knoweth not, that herein the priesthood of the lawe, did decypher the priesthood of Christ, by whome our spirituall leprosies are discerned and cured?</p>
               <p>Nay they doe not content themselues with an apish imitation of Iewish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> ceremonies, but they also belie them, and father vpon them such thinges, as they neuer vsed: as that they pray for the dead, which it is certayne the Iewes to this day doe not, And whereas the fact of Iudas Machabae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us is commended for praying for the deade, <hi>2. Machab. 12. 44.</hi> It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee put into the storie by the author (whosoeuer hee was) of his owne: for Iosephus, who writte fiue bookes of those matters, and out of whose workes this storie seemeth to bee abridged, entreating of this place, maketh no mention at all of prayer for the dead. <hi>Lib. 3. cap. 19.</hi> And againe, in this place prayer is made for open Idolaters, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the practise of the popish Church, who deny prayer to be made for those which die in deadly sinne.</p>
               <p>In like manner they burthen the Iewes with authenticall vnwritten traditions besides scripture: Such they had none as wee haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Loc. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the papistes doe farre exceede the Church of the Iewes, in number of ceremonies, but in lightnesse and vanitie of such childish toies, the Iewes neuer came neere them, or were once like vnto them. We will<note place="margin">

Secondly, the priest signeth his eyes, eares, mouth, breast, forehead with the signe of the crosse, that all his senses thereby may be defended. Thirdly, hallowed salt is put into his mouth, that hee may be seasoned with wisedome, and keept from putrifying in sinne. Fourthly, the partie is annoynted with oyle in his breast, that he may be safe from euil suggestions; &amp; betweene the shoulders, which signifieth the receiuing of spiritual strength. Fifthly, he is anointed with the Chrisme in the toppe of the head, and therby is become a Christian: Sixtly, a white garment is put vpon him to be token his regeneration. Seuenthly, a vayle

                  <hi>the Angels which are in heauen, neither the sonne him-selfe saue the father:</hi> which words plainly shewe, that Christ as man onely, knoweth not the time of his comming to iudgement: They frame this aunswere, <hi>Non scit addicendum alijs:</hi> The sonne of man is said not to knowe it, that is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to others, but to keepe it secrete to himself, <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi> This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is verie insufficient: for as the sonne knoweth it not, so neither doe the Angels: if the sonne be said, not to know it to tel others, &amp; yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in himselfe: so likewise the Angels should know it to themselues, though not for others: but I thinke, they will not saye, that the houre of Christs comming is reuealed to the Angels. Againe, as the sonne is said not to know it, so the Father is said to know it, if the Sonne onely know it not, to reueale it to others, then the Father knoweth it, to the intent he should declare it to others: but neuer yet was it declared to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor euer shall, till Christ suddenly appeare in the cloudes.</p>

Secondly, <hi>Peters</hi> fault was, that he constrained the Gentiles to doc like the Iewes, v. 14. And by his example he caused the Iewes and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to dissemble: Is dissimulation then so small an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? or was it so light a fault, to constraine the Gentiles <hi>Iudaizare,</hi> to play the Iewes? or was <hi>Paul</hi> so vndiscreete, so sharply to reproue so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie an Apostle for so small a fault? Thirdly, And what doctrine is this, that a man may sinne, and not be guiltie of sinne? may do a fault, and not be faultie? as though sinnes committed ignorantly and vn wittingly, doe not bring a guilt with them; albeit not so great and heynous, as sinnes willingly done: For to what end els were sacrifices appointed in the law for sinnes of ignorance? <hi>Leuitic.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Where we alleadge the example of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that appealed vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>

Their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is, that there is not the like reason of Heathen and Christian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours: for vnto them, euen the chiefe Bishop was subiect in ciuile cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: But when Princes became Christians, they then were to submit themselues to the Pope, as sheepe to the shepheard, <hi>Bellarm. de Rom. Pontif. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. A worthie aunswere: as though the Gospell did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the lawful authoritie of Princes: for if it were the right of heathen Emperours to be supreme Iudges of all persons: (otherwise the Apostle would not voluntarily haue appealed to an vnlawful and vsurped power:) Much more may Christian Princes challenge the same right. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aunswere, that <hi>Caesar</hi> had this power by vsurpation: for the Apostle was not compelled thereunto, but made free choyce of <hi>Caesar</hi> to be his Iudge.</p>
               <p>To proue that it is not lawful nor conuenient for one &amp; the same man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> to be both an Ecclesiasticall &amp; temporal Prince: We bring forth these &amp; such like places of Scripture, <hi>It is not meete we should leaue the worde of God</hi>

Now it is most plaine and euident, that the charge and care of ciuil gouernement, are as great, nay a greater distraction of the minde, than the executing of smaller and baser offices, and require greater studie and industrie, and therefore do as well, nay much rather hinder and let the progresse of spirituall matters. And yet further to shewe what a friuolous and feeble aunswere they haue made, our Sauiour Christ saith, to put all out of doubt, <hi>Who made mee a iudge, or deuider ouer you?

                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> to worship him, that Saints and holy men are not therefore to be adored with any religious worship: It is aunswered, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> did well, and as he ought, in worshipping <hi>Peter:</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> of modestie refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take it at his hands, <hi>Bellarmine, de sanct. lib. 1. cap. 14.</hi> Yea, but <hi>Peter</hi> rendereth a reason: For I am also a man, v. 26. insinuating, that such reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship belonged vnto God, not vnto man. If it be then a point of modestie onely for the creature to refuse that homage which is due to the creator, then was this modestie in <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there was and is, one and the selfe same substance both of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> of the olde Testament, and of ours, wee proue it by Saint <hi>Paules</hi> wordes, <hi>They all did eate of the same spirituall meate, and did all drink the same spirituall drinke, 1. Corinth. 10. 4.</hi> Answere is made, that they did eate and drinke the same spirituall meate and drinke amongst themselues, not the same with vs, <hi>Bellarmine de Sacram. lib. 2. cap. 17.</hi> which is but a vaine shift: for the Apostle addeth, <hi>They dranke of the spirituall rocke that followed them, and the rocke was Christ, v. 4.</hi> Now Christ is the same spirituall rocke both vnto vs, and vnto them: not vnto them onely among themselues, or to vs onely, but both vnto them and vnto vs.</p>
               <p>That the baptisme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the baptisme of Christ, was one and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> same in substance, and of the same efficacie and force, we proue it thus: <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme was the baptisme of repentance for remission of sinnes: <hi>Luk. 3. 3.</hi> So also was the baptisme of Christ: <hi>repent and be baptized euerie</hi>

                  <hi>one of you, in the name of Iesus Christ, for the remission of sinnes: Act. 2. 38, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> there was the same fruite and effect of each baptisme. They doe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vs thus, No sayth the Iesuite, there is not the like reason of both, for repentance went before Christes baptisme as a necessarie preparation thereunto, but it followed Iohns Baptisme, as an effect thereof: <hi>Bellarm. de baptis. lib. 1. cap. 23.</hi> This answere is too vayne and friuolous, for in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are two things, the purpose of hart, <hi>Act. 11. 23.</hi> and the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, which consisteth in beeing buried and dead vnto sinne, and rising vp to the newnesse of life, <hi>Rom. 6. 4.</hi> This purpose and vow of heart with confession of sinnes, went as well before Iohns baptisme as Christes: for the people first came and confessed their sins, and then were baptized of Iohn: <hi>Math. 3. 6. Luke 3. 12.</hi> And as for amendement of life, which is the accomplishment and fruites of repentaunce, it neither went before Iohns baptisme, nor Christes: not Iohns by their owne confession, not Christs: for in the same instant, that the Apostle said, <hi>Repent &amp; be baptized: Act. 2.</hi> They were baptized, so that the time serued them not to shew the fruites of repentance, and by baptisme wee are buried vnto sinne, and raysed vp to newnesse of life, <hi>Rom. 6. 4.</hi> But the fruites and efficacie of baptisme goeth not before, but followeth after, thus the vanitie of their answeare is vanished and blowen away.</p>
               <p>Whereas wee obiect that saying of Christ, <hi>Except yee eate my fleshe, and</hi>

                  <hi>drinke my blood, yee haue no life in you, Iohn 6. 53.</hi> That it can not bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Eucharist, as our aduersaries doe expound all such places in that chapter, for then no man could be saued without this sacrament, which were an absurde and hard saying: And so both infantes, which are not fit to receyue it, and all such, as are preuented by some remedilesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, should be cut off from the hope of saluation. They answere thus: first, that the place is to bee vnderstood onely of those that are <hi>Adulti,</hi> of yeares of discretion, not of infantes. And agayne, all men are bound ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to communicate, <hi>reipsa, aut desiderio,</hi> either in verie deade, or else in vowe and desire, <hi>Bellarm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de sacram. Eucharist. lib. 1. cap. 7. resp. ad argum. 3.</hi> This answere is like vnto the rest, verie insufficient, and may bee turned vppon themselues, for whereas they vrge the necessitie of baptisme out of these words of our Sauiour, <hi>Except a man bee borne of water and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, he cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen, Iohn 3. 5.</hi> May it not aswell bee answered that children also are excluded here, as in the other place? for the words are in both places generallie spoken without exception. Agayne, Christ sayth, except yee eate: if this may be done in vow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, that is spiritually, which wee affirme and graunt, then is it not meant of the sacramentall eating onely, as the Papistes beare vs in hande, and so they are contrary to themselues: Lastly, if it bee necessarie to receiue the Eucharist eyther actually and indeede, or in vow and desire (which is most
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20647:72"/>
true) There is the like necessitie thereof, as of baptisme: For the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistes</hi> confesse as much, that they <hi>before God are accepted as baptized that depart this life with vowe and desire to haue this sacrament, but by some reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles necessitie could not obtaine it, Annot. Iohn. 3. Sect. 2.</hi> Thus baptisme by their owne confession is prooued to be no more necessarie than the other Sacrament: and so are they taken with their owne wiles.</p>
               <p>Against the reall presence in the Eucharist, amongst other arguments,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> wee do bring foorth this: S. <hi>Paul</hi> in diuers places calleth the Sacrament bread after consecration: as <hi>1. Corinth. 10. 16. The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</hi> And <hi>chap. 11. 26. As often as ye shall eate this bread, &amp; drinke this cup, ye shewe the Lords death till hee come.</hi> The Apostle calleth it bread, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is bread, not the bodie, flesh or bloud of Christ. To this argument, they make vs this aunswere: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calleth it bread, because it was bread before, or because it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be bread, not that it is bread, <hi>Bellarm. de Eucharist. lib. 1. cap. 14. res. ad loc. 13.</hi> Yea, but the Apostle maketh mention together both of the bread and cup: If it be called bread, because of the appearance onely; then by the like reason so is the cup: and as there is no bread in deede, so there shalbe no cup. Againe, saith hee, <hi>The bread which wee breake;</hi> but the shape or forme of bread cannot be broken, but the substance. Neither will they say, that Christes bodie is diuided or broken: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is true bread which the Apostle so calleth. Lastly, if they like this speech of the Apostle, that hee should call it bread after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to passe, that they are afraide to call it bread in the Canon of the Masse, but the bodie of Christ only? It should seem therfore by their practise, that they mislike the apostles phrase &amp; maner of speech.</p>
               <p>That the Eucharist ought to be ministred in both kindes, we confirme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> it out of that place, <hi>Iohn. 6. 53. Except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you:</hi> which our aduersaries expound of the Eucharist. Their answere is this: that here the coniunction or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, &amp;, and, must be taken after the phrase of Scripture, for the Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <hi>vel,</hi> either: as if the sense were this: except you either eate or drink, <hi>Bellarm. de Eucharist. lib. 4. cap. 25.</hi> By this reason, they make it a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, either to eate or to drinke, to doe any one of them: and so, as the people doe onely eate in the Sacrament amongst them, &amp; not drink; the contrarie custome also may be brought in, for the people to drinke onely, and not to eate, which I thinke they wil be loath to graunt.</p>
               <p>Againe, where they presse vs for the necessitie of baptisme with that place, <hi>Iohn. 3. 5. Except a man be borne of water and the Spirite:</hi> wee can aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them with their owne words: And in this place, &amp;, is taken for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>vel,</hi> as if it were said, Euery man must be borne either of water or of the spirit. Although we haue better answer, &amp; are not driuen to vse any
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20647:72"/>
such shift: yet thus they do make rods for themselues to be whipt withall.</p>
               <p>Whereas we thus reason, that the Eucharist ought to bee ministred in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> both kindes, because the death of Christ cannot otherwise be liuely she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed foorth, but both by eating and drinking in remembrance of Christ: The Iesuite boldly aunswereth, that a sufficient commemoration may be made by receiuing onely in one kinde, <hi>Bellarm. de Sacramen. Eucharist. lib. 4 cap. 27.</hi> cleane contrarie to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith: <hi>As often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye shewe the Lords death till he come, 1. Corin. 11. 26.</hi> To remember and shewe foorth the death of Christ, hee requireth receiuing in both kindes.</p>
               <p>That the marriage of Ministers, is authorized by the word of God, wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> proue out of S. <hi>Paul. 1. Timoth. 3. 11.</hi> who hauing first described the office of Bishops &amp; Pastors of the Church, and what maner of men they ought to be, commeth afterward to set foorth the qualities and conditions that should be in their wiues: <hi>That they should be honest, sober, and faithfull.</hi> The Iesuite here celleth vs, that the Apostle meaneth such, as had beene their wiues before they were ordained, <hi>lib. 1. de Clericis. cap. 20.</hi> Ans. I wil aske them then one question: Their former wiues maried before, did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce them afterward, or retaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If they renounced them, what need had the Apostle to be so carefull in setting downe rules and precepts for their wiues? for it was no more to them, how they demeaned themselues than other women. If they retained them in the name of their wiues, they either liued together, or apart: not apart, for the Apostle prescribeth an order for the Ministers house &amp; children, v. 4. But there is no reason that the mother should want the comfort of her children, though shee enioyd not the companie of her husband: It is therefore most like the mother li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with her children, and the children with their father: and where els then should their mother liue, but with their father? If then they liued in one house together, how then is shee not now his wife as freely, &amp; for all honest purposes and ends of mariage, as before? Who seeth not now, how weakely these things hang together?</p>

                  </gap>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> their calling to the Ministerie, as before, we shew it by these words of the Apostle: <hi>Haue we not power to lead about a sister awife? 1. Cor. 9. 5.</hi> Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, that it must be read thus, a <hi>sister</hi> a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for certain deuout wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folowed the Apostles, which ministred vnto them of their substance, <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. Annot. in hunc locum.</hi> Ans. But this were a superfluous speech, to say, a sister a woman, whereas it had been enough to say, sister, which word also expresseth the sexe. And seeing the Apostles had wiues of their own, it is an absurd thing to imagine, that they would choose rather to go in the companie of strange women, their owne wiues being more necessarie to attend on them, &amp; more fit for auoiding of offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:20647:73"/>That the hearing &amp; preaching of the word of God is a necessarie note <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> of the Church, we conclude out of our Sauiour Christs words: <hi>Iohn. 10. My sheepe heare my voice.

               <p>Christ said to <hi>Peter, dic Ecclesiae,</hi> Tel it to the Church, an obstinate sinner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> must be referred to the censure of the Church: <hi>Ergo, Peter</hi> &amp; his successors are not the supreame iudges: for here he is referred to the Church. <hi>Bellar.</hi> So the Pope doth, <hi>dicere Ecclesiae,</hi> tel it to the Church, <hi>id est, sibi ipsi,</hi> that is, he telleth it to himselfe, <hi>lib. de Concil. 2. ca. 19.</hi> Ans. Is not here good stuffe? the Pope is now become the whole Church: contrarie to the sense of this place: for in censuring of offendors wee must proceede by degrees: first one must rebuke him that sinneth, the 2 or 3. last of all it must be declared to the Church: so then, as two or three are more than one, so the Church is more than 2 or 3. But the Pope is not 2 nor 3, much lesse can hee stande for the whole Church.</p>
               <p>That the Apostles were al equal in authoritie, we shewe it out of Saint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/>

               <p>Whereas we reason thus against reliques: that therefore the Lord bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> the bodie of <hi>Moses,</hi> lest the <hi>Israelites</hi> should haue worshipped his bodie, and so committed Idolatrie. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> telleth vs, that men are not so prone to Idolatrie nowe as the Israelites were, and therefore may more safelie be admitted to worship reliques, <hi>de Reliqu.

                  <p>They are much troubled about this question, whether the Pope may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> deposed for heresie: <hi>Albert. Pighius</hi> holdeth, that the Pope cannot be an heretike, &amp; therefore not for any cause to be deposed: <hi>Iohannes de Turre cremat.</hi> is of opinion, that the Pope for secrete heresie, is actually deposed of God, &amp; may be by the Church declared to be so deposed. Others helde, that the Pope neither for manifest, nor secrete heresie, either is actually or may be deposed. <hi>Caietanus,</hi> that the Pope for manifest heresie is not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deposed, but may be deposed by the Church. There is a fifth opinion, that the Pope being a manifest heretike, doth cease of himself to be pope, &amp; that he may be iudged by the Church, &amp; yet they iudge not the Pope, for he is now no Pope, <hi>Iohan.

                  <p>Concerning the popes temporal iurisdiction, some of them teach, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> the pope by the worde of God, hath full &amp; plenarie power in all matters both Ecclesiastical &amp; ciuill, <hi>Augustin. Triumphus: Hostiensis.</hi> Others, that he hath not directly &amp; immediatly any temporal authoritie, but only spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: yet indirectly &amp; imediatly by reason of his spiritual power, he hath chiefe authoritie also in temporal matters. <hi>Sic Iohan.

                  <p>They are much busied about the Councel of the Iewes that condemned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Christ, whether it erred or not. Some hold, that the question was <hi>de facto, non de iure,</hi> not by what right Christ should be put to death, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted only of the fact, to put him to death, &amp; therefore in a matter of fact might erre. Others think that they erred in their own mind &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Christ, not in the sentence: for Christ was worthie of death bearing our sinnes. But <hi>Bellar.</hi> is of an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by himself; that the Councel did erre: for they were priuileged only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error before Christs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>li.</hi> 2. <hi>de Concil. ca.</hi> 8.

But others think, that he hath such an absolute authoritie, that he cannot submit himself to the sentence or censure of Councels though he would. So <hi>Antoninus. Iohan. de Turre cremat.

                     <hi>Iohannes de Turre cremat.</hi> saith, it is against the Catholike faith to affirm,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> that the faith of the Church did not only rest, or was preserued in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Marie</hi> in the passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ: <hi>Bellar.</hi> thinketh that faith was preserued as well in the Apostles, as in <hi>Marie,</hi> that theirs failed no more than hers, <hi>li.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccles. ca.</hi> 17. And herein the Iesuite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth nearest the truth: The Apostles faith was not lost, but greatly shaken, at the death of Christ, and they remained wauering &amp; doubtful, til they were by Christ (risen again) confirmed.</p>
                  <p>Some affirme, that the vow of continencie or single life is annexed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> priesthod, by the law of God, <hi>Iohan.

                  <p>Now concerning the sacraments. Some of them thinke that the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> definition of a sacrament, cannot agree vnto the sacraments both of the old and new testament, but improperly, <hi>Sic Magister sententiar. Albertus, Bonauenture.</hi> Others thinke, that this definition of a sacrament, <hi>est sacrae rei signum,</hi> It is a signe of an holy thing, may properly comprehende both the olde and new sacrament, because it is not of the essence of a sacrament to bee a cause of sanctification, but a signe onely. <hi>Sic. Thom. Dominicus a Soto, Martinus Ledesinius,</hi> and this is the truer opinion: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fully liketh neither, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de sacram. cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Nowe whether the sacramentes doe consist, <hi>ex verbis &amp; rebus,</hi> of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> wordes, and the things or elementes as their matter, &amp; forme, it is a great question among papistes. Some holde that they doe not: but that any thing sensible, whether it be the element, or the word, is the matter, and the fourme to bee the signification, <hi>Sic Dominicus a Soto, Caietanus.</hi> Others thinke that all Sacramentes consiste not of the worde and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but some onely: <hi>Sic Durandus.</hi> A thirde opinion is, that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20647:95"/>
the sacraments onely of the New Testament do consist of these parts, not the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the old, <hi>Sic alexand. Alensis:</hi> and others thinke, that al sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doe consist of these parts, either in themselues, or some what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead, or place of them: <hi>Sic dominicus a Soto. Bellarmine</hi> taketh somewhat from all these opinions, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de sacram. cap.</hi> 1 8. But to put the matter out of doubt, there must be in euery sacrament, both the word and element, the word sanctifieth, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. 5. and therefore must needs be there, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can serue insteed of it: there must be also an eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beside the word, to be sanctified, and therefore the word cannot be the element.</p>
                  <p>The Iesuites do hold, that the intention of the minister is necessarie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> make a sacrament: he must haue a purpose and intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Faciendi, quod facit ecclesia,</hi> to do that which the Church doth: that is to make a sacrament, <hi>Sic Bellar. cum alijs: Catharinus</hi> a papist saith, it is not necessary to haue such an intention, but that a sacrament may be without it: wherein he thinketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for the sacrament no more dependeth of the ministers intention, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preaching of the word doth.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the efficacie of the sacraments, they do all hold, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> are causes of sanctification, but not alike. Some holde that the minister is the efficient and working cause of iustification, the sacrament but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, <hi>Sic Caietanus, Sotus Ledesinius.</hi> Some contrariwise, that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the efficient cause, the Minister but the instrument: <hi>Ita Tho. Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, ex Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27. and of these there are two sorts, some thinke that the sacraments are but causes, <hi>Sine quibus non:</hi> without the which wee are not iustified, <hi>Sic Bonauentur. Scotus, Durandus.</hi> Others thinke that there is verily an effectuall power giuen to the sacraments to iustifie, <hi>Sic Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. What adoe is here about nothing, the sacramentes are no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall or efficient causes of our iustification, but seales onely of the righteousnes of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. And it is faith, whereby we are iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>As touching the sacraments of the law: some deny that they did iustifie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> 
                     <hi>ex opere operantis,</hi> that is by the faith, and deuotion of the receiuer: <hi>Sic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister:</hi> others thought they did. And for Circumcision, some held it did iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the very worke wrought: <hi>Sic Alexander, Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Scotus, Gabriel.</hi> Others were of opinion, that it did not iustifie of it self, but as it was a protestation and application of faith: <hi>Sic Tho.

                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Indeleble</hi> character, which they say is imprinted in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> soule by the sacramentes, and can neuer bee blotted out, <hi>Durandus</hi> sayth, it is no reall thing distinct from the soule, or any absolute qualitie, but a certayne respect, and relation onely: <hi>Scotus</hi> sayth, it can not bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

                  <p>Some papistes haue held opinion, that in baptisme it is sufficient to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> in the name of one of the persons in trinitie, and especially of Christ: <hi>Sic Hugo de S. Victor. Nicholaus papa. Bellarmine</hi> holdeth, as the trueth is, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme must be celebrated in the name of the whole Trinitie.</p>
                  <p>Some hold, that Martyrdome doth not giue grace, <hi>Nisi ex opere operantis,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> but according to the affection and disposition of the martyr: <hi>Sic Dominicus a Soto, Martinus Ledesinius.</hi> Others that it was auailable <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the verie worke wrought: <hi>Ita Thom.

And yet neither martyrdome, nor any worke else, can be the cause of grace.</p>
                  <p>Some hold that <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme was a sacrament of the new lawe, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> they which were baptized there with, and did not put their trust therein, but had knowledge of the holy Ghost, needed not to haue beene baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by Christ: <hi>Sic Petr.

The scripture putteth all out of doubt that saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized vnto repentance for remission of sinnes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. and so was in substance and effect one, and the same with the baptisme of Christ.</p>
                  <p>That Christ in the 6. of <hi>Iohn</hi> treateth not of the Eucharist: it is the opinion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> of many papistes, <hi>Gabriel, Cusanus, Caietanus, Tapper, Iausenius:</hi> wherein they say, as the trueth is.

                  <p>As touching the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, <hi>Durandus</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> that the substance of Christ is there without magnitude or quantitie. Others thinke that the bodie of Christ is there with the due quantity &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, but there is no distinction nor order of the partes: <hi>Sic Okam.</hi> But <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and the rest do thinke that the bodie of Christ is in the sacrament, in his due quantitie, and distinction and order of partes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de sacram.

                  <p>About the popish sacrament of extreame vnction arise these differences:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> They haue but two places of scripture vpon the which they grounde that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; Iames.</hi> 5.

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:20647:98"/>Some, that the whole sacrament doth not conferre grace, but absolution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="63"/> onely by the priest, <hi>Sic Thom.

                  <p>Some thinke that the act of penance, is but a disposition onely vnto remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="64"/> of sinnes, no merite at all whereby remission is deserued: <hi>Sic Iohan, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preolus, Dominicus a Soto.</hi> Others, that it is not a disposition onely vnto iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but a meriting cause thereof of congruitie, <hi>sic Albertus, Bonauent.

But the Iesuite is here grosly deceiued, for before iustification it is impossible to please God without faith: therefore there is no place for merite.</p>
                  <p>Some, that perfect contrition is not sufficient to attaine remission of sinnes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/> without the sacrament of penance, and absolution by the priest, but onely at the point of death: Others, that it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be truely contrite, if the partie haue a vow &amp; purpose afterward to receiue the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of penance: <hi>sic Bellar. cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alijs lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.

                  <p>Some hold, that men may satisfie God by their penal workes, both for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="66"/> fault, and for eternall punishment due thereunto, <hi>Sic Ruard, Tapper, Andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Vega.</hi> Others, that they can satisfie God for neither of these, but onely for temporall punishment, <hi>Sic Bellarm. cum Iesuitis. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.

                  </hi> maketh <hi>Clement</hi> the next to <hi>Peter: Optatus</hi> first nameth <hi>Linus,</hi> then <hi>Clement: Irenaeus</hi> after <hi>Peter</hi> placeth <hi>Linus,</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the fourth. Thus also their succession is made vncertaine and doubtfull.</p>
               <p>16 They hold Lent to be an Apostolical tradition &amp; warranted by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="126"/> the example of our Sauiour Christ: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> witnesseth, that some fasted one day, some two daies, some fortie howers day and night. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, the wednesdaies fast also was an Apostolike tradition, and to fast the six daies of Esther, with bread and water, and salt, which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes them selues obserue. One therefore is as like to be an apostolike tradition as the other: But it is certaine neither of them was, for then they would haue beene kept more vniformely of the Church: and not euery man left to his owne choice.</p>
               <p>17 It is a matter yet vndetermined and not concluded vpon of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="127"/> sides, whether the pope be aboue Councels, or Councels aboue the pope. And both opinions are maintained and defended in the popish Church.</p>
               <p>18 As also it is vncertaine among papistes, whether the <hi>Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="128"/> were conceiued without Original sinne, for both opinions are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and suffered among them, both of them that say she was, and that hold she was not, <hi>Bellarm. decultu sanctor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.

               <p>19 About and concerning purgatorie, they haue many doubtes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="129"/> which they are not yet resolued vpon: as, first in what place purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie should be. 2. How many yeares purgatorie continueth, whether an hundred, 200. or 1000. yeares. 3. Whether it be materiall fire, that burneth in purgatorie, they are vncertaine. 4. They make doubt how corporall fire should worke vpon the soules in purgatorie, which are spiritual and incorporal, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>depurgator. cap.</hi> 12. 5. It is doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether the deuils or Angels are ministers of the torments in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. 6. Whether the paine of purgatorie be at all time alike, or by litle &amp; litle slaked toward the end, and whether it exceed al the paines and sorrowes of this life, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 14. All these pointes remaine yet vndetermined among them: and yet for all this the Iesuite telleth vs sadly, that it is an article of faith to beleeue purgatorie, and that he which beleeueth it not, is sure to goe to hell, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:20647:105"/>20 Lastly, that wee may see at once the fraile and brittle foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="130"/> of popish Religion: the <hi>Rhemistes</hi> boldly affirme, that iustice is reputed to men, or that they are iustified by beleeuing onely the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Christes death and resurrection, and this they call the Catholike faith, <hi>Annot. Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>If this be Catholike faith, to beleeue onely the articles of faith to be true: then reprobates, yea and the diuell himselfe may bee true Catholikes, for the diuels beleeue and tremble, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 19: yea, they confesse Iesus to be the sonne of God, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. 7. Is not this a proper faith for Christians to saue themselues by? It is not then a bare knowledge or generall beleefe of the articles of faith, or giuing assent or credite vnto them only, that is sufficient to iustifie vs, as the <hi>Rhemistes</hi> affirme: but such a beleefe of these articles, as is ioyned with an assured trust and confidence in God, and vndoubted perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that all the promises of God, and whatsoeuer Christ wrought in his flesh, are not onely true, but euen do belong and appertaine to vs.</p>
               <p>Thus, I thinke, I haue requited <hi>Bellarmines</hi> kindnesse towardes vs, who chargeth vs with no lesse than an hundred seuerall dissensions in opinion amongst our selues: I haue here repayed him for his bare hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, sixe score to the hundred: and if that be not interest sufficient, he may haue more hereafter. And here againe is some oddes betweene vs: <hi>Bellarmines</hi> hundred is in worde onely, but our large hundred wee haue prooued, by particular induction. Now then, if wee will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the first and the last, and lay altogither, their railings, slaunders, forgeries, lying and vntruthes: Againe, their blasphemies, opinions contrarie to Scripture, heresies, &amp; absurdities: Thirdly, their weake and feeble arguments, insufficient aunswers, subtile and vaine distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Lastly, their contradictions among themselues, the new with the olde: the new one with another: the same men many times with themselues: yea, their religion fighteth and iarreth with it selfe: If those things be well weyghed and considered, it will easily appeare, whether their house be built vppon a sandie or a rockie foundation: Beggerlie, paltrie, wicked, yea, diuelish is that religion, which is uen to vse such lewd, vnhonest, and vnchristian deuises and shiftes.</p>
