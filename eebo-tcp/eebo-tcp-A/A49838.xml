            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Some Queſtions and Anſwers concerning Religion,</hi> AND THE WORSHIP OF GOD.</head>
            <p>THE only Living and Eternal God that made Heaven and Earth, and all Mankind, it is he that requireth Religion, Worſhip and Service, from all People, having given them a Gift and Underſtanding whereby to know and diſcern Good from Evil, and Right from Wrong: And ſeeing there are ſo many Religions, Profeſſions and Worſhips in the World, it is very neceſſary to know which is that True Religion and Worſhip the Lord hath a Regard unto, and doth Accept of.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>From whence comes, and what is, the true and ſound Religion and Worſhip?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The true and right Root, from whence ſound Religion ſprings and ariſes, is from that precious Incorruptible Seed, ſowen by Chriſt the good Seeds-Man in the Hearts of the Children of Men, whereby they are Renewed and Born again unto a firm Faith, and ſure ſtedfaſt Belief in God the Father, and in his Eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt for Life and for Salvation; and in this living and true Faith, we ſincerly ſerve, honour and obey God, in a holy Living with him in his Fear, and a daily waiting upon him, and a humble Walking before him, and reverend Worſhiping and Serving him in the Spirit and in the Truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is the difference between the true Religion and the falſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The true and ſound Religion having for its Ground and Foundation a pure Principle of Truth, which leads into all Truth in the Hearts and Conſciences of the Children of God, whereby they are acted, led and guided in the things of God, and in all there religious Services to God: Then the fruits and effects therefrom, is Meekneſs, Patience, Temperance, Love, Peace and Good-will unto all: And ſuch as are led and guided by this good Spirit, they are firm, and ſure, and ſtedfaſt in their Religion and Worſhip, and cannot forſake the Aſſembling themſelves together in the time of Perſecution and Suffering, as the manner of ſome hath been.—And the Ground and Foundation of falſe Religion, is Darkneſs, Ignorance and Unbelief, Pride, Blind-zeal and Self-conceitedneſs, begotten by the Spirit of Enmity in the Hearts of the Children of Darkneſs and Diſobedience to the Light and Grace of God; and from this ground ariſeth all that confuſion in Religion and Worſhip, and thoſe many Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Traditions in pretence of the ſervice of God: And from this vain Religion, and unbridled Tongue, ariſeth much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Strife and Contention, from ſuch as conceit they know that which they rightly know not, and ſo are wiſe in their own Imaginations, and puft up with their own Conceivings, to contend and diſpute in the Spirit of Enmity, and not of Love; and when this doth not prevail, then ſometimes they go on to Perſecution, Impoſition and other Cruelties, about Religion and Worſhip; and ſuch are not conſcientious for any Religion at all, but can eaſily comply and conform to any Religion and Worſhip whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being from the meek and peaceable Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Among all ſorts of People, who may be ſaid to be likeſt the Ancient and Primitive Chriſtians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe may be ſaid to be likeſt the Ancient and Primitive Chriſtians, who do believe in, and receive the Light and Spirit of Grace in their own Hearts, and are thereby taught in Doctrin and Practice, in Humility, Charity and Self-denial, being made willing patiently to ſuffer Reproach and Perſecution for God and Chriſt's ſake, and walk according to Chriſt's Example, who went about doing good, and when he was reviled, reviled not again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>Who are the beſt Miniſters?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe may be ſaid to be the beſt Miniſters that convert and turn moſt Souls unto God, according to that in <hi>James</hi> 5.20. <hi>He that converteth a Sinner ſhall ſave a Soul:</hi> Then let us ſee who theſe are; they are not the Proud and Lofty, they are not the Light and Airy, nor the Wild and Wanton, they are not the Hirelings, who ſeek their Gain from their Quarter, they are not the envious Perſecutors, nor the vain and unprofitable Talkers.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>Who are they then?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are ſuch as have freely received the Gifts of God's Grace, and according to the Ability thereof, do freely Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto others, what they have heard ſeen and handled of the Word of Life in themſelves and live accordingly, whereby they are made Instrumental to turn many from Darkneſs to Light, and from Satan's Power to God: Theſe are the beſt Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>And who is the best Teacher?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The beſt Teacher is Chriſt Jeſus, who by his Light and Grace teacheth to deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts. And who are they that are taught and guided by him? Not the Prophane, Drunkards, Lyers, Swearers, Whore-mongers and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nay theſe God will judge: It's thoſe that live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>And which may be ſaid to be the beſt Meetings in relation to the Worſhip of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe may be ſaid to be the beſt Meetings, wherein the Lord moſt appears by his Heavenly Power and Divine Preſence to humble the Hearts, and mollifie and tender the Spirits of his Children, and enlarge them to run the way of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with great Delight: Theſe are certainly his People, and theſe are the beſt Aſſemblies and Meetings.</p>
            <p>Let Truth and true Experience ſpeak to theſe few Things.</p>
