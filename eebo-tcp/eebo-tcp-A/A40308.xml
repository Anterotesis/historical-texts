            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. SPEAKER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce the Army came further VVest, I have not given you an account of the motions thereof: The Treasure no sooner came to the Army, (of which there was great want) but we marched towards the Enemy, whose intention was (as we received Intelligence) to attempt to break thorough with Two thousand horse to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to joyn with the Forces there; For prevention whereof, I sent Letters to the severall counties, to raise the power of the county, to give inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113270:3"/>
to his march, by making good the passes: That day that part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marched to <hi>Axminster,</hi> the Enemy with two thousand horse marched over <hi>Blackdown,</hi> and through the darknesse of the night, passed by our Guards, and fel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into the quarters of our Dragoons, and took about fifty prisoners, and returned immediately, their intention then being to make their way through, as some of their officers, who since came in unto me, do confesse: The whole Army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that day after the Enemy to <hi>Hunni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the horse quartering in the field all night, to prevent a second attempt of the Enemy to march Eastward; and next day the Army marched to <hi>Columpton,</hi> and the Enemy over the River <hi>Ex,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I caused part of the Army to be quartered along that River, within three
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113270:3"/>
or four miles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Enemies return; and with the rest of the Army I marched to <hi>Tiverton,</hi> whither Major Generall <hi>Massey</hi> was sent before with the Regiments with Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Welden,</hi> who found the Governour resolved to hold out; whereupon (after consultation) the storming of that place was agreed on; (the season of the yeer not admitting of much time to be spent about it) and yesterday being the Lords day, after forenoon Sermon, a Councell of VVar being called to order the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Storm: The Canonier, with a great shot broke the chain of the draw-Bridge, whereby it fell down, and the Souldiers immediately entred, and got over the works, with little opposition: The Enemy fled into the Castle and Church for their security, where they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113270:4"/>
had quarter for their lives: Colonell Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot,</hi> and about Two hundred more were taken prisoners; wee found four peece of Ordnance, and thirty Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells of Powder; the works were very strong and regular as I have seen: This Garrison will be of great use, both in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the straitning of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing any thing for this Army whilest it stayes in the VVest.</p>
            <p>This day the Army moves towards the Enemy westward, in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of these parts; desiring you that care may be taken the Army be seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly supplyed with Moneys, being in a country that is much wasted and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished, by the Enemies quartering so long upon them.
