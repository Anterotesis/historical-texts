            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶Eloquence first
geuen by God, after loste by man,
and laste repayred by God
agayne.</head>
            <p>MAn (in whom is poured
the breathe of lyfe) was made at hys
firste beinge an euerliuynge Creature,
vnto the likenes of God, endued with
reason, and appoynted Lorde ouer all
other thinges liuing. But after the fall
of our firste father, Sinne so crepte in,
that our knowledge was muche darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and by corruption of this oure fleshe, mans reason and
entendement were bothe ouerwhelmed. At what time God
beinge sore greued with the folye of one man, pitied of his
mere good uesse, the whole state and posteritie of mankinde.
And therefore (wher as throughe the wicked suggestion of
our ghostelye enemye, the ioyfull fruition of Goddes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
was altogether loste:) it pleased our heauenly father to
repayre mankynde of hys free mercye, and to graunte an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerliuynge
enheritaunce vnto all suche as woulde by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante
fayth seeke earnestlye thereafter, Longe it was ere
that man knewe himselfe, beinge destitute of Gods grace,
so that al thinges waxed sauage, the earth vntilled, societye
neglected, Goddes will not knowen, man againste manne,
one agaynste another, and all agaynste order. Some liued
by spoyle, some like brute Beastes grased vpon the ground,
some wente naked, some romed lyke woodoses, none did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
thing by reason, but most did what they could, by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode.
None almoste considered the euerliuynge God, but
all liued moste communely after their owne luste. By death
they thoughte that all thinges ended, by life they loked for
none other liuynge. None remembred the true obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of wedlocke, none tendered the education of their chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
lawes were not regarded, true dealinge was not once
<pb facs="tcp:12030:6"/>
vsed. For vertue, vyce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are place, for right &amp; equitie, might
vsed aucthoritie. And therfore where as man through rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
might haue vsed order, manne throughe follye fell into
erroure. And thus for lacke of skill, and for wante of grace,
euyll so preuayled, that the Deuyll was mooste estemed, and
GOD either almost vnknowen emonge theim all, or
elles nothinge feared emonge so manye. Therefore euen
nowe when man was thus paste all hope of amendemente,
God still tendering his owne workemanship, stirred vp his
faythfull and elect, to perswade with reason, all men to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietye.
And gaue his appoynted ministers knowledge bothe
to se the natures of men, and also graunted them the gift of
vtteraunce, that they myghte wyth ease wynne folke at
their will, and frame theim by reason to all good order.</p>
            <p>And therefore, where as Menne lyued Brutyshlye
in open feldes, hauing neither house to shroude them in, nor
attyre to clothe their backes, nor yet anye regarde to seeke
their best auayle: these appoynted of God called theim to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by vtteraunce of speache, and perswaded with them
what was good, what was badde, and what was gainefull
for mankynde. And althoughe at firste, the rude coulde
hardelie learne, &amp; either for straungenes of the thing, would
not gladlye receyue the offer, or els for lacke of knoweledge
could not perceyue the goodnes: yet being somewhat drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and delighted with the pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnes of reason, &amp; the swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of vtterau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: after a certaine space, thei became through
nurture and good aduisement, of wilde, sober: of cruel, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
of foles, wise: and of beastes, men. Suche force hath the
tongue, and such is the power of eloquence and reason, that
most men are forced euen to yelde in that, whiche most stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
againste their will. And therfore the Poetes do feyne
that Hercules being a man of greate wisdome, had all men
lincked together by the eares in a chaine, to draw them and
leade them euen as he lusted. For his witte was so greate,
his tongue so eloquente, &amp; his experience suche, that no one
man was able to withstand his reason, but euerye one was
rather driuen to do that whiche he woulde, and to wil that
<pb facs="tcp:12030:6"/>
whiche he did, agreing to his aduise both in word &amp; worke,
in all that euer they were able.</p>
            <p>Neither can I see that menne coulde haue bene broughte
by anye other meanes to lyue together in felowshyppe of
life, to mayntayne Cities, to deale trulye, and willyngelye
to obeye one another, if menne at the firste hadde not by Art
and eloquence perswaded that, which they ful oft found out
by reason. For what manne I praye you beinge better abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to maintayne him selfe by valeante courage, then by liuing
in base subiection: would not rather loke to rule like a lord,
then to lyue lyke an vnderlynge: if by reason he were not
perswaded that it behoueth euerye man to lyue in his owne
vocation, and not to seke anye hygher rowme, then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he was at the first appoynted? Who woulde digge and
delue from morne till euening? Who woulde trauaile and
toyle with the swea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of his browes? Yea, who woulde for
his kynges pleasure aduenture and hasarde his life, if witte
hadde not so wonne men, that they thought nothing more
nedefull in this world, nor anye thing wherunto they were
more bounden: then here to liue in their duty, and to traine
their whole lyfe accordynge to their callynge. Therfore
where as menne are in manye thynges weake by Nature,
and subiecte to much infirmitye: I thinke in this one point
they passe all other Creatures liuynge, that they haue the
gift of speache and reason.</p>
            <p>And emonge all other, I thinke him most worthye fame,
and emongest menne to be taken for halfe a God, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
dothe chiefelye, and aboue all other, excell menne, wherin
men do excell beastes. For he that is emonge the reasonable,
of all moste reasonable, and emonge the wittye, of all moste
wittye, and emonge the eloquente, of all mooste eloquente:
him thincke I emonge all menne, not onelye to be taken for
a singuler manne, but rather to be counted for halfe a God.
For in sekynge the excellencye hereof, the soner he draweth
to perfection, the nygher he commeth to GOD who is
the chiefe wisdome, and therefore called God, because he is
most wise, or rather wisdome it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12030:7"/>Nowe then seinge that God geueth his heauenlye grace
vnto all suche as call vnto him with stretched handes, and
humble harte, neuer wantynge to those, that wante not to
them selues: I purpose by his grace and especial assistence,
to set forthe preceptes of eloquence, and to shewe what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
the wise haue vsed in handeling of their matters,
that the vnlearned by seinge the practise of other, may haue
some knowledge them selues, and learne by their
neyghbours deuise, what is necessarye
for them selues in their owne
case.</p>

                     <p>EUery question, or demaunde in thynges, is of two
sortes. Either it is an infinite question, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ende, or els it is definite, and comprehended
within some ende.</p>
                     <p>Those questions are called infinite,<note place="margin">Questions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</note> whiche generally
are propounded, withoute the comprehension of tyme,
place, and person, or any suche like: that is to saie, when no
certain thyng is named, but onely woordes are generally
spoken. As thus, whether it be best to marie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to liue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.
Whiche is better, a courtiers life, or a scholers life.</p>
                     <p>Those questions are called definite,<note place="margin">Questions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</note> whiche set furthe a
matter, with the appoynctment, and namyng of place, time
and persone. As thus. Whether now it be best here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande,
for a Prieste to Marie, or to liue single. Whether
<pb facs="tcp:12030:8"/>
it were mete for the kynges maiestie, that now is, to marie
with a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, or to mary with one of his awn subiectes.<note place="margin">Questions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, belong properly to an Orator.</note>
Now the definite question (as the whiche concerneth some
one persone) is moste agreyng to the purpose of an Orator
consideryng particuler matters in the Lawe, are euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
betwixte certain persones, the one affirmyng for his
parte, and the other deniyng, as fast again for his parte.</p>
                     <p>Thynges generally spoken without al circumstaunces,
are more proper vnto the Logicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Questions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, proper vnto Logicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> who talketh of thynges
vniuersally, without respect of persone, time, or place. And
yet notwithstandyng, Tullie doeth saie, that whosoeuer
will talke of a particuler matter, must reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thesame also, is comprehended a generall. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
If I shall aske this question, whether it be lawfull for
Willyam Conqueroure to inuade Englande, and wynne
it by force of armour, I must also consider this, whether it
be lawfull for any man, to vsurpe power, or it be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
That if the greater cannot be borne withall, the lesse
cannot be neither. And in this respecte, a generall question
agreeth well to an Orators profession, and ought well to
be knowen, for the better furtheraunce of his matter, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng
the particuler questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is euer called in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie,
and the generall onely thereupon considered, to
comprehende and compasse thesame, as the whiche is more

all these, there remain twoo lessons, the whiche wisemenne
haue alwaies obserued, and therefore ought of all men, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
to be learned. The one is, that if any matter<note place="margin">Matters, hard to auoide, shuld alwaies bee past ouer, as thoughwe saw them not at al</note> be laied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, whiche by reason can hardely bee auoyded, or the
whiche is so open, that none almoste can deny, it were wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in confutyng all the other reasons, to passe ouer this
<pb facs="tcp:12030:12"/>
one, as though we sawe it not, and therefore speake neuer a
worde of it. Or els if necessitie shall force a man to saie some
what,<note place="margin">Good to bee bolde in moste daungier, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise wee cannot escape.</note> he may make an outward bragge, as though there wer
no matter in it, euer so speakyng of it, as though he would
stande to the triall, makyng men to beleue, he would fight in
the cause, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better it were (if necessitie so required) to run
clene awaie. And herein though a man do flie and geue place,
euermore the gladder, the lesse rauyng there is or stirryng in
this matter: yet he flieth wisely, and for this ende, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng fensed
otherwise, &amp; strongly appoyncted, he maie take his
aduersary at the best aduauntage, or at the least, werie hym
with muche lingeryng, and make hym with oft suche fliyng,
to forsake his chief defence.</p>
                     <p>The other lesson is, that whereas we purpose alwaies to
haue the victorie, wee should so speake, that we maie labour
rather not to hynder, or hurt our cause, then to seke meanes
to further it.<note place="margin">Better not to hurte a good matter by euil speach, then to further it by good talke.</note> And yet I speake not this, but that bothe these

behalfe.<note place="margin">The person be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore whom we speake, must be well marked.</note> Some man beyng stirred, shall hurt more our cause

whiche is wisely kept close, yet the necessitie of the matter,
must rather be marked, then the fonde iudgement of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
estemed. What a sore saiyng were this? When a lawyer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12030:12"/>
should take in hande a matter, concernyng life and death,
and another should aske how he hath sped, to heare tel that
the lawyer, hath not onely cast awaie his clie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but vndoen
hymself also, in speakyng thynges inconsideratly, as no
doubt it ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> happeneth, that wise men, and those also that
bee none euill men neither, maie vnwares speake thynges,
which afterward thei sore repent, &amp; would cal backe again
with losse of a greate so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e. Now what a foly it is, not to
remember the tyme and the men. Or who will speake that
whiche he knoweth will not be liked, if he purpose to finde
fauour at their handes, before whom he speaketh, what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of reason will praise that before the Iudges, (before whom
he knoweth the determinacion of his cause resteth) whiche
the Iudges self cannot abide to heare spoken at all? Or
doeth not he muche hinder his awne matter, that wtthout
al curtesie or preface made, will largely speake euil of those
men, whom the hearers of his cause, tenderly doo fauour?
Or be it that there be some notable faulte in thyne aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
with whiche the Iudges also are infected, were it not
foly for thee, to charge thyne aduersary with thesame. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

theim also, and so thou maiest perhappes, lose their

And in framing reasons, to confirme the purpose, if any
be spoken plainly false, or els contrary to that, which was
spoken before, dooeth it not muche hynder a good matter?
Therefore in all causes, this good hede ought to bee had,
that alwaies we labour to do some good, in furtheryng of
our cause, or if we cannot so do, at the least that we doo no

God made this enterprise appere full easie, before Dauid
could haue the harte, to matche hymself with suche a one.
For though his harte might quake, beeyng voyde of Gods

set hym on. Let tirauntes rage, let hell stand open, let Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than

God preserue Moses, and destroye Pharao? What is man
and all his power that he can make, in the handes of God,

what did the Israelites, when thei sawe Dauid take vpon

euen at his firste commyng? For if the Philistine maie

Now what should he meane, so vnegally to matche himself
except he were, wery of his life, or els were not well in his

that could bee, he came vnarmed, and whereas the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,

onely, as though he would kill crowes, whereat, not onely
the Philistine laughed, &amp; disdained his folie, but also bothe
the armies thought he was but a dedde man, before he gaue
one stroke. And in deede, by all reason and deuise of manne
there was none other waie, but deathe with hym, out of
hande, Dauid notwithstandyng, beeyng kyndeled in harte
with Gods might, was strong enough for him, in his awne
opinion, and forced nothyng, though all other were muche
against hym. And therefore made no more a dooe, but beyng
redy to reuenge in Goddes name, suche greate blasphemie,
as the Philistine then did vtter, marched towardes his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and with castyng a stone out of a slyng, he ouerthrewe
the Philistine at the first. The whiche when he had dooen,
out with his sworde, and chopt of his hedde, cariyng it with,
his armoure, to the Campe of the Israelites: whereat the
Philistines wer greatly astonied, and the Israelites much
praised God, that had geuen suche grace, to suche a one, to
compasse suche a deede. And the rather this manly acte, is
highly to be praised, because he subdued this houge enemie,
when Saul firste reigned kyng ouer Israell, and was sore
assaied with the greate armie of the Philistines. Lette vs
therefore that be now liuyng, when this acte or suche like,
come into our myndes: remember what God is, of how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

he hath wrought suche wonders, to the strengthenyng of

Then may I be bolde to commende that, whiche all
men wishe &amp; fewe can haue, whiche all men loue, &amp; none can
want: not doubtyng but as I am occupied in a good thyng,
so al good men wil heare me with a good wil. But woulde
God I were so wel able to perswade all men to Iustice, as
al men know the necessarie vse therof: and then vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I woulde be muche boulder, and force some by violence,
whiche by faire wordes can not be entreated. And yet what
nedes any perswasion for that thyng, whiche by nature is
so nedeful, &amp; by experience so profitable, that looke what we
want, without iustice we get not, loke what we haue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
iustice we kepe not. God grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his grace so to worke in
the hartes of al men, that they may aswel practise well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

God shal worke with any man, than may I thynke my
self in happy case, &amp; reioyce much in the trauaile of my wit.
And how can it be otherwyse, but that al men shalbe forced
inwardly to allowe that, whiche in outwarde acte many do
not folowe: seyng God poured first this law of nature into
mans hart, &amp; grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it as a meane wherby we might know

deuisyng lawes necessarie for mans lyfe. And here vpon it
is that when men desire the lawe for trial of a matter, they

meane nothyng elles but to haue iustice,<note place="margin">Iustice what it is, and howe largely it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth.</note> the whiche iustice
is a vertue that yeldeth to euery man, his owne: to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

and to al men, perfite peace, and charitie. Now what can be
more said in praise of this vertue, or what thyng can be like
praised? Are not al thynges in good case, when al men haue
their owne? And what other thyng doeth iustice, but seketh
meanes to contente al parties? Then how greatly are they
to be praised, that meane truely in al th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

onely, do no harme to any, but seke meanes to helpe al. The
sunne is not so wonderful to the world (saith Aristotel<note place="margin">Aristotel.</note>) as
the iust dealyng of a gouernour is merueilous to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. No
the yerth yeldeth not more gaine to al creatures, than doth
the iustice of a Magistrate to his whole Realme. For, by a
lawe, we liue, and take the fruites of the yearth, but where
no law is, nor iustice vsed: there, nothyng ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be had, though
al thynges be at hande: For, in hauyng the thyng, we shall
lacke the vse, and liuyng in great plentie, we shal stande in
great nede. The meane therfore that maketh men to enioye
their owne, is iustice, the whiche beyng ones taken away,
all other thynges are lost with it, neither can any one saue
that he hath, nor yet get that he wanteth. Therfore if wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g

death,<note place="margin">Wvrong dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng deserueth death.</note> what man coulde lyue in reste? Who coulde be suer
either of his lyfe, or of his liuyng one whole day together?
Now because euery man desiereth the preseruation of hym
selfe, euery man should in lyke case desire the sauegarde of
his neighbour. For if I shoulde wholly mynde myne own
ease, and folowe gaine without respect to the hinderaunce
of myne euen Christian: why should not other vse thesame
libertie, and so euery man for hymselfe, and the deuil for vs al,
catche that catche may? The whiche custome if all men
folowed, the earth woulde soone be voide for want of men,
one woulde be so gredie to eate vp an other. For in sekyng
to lyue, we shoulde lose our lyues, &amp; in gapyng after good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
we shoulde soone go naked. Therefore to represse this
<pb facs="tcp:12030:24"/>
rage, and with holsome deuises to traine men in an order,
God hath lightened man with knowledge, that in al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
he may se what is right, and what is wrong, and vpon
good aduisement deale iustly with al men. God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
al thynges for mans vse, and ordeined man for mannes
sake, that one man might helpe another. For thoughe some

no man can liue alone without helpe of other.<note place="margin">Iustice neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for almo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Therfore we
shoulde striue one to helpe another by iuste dealyng, some

as we shalbe alwaies best able, wherein the lawe of nature
is fulfilled, and Goddes commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t folowed. We loue

beyng past one and twentie yeres, is free and at his libertie.
Yea the sonne beyng abdicated, becommeth no sonne. But
it is death onely that parteth maried folke, if yet death doe
part them. Now if the other Sacramentes (whereunto the
Churche of Christe chiefely leaneth) bee reuerently vsed,
who doeth not see that this Sacramente shoulde haue the
most reuerence of al, the whiche was instituted of GOD,
and that firste and before all other. As for the other they
were instituted vpon yearthe, this was ordeined in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:
the other were geuen for a remedie, this was appoinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the felowshippe of felicitie: the other were applied
to mannes nature after the fall, this onely was geuen when
man was in moste perfite state. If we counte those lawes
good that mortall men haue enacted, shall not the lawe of
Matrimonie be moste holie, whiche wee haue receyued of
him, by whome we haue receiued lyfe, the whiche lawe was
then together enacted whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man was first created? And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to strengthen this lawe with an example and deede doen
Christe beyng an young man (as the Storie reporteth) was
called to a Mariage,<note place="margin">Mariage beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tified by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</note> and came thither willyngly with his
mother, and not onely was he there present, but also he did
honest the feaste with a wonderfull meruaile begynnyng
first in none other place to worke his wounders, and to doe
his miracles. Why then I praie you (will one saie) howe
happeneth it that Christ forbare Mariage? as though good
Seir there are not many thynges in Christe at the whiche
we ought rather to meruaile, than seeke to folowe. he was
borne and had no father, he came into this worlde without
his mothers painefull trauaile, he came out of the graue
<pb facs="tcp:12030:33"/>
when it was closed vp, what is not in hym aboue nature?
Let these thynges be propre vnto hym. Let vs that lyue
within the boundes of nature, reuerence those thynges
that are aboue nature, and folowe suche thynges as are
within our reache suche as we are able to compasse. But
yet (you saie) he woulde bee borne of a Uirgine: Of a
Uirgine (I graunt) but yet of a maried Uirgine. A Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne
beyng a mother did moste become GOD, and beyng
maried she did showe what was beste for vs to doe. Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie
did become her, who beyng vndefiled, brought hym
forthe by heauenly inspiration that was vndefiled. And
yet Ioseph beyng her housbande dothe commende vnto vs
the lawe of chaiste wedlocke. Yea, howe coulde he better
sette out the societie in wedlocke, than that willyng to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the secrete societie of his diuine nature with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

heauenly Aungelles, and to showe his vnspeakable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
abidyng loue towarde his Churche: he doeth call hym
selfe the Brydegrome, and her the Bryde. Greate is the
Sacrament of Matrimonie (saith Paule) betwixt Christe
and his Churche. If there had bene vnder heauen any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier

than is Matrimonie, without doubte the example thereof
had bene vsed. But what lyke thyng doe you reade in all

and yet the syngle lyfe is not so muche as ones named in
the same place. Nay they are not borne withall that lyue
syngle, except they make some recompence with doyng some

nature, doe labour to gette children, he is euer to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

ende, but because he woulde bee out of trouble, and lyue
more free. Wee doe reade that suche as are in very deede
chaiste of their body, and lyue a Uirgines lyfe, haue bene
praised, but the syngle lyfe was neuer praised of it selfe.
Nowe againe the lawe of Moses accurseth the barrenesse

of maried folke, and wee doe reade that some were excem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

And wherefore I praie you? Marie Sir because that
they like vnprofitable persones, and liuyng onely to theim
selues, did not encrease the worlde with any issue. In
Deuteronomie it was the chiefest token of Goddes bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synges
vnto the Israelites that none shoulde be barren e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them,<note place="margin">Deut. vi.</note> neither man, nor yet woman. And Lya is
thought to bee out of Goddes fauour,<note place="margin">Lia.</note> because she coulde
not bryng furth children. Yea, and in the Psalme of Dauid
an hundreth twentie and eight, it is counted one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
partes of blesse to bee a frutefull woman. Thy wyfe
(sayeth the Psalme) shalbe plentifull lyke a vine, and thy
children lyke the braunches of Olyues, rounde about thy
Table. Then if the lawe do condempne, and vtterly dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
barren Matrimonie, it hath alwaies muche more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
the syngle lyfe of Bacchelaures. Yf the fault of
nature hath not escaped blame, the will of man can neuer
wante rebuke. Yf they are accursed that woulde haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and can gette none, what deserue they whiche neuer

                     <p>The Hebrues had suche a reuerence to maried folke,<note place="margin">Hebrues lawe for maried folke.</note>
that he whiche had maried a wyfe, the same yeare shoulde

this felowship of manne and wife, be otherwise then moste

aboue all other, that is borne, as a man would saie for
hymself, that liueth to hymself, that seketh for himself, that
spareth for himself, maketh cost onely vpon himself, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

either of God or man, and without hynderaunce of his esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion.
Truely I would take suche a one, not to be a man,
but rather to bee a very stone. Although this pleasure of the
body, is the least parte of all those good thynges, that are in
wedlocke. But bee it that you passe not vpon this pleasure,
and thinke it vnworthy for man to vse it, although in deede

You haue other parentes, other brethren, sisterne, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes.
Nature in deede can geue you but one father, &amp; one

shall seme, to bee newe borne. For so long as thei shall liue,
you shall nede neuer bee thought ded your self. The goodes
and landes that you haue gotte, go not to other heires, then
to your awne. So that vnto suche as haue fulfilled all thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
that belong vnto mannes life, death it self cannot seme
bitter. Old age cometh vpon vs all, will we, or nill we, and
this waie nature prouided for vs, that we should waxe yong

whiche he had beyng a childe, to appere liuely in his sonne?
Death is ordeined for all mankynd, and yet by this meanes

what and if one haue a curste wife? What if she be lighte?
What if his children bee vngracious? Thus I see you will

Well, go to it, tell as many as you can, &amp; spare not: you shal

if all men tooke after you, and still forbare to marie: I can not
see but that these thynges whiche you wonder at, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme
so muche, could not haue been at al. Do you yet esteme
this syngle lyfe so greatly? Doe you praise so muche virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
aboue al other? Why man, there will be neither syngle
men, nor virgines a lyue, if men leaue to marie, and mynde
not procreation. why do you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preferre virginitie so muche
why set it you so hye, if it be the vndoyng of all the whole
worlde? It hath been muche commended, but it was for that

tyme, and in a fewe. God woulde haue men to see as though
it were a paterne, or rather a picture of that heauenly habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion,
where neither any shalbe maried, nor yet any shall
geue theirs to Mariage. But when thynges be geuen for an
example, a fewe may suffise, a nomber were to no purpose.
For euen as al groundes though they be very frutefull, are
not therefore turned into tillage for mans vse and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
but parte lyeth fallowe, and is neuer mannered, parte
is kepte and cherised to lyke the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and yet in al this plentie of thynges, where so great store of
lande is, nature suffereth very litle to waxe barren: But
nowe if none should be tilled, and plowe m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who seeth not but that wee shoulde al sterue, and bee faine
shortely to eate acornes: Euen so, it is praise worthie if a
fewe liue syngle, but if al should seke to lyue syngle, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as be in this worlde, it were to great an inconuenience.
Now again be it that other deserue worthie praise that seke
to liue a virgines life, yet it must nedes be a great faulte in
you. Other shalbe thought to seke a purenesse of lyfe, you
shalbe coumpted a parricide, or a murtherer of your stocke:
that whereas you may by honest mariage encrease your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie:
you suffex it to decaie for euer, through your wilful
single lyfe. A man may hauyng a house ful of children, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
one to God to lyue a virgine al his lyfe. The plowe
man offereth to God the tenthes of his owne, and not his
whole croppe al together: But you Sir, muste remember
that there is none lefte aliue of al your stocke, but your self
alone. And nowe it mattereth nothyng whether you kill,
or refuse to saue that creature, which you onely might saue
and that with ease. But you wil folow the example of your
sister, and lyue syngle as she doth. And yet me thynketh you
shoulde chefely euen for this selfe same cause, be afraied to
lyue single. For whereas there was hope of issue heretofore
in you bothe, nowe ye see there is no hope left but in you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely.

He is vnthankfull, that thynkes he hath wrong doen, when

your self most happie, that you had two suche, and geue God

Necessitie is lawles, and that whiche is by God appoyncted

And euer we saie, when any dye young, he might haue
liued longer, it was pitie he died to sone. As though for sothe

Therefore. whereas for a tyme your grace, muche bewailed

but also refusyng all kynde of comforte, almoste dedde with
heauinesse, your body beyng so worne with sorowe, that the
long continuance of thesame, is muche like to shorten your

youre will to Goddes will, and whereas hetherto nature
hath taught you to wepe the lacke of your naturall children
lette reason teache you hereafter, to wipe awaie the teares,
and lette not phantasie encrease that, whiche nature hath
commaunded moderately to vse. To bee sory for the lacke of
oure dearest, wee are taughte by nature, to bee ouercome

hath so graciously taken these your two children, to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable

you will saie. These were good and godly broughte vp, and

though thei had not chaunced to your children, yet we knew
not that before, and more wisedome it had been, to feare the
worst with good aduisement, then euer to hope, and loke stil

in matters criminall, where iudgement is required:
there are two persons at the least, whiche must through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie,
stande and reste vpon some issue. As for example:
A seruyng man is apprehended by a lawyer for felonie vpon
suspicion. The lawier saith to the seruyng man: Thou hast
done this robbery. Nay, (saith he) I haue not doen it. Upon
this conflicte &amp; matchyng together, ariseth this State, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this seruing man hath done this robbery, or no? Upon
whiche poincte the lawyer must stande, and seeke to proue it

whiche doeth arise vpon the first demaunde and denial made

because we doe stande and reste vpon some one poincte,<note place="margin">State, why it is so called.</note> the
whiche must wholly and onely be proued of the one side, and
denied of the other. I cannot better terme it in Englishe

                     <p>IN the fyrst we consider vpon rehearsal of a matter
whether anye suche thinge bee, or no. As if one
shoulde be accused of Murther, good it were to
knowe, whether anye murther were committed at
all, or on, if it be not perfectlye knowne before: and after to
go further, and examine whether suche a man that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
haue done the dede or no.</p>
                     <p>In the seconde place, we doubte not vpon the thinge
done, but we stande in doubte what to call it. Sometimes
a man is accused of felo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ye, and yet he proueth his offence
to be but a trespace, wherupon he escapeth the daunger of
deathe. An other beynge accused for killynge a man, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his faulte to be manslaughter, and denieth it vtterlye
to be any murder, wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he maketh frendes to purchase
his Pardon. Nowe the lawyers by their learninge muste
iudge the doubte of this debate, and tell what name he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
to haue that hath thus offended.</p>
                     <p>In the thyrde place, not onely the dede is confessed, but
the maner of doynge is defended. As if one were accused for
killynge a man, to confesse the deede, and also to stande in it
that he myght iustely so do, because he did it in his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
wherupon ariseth this Question, whether his doing

his noughtye nature, and his wycked liuynge hathe
made him famous. For, who is he that hearynge of N. (the

is he onelye knowen vniuersallye to be nought, but his

where pillage is good purchase, and murderynge is

now beyng at a low ebbe, &amp; lothe to seme base in his estate,
thought to aduenture vpon this farmar, and either to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

GOD would haue thys murder to be knowen, loke
I praye you what bloude he carieth aboute hym, to beare

                     <p>And often his coloure chaungeth, his bodye shaketh, and
hys tongue foultereth wythin hys mouthe. And suche men

at suche a place at the selfe same houre, when the Farmar
was slayne: they wyll not be sworne for the verye houre,
but they saye, he was at suche a place, wythin two houres

vnto al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, especially seing this dede was done such a time,
and in suche a place, that if the deuyl had not bene his good

wyll not saye that this Caytife hadde little cause to feare,
but rather power inoughe to doe his wycked feacte, seynge
he is so sturdye and so stronge, and the other so weake and
vnweldy: yea, seyng this vilaine was armed, and the other

notes of his former lyfe to declare his inwarde nature, and
perceiuing suche coniectures lawfully gathered vpon iuste
suspicion: but that this wretched Souldioure hath slayne
thys worthye Farmar. And therfore I appeale for iustice
vnto your wisdomes for the deathe of thys innocente man,
whose bloude before God asketh iuste auengement. I doubt
not but you remember the wordes of Salomon, who saith.
It is as greate a synne to forgeue the wicked, as it is euill

or disswadyng, diuisions muste also be vsed. As if one
woulde enueighe against those women that will not geue
their owne chidren sucke, he might vse this deuision. Where
as women commonly put their children furthe to nursyng,
I will first proue that it is bothe against the lawe of nature
and also against Goddes holie wil:<note place="margin">

it is harmefull bothe for the childes bodie, and also for his

muche sickenesse thereby.</p>
                     <p>First, nature geueth milke to the woman for none other
ende, but that she shoulde bestowe it vpon her childe. And
we see beastes feede there youngones, and why shoulde not
women? GOD also commaundeth all women to bryng
vp their children.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the childrens bodies shalbe so affected, as the
milke is whiche they receyue. Nowe, if the Nurse be of an
euil complexion, or haue some hidde disease, the childe suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
of her brest muste needes take parte with her. And if
that be true whiche the learned doe saie, that the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the mynde folowes the constitucion of the bodie,
needes must it be that if the Nurse be of a naughtie nature,
the childe muste take thereafter. But be it, the Nurse be of
a good complexion, of an honest behauiour (whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

mylke shoulde be muche more naturall for the childe,
than the mylke of a straunger.</p>
                     <p>As by experience, let a man be long vsed to one kynde
of drynke, if the same man chaunge his ayre, and his drynke,
he is lyke to mislyke it. Lastely for the mothers, howe

committed. Yea, what he did, before this acte was dooen. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the tyme muste bee marked, the place, the maner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng,
and what hart he bare hym. As thoportunitie of doyng
<pb facs="tcp:12030:72"/>
and the power he had to do this deede. The whiche all sette
together, that either acquitte him, or finde him giltee. These
argumentes serue to confirme a matter in iudgement, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hainous offence. But in the other causes which are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
either in praisyng, or dispraisyng, in perswadyng, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadyng,
the places of confirmacion, be suche as are before

and brief heapyng of all that, whiche was saied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
stirryng the hearers by large vtteraunce, and

                     <p>There are twoo partes of a conclusion,<note place="margin">Conclusion, of twoo sortes.</note> the one resteth in

rehersed, reportyng the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of them, in as fewe wordes
as can be, and yet after suche a sorte, that muche varietie be
vsed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bothe when the rehersall is made, as also after the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is fully reported. For, if the repeticion should bee naked,
and onely set furthe in plain woordes, without any chaunge
of speache, or shift or Rhetorique: neither should the hearers
take pleasure, nor yet the matter take effect. Therfore, when
the Oratour shall touche any place, whiche maie geue iuste
cause to make an exclamacion, &amp; stirre the hearers to be sory
to bee glad, or to be offended: it is necessary to vse arte to the
outermoste. Or when he shall come to the repeatyng of an
heinous acte, and the maner thereof: he maie set the Iudges
on fire, and heate them earnestly against the wicked offendor
Thus in repeatyng, arte maie bee vsed, and nexte with the
onely rehersall, matters maie bee handesomely gathered vp
together.</p>
                     <p>The other part of a conclusion resteth, either in augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
and vehemently enlargyng that, whiche before was in
fewe wordes spoken, to set the Iudge or hearers in a heate:
or els to mitigate and asswage displeasure conceiued, with
muche lamentyng of the matter, and mouyng theim thereby
the rather to shewe mercie. Amplificacion is of twoo sortes,
whereof I will speake more at large, in the nexte Chapiter.
The one resteth in wordes, the other in matter. Suche wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
muste bee vsed, as be of greate weight, wherein either is
some Metaphore, or els some large vnderstandyng is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Yea, wordes that fill the mouthe, and haue a sound with
them, set furthe a matter very well. And sometymes wordes
twise spoken, make the matter appere greater.</p>
                     <p>Again, when we firste speake our mynde in lowe wordes,
<pb facs="tcp:12030:73"/>
&amp; after vse weightier, the fault likewise semeth to be greater
As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one had killed a ientleman, thus might another am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
his mynd. For one slaue to strike another, wer worthy
of punishement, but what deserueth that wretche, whiche
not onely striketh a manne, but striketh a ientlemanne, and
not onely striketh a ientleman, but cowardly killeth a ientle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manne,
not geuyng hym one wounde, but geuyng hym twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
To kill any manne in suche sorte, deserueth deathe, but
what saie you to him, that not onely killeth hym so, but also
hangeth hym moste spitefully vpon a tree. And yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with that, but scourgeth hym, and mangeleth hym whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he is dedde, and last of all, maketh a iest of his moste naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

I aske it for Gods loue, and in the waie of Iustice, that

to the example of all other. Amplifiyng of the matter,
consisteth in heapyng, and enlargyng of those places, whiche
serue for confirmacion of a matter. As the definicion, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to crie out of suche a deede. As if some worthy manne

if the walles of suche a citee or toune, had a tongue, would

wonder at the straungenesse of any thyng. In perswadyng,

                     <p>The occasion of laughter, and the meane that maketh vs
merie (whiche is the second obseruacion) is the fondnes, the
filth nes, the deformitee, and all suche euill behauior, as we

whiche either onely or chiefly touche handsomely, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely

or some one thing. Sometymes we iest as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes body that

no matter to hit hym home, ye maie be assured. Some iest is
made, when it toucheth no man at al, neither the demaunder
neither the sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders by, nor yet any other, and yet deliteth as

Arte as my slender witte coulde beste yelde. And
now, nexte and immediatly after inuention, I thinke
meete to speake of framyng and placyng an Oration in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the matter beeyng aptely sartelde, and couched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
might better please the hearers, and with more ease
be learned of all men. And the rather I am earnest in this
behaulfe, because I knowe that al thynges stande by order,
<pb facs="tcp:12030:93"/>
and without order nothyng can be. For by an order wee are
borne, by an order wee lyue, and by an order wee make our
end. By an order one ruleth as head, and other obey as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
By an order<note place="margin">Order of what sorte it is.</note> Realmes stande, and lawes take force.
Yea by an order the whole worke of nature and the perfite
state of al the elementes haue their appointed course. By an
order we deuise, we learne, and frame our dooynges to good
purpose. By an order the Carpenter hath his Squyre, his
Rule, and his Plumme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his measure: The Mason his Former, and his Plaine, and
euery one accordyng to his callyng frameth thynges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
For though matter be had, and that in greate plentie:
yet al is to no purpose, if an order be not vsed. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
What auaileth Stoone, if Masons doe not worke it?
What good dothe clothe, if Tailours take no measure, or
do not cutte it out? Though Tymber be had for makyng a
Shippe, and al other thynges necessarie, yet the shippe shal
neuer be perfite, till worke men begynne to set to their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and ioyne it together. In what a comenly order hath
God made man, whose shape is not thought perfite, if any
parte be altered? yea al folke would take hym for a monster,
whose feete should occupie the place of his handes. An army
neuer getteth victorie, that is not in araie, and sette in good
order of battail. So an Oration hath litle force with it, and
dothe smally profite, whiche is vtterde without all order.
And needes must he wander, that knowes not howe to goe,
neither can he otherwyse chouse, but stumble: that gropyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with a weapon that knoweth not howe to vse it? What
though one haue mountaines of golde, what auaileth hym

It is not enough to haue learnyng, but it is al to vse lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng.
Therefore because this parte of bestowyng matter,

our owne cause by good reason, and to confute all suche
thinges as are contrarie to our purpose: last of al, to gather
the whole in a somme, concludyng the matter briefely, and
so to make an ende. Nowe to place those reasons, whiche
shoulde both serue to confirme and to confute, and to tel in
what parte of the Oration it were best to vse this reason,
and that reason, that the rather wee might proue, teache,
and perswade: a right wyse man had nede to take this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hande. For euen as the tyme, the place, the iudge, and
the matter it selfe shal geue cause: so must a wyse body take
his aduantage. Sometymes it shalbe expedient to vse no
preface at al, or els when the matter is wel knowne, it will
be good to leaue the matter vntolde, and streight to seeke
the confirmacion, vsyng some stronge reason for the same
purpose. Yea sometymes it may do good to neglecte the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

<pb facs="tcp:12030:94"/>
it out of hande with as briefe reasons, and as strong as can
be gatherde possible. And in prouyng of our matters, we
had nede euermore rather to waie our reasons, than to no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them, and thynke not that then we shall doe beste, when
haue the most, but then looke to doe best, when we haue the
strongest. And first of al the strongest should be vsed, and the
other placed in the middest of the Oration, the whiche bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
heaped together wil make a good mustar.<note place="margin">Argumentes howe they should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested.</note> And yet this
also would be learned, whereas we vsed the best reasons at
the first, we shoulde also reserue some that were lyke good,
for the later end: that the hearers might haue them freshe in
their remembraunce, when they shoulde geue iudgement.
The slender reasons that can do lesse good, and yet not all,
(for some may better be omitted) woulde bee placed in the
middest (as I saied) that bothe they might bee lesse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
or beeyng heaped there together, they might doe more
good, especially when bothe weightie reasons went before,
and weightie reasons also, folowed after. Now a wyse man
that hath good experience in these affaires, and is able to
make hym selfe a Rhetorique for euery matter, will not bee
bounde to any precise rules, nor kepe any one order, but
suche onely as by reason he shall thynke best to vse, beeyng
maister ouer Arte, rather then Arte shoulde be maister ouer
hym, rather makyng Art by witte, than confoundyng witte
by Arte. And vndoubtedly euen in so doyng, he shal do right
wel, and contente the hearers accordyngly. For what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
whether we folowe our Booke, or no, if wee folowe
witte, and appoint our selfe an order, suche as may declare
the truthe more plainely? Yea some that be vnlearned and
yet haue right good wittes: will deuise with theim selues
without any Booke learnyng, what they wil saie, and how
muche they wil say, appointyng their order, and partyng it
into thre, or foure partes, or more, if neede be, suche as they
shal thynke especial pointes, and most meete to bee touched.
Whose doynges as I can wel like, &amp; muche commende them
for the same: so I would thynke them muche more able to do
muche better: if thei either by learning folowed a Paterne,
or els knewe the preceptes, whiche leade vs to right order.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12030:94"/>
Rules wer therfore geuen, and by muche obseruacion gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together, that those whiche could not see Arte hid in
another mannes doynges, should yet se the rules open, all in
an order set together: &amp; therby iudge the rather of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges,
and by earnest imitacion, seke to resemble suche their
inuencion.<note place="margin">Thuse of arte.</note> I cannot deny but that a right wise man vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
shall doo more good by his naturall witte, then twentie
of these common wittes, that want nature to help arte. And
I know that rules wer made first by wise men, and not wise
men made by rules. For these preceptes serue onely to helpe
our nede, suche as by nature haue not suche plentifull giftes
And as for other, vnto whom nature is more fauorable, thei
are rather put the soner in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce, that suche lessons
are, then so taught as though thei neuer knewe theim, or els
neuer would vse them. And therfore a certain learned man, &amp;
of muche excellencie, beeyng asked what was suche a figure,
and suche a trope in Rhetorique: I cannot tell (ꝙ he) but I
am assured, if you loke in the boke of myne oracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, you shall
not faile but finde theim. So that though he knewe not the
name of suche and suche figures, yet the nature of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
so familiar to his knowlege, that he had thuse of them, when
soeuer he had nede. Nowe though this man could well thus
doo, beyng of suche notable vnderstandyng, yet it were foly
that all should folowe his waie, whiche want so good a wit.
And I thinke euen he himself, should not haue lost by it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if he had seen that in aglasse, whiche he often vsed to do
without knowlege. Man is forgetfull, and there is none so
wise, but counsaill maie dooe hym good. Yea, he shall dooe
muche better, that knoweth what arte other me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what inuencion thei haue folowed, what order thei haue
kept, and how thei haue best doen in euery part. If
he like not theirs, he may vse his awne, and yet
none dooeth so euill (I thynke) but some
good maie be got by hym. The wise
therfore wil not refuse to heare:

are so taken on with contrary Bishoppes, with reuiues, and
with subsides to the kyng, that al our money is cleane gone.
These wordes he spake for contribucion, relief, and subsidie.
And thus we see that poore simple men are muche troubled,

what woordes wee best vnderstande, and knowe what thei

vnto those wherof they spake: they vsed suche wordes
to expresse their minde, as were most like vnto other. As for
example. If I shoulde speake against some notable Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,
I might vse translation of wordes in this wise: Yonder
man is of a croked iudgment, his wyttes are clowdie, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in deepe darkenes, dusked altogether wyth blynde ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce,
and drowned in the raginge sea, of bottomeles su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.
Thus is the ignoraunte set out, by callinge hym
croked, clowdye, darke, blinde, and drownde in superstition.
All whiche wordes are not proper vnto ignoraunce, but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
of other thinges, that are of lyke nature vnto igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce.
For the vnskilfull man hath his wytte set oute of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12030:100"/>
order, as a mannes bodye is set out of ioynte, and therupon
it maye be sayde to be croked. Likewyse he maye be called
clowdye, for as the clowdes kepe the Sunne shinynge from
vs, so dothe his Ignoraunce kepe him blindefolde from the
true vnderstandinge of thinges. And as when the eyes are
oute, no manne can see anye thinge: so when perfecte iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
is wantinge, the truthe can not be knowen. And so
likewise of all other. Thus as necessitye hath forced vs to
borowe wordes translated: so hath time and practice made
theim to seeme moost pleasaunt, and therfore thei are mucht
the rather vsed. Yea, when a thynge full ofte can not be
expreste by an apte and mete woorde, we do perceyue (when

brute beastes, and thynges that haue no life, minister

a stone wall. A man maie loue his house wel, and yet not ride
vpon the ridge. By all whiche, any one maie gather a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and enlarge it at pleasure. The prouerbes of Heiwode
helpe wonderfull well for this purpose. In comparyng a
thyng from the lesse to the greater, Similitudes helpe well
to set out the matter. That if we purpose to dilate our cause
hereby with poses and sentences, wee maie with ease talke
at large.<note place="margin">Similitude enlarged.</note> This shall serue for an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ample. The more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a thyng is, the more diligently should it bee kepte, and
better hede taken to it. Therfore tyme, (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideryng, nothyng
is more precious,) should warely bee vsed, and good care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that no tyme bee lost, without some profite gotten. For
if thei are to be punished, that spende their money, and waist
their landes, what folie is it, not to thynke theim worthie
muche more blame, that spend their tyme (whiche is the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
treasure that God geueth) either idlely, or els vngodly?
For what other thyng doeth manne lose, when he loseth his
tyme, but his life? And what can bee more deare to man, then
his life? If wee lose a litle money, or a ryng of golde with a
stone in it, we compt that greate losse. And I praie you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wee lose a whole daie, whiche is a good porcion of a mannes
life, shall wee not compte that a losse, consideryng though
our money bee gone, wee maie recouer thesame again, but
tyme lost can neuer be called backe again. Again whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we lose
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12030:110"/>
our money, some bodye getteth good by it, but the losse of
time turneth to no mannes auayle. There is no man that
loseth in anye other thynge, but some bodye gayneth by it,
sauynge onelye in the losse of time. Yea, it hathe saued the
lyfe of some, to lose al that they hadde. For riches be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
sometimes of muche mischiefe in this lyfe, so that it
were better sometymes wastefullye to spende, then warely
to keepe: by the losse of time, no man hath profited him selfe
any thing at all. Besides this, the better &amp; more precious a
thing is, the more shame to spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it fondly. Though me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kepe
their goodes neuer so close, and locke them vp neuer so fast,
yet often times, either by some mischaunce of fyre, or other
thinge, they are lost, or els desperate Dickes borowes nowe
and then againste the owners wille, all that euer he hathe.
And now though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> owner be vndone, yet is he not therfore
dishonest, considerynge honestye standeth not in wealthe or
heapes of money: But the losse of tyme, seynge it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
throughe oure owne folye, not onelye dothe it make
vs wretches, but also causeth menne to thinke that wee are
paste all grace. A wonderfull kynde of infamie, when the
whole blame shall reste vpon none other mannes necke, but
vpon his onelye that suffereth all the harme. Wyth money
a manne maye bye lande, but none can gette honestie of that
pryce: and yet with well vsinge of tyme, a manne not onely
might get him muche worshippe, but also myghte purchase
himself a name for euer. Yea, in a smal time a man might get
greate fame, and liue in much estimation. By losinge of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
wee lose little elles: by losynge of time, wee lose all the
goodnes and gyftes of GOD, whiche by laboure might be

small good with al his vnderstandyng. And therfore it is said
not without reason, that thesame is memorie to the mynde,
that life is to the body. Now then what els must thei do that

it is best &amp; moste expedient, euermore to hold fast. For, what
auaile good thynges, if we cannot kepe theim, if wee receiue

se thesame. But the memorie called the Threasure of the
mynde, lieth in the hynder parte, the whiche is made moste
perfect by temperatnesse, and moderacion of qualitees in the

harden and make thynges fast together. But now how dooe

For what other thinge els do they that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt

                     <p>Shall some gentilman playe blyndefolde at the chesse, and
can not a learned man be able to rehearse vp a score or two
of straunge names together? A Neteherde hauinge the

Fenne, that belonge to diuers menne, will not onelye tell,
who be the owners of al suche cattell, but also he wil shew
a manne twise a weeke where anye one is feading, and if he
wante one amonge the whole, he will tell immediatly what
it is, and whose it is that is wantynge. Then fonde are
they that counte the Arte of Memorye so harde, seynge
they will neither proue the hardenes of it, nor yet blowshe
at the matter, when they see pore neteherdes go so farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde

marueylous to beholde, and muche more would, if we were
not altogether slouthful, and as carelesse to kepe, as we are
to gette, good thinges I meane, not goodes of thys world.
Euerye Artificer hath through exercise and laboure, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall

                     <p>When we come to a place where we haue not bene many
a daye before, we remembre not onely the place it selfe, but
by the place, we call to remembraunce manye thinges done
there. Yea sometimes a window maketh some reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that
they haue stollen in their daies some thing out of it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a chimney telleth them of manye late drinkinges and

what a thinge is this.<note place="margin">God graunt al rebels lyke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunces.</note> It comes to my remembraunce nowe
that aboute fourtene yeres paste, I was merye here vpon

The whiche Sentence beynge a Psalme of Dauid, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge

euer and euer, here shall be my dwellynge, because I haue
chosen it. And nowe (quod he) I finde it to be ouer true, so
that I thinke it be Goddes wyl I should dye, and therfore
I take it in good worthe, and thus I desire you al to praye
for me. Thus we see that the place brought hym in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of a sentence spoken .xiiij. yeres before.</p>
                     <p>Therfore this knoweledge is not to be neglected, no tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughe
we do contemne it, yet we haue the vse of it. For if we
be fully disposed to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber a thing, we do call vp the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye,
and styrre it to mynde thynges lyke thereunto. As

then helpeth a mans wit. And yet Tullie the greatest Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
emong the Romaynes, did wel alowe it, and proued it
good by a naturall reason. For where as we knowe some
thinges (sayeth he) onelye by vnderstandynge, and some by
the sence of seynge, those we kepe best in our mindes whiche
we knowe by sight, &amp; haue marked with our eyes. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:12030:126"/>And the rather when a manne bothe heareth and seeth a
thinge (as by artificiall memorye he dothe almoste se thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
liuelye) he dothe remember it muche the better. The sight
printeth thinges in a mannes memorye, as a seale doth
prynce a mannes name in waxe. And therfore heretofore I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
were sette vp for remembraunce of Sainctes, to be
laye mennes bokes, that the rather by seinge the Pictures
of suche menne, they might be stirred to folowe their good
liuynge. The whiche surely hadde bene well done, if God
had not forbidden it. But seinge thinges muste be done not
of a good entente, but euen as God hath commaunded, it is
well doone that suche Idolles are cleane taken oute of the
churche. Marye for this purpose wherof we nowe write,
they woulde haue serued gayly well. Thus the arte is sone
tolde, but the practise of it is all. And therfore if one desire
to excell herein, let him take paynes to gather his places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and kepe them well in remembraunce, prouinge by
halfe a score, how he shall be able to vse a hundreth. And no
doubte, but time and exercise shall make him perfecte.</p>
                     <p>For the beste arte of memorye that can be, is to heare
muche, to speake muche, to reade muche, and to write much.

his bodie, and therfore reason it is, that lyke as the speache
must agree to the matter, so must also the gesture agree to
the mynde. for, the iyes are not geuen to man onely to se, but
also to shewe, and set forth the meanyng of his mynde, euen
as vnto a Bore are geuen briselles: to a Lyon, the taile: to a
horse, his cares: whereby their inclinacions and soubdeine
affections are sone espied. When we see a man loke redde in
the iyes, his browes bent, his teeth bytyng his vpper lip, we
iudge that he is out of pacience. Therefore as we
