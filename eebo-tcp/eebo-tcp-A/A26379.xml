            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ADDITION TO THE CASE of the Paper-ſellers Humbly offered to this Preſent PARLIAMENT Againſt the PAPER-BILL.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Paper-ſellers of <hi>London</hi> being very ſenſible that the Bill offered to this honourable Houſe by the New Company of White-Paper-makers would not anſwer the Name and pretended Deſign of it, but on the contrary be very deſtructive to the general Trade of Paper-making, and the Ruine of many hundreds of Families now maintained by the Making, Selling and Working of all ſorts of Paper, did therefore Petition, as the Antient Paper-makers had before done, that the ſaid Bill might not paſs, and in a true ſtate of the Caſe and Circumſtances of Paper-making, have, as they humbly conceive, made it appear that the ſaid Bill was contrived for ſiniſter ends and purpoſes of Private Men, and to carry on a Monopoly againſt the Common and Statute Laws of this Realm, and expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Statute, 21. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. againſt Monopolies and Diſpenſations with Pena! Laws, and that the ſame doth no way. tend to any publick Good, but would be very grievous to many of their Majeſties Subjects, which the ſaid New Company being not able to give a ſufficient Anſwer to, by ſeveral unttue and reflecting Papers, and other diſingenuous Practices have endeavoured to inſinuate,</p>
            <p>That they the ſaid Paper-ſellers have combined with divers Perſons to diſcourage and oppoſe the increaſing of White Writing and Printing Paper in this Kingdom: It is therefore humbly offered.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Paper-ſellers are, and will be ready when they ſhall have leave to be heard by their Councel, to make it appear as they now humbly aver; that they have not in any of their Proceedings diſcouraged, and do not deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the making of greater quantities of White-Writing and Printing Paper in <hi>England,</hi> which is evident, in that the ſaid Paper-ſellers or the Antient Paper-makers, though they have ſuffered for fifteen Years paſt very much by the Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, interloping into their Trade and Livelihoods, have not endeavoured as they might have done to ſtop or hinder the ſaid Patentees in their Proſecuting to make any ſort of White or Brown Paper, as they do at this preſent day, though they endeavour to conceal that they make Brown Paper; of all which ſorts the ſaid Paper-ſellers have from time to time bought of them, and frequently adviſed and inſtructed them what ſorts of Paper were beſt for the Markets.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Paper-ſellers can make it appear the late Patents and Grant for a Corporation to Monopolize the ſole making of White-Writing and Printing Paper were not only againſt Law, but have greatly hindred the making of that Manfacture in <hi>England,</hi> the Antient Paper-makers having been thereby threatned and over-awed from making thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Paper-ſellers do alſo moſt humbly offer that there is a conſiderable number of the Antient Paper-makers now working in Mills very proper for making of Writing and Printing Paper, and have Workmen who by their Experience well know the beſt way of ſorting white Rags to make fine Writing and Printing Paper, and by reaſon of the preſent hindrances from abroad, all the Artiſts in <hi>England</hi> are few enough to make a ſufficient ſupply of Paper for the neceſſary uſe of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And whereas the ſaid Companies laſt Paper doth inſinuate that by their Bill is reſerved to the Antient Paper-makers the freedom of making any ſort of Paper of the value by them formerly made, the ſame is untrue, for that it will, if it ſhould paſs, confine them not to make any White-Writing or Printing Paper above the value of four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ream, when as they have made many ſorts of a much greater value; beſides if the ſaid New Company were as they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the ſole Inventors and Artiſts of making ſuch ſorts, they need not deſire to confine others at all.</p>
            <p>There are many more Contradictions and falſe Inſinuations contained in the ſaid New Company's Papers, which the ſaid Paper-ſellers to avoid Prolixity forbear to take notice of.</p>
            <p>The whole conſidered, it appears unneceſſary both in reſpect of the skillfulneſs of the Ancient Paper-makers in the ſaid Manufacture, and that they want no Stock nor Mills to manage the ſame, and that this Kingdom will be ſupplyed better by allowing a free and open Trade to all Perſons that are brought up to, or underſtand, the making of all ſorts of Paper, and the New Companies Bill being in the opinion of learned Council, to confirm a notorious Monopoly, and as ſuch will be attended with deſtructive and miſchevious conſequences to the Public, the ſaid Paper-ſellers moſt Humbly pray the ſaid Bill may not paſs into an Act.</p>
