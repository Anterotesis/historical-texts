            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now I thy Tutor, louing thee faithfully, doe giue vnto thee with a most hartie &amp; Zealous good will, this

lost all her bewtye whiche had leade both her, and the Whooremonger, her vicious louer to commit euil.</p>
            <p>Thus loe by the Lawes and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes both of the Scripture and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is euidently approued, that the Whooremonger hath bene vsed to bee condemned to death, and to bee gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslye punished for adulterye, whiche thing neuer was done vpon the Dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard: by whiche onelye argumente, O Whooremonger thou art iustlye to bee adiudged farre more worse and euill then I, and so by consequence depry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of our Fathers Landes.</p>

            <p>What is there (saythe hee) more vycious and infamous, more infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hurtefull, then whordome: the whiche as by Witchcrafte or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntemente so farre transporteth the minde of man, that it throweth him from reason to beastialitye, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him not only foolish, sottish and filthye mopish, but also so madde and witlesse, that hee willingelye nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shethe the Aspe in his boosome that bytethe him euen to the hearte, not feeling the poyson so neere.</p>

            <p>At what time also that the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie King <hi>Xerxes,</hi> gaue himselfe ouer vnto luste and Whooredome, at that very same time, began both the ruine of himselfe and his <hi>Persian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</p>

            <p>Likewise many glorious publique Weales, puissant Empyres and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yea the moste mightiest, sayeth <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> therby haue ben brought

            <p>But because that bookes bee filled<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full with such thinges, &amp; that the same vnto vs al is so euidentlye knowne, I will as from superfluous matter, make my retreat, although to speake truelye, I cannot sufficientlye sette oute the abhomynation of the same sinne.</p>
            <p>For the braue and gallant traine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing therevnto is: <hi>Effemination, Pusillanimitie, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, losse, Ill happe, Infamie, Care, Greefe, Dolor, Sorow, Frenzie, Derision, Trauaile, Tribulation, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Filthinesse, Foolishnesse, Rashnes, shamelesse Malice, Couetousnesse, Sloth, Beggerie, Rage, Suspition, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, hate, Wrath, and Enmitie.</hi> To be short, as an other Poet sayeth, in speaking of the same infamous, and voluptuous loue, the cause of manye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils.</p>
            <p>Loue (sayth hee) is a gulphe of euil, meaning lasciuious loue, for it assot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the wyse, it blindeth reason, it

ouerthroweth houses, it shameth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, it ingendereth nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, and yet it is but a Smoke, which dispearceth it selfe into wind in the ayre.</p>
            <p>Likewise sayth hee, those lusting louers, (Lubbers he might haue ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them) are so tyed vnto theyre Harlottes, as their heartes, myndes, and thoughtes, are as it were impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within theire breastes, where they make them lyue and abyde in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodyes besides theire owne: in suche manner, as the Whooremonger maye saye with <hi>Plautus,</hi> where I am, I am not: and where I am not, my heart, minde, and thoughte is. To which the elder <hi>Cato</hi> agreeing in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche,</hi> sayth. The Louer lyueth and dwelleth in the bodye of hys belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>Besides, wee commonlye saye in these dayes, the mynde and affection is rather there where it loueth, then there were it liueth.</p>
            <p>If it bee then so certayne, that
<pb facs="tcp:25681:19"/>
such villanous loue is no other thing but meere madnesse and furye, and that whooredome or adultery is nothing else but distruction and infamye, doeth it not appeare more then playnelye, that the Whooremonger is the moste vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and so muche the more to bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, because of his owne free will hee subiecteth hymselfe to so villanous and pernicious a vice, for the intertaining of whiche, hee committeth a thousande euils, carrying all that hee can catche or come by, vnto his polling mistres. mooued therevnto, by the wrath and iealousye that hee hath, leaste any of his companyons, or other as honeste as himselfe, shoulde shroude themselues betweene her sheetes, a suspition sure not withoute cause, for as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Ecclesiasticus:</hi> The common woman is trodden downe vnder the feete of all passers by, as it were dyrt, and myre in the high way, for so much as it is not her nature and condition to serue onelye to one, but to intertaine manye, and of sundry Grapes to make hir Uintage, and fill vp her Barnes,

for shee openeth hir mouth to drinke of all waters, and notoriously len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and selleth hir selfe to them that giue moste, resembling (saith <hi>Plautus</hi> in his <hi>Cistellarius</hi>) a great mightie Citie which cannot come to abounde in wealth without the vse and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quention of many men.</p>
            <p>Thus by reasons before alleaged it is made manifest vnto you (right Honourable) how the whoormonger is not onely moste wicked and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, but also most filthy and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, aboue all other: in such manner, that the more I am moued against him, the more matter I finde still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding to beate downe his vile ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomious life.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I pray harken what the Mother of king <hi>Lamuel</hi> sayd.</p>
            <p>My sonne, giue neyther thy selfe nor thy substaunce to these common vncomely Curtizans: for they bee the cause of many kings destruction, neither harken thou to their deceites, sayth the wise, for their lips are like distilling honnie: but the ende more

bitter then gall. Their tongues cut as a two edged swoord: they walke not in the paths of lyfe, but their feet stretch vnto death, and their steppes vnto the pit. Make thou thy passage therfore farre from them, &amp; beware of approching neere to their houses, for who so euer followeth them is foolish, &amp; the gaine he getteth by them is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shame, reproch, &amp; dishonour, which can no waies be done away againe, yea, to be short, whosoeuer is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of harlots, is lead by them as an Ore to the Sacrifice. Auoide them therfore, for by them the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest haue binne slaine: Their houses are the wayes to death, and I haue found them saith <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> more bitter then death, for their handes bee meere hookes and limetwigs.</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer will please God lette him eschew them, for he with whome the Lord is angry shal fall into their pits, and the sinner shall bee taken in theire ginnes &amp; snares, through which many haue perished, refraine thy heart therefore from them, least thou

also perishest with them, for the false sweetnesse and honnied flatery of an harlot, hunteth after the precious soule of a man, vnto his hurt and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, drawing the vnwarie and il ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised to goe towards them to theyr shame and distruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for so much as it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peculiar propertie of harlots to consume &amp; wast al things in their filthinesse (sayth <hi>Alciat</hi>) which thinge is approued by the <hi>Acolastus</hi> of <hi>Gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feus,</hi> when he cryeth out in complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, saying: Thou whooredome, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue had for my especial freind and companion, hast caried from me, both my gods, renowne, and frindes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me in their places, thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, infamy and beggery.</p>

in the lake burning with fire and Brimstone.</p>
            <p>Then seeing that the whooremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is in such execration before God and men, it most euidently appeareth that the vice or sinne of whoordome is greatest, vilest, &amp; most infamous of all other, goe your wayes therfore you whooremongers, or adulterers, goe your way and hide your loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some heads, within the brothell hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of your most lewd lasciuious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.</p>

            <p>Also it is not without cause that the good modest Emperour, <hi>Marke Anthonie</hi> (whose historie <hi>Herodian</hi> begins) drawing neere his ende, was in a meruailous great care and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuenesse.

            <p>It commeth now to my memorye that my brother the drunkard alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he neuer heard of any law or statute that condempned the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to death, but if he had turned the lease (as it was saide vnto the Nunne that reade but halfe the Sentence and leaft the other halfe vnreade for want of turning ouer the leafe) to reade a littel farther, he had found the contrary, for onely <hi>Romulus</hi> by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe heeretoofore mencioned, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly ordeine by his thirteene lawe,

that all women drinking wyne, should be punisht with death, like to the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, the which lawe or the like, long time before the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> was made and obserued, generally through oute all <hi>Italy</hi>: where women whollye abstayned from drinking of wyne, for feare least they being ouercome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, shoulde fall into shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, they being forbidden the same, vpon payne of death, with whiche they were punished without excuse, or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of person, whensoeuer it was prooued that they had offended: The author of whiche is <hi>Denis</hi> in his anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
            <p>The which law or custome (as <hi>Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doen,</hi> the Iurisconsull in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries aforesayd, vpon the <hi>Romulan</hi> Lawes affyrmeth) in <hi>Latiae</hi> a Region of <hi>Italy,</hi> was executed onelye vppon the queene <hi>Fawna</hi> or <hi>Fatua,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Pic</hi> of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and Sister and wife to <hi>Fanus,</hi> the king of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Aborigenes,</hi> which queene hauing against the decencye of royall dignitye drunke so muche Wyne as made her

            <p>Likewise the wife of the <hi>Mecenian Egnacius</hi> (as <hi>Valerius</hi> reheareeth in his commentaries) was slayne by hir husband with whippes or wands in the caue or seller hard by the Uessell, oute of the which she had drawne the Wine that made her dronken.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:25681:41"/>And no doubt to speake vprightly, all women ouermuch giuen to drinke, little regarding sobrietie, easily and lightly doe leaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reine of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to follow &amp; prostrate themselues to all vicious thinges.

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:25681:41"/>And surelye this laudable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reason that women shoulde not drinke wine vnlesse their husbands license them, remained and stoode in effect and force a long time, among the best and most famous familyes or houses in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But passing from these prophane examples, I will a little enter among those of the sacred and holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The most mightie, iust, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God, creator of all things, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge vnto his Minister of holye thinges, sayde: When thou enterest into the witnesse of the Tabernacle, thou, nor thy children shall drinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wine, nor other thing whatsoeuer that maye make you drunken, leaste that you dye the death.</p>
            <p>In an other place by the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine voyce this warning is expreslye repeated to all, ministring in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the which besides wine ther is also comprised by these expresse words, Ale and Cider: by which words (Ale and Cider,) the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> vnderstand and signifie all sorts and manners of
<pb facs="tcp:25681:42"/>
drinke, by which a man may be made dronken.</p>
            <p>And the sayde interdiction was made to the ende that they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende and watche more holylye and warely about the diuine Ministrie: which thing they had not done, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could haue done, had they bene ouercharged or laden with wine, the onely corruption and marring of the minde and thought, the deuertor and neglector of true worship, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bate or pricke of dissolution and intemperance.</p>
            <p>For which cause the auncient Priests of <hi>Aegypt</hi> abstained wholly from wine, all the time of their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, euen from the beginning of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto the ende.</p>
            <p>That vessell of election, and most faithfull preacher of the truth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> condempning dronkennesse, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ordeined (writing vnto <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> the firste Epistle) that among other things the Bishop should be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and not giuen to wine, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off the decrees make mention, in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:25681:42"/>
place conteining these wordes: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Apostle condempneth the Priest gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to wine.</p>
            <p>And therfore his disciple <hi>Timothie</hi> dranke nothing but water, as his writing vnto him witnesseth, where he saith, let not thy drinke heereafter bee water, but for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> health of thy sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and the sickenesse, with which thou art often troubled, vse a lyttle wine. Also in the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the same most Christian Doctor saith, that dronkards shal not inherite the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
            <p>For which cause Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> forbiddeth in a manner the whole vse of wine vnto Priests &amp; Churchmen, writing and commaunding vnto his Neuew <hi>Nepotion,</hi> in this sort: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware (saith he) that thy breath doth not smell at any time of Wine, for feare least approching nere any one, thou hearest this saying of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher pronounced against thee: this is no kisse that thou presentest, but Wine, the sente of whiche, issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of thy mouthe, yeeldeth
<pb facs="tcp:25681:43"/>
a most filthy smell.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Esseans</hi> a people of <hi>Iudea,</hi> whose sect for their vertues haue ben so highly estemed by Saint <hi>Hierome, Philo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iosephus, Eusebius, Plinie,</hi> and <hi>porphine,</hi> dronke no wine at all.</p>
            <p>Was it not prophecied of that Prophet, and more then a Prophet, Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> that he should not drinke strong drinke, to the ende that he might choose the good and leaue the euill? an argument most plaine &amp; eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that wine and strong drinke cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth &amp; peruerteth iudgment and reason: and that a man ouercome therewith in steede of taking and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing veritie and vertue, taketh &amp; choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth falshoode and vice.</p>

               <hi>Salomon</hi> was of opinion that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a king it was good to minister nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wine nor stronge drinke, to the ende that he thereby might iudge the

            <p>Cursed be he saith the Prophet, that riseth early to make himselfe dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>We reade in <hi>Genesis,</hi> that dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse was the onely cause that <hi>Lot</hi> that godly man, committed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable incest with his daughters, who els by noe meanes coulde haue drawne him to such an abhomination.</p>
            <p>After the Deluge, as it is written in <hi>Genesis,</hi> as <hi>Noe</hi> first planted the Uine, first made wine and first dronk thereoff: so also he was the first that was made drunke therewith: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may gather, that if wine was nothing fauourrable to him that first made it, what fauor should any other hope to finde in it saue the like.</p>

            <p>For most certaine it is, that the more such drunkards doe drinke, the more desirous of drinke they be, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their follye and ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And sure this alteration and hot desire of wine is no otherwise ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred then by the vicious and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue vse of drinking: vnto which they be so outragiously giuen, that it seemeth rightly, that such men (if it bee lawfull for me to call them men) are not borne, but onely to deuoure, and glowse, or glut vp wine.</p>
            <p>Among which number, <hi>Nouelie</hi> a <hi>Millannon</hi> deserueth to bee put, who beeing a Consull during the time of <hi>Tiberius Cesar,</hi> and hauing droncke three <hi>Congies</hi> of Wine at one meale, (which <hi>Congie</hi> was a vessell aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conteining sixe <hi>Septiers,</hi>) had

            <p>But if dronkennesse bee so muche the more to bee blamed and abhorred by howe muche the more the partie or personage whiche is infected and noted therewith is raysed to honour &amp; digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, with what worthy note shall wee make the infamous <hi>Bonosus,</hi> that dronken Emperoure of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> was wont to say, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosus</hi> is not born to liue, but to drink. Whose death was as honeste as his lyfe, for being vanquished by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull <hi>Probus,</hi> hee ended his dayes with an halter: of whome being hanged vp in the ayre, this Prouerbe went.

            <p>Because the Drunkarde is vnwise, (sayth the most sapient <hi>Salomon</hi>) and hath no honoure nor prudence in him, I am determined to alienate my selfe and abstayne from Wine: forbidding and warning vs (as the Apostle also doth) not to be like vnto them, whiche therevnto bee inclyned and giuen, neyther to bee assistaunt at theire ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nor at the meales or banquets

of tumulous dronkardes: for so muche as of dronkennesse springeth dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, quarrels, hates, rancours, and moste often, murthers, and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is the deathe of Uertue: it is the forgetfulnesse and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of all honeste duetye, for in it, (sayth the Mother of King <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell</hi>) is no secrecie, but it vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all thinges, for the tongue of a Dronkarde cannot bee healde, it also commaundeth the wyse as well as the foolishe, the learned as well as the vnlearned, and thereof commeth, Follye, Furye, Presumption, and pryde.</p>
            <p>Also the reason why <hi>Denis</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye called <hi>Bacchus</hi>) after the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> the fyrste inuentoure of Wyne, is pictured or paynted with Hornes vppon his heade, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same goodlye God of dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kardes, didde fyrste couple Oxen togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> beleeueth, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that only by his inuention, that

is to saye, of Wine, and the outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vse thereoff, menne become hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that is to say, furious, and easilye moued to excesse and rash insolence.</p>
            <p>For onely the moste poore and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedest abiecte that is, if hee bee once ouercome with wine, hee then as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of his calling and qualitie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hornes vpon him, sayth the Poet, that is, hee rayseth himselfe vp in all fiercenesse and presumption, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the disdayning of the most noble and mighty, and like vnto <hi>Aesopes</hi> Crane, he compareth himselfe with his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and betters.</p>
            <p>Also the same is to be seene in the most ignoraunt, sottish, and vnlearned, for beeing once vppon his Hornes, you shall presently heare him, bee it righte or wrong, vppon his <hi>Ergoes,</hi> philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phying agaynst <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi>: or so encherubind, he will dispute obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately on some other Art or Science, againste the best learned and moste ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented menne that are in the world.</p>
            <p>Yea, onlye the moste wicked and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,

if he be once dronken, he will boldlye intermeddle himselfe with the most honorable, and stande vppon his slippers against the honestest man that is.</p>
            <p>For which occasion the <hi>Scithians</hi> wisely and wittily quibbing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the <hi>Greekes Orges</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanales,</hi> (which were wont to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Feaste of their dronken God <hi>Baccus,</hi> by excesse drinking of wine, in playing on Tabors, Timpanies, &amp; such like dissolate dronkennes) deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and disavowed that a God should be an inuentor of so pernicious and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing (speaking of wine) seeing that men thereby become furious and frenticke.</p>
