            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Second Addreſs directed to his Excellency the Lord Generall <hi>CROMWELL,</hi> and the Right Honourable the <hi>Councell of State</hi> ſitting at WHITE-HALL: Being, <hi>The humble Petition of Lieutenant Colonell</hi> John Lilburne.</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioner hath long ſuffered a very hard exilement from his deareſt Chriſtian friends, his neareſt relations, his eſtate, imployments, and native Country, by vertue of an Act of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And your Petitioner hath been a very gazing-ſtock beyond the Seas, and in conſtant peril of his life, only for his love to this Commonwealth, and faithfulneſs to their ſervice.</p>
            <p>That the late Parliament being diſſolved, and the preſent care of the Government devolved upon your Honours, who profeſs the fear of the Lord, and the deſign of advancing Chriſts Kingdom; your Petitioner believed that he ſhould find mercy and impartial juſtice from you, and a readineſs to looſe every heavy yoke, and cut in ſunder all wicked bonds, the Lord having led you forth to break many of the bonds of men, in order to thoſe ends: And in this confidence the Lord perſwading your Petitioners heart that he had mercy for him and his poor ruined family, in his own Country, reſolved to depend upon your Juſtice and goodneſs to protect him, and to admit of a Legal examination of the late Parliaments ſentence of Baniſhment againſt your Petitioner: But having thus caſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himſelf and his life at your feet, he finds your Order to apprehend him, and execute the ſaid Sentence; whereupon he is now a Priſoner.</p>
            <p>That the authority of the late Parliament being taken from them for miſgovernment, your Petitioner hopes you will pleaſe to ſuſpend at leaſt the execution of any Acts made by them, which ſhall not clearly and evidently appear to your ſpirits and conſciences to have ſuch Juſtice in them, as God may be truly glorified in your execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. And therefore he humbly offers to your conſiderations theſe things following concerning the Act made by them for his perpetual baniſhment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, that the Parliament in the ſaid Act did not judge your Petitioner an Offender according to any Law in being; and unleſs there were a Civil Law againſt what he had done, he was no Offender in the leaſt againſt the Laws of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the ſaid Act is a Law made after a fact is done, to ordain a puniſhment for that fact which was never ordained or heard of before; and if that practiſe be admitted, the very foundations of all Government (which are Laws) are utterly overturned, and every Man governing may deſtroy all or any of the governed at his will, without poſſibility of account to man; for that cannot be given or taken, but by a Rule between the Governours and the governed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, That your Petitioner was not tryed with liberty of defence, for or againſt any of the pretended crimes, for which he was baniſhed by the ſaid Act; for nothing was examined by the Committee of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon whoſe Report the ſaid Act was made; but the matter of Mr <hi>Primats</hi> Petition, for whom your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner appeared only as Councel; and if that was ſcandal, and your Petitioner concerned therein, he conceives that he ought then to have been tryed legally for that crime at the Common Law, and no where elſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, that if your Petitioner were guilty of Scandal againſt Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg,</hi> as the Parliament had judged; yet that ſentence of abſolute Ruine to him and his whole Family is not a puniſhment proportionable to the Offence; and the Laws of God, and the Fundamentall Lawes of this Land require a proportion between Crimes and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, that if the ſaid Act he admitted to be Juſt, and to be drawn into Preſident, then no Engliſh-man whatſoever can juſtly or rationally claim from the Governors any Freedom, Right, benefit, or Priviledg of being Tryed and Judged according to the Laws, whether he offends or not, or whether his Life, Liberty, or Eſtate ſhall be taken from him, or preſerved.</p>
            <p>And your Petitioner further Offers to your Honors, that he hath neither in the leaſt offered, nor intended any Contempt unto any Authority, in coming into this Nation againſt the ſaid Act; he humbly conceiving, That in this juncture of Time, wherein the Parliament is diſſolved, and Right is declared to be univerſally done to all of this Nation, he was capable of making his humble Addreſſe to thoſe who have ſo Declared, as a Party much grieved by the ſaid Act of the late Parliament.</p>
            <p rend="indent italic">Therefore the whole Premiſes conſidered; he humbly prays your protection, and ſuſpention of any proceedings against him upon the ſaid Act, untill the Juſtice of the ſame, as to the matter and manner of it, be legally exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; That whatſoever he now ſuffers, being to be under your Power, your Conſciences may be clearly ſatisfied, that you do therein glorifie God, and do evident good to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <closer>And he ſhall pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
