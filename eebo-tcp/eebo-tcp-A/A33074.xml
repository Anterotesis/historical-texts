            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>She</hi> (says he) <hi>knew full well, that her Legitimation and the Popes Supremacy could not stand together, and that she could not possibly maintain the one without a discarding of the other.</hi> And what follows, we more feelingly know than Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> viz. That the Answer of the <hi>Pope according to his accustomed vigour: That the Kingdom of England was held in Fee of the Apostolick See; that she could not succeed being Illegitimate; that he could not contradict the Declarations of</hi> Clement <hi>the Seventh, and</hi> Paul <hi>the Third; That it was a great boldness to assume the Name, and Government of it without him,</hi> was not only the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but also of all the Distractions and Miseries this poor Land has suffer'd from that day to this. And all this upon a frivolous account of a pretended Donation of this Kingdom to the <hi>Pope</hi> by King <hi>Iohn</hi> the usurper; which had been equally frivolous, had he been never so lawfull a King.</p>
            <p>But! what a Bottom is this to build a Church upon? And to forsake the Communion of a Church professed so many hundreds of years, and established by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Laws in the Nation; because forsooth the Queens <hi>Legitimation, and the Pope's Supremacy could not stand together?</hi> We read, that <hi>the Gates of</hi> Hell <hi>shall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against the Church of</hi> Christ: But had the Pope, and the Queen, known how to have adjusted their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, this <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> had been extinguisht in the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> had never been seen, nor heard of in the world. And will any man in his wits repose his hopes of salvation in a Church, that came from so bare an accident, so meer a chance as this, midwived into the world by a Maiden Queen to make good her Legitimation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40256:3"/>Moreover, we read, that <hi>Christ will be with his Church to the end of the world.</hi> But (I pray) when did he begin to be with <hi>this</hi> Church? was it when the <hi>Queen</hi> had made good her Legitimation? She has not done it yet. But, (as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> well observes) <hi>Bacon was not to be told of an old Law-maxime; That the Crown takes away all defects:</hi> Which, it seems, in the language of the Law, was a <hi>Tantamount</hi> to a <hi>Legitimation</hi>; and on this <hi>Tantamount</hi> was first erected the <hi>Crown,</hi> and on that the <hi>Church</hi>; as tho' the Law-makers ever meant, that that odd scrap of Law should be extended to Legitimate, whom the Law had illigitimated; which, if so, might as well have legitimated the Rebellion of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> (had he clapt the Crown on his head,) and made him a lawful King, tho he had been a Bastard into the bargain. And now, I think, here is enough said of the fundamental and final Cause of the Church of <hi>England, viz.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>accustomed Rigour,</hi> and the <hi>Queens legitimation.</hi> I will now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Embryo of this Church in the rest of her Causes, according to Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and then I hope I shall have truly <hi>Represented</hi> her according to her best, and most beloved Historian.</p>
            <p>I find no greater Enemies to Reformations, than Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; each Reformer, like the Ape in the story, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>Brat</hi> the fairest, would have no Reformation stand good but his own; and therefore reviles and flouts at the rest as whimseys and phancys; as indeed they are no better, nor his own neither. Who ever saw more bitter scolding, than between the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians,</hi> and the <hi>Calvinists</hi>? the worst of men cannot be represented greater Villains, than they represent each other; and, if a man considers them rightly, he will find
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40256:4"/>
no other truth but This in all their Volums; and yet some of them are very voluminous too. In like manner does the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> revile and flout at the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in his <hi>Cobler</hi> of <hi>Gloucester</hi>; and serves Her up to his Readers in whole <hi>Cart loads</hi> of debauched Ministers and prophane Bishops: But indeed the Church of <hi>England</hi> reviles and ridicules the Presbyterian with much more wit and far greater civility in her <hi>Hudibras</hi>: But, with too much Rigour too: For she will not allow <hi>Sow-Gelders when they wind their horns to geld a Cat, to cry</hi> Reform: <hi>Nor an Oyster-wench to shut up shop, and trudge about to cry</hi> no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; as tho' <hi>Sow-Gelders</hi> might not as well cry <hi>Reform the Church of England,</hi> as a pack of Laymen in Parliament, cry, <hi>Reform the Church of Rome</hi>; or as tho' an <hi>Oyster-Wench</hi> might not as well cry <hi>No Bishop,</hi> as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> cry <hi>No Pope.</hi> How can it enter into the head of an Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal man, that a Church of so long standing, as the R. Catholick Church had been of continuance in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; backt by so many Old Laws, could on a suddain be lay'd aside, with all her Doctrins, and a new one foist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into her place with new ones, without either Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark of the West, Primates of the Land, or Bishops at all to it.</p>
            <p>This is the case of the Church <hi>England,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> makes it out as clear, as ever the sun shin'd at noon day. He tells you, that in the beginning of that Parliament, 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Which Parliament made, and establisht the Church, that the Oath of Supremacy was tendered to the Bishops; upon the refusal whereof, they were cast out of PARLIAMENT, all but Bishop <hi>Kitching</hi> who took the Oath, but never was PROTESTANT notwithstanding. Then it is evident, that the old Bishops were not in Parliament at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40256:4"/>
the devising and making of this Church. He begins the 2<hi>d.</hi> year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with the consecrating of the new Bishops, <hi>Parker</hi> and the rest; then they were not in Parliament neither at the devising and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Church: for the Church was made and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht in the first year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; the Church to this day dates from this first <hi>of Elizabeth,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>ab urbe condita:</hi> And therefore my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Finch</hi> in an eloquent speech to the Parliament, learnedly declared unto them, that she was a Church now of above a hundred years standing, meaning from this first of <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> Then you see that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> has made it as clear as the sun, that there were no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at all at the making of this Church.</p>
            <p>Men of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> now tell me, Are not Bishops of the Essence of God's Church? no Episcopal man ever deny'd it. And men of the Law, tell me, Are not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops so of the Essence of this Government, that there can be no Parliament without them? no Lawyer can deny it. Then here is a Church set up in spite of God, and in defiance to the fundamental Laws of the Land. And this forsooth is your <hi>Church by Law establisht</hi>! Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht! with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to the very Essence of the Government by Bishops, which <hi>God</hi> set over his Church; and to the Essence and foundation of th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Government of this Realm: So that, unless the deserting of one Church for <hi>lust, spoil, rapin,</hi> and <hi>sacriledge</hi> be the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, making and establishing of another; there has been neither Church made, nor setled, nor establisht since the defection from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to this present time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40256:5"/>Then is it not severe, that after all this ado and noise of a <hi>Church, Articles, Tests, Laws</hi> penal and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary to compel men from their consciences, there should not be the least semblance or shadow of a Church to invite them unto: Nor had the <hi>Queen</hi> with her Lay-Parliament any more Power or Authority by the laws of God, and his Church founded on Episcopacy, to make, alter, or establish a <hi>Church,</hi> than has the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Women,</hi> and the poor man that crys it up and down the Town, Power, or Authority to make a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and establish it when he had done, by crying it about the streets: Nor do I see how it is possible for any Episcopal man to have confidence to pretend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>With good Reason then did the late Dutchess of <hi>York</hi> of happy memory declare, that instead of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the <hi>History of the Reformation</hi> recommended to her for that purpose, she found nothing, but <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the horridest sacriledges in the world; and could find no Reason why we left the Church, but for three the most abominable ones, that were ever heard of amongst Christians. First, Henry</hi> 8<hi>th renounces the Popes Authority, because he would not give him leave to part with his wife, and marry an other in her life time. Secondly,</hi> Edward 6<hi>th was a Child, and governed by his Vnkle, who made his estate out of Church-Lands, and then</hi> Queen E. <hi>who being no lawful Heiress to the Crown, could have no way to keep it, but by renouncing a Church, that could never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer so unlawful a thing to be done by one of her Children. I confess, I cannot think the</hi> Holy Ghost <hi>could be in such Counsels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40256:5"/>The Church being thus truly represented, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be nothing; it must necessarily follow, that her Bishops and Priests are likewise nothing, as to any <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> or <hi>Mission,</hi> they can pretend to: And <hi>how shall they Preach, unless they be sent?</hi> For in a Bishop, is required not only Ordination, but also Spiritual Jurisdiction and <hi>Mission,</hi> and both these are derived not from Kings, or Queens, but immediately from <hi>Christ</hi> by succession from the <hi>Apostles:</hi> Then the Church of <hi>England</hi> being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in Communion with no other Episcopal Church; by what succession will her Bishops derive their <hi>Powers</hi> from the <hi>Apostles?</hi> Do they think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> sent them to Preach the Doctrine of the Thirty Nine Articles? No, it cannot be so imagin'd; and therefore the Presbyterians derive their <hi>Mission extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> from <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> well knowing, that it were impossible for them to derive it <hi>Ordinarily,</hi> by succession through the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from Christ and his Apostles. So that 'tis a clear Case that the pretended Bishops of <hi>England</hi> have no <hi>Mission</hi> nor Power at all, to do what they do, but from lay Authority.</p>
            <p>But, indeed, as to the <hi>Ordination,</hi> it is quite an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: for the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Donatist</hi> Bishops were true Bishops as to <hi>Ordination,</hi> tho by Apostacy and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie they had lost their <hi>Mission.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the like of the Bishops of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and to clear all doubts to the contrary, tells us, that the story of the first four Bishops of his Church being merrily ordained at the <hi>Naggs-head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 294</note> was but the invention chiefly of one <hi>Neal,</hi> once Hebrew reader in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Chaplain to Bishop <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40256:6"/>
and Dr. <hi>Sanders</hi>; and thus like an erudite Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, learnedly and compendiously confutes them both: <hi>Sanders</hi> he calls <hi>Slanders</hi>; and as for the other, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that he was once Chaplain to <hi>Bonner,</hi> and so their business is soon done.</p>
            <p>He also tells us, that <hi>George Abbot,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> caused several Priests and Jesuits, then Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Clink to be brought before him: <hi>Who being brought to</hi> Lambeth <hi>the Twelfth of</hi> May, 1613. <hi>were suffered in the presence of diverse Bishops to peruse the publick Registers, and thereby to satisfy themselves in all particulars concerning the Confirmation and Consecration of Archbishop Parker.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> is indeed a very punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man; you see he sets down exactly the day of the Month, and the year this happened, <hi>viz.</hi> The Twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> 1613. But Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> was consecrated in the second year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 1559. Then where were these Registers all this while? Dr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> Dr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> even in the time of Archbishop <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and to himself called his Consecration in question, and denyed it, without any Reply either from himself or any body else in his behalf. Then where were at that time these same Registers?</p>
            <p>But suppose these Registers true, and that the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration was at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and the Consecration-dinner only at the <hi>Naggs-head,</hi> did not multitudes of people flock to see the great solemnity of Consecrating the first four new Bishops of the Novel Church? and was not the Dinner well attended on by multitudes both of men and women (for they are also curious, especially in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40256:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church affairs) and were all these men and women dead on a suddain, that none should be left alive to witness against <hi>Neal</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> that they saw <hi>Parker</hi> Consecrated at <hi>Lambeth?</hi> Or could so great a man as Dr. <hi>Sanders</hi> have the confidence to broach such a <hi>Tale</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> calls it) when multitudes of eye-witnesses were alive to give him the <hi>lye?</hi> Had those Registers been found out in any competent time, and flapt in the faces of <hi>Neal</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> and the rest who reproached the Church with her <hi>Naggs-head</hi> Consecration, they might all have been justly called <hi>Slanderses</hi>; but instead of finding such Registers, the Church and State politickly combined to renew the statutes against <hi>Tellers of false news,</hi> that a poor Papist if he passed through <hi>Cheapside,</hi> durst not so much as look toward that side of the street, where the <hi>Naggs-head</hi> stood, for fear of being punisht as a <hi>Teller of false news:</hi> for the looks of a Papist in those days boaded false news; as a Wash-ball in his pocket of late boded <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap> firing of the City.</p>
            <p>And indeed, to produce these Registers Fifty four years after the time, and not before, when <hi>Neal</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> the Vintner of the <hi>Naggs-head,</hi> his wife, drawers, and all were dead; was to as much purpose, as if they had left them at <hi>Salamanca</hi> in Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Library to be brought over with the Forty Thousand pilgrims, 1678. <hi>September,</hi> the Lord knows when; for <hi>Oates</hi> did not confine himself to a day as Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and <hi>Mason</hi> the forge<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the Registers did. But Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> treats of this matter here <hi>en passant</hi> only, and refers his Readers for their further satisfaction to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40256:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the begining of his eight and last book, where thus he tells his own Tale worth any mans reading.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Nothing remaineth, but that we settle the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government; and then it will be time to conclude this History. And for the settling of this Government by as good Authority, as could be given unto it by the Laws of the Land, we are beholding to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy of Dr. <hi>Edmund Bonner,</hi> late slaughter-man of <hi>London.</hi> By a statute made in the last Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament for keeping her Majesties Subjects in due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a Power was given unto the Bishops to tender, and receive the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> to all manner of persons dwelling and residing in their several Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses. <hi>Bonner</hi> was then prisoner in the Clink or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalsee;</hi> which being in the <hi>Borrough</hi> of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> brought him within the Iurisdiction of <hi>Horn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> by whose Chancellour the Oath was tendered unto him: on the refusal of which Oath, he is indicted at the Kings <hi>Bench</hi> upon the Statute: to which he appeared in some Term of the year fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The second Principal Plea was this, that <hi>Horn</hi> at the time the Oath was tendered, was not Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and therefore not impowred by the said Statute to make tender of it by himself, or by his Chancellour. And for the proof of this, that he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40256:7"/>
was no Bishop, it was alledged, that the form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of Archbishops and Bishops, which had been ratify'd by Parliament in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> had been repealed in the first year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and so remained at <hi>Horn's</hi> pretended Consecration. The Cause being put off from Term to Term, comes at last to be debated amongst the Iudges at Serjeants Inn, by whom it was finally put upon the Issue, and the Tryal of that Issue ordered to be committed to a Iury of the County of <hi>Surry:</hi> But then withall, it was advised, that the decision of the point, should rather be referred to the following Parliament, for fear that such a <hi>weighty matter</hi> might miscarry by a Country Iury, of whose either Partiality, or Insufficiency, there had been some proof made before touching the Grants made by King <hi>Edwards</hi> Bishops, of which a great many were made void, under pretence that the Grantors were not Actually Bishops, nor Legally possessed of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sees.</p>
               <p>According to this sound advice, the business comes under consideration in the following Parliament, which begun on the Thirtyeth of <hi>September,</hi> where all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars being fully, and consideratly discoursed upon, it was first declared, that their not restoring that book to the former Power in Terms <hi>significant,</hi> and <hi>express,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40256:8"/>
was but <hi>casus omissus</hi>; And secondly, that by the Statutes Fifth and Sixth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, it had been added to the book of Common Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments, as a Member of it, or at least an Appendant to it; and therefore by the first of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was restored again, together with the said book of Common Prayer, intentionally at the least, if not in <hi>Terminis.</hi> But being that the words of the said Statute were not clear enough to remove all doubts, they did therefore revive it now, and did accordingly Enact, That all persons that had been, or should be made, ordered, or Consecrated Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Priests, Ministers of God's Holy Words, and Sacraments, or Deacons after the form and order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the said book, be in very deed, and also by Authority hereof declared and enacted to be, and shall be Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Priests, Ministers of God's holy Words and Sacraments, and Deacons rightly made, Consecrated and ordered, any Statute, Law, Canon, or any thing to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A bold Parliament indeed, that thus generously bids defiance to all Laws and Statutes ever made in the world, to all Canons ever made in God's Church, and to every thing else whatsoever. To good purpose then did Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, and Bishop <hi>Lawd</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, declare that they gave the like credit to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40256:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
first four General Councils, as to the four Evangelists; when an English Parliament shall come and enact and declare Bishops in the form they please with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to all the Powers of Heaven and Earth, or <hi>any thing to the contrary notwithstanding,</hi> i. e. of Hell too.</p>
            <p>But being that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> tells us, that this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, was onely <hi>fully and considerately discoursed upon in Parliament;</hi> it may I hope yet bear a further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion and canvassing. You see, here were many doubts whether these Bishops were rightly consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because the Form of Consecration made in King <hi>Edwards</hi> days, was declared void and null in the first year of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and as yet has never been allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because you see, there was a <hi>Casus omissus,</hi> and the Form of King <hi>Edward</hi> was not restored in <hi>Terms express</hi> and <hi>significant,</hi> which is requisite in Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To talk of a Statute once made null and void, <hi>intentionally</hi> is non-sence: For Intention will not make Law; neither is it in Church affairs, nor indeed, is it any where else, as it is in <hi>England,</hi> where there are definitive Interpreters of Law, and no Law Text, and where there is Gospel and no definitive Interpreters of the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because, <hi>the words in the said Statute were not clear enough to remove doubts</hi>: Then 'tis clear that there were doubts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Because the Doubts were so many, that the whole Power of the Kingdom, Queen, Council, Church and State, durst not venture a tryal against a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40256:9"/>
poor Prisoner, (notwithstanding that the business was order'd for a tryal by Serjeants Inn) to see it fairly decided, whether the Doubts could be removed or not, <hi>for fear such a weighty matter might miscarry by a County Iury,</hi> as tho' it had not been in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make what Jury they pleased.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Bonner</hi> tho' a Prisoner, enjoyed his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue all this while by dint of Law, that is, from the first of <hi>Eliz.</hi> to the eighth of <hi>Eliz.</hi> because <hi>Horn</hi> in all this time could not prove himself a Bishop: Then the Law did not look upon them as yet Bishops. But, all the Bishops were made in this time, and all that pretend to be now Bishops are derived from them; Then how sacrilegious were those Bishops that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred the Sacraments and conferred Orders, whilst so many Doubts remained. Whether they were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained, or had any lawful Jurisdiction or not. And of this there can be no question, nor can any man deny it.</p>
            <p>But now comes the Parliament, the Doubts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and <hi>Horn</hi> gets his Cause; But how? were both Parties heard? No; nor durst the Parliament hear what <hi>Bonner</hi> could say for himself, nor what his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers could say for him neither, who were Eminent Men, as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> tells us, <hi>Wrey, Lovelace</hi> and <hi>Ploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> nor is it to be imagined that such Eminent Men would have undertaken so invidious a business to Church and State, unless they had foreseen, that the Cause was sure enough in their hands. It is a received Maxim throughout the world, that <hi>Qui judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat causa inaudita altera iniquus est Iudex;</hi> He that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without hearing both Parties is a wicked Judge. But this Parliament judged without hearing both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40256:9"/>
then this was <hi>iniquum Parliamentum, iniquus Iudex</hi>; a wicked Parliament, wicked Judges: then what are the Bishops, who are no otherwise Bishops, than by verdict of such Iniquity? But this is not all.</p>
            <p>Either those Bishops of whose Consecration there were so many Doubts were in this Parliament or not? Of right they could not be there until the Doubts were removed: But either they were, or they were not? If they were, can any thing be more pleasantly ridiculous, than to see the very men in question whether Bishops or not, sit judging in Parliament, and voting themselves <hi>to be in very deed, and also by Authority hereof</hi> (that is, of themselves) <hi>declared and enacted to be, and shall be Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>rightly made, consecrated, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; any thing to the contrary notwithstanding.</hi> This is far worse, than ask my Brother if I am a Thief. In fine, it is so ridiculous, that for soberness sake, we will suppose, that those pretended Bishops did not sit in that Parliament. Then was the Parliament but a pack of Laymen; and what have such to do with enacting or declaring of Bishops? Bishops derive their ordination and the power that follows it, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Christ himself by succession from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, (as I said before) and not from <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Queen;</hi> It is a thing purely spiritual, and therefore cannot fall under the cognizance of any Temporal Power: So that the pretended Bishops were no more Bishops for this Act of Parliament, than they were before: For such a Parliament neither had power to enact them Bishops, nor to declare them such? so that all the former Doubts yet remain, and reach our present pretended Bishops equally, and as much, as they did
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40256:10"/>
the former. But it is <hi>Sacriledge</hi> for any pretended Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to offer to administer the Sacraments, and confer Orders, when but one Doubt remains, whether he be rightly in Orders himself, or have Authority to do it; Then greater is the <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> when men offer to administer the Sacraments and confer Orders, when so many Doubts remain whether they be in Orders, or rightly authorized to do such Acts.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, how came Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> so well acquainted with Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> that he should know which were his chief Pleas, or what he would chiefly have insisted upon, had the <hi>weighty matter</hi> been suffered to have come to a hearing? Did he think the story of the <hi>Naggs-head</hi> less known to <hi>Bonner,</hi> than it was to <hi>Neal</hi> and <hi>Saunders?</hi> or can any man in his wits believe that the whole Power of the Realm, Queen, Church, Parliament, Council and all, were in earnest afraid the <hi>weighty matter might miscarry by a County Iury,</hi> either by <hi>Partiality</hi> or <hi>Insufficiency</hi>? Was it impossible for the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> to have found in the whole County of <hi>Surry,</hi> twelve men according to their own hearts? And could not they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed them as far as they pleased, that there could not be any fear of Insufficiency? And could not they have made them wholly their own, that there could be no fear of Partiality, at leastwise towards <hi>Bonner</hi>? And if all other means had failed, could not they have brib'd and suborn'd them? A more necessary Policy <hi>then,</hi> when the <hi>weighty matter</hi> was at stake, than ever there was occasion for the like since. And does Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> call the declining of this Tryal <hi>sound Advice</hi>;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40256:10"/>
Certainly, when this question was started, <hi>Bishops or not Bishops?</hi> And that <hi>the Cause, debated amongst the Iudges at Serjeants Inn, was finally put upon the Issue, and the Tryal of that Issue ordered to be committed to a Iury of the County of Surry,</hi> it was necessary the world should be satisfied. But the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, either that such things would be brought upon the stage, as would be very dishonourable to both, or that the pretended Bishop <hi>Horn</hi> would be cast. And then whither would her <hi>Majesty</hi> have sent for Bishops to Consecrate her new <hi>Elects?</hi> The Catholick Bishops would not do it, and of that she had a Tryal in <hi>Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin.</hi> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> would not do it; for Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> tells us, that they would not receive English fugitives in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> time, and that they called such as dyed here then, the <hi>Devils Martyrs.</hi> So that the Church of <hi>England</hi> must e'en have been an Episcopal Church without Bishops. And that had not been more ridiculous than it was infamous, and Scandalous to have declined the Tryal.</p>
            <p>That my Reader may the better remember, what has been said; I thus in short Recapitulate it. Th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Bishops of this pretended Church are no Bishops at all; or at the best, they can but pretend to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops with many doubts on their backs, whether they are Bishops or not; and consequently must lye under the guilt of Sacriledge for Administring the Sacraments, and conferring Orders, those doubts still remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear'd, nor possible now ever to be so. For no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Parliament can ever do it: nor if it could, were it ever possible for them to prove by what Lawfully Authorized Successor's of the Apostles, they were sent to Preach the Doctrine of the Thirty Nine Articles.</p>
