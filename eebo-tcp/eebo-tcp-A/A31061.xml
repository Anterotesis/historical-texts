         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either as it is
in it self, wrapt up in unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
Folds of Mystery;
or, as it hath discovered it
self, operating in wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Methods of Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48063:3"/>
As it is in it self, 'tis an
Object too bright and daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for our weak Eye to
fasten upon; an Abyss too
deep for our short Reason
to fathom. I can only say,
That we are so bound to
mind it, as to exercise our
Faith, and express our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
in willingly believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in submissively ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
those high Mysteries,
which are revealed in the
Holy Oracles concerning it;
by that Spirit it self, <hi>which
searcheth the Depths of God,</hi>
and by that Only Son of
God, who residing in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Bosom, hath thence
brought them forth, and
<hi>Expounded them</hi> to us, so far
as was fit for our Capacity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48063:3"/>
and use. And the Lectures
so read by the Eternal <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> the Propositions
uttered by the Mouth of
<hi>Truth it self,</hi> we are obliged
with a Docile Ear, and a
Credulous Heart, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> there is One Divine
Nature or Essence, common
unto Three Persons, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibly
Vnited, and ineffably
Distinguished; united in Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Attributes, distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by peculiar Idioms and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
all equally Infinite in
every Divine Perfection, each
different from other in Order
and Manner of Subsistence;
that there is a mutual inexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of One in All, and All
in One; a Communication
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48063:4"/>
without any Deprivation or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
in the Communicant;
an Eternal Generation, and
an Eternal Procession without
Precedence or Succession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proper Causality or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
A Father imparting
his own, and the Son receiving
his Father's Life, and a Spirit
issuing from both, without any
Division or Multiplication of
Essence; <hi>These are Notions
which may well puzzle our
Reason, in conceiving how
they agree, but should not
stagger our Faith, in assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they are true. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which we should medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
not with hope to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
but with disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to admire, veiling our
Faces in the Presence, and
prostrating our Reason at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48063:4"/>
the Feet of Wisdom so far
transcending us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be those, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot untie, dare
to cut in sunder these Sacred
Knots. Who, because they
cannot fully conceive it, dare
flatly to deny them. Who,
instead of confessing their
own Infirmity, do charge
the plain Doctrines and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
of Holy Scripture
with Impossibility. Others
seem to think, they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
these Mysteries
by Arguments grounded
upon Principles of Natural
Light, and express it by
Similitudes derived from
common Experience. To
repress the Presumption of
the former, and to restrain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48063:5"/>
the Curiosity of the latter;
the following Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(improved by your
Thoughts) may perhaps
somewhat conduce.</p>
            <p>We may consider, <hi>That
our Reason is no competent or
capable Iudge coneerning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of this Nature.</hi> 'Tis
not sufficient, nor was ever
designed to sound such
Depths; to descry the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Principles of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
to reach the extream
Possibilities of Things.</p>
            <p>Such an Intellectual Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
is vouchsafed to us,
as doth suit to our Degree
(the lowest Rank of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Creatures) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
our Station in this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48063:5"/>
inferior Part of the World;
as may qualify us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the petty Businesses
committed to our Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the facile Duties
incumbent on us. But to
know, <hi>What God is; How he
subsisteth; what he can; what
he should do;</hi> by our natural
Perspicacity, or by any
means we can use, farther
than he pleaseth to reveal,
doth not suit to the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Condition, or
the Narrowness of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.
These really are
the most elevated Sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the abstrusest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
that are, or can be in
the nature of things. He
that can penetrate them,
may erect his Tribunal any
where in the World, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48063:6"/>
pretend justly that nothing
in Heaven or Earth is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But in truth, how unfit
our Reason is to exercise
such Universal Jurisdiction,
we may discern by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it to our Sense. It is
obvious, that many Beasts
do (by advantage of a finer
Sense) <hi>See, Hear, Smell</hi>
things imperceptible to us.
And were it not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to conclude, that
such things do not exist, or
are in themselves altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
insensible, because they
do not all appear to us? Is
it not evident, that we
ought to impute their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibility
(respecting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48063:6"/>
us) to the defect of our
Sense, to its Dulness and
Grossness, in regard to the
Subtilty of those Objects?
Even so may Propositions in
themselves, and in regard
to the Capacity of higher
Understandings; (for there
are gradual Differences in
Understanding, as well as
in Sense) be true and very
intelligible, which to our
inferiour Reason seem unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
or repugnant to
the Prenotions, with which
our Soul is imbued: And
our not discerning those
Truths, may argue the
Blindness and Weakness of
our Understanding, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fault or Inconsistency
in the Things themselves.
Nor should it cause us any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48063:7"/>
wise to distrust them, if
they come recommended to
our Belief by competent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>It cannot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
out of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
drawn from ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Experience,<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> about these
most low and imperfect
Things to collect; that
there can be no other kind
of <hi>Vnions,</hi> of <hi>Distinctions,</hi> of
<hi>Generations,</hi> of <hi>Processions,</hi>
than such as our own gross
Sense doth represent to us.
Reason it self more forcibly
doth oblige us to think, that
to sublimer Beings there do
pertain <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Existence</hi>
and <hi>Action, Vnions</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
Influences</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations</hi>
of a more high
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48063:7"/>
and perfect Kind: Such as
our course Apprehension
cannot adequate, nor our
rude Language express:
Which we perhaps, have
no Faculty subtile enough to
conceive distinctly, nor can
attain any congruous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
from which to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
solidly about them.
No Words,<note place="margin">

Things, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and adequately suit to
a Mystery, so much remote
from the common Objects
of our Knowledge, so far
transcending our Capacity.
Shall we then, who cannot

            </p>

not diluting it with baser
Liquors of Humane Device.
That where God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
his definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
our Reason hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do but to attend
and submit. No Right to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48063:10"/>
Vote, no Licence to Debate
the Matter. Its Duty is to
listen and approve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God speaketh, to read
and subscribe to whatever
he writeth. At least in any
case it should be mute, or
ready to follow <hi>Job,</hi> saying,
<hi>Behold, I am vile, what shall
I answer thee? I will lay my
hand upon my mouth,</hi> Job

            <p>In fine; The Testimony
of God, with a sufficient
clearness represented to the
Capacity of an Honest and
Docile Mind (void of all
partial Respects, and clear
from all sorts of Prejudice;
loving Truth, and forward
to entertain it; abhorring
to wrest or wrack Things,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48063:10"/>
to use any Fraud or Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon any Principle,
or Ground of Truth) the
Testimony of God, I say,
so revealed, whatever Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
our shallow Reason
can thrust in, should abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
convince our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and constrain our
Faith.</p>
            <p>If the Holy Scripture
teacheth us plainly, and
frequently doth inculcate
upon us (that which also
the uniform Course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World
doth also speak) <hi>That there
is but One True God. If it
as manifestly doth ascribe to
the Three Persons of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Trinity, the same August

Names, the same Peculiar
Characters, the same Divine
Attributes (essential to the
Deity) the same Superlative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admirable Operations of
Creation and Providence: If
it also doth prescribe to them,
the same Supreme Honours,
Services, Praises and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
to be paid unto them
All;</hi> this may be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough to satisfy our
Minds, to stop our Mouths,
to smother all Doubt and
Dispute about this High and
Holy Mystery.</p>
            <p>It was exceeding Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in God, that he would
condescend so far to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us; to disclose so No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Truth unto us; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
our Minds with that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48063:11"/>
that <hi>most
excellent Knowledge of himself.</hi>
And it would be no small
Ingratitude and Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in us, any wise to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his Word, or pervert
his Meaning; any wise to
subject his Venerable Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to our rude Canvasses
and Cavils.</p>
            <p>In fine; The proper Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of our Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these Mysteries, is not
to search and speculate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, to Discourse
flippantly and boldly about
them; but with a pious
Credulity to embrace them,
with all humble Respect to
Adore them.</p>
