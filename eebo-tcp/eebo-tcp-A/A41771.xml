         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Likewiſe it is the propertie of a Church well conſtitute; alſo it is the dutie of all Believers to ſeek for unity and Love: Yet this mark is not inſeperable, for it can be among Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, 13 Theſe ſhall have one mind, and ſhall give their ſtrength and power to the Beaſt: And this alſo can be among Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors going on in a courſe of defection, as we have the Example of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael Exod</hi> 32.

               <hi>Axiom</hi> or <hi>Carmen.

            <p n="5">5 But Fiftly the impurity of your Doctrine appears in the miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and that falſly both as to mercies and Judgements. (1) as to mercies let it be conſidered what you were a people laying in ſin, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the benefit of your ſinfull Toleration, under your late King, and acknowledging him to be your lawfull King in prayer before God; altho' afterwards in a printed declaration in the year 1689 the Crown was acknowledged to be Vaccant, by reaſon that he was a Papiſt, and had had not taken the <hi>Coronation Oath;</hi> But formerly you did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he was an Inſtrument to open the doot of libertie to your Goſpel (as you called it) So that in this you acknowledge your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to be begun, and him to be Inſtrumental in it; And if this was then how you could caſt him off? &amp; be ſo unthankful for your Mercies. But if you own that Declaration of the States, in the Year 1689; Then you muſt acknowledge your Sin in owning of him anie manner of way: And that either by Addreſſing of him for your Libertie; or yet confeſſing him to be an Inſtrument of Deliverance, otherwayes you cannot date your Deliverance, nor yet point out the Inſtrument of it, ſeing it cannot be aſcribed to two oppoſit inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſent and late King. So that in this you Mercies are contradictorie, both as to the inſtruments, and alſo the time of deliverance; and by conſequence one way or other, according to your own confeſſion, and practiſe, muſt be miſapplied. So that in this, no tender Conſcience dare join with you. But furder let it be conſidered, who are the object of Mercie; &amp; then it will appear, to whom the deliverance belongeth, I ſay doth not Mercie belong to theſe that are in Miſerie; I mean theſe who ſeeth and confeffeſſeſs themſelves ſo to be, as in 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7 11. <hi>If my People which</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97875:8"/>
               <hi>are called by my Name, ſhall humble themſelves and Pray and ſeek my Face, and turn from their wicked wayes: then will I hear from Heaven and will forgive their Sins, and heall their Land.</hi> So that it appears, from this that deliverance belongeth only to a penitent People. Alſo in the Book of the <hi>Judges,</hi> it is ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That they cryed unto the Lord; that is by Repentance and Confeſſion of Sin (for no other Prayers are heard of God <hi>Jo.</hi> 9 31) And he ſent them a Deliverer: So that from this you ſee that the object of Mercie, is only the Penitent, that confeſſes their Sin: which cannot be ſaid of you, who hitherto hath never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged your Eraſtian courſes of defection, in the matter of the Indulgence and Toleration, contrair to the Example of the People of God in former times, who were plain and particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in <hi>Ezera</hi> 9 2. The ſtrange Marriages are confeſſed: But no Confeſſion to be ſeen of the ſtrange Marriages, that hath been made with the Enemies of God, by you in the forenamed Sins. Alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then how can you apply Deliverance, ſeing ye have no warrand from Scripture ſo to do; when all circumſtances are conſidered, and whatever you have done or may do in this; Yet be aſured that your Application of Deliverance is not of any other nature than that ſpoken of in <hi>Jer.</hi> 14 12. <hi>A falſe Viſion and Divination and, the deceit of your own Heart.</hi> Now this being your ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then is your preſent temporal proſperity, not anie other thing, but an Judgment, like to that ſpoken of <hi>Jer.</hi> 13 13, 14 <hi>verſes, viz.</hi> Fair flouriſhing providen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now in the firſt place, if we have done any thing that we are not bound and engaged both from the Word of God, and our Covenants, expreſlie to do: Them we ſhall take with our Guilt.</p>

            <p>So that we are willing to reaſon the Matter, and to put our courſes

               </gap> practiſes of our Anceſtors. Therefore I ſhall in the firſt place confider the Seperation, in it's riſe and progreſs, as to the time when it firſt began, and that was in the Year 77 and 78, This E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raſtian Weed, did then appear in that Presbytrie at <hi>Edinburgh &amp; Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore,</hi> where Mr, <hi>Richard Cameron</hi> was Cenſured for his Preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and the indulged Miniſters (who received the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencie after <hi>Pentland,</hi> in the Year 67, and when accuſed beſor them, he declared that his Accuſations did prove him to be a Presbyterian, for he had done nothing, but what was agreeable to Gods Word, and the Conſtitutions of the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And therefore he would decline anie ſuch Presbytrie as lawful, who would ſo accuſe the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of Guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; which they could not prove. I ſay at that time the <hi>Twins</hi> began to ſtruggle in the Church Womb; as did appear by the Malice, Clamour, and Reproach, that theſe Miniſters did vent againſt Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> for his declining of them, they thought this was a ſin of a deep dye. But alas! no Lamenting for Truth, that was wronged by the Indulgence, and the defence thereof, as appeared by their giving by Names to all theſe who were againſt the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Indulgency,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them <hi>Cameronions.</hi> Now as this Eraſtian weed did ſtill grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe: So likewiſe the Faithful did ſtill adhere to Truth; as did appear at <hi>Bothwell,</hi> by their caſting off the Tyrrants Intereſt, declaring a War againſt him, &amp; all the Men of his Practiſe, as ſtated Enemies to the Church of Chriſt. But the other Party who favoured the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie and Supremacie, emitted a Declaration contrair to the former, taking in the Tyrrants Intereſt, acknowledging him to be their lawful King, Notwithſtanding of all the Tyrranie that had been done by him againſt the Work of Reformatſon, from the Year 61 to the Year 79. where he did appear in War, againſt the Intereſt of Chriſt. So that you ſee that it was a Contradiction to them, to ſay that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Intereſt of Chriſt, and the Intereſt of his Enemies, they being oppoſit, the one to the other, Alas! this was the curſed <hi>Achan</hi> in the Camp' for which <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtand before the Eumie; as in <hi>Joſh.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97875:9"/>
7. So that from this you ſee, that the Separation was materialie begun before <hi>Bothwell;</hi> But not formallie brought forth (in all it's Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) until the Act of <hi>Indemnity</hi> afterward was proclaimed; which Proclamation the indulged did willinglie accept, at which time they ſeparated from the Faithful. From which time we are willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our Actions, ever ſince the Year 79. and that becauſe in your National Faſt in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Firſt, If we have done any thing, that we are not bound and engaged, both from the Word of God and our Covenants to do; then we ſhall take with our Guilt.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall give a Narration and Account of our Proceedings, in that ſad Day of the Church calamitie, under the indulgencie in the Year 1680, It's ſaid <hi>Job</hi> 17 8 9 <hi>

And this they did in as legal a way, as the preſent Circumſtances could permit.

but they failing in this. by their defection and complyance, ſilence and connivance at the Tyrannie commited in this caſe, it becomes the ſubjects (altho' privat perſons) to aſſume to themſelves that power of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws and Kingdom, which they have Forefaulted. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if a City were Beſieged by an Enemie, and the Magiſtrats and theſe who had the power would conſpire in one, with the Enemy to deſtroy the Citizens, were it not their duty, to take the power (which they have abuſed) and defend themſelves their Lives and Liberties. Now this being our caſe, then no reaſonable man, I think will condemn what we have done, conſidering the grounds and reaſons abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Now this Repreſentative power was firmly owned and avowed, by all the Nonconformiſts in the Year 1680. 1681, and 1682. But in the Year 1633, they began to faint the eminent godly, in whom the Life and ſubſtance of this dut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e was, were in a great part taken away, by ſuffering in Fields and Scaffolds; and the remaing partie who were Faithful proteſted againſt theſe failings, but were not heard: So that at length, they denyed that they acted Authoritatively in theſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations above mentioned, where the judicious Reader may diſcern the contrair, by ſuch congruous expreſſions, as is uſed for expreſſing the nature of the Action. But now this hopeleſs party of Nonconformiſts, has turned their Teſtimonies to Proteſtations; That when Kings and Queens comes to the Throne, they enter a Proteſtation againſt them: But what is that to the purpoſe? What if all the Shires in <hi>Scotland</hi> would ſend a Thouſand Arm'd Men to the chief City of every Shire, to declare againſt them? And there reſt on their Proteſtations, would thus effectuat any thing? Certainly no, the only duty is to call a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, and put on Authority and take to them that power which they have Forfaulted, and by vertue of that power they may proceed againſt them, with the Sword of Juſtice; and this power belongs only to the faithful of of the Land, who are the true Sons of the Church and State. Alas! this fainting did ariſe from the weakneſs of their Love and Faith; they thinking, this was a work too hard for them (who were ſo few) to carrie on againſt ſo great a Generation of Malignants, and Backſliders. Likewiſe that it was mocked at by wicked Men and carnal Proffeſſors; as a thing deſperat, that would bring forth much

Blood and Confuſion: Whereas a dutie is ſtill abſolute and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible; and therefore to be gone about in Faith, truſting to the alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiency and faithfulneſs of God, for throwbearing.

            <p>But this ſhall more appear in the, following head, which is That if any thing be done, that an Indiſpenſability or abſolute neceſſity did not not call for? then ſhall we acknowledge our ſelves tranſgreſſors; and this <hi>I</hi> endeavour to prove by ſeveral Arguments; as (1) from the nature of the ordinance, Magiſtrats being ſervants, to the common wealth, and nouriſhing fathers to the Church; ſo that they are made for the peoples good, as in <hi>Rom:</hi> 13. and not the people for their Tyrannicall Luſt and uſe. <hi>Ergo</hi> from the nature of the ordinance it is a dutie indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to caſt off Tyrannie.</p>

               </gap>tence, otherwiſe we muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Sin, and conſequently of their Judgment. Now let the Judicious Reader conſider this, and then he will ſee, that we have done nothing, but what is juſt and right and agre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ble to Gods Will and Word, in our caſting off of him; who had manifeſtly caſt off God, as you ſee by what is ſaid above.

            <p>Now I ſhall in the next place ſpeak to the third head, which is that if the Mercies and Deliverance of the Church hereafter, for the time to come, ſhall run in any other Channel: than what we have eſpouſed, then ſhall we acknowledge our ſelves tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now this I prove, firſt from the Mercies of God, in that they do not extend towards unbelievers, ſuch as the impenitent. (I mean Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mercies) but only towards the Faithful, who are keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and adhearing to their Vows and Engagments: Such the Lord has promiſed to be with, as in 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15 2. <hi>The Lord is with you while ye be with him.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To repair and build a civil ſtate (that's defaced and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97875:15"/>
by reaſon of Tyrannie) is a work of Gods Mercie and Love, &amp; doth terminat only in Believers, ſo that they are the Inſtruments in and by whom the Lord will build this work, they being led by his Word &amp; Spirit, and the promiſe belonging only to ſuch, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4 6 <hi>Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit ſaith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Now ſeing they are the inſtruments; Then let none carp at the manner of this Dutie, for we have done nothing but what is agreeable to Gods Word and Will. as I have clearly held out. But on the other hand let theſe who condemn this dutie, conſider that what we have done, will not fall to the ground, or be buried. For certainly there is no Action, but muſt either be Sin or Dutie. I ſay there is no Action ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>in individuo,</hi> Thats to ſay, conſidered ſubjectively as to its riſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, object and end, but muſt be morally good, or elſe morrally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (indifferences layes in certain degrees or circumſtances) then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence this Action, muſt be either put among the Sins of the Fathers or elſe among the duties of the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers; for certainly one of the two muſt be. And I think it is impoſſible to make this Action a Lands Sin, conſidering the invincible grounds and reaſons given above.</p>
            <p>Now having held out the lawfulneſs of our rejecting, and caſting Tyrany off, and that the Mercies and Deliverance of the Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run in any other Channel.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the next place, ſpeak to the manner of Government, and Governours, that we contend for: Which is found in that Covenant, drawn up by Mr. <hi>Cargill,</hi> in the Year 1680, where we do declare that we ſhall ſet up over our ſelves, and over what God ſhall give us power of Government (and Governours according to the Word of God, and eſpecially to that word <hi>Exod.</hi> 18 21) <hi>viz.</hi> That we ſhall no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Government of our ſelvs to one ſingle Perſon, or lineal Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That is Monarchy Government: But the Government we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to is a Common Wealth; but whether ARISTOCRATICAL or DEMOCRATICAL or a mixture of both, we will not at preſent determine: We ſeing that Monarchie is very lyable to incoveniences, and apt to degen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rat into Tyranny, as long and ſad experience has taught us, this flowing from the natures, humours, and inclinations of the People, and eſpecially the Nobility, who hitherto has driven Kings

to Tyarnnie, inſinuating themſelves in their favours, by their makeing a Sacra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ice of the Lands rights and Liberties to them, that thereby they may partake of the ſpoill of the Poor ſubjects, of which we can give innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and ſure inflances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that we may ſee that if their be any thing that ſtands in our way? of changeing rhis Goverment. There are but two things that ſeemeth to have weight.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt if the deed and obligation of our Anceſtors? can bind us to Monarchie Government by lineall or hereditary Succeſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, if it be in the power of people to choiſe any form or kind of Government? that they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Now as to the firſt I ſay the contract and Obligation of the fathers (ſimply conſidered as an Obligation of the fathers) can never bind the poſterity; and that becauſe a Contract or Covenant is called by POLITITIANS, <hi>

Now the Children not yet exiſting, cannot be ſaid to be Agents in this bond neither can it bind them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing all men are born free: that is to ſay, with the free exerciſe of reaſon, to choiſe that which is good, and to refuſe what is evil. <hi>I</hi> ſay all our O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ligation flows <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> thats to ſay from the nature of the thing. in ſo far, as that Obligation tends to the glory of God, and ſaftie of the Kingdom, in preſerving maintaing, and carrying on of Religion and vertue in the Land, in this we are bound, this being the chief and principle end of all our Actions. But on the other hand, when this end cannot be obtained: Then are we free from the Contract and Obligation of the Fathers; this Contract being conditional, ſo that now it is looſed, and that <hi>ex na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tura rei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it be in the power of the People, to choiſe any form or kind of Government that they pleaſe? Thats moſt for the good of the Land, and ſafety of the Kingdom. It is affirmed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe we are not bound to Monarchy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and lineal Succeſſion, by a Divine Precept, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were: for this was Typical of Chriſt, and promiſed to them from <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Juda, <hi>nor a Lawgiver, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Feet until</hi> Shiloh <hi>come.</hi> Now from their Example, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proven that we are tyed, to that particular kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97875:16"/>
Otherwiſe, if by their example this had been, then ſhould it have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yed every individual Kingdom, to this kind of Government: But the contrair is ſeen, and alſo taught by all found <hi>juriſts:</hi> For Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to choiſe any kind of Government, that they ſee moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the nature of the People, and ſaftie of the Kingdom, in which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vertue may moſt flouriſh and grow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> All ſound Polititians acknowledges, that under the Yoak of Tytanny, the People may either change the Government or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Now the Family is only to be changed, where Monarchy ſuits well with the Kingdom. But alas! by ſad experience, the contrair has been ſeen in <hi>Scotland</hi> (ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Moreover in the next place we declare, That theſe Governours, that we contend for, <hi>Shall be able Men, ſuch as fear God Men of Truth, hating covetouſneſs,</hi> as in <hi>Exod</hi> 18 21 Ilay their Qualifications, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally are contained in theſe three things. 1 That they be Men of ſound principles. 2.

as our manner was in the year 80<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for no other way can better remove envy, ambition and contention among a People, then this way can do, Now I think from the Grounds and Reaſons abovementioned, it will appear, That the Government we have choſen, is the only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iteſt Government; And likewiſe that the Qualifications of the governours are agreeable to Gods word, and conſequently to his will; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be embraced by all theſe who deſires the ſafetie and wellbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom. Therefore I ſhall lay down three conſiderations (as motives) flowing from the miſeries of choiſing any other kind of Government, or Governours, than what we have eſpouſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I ſay to theſe who contends to have one King with <hi>England,</hi> let ſuch conſider the Miſeries that will follow upon this choiſe, and let theſe be grounds and motives to diſwade any wellwiſher to the Kingdom from embracing of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to matters of Religion, conſider the corruptions of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by reaſon of the prevailing power of Prelacie, rooted in that Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſmall inclination that the Presbyterian Partie hath to a Lands Reformation, by Covenant Vows and Engagments, in order to caſt out Prelacie: So that by this neglect the prelatick Partie are ſtrong in power, which makes their Kings <hi>Jeroboam</hi> like comply with them, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they cannot poſſeſs the Crown and Kingdom, if they do not ſo. Now <hi>Scotland</hi> having caſt off Prelacie, and ſworn againſt it; can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver embrace and receive that King who complyes with Prelacie; and inveſts himſelf therewith; neither can a King ſerve two Maſters at once: For this were to build and deſtroy <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> which is a compleat contradiction. Therefore none Godly, whoſe Conſciences are not by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed and prejudged, will ever ſubject themſelves to ſuch a King, altho they ſhould ſuffer the utmoſt of Cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to vertue and exerciſe of Trade, how much is this Land oppoſed, hindred, and impriſoned by that Nation of <hi>England</hi> (as ſad experience has taught us) they having the Seat of the Throne and Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Helm, Adviſing and Counſelling their Kings, not to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance nor aſſiſt <hi>Scotland</hi> in the exerciſe of Trade. But on the ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

others, has ſpoken Learnedly and reaſonably upon this head: And I think it is approven by the whole Land; except only by theſe few, who are by aſſed, prejudged, and bought for Self Intereſt, to the Selling and betraying of their Nation. Now from the Conſideration of what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, I think we may be moved to reject that King: And if we may refuſe and reject him upon the account of Prelacy: Then much more may we refuſe that Popiſh Prince (who pretends to a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redetarie Succeſſion, contrair to the Lands Engagements and Laws) u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Account of Popery, whoſe intention without doubt, is to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now having commented at large upon theſe three heads, becauſe in them, the moſt material and ſubſtantial part of the Contraverſie did

lay: I ſhall in the next place, proceed to conſider the premiſſes, that you lay out againſt us (in your Phamphlet called the Seaſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition) taken from the Writings of Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> concerning Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Diviſions, which Premiſſes, I ſhall ſpeak to in order as they lay. Ye ſay we may and ought to endeavour Union, though there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things defective: This likewiſe I acknowledge, for no perfection is to be obtained Heir on Earth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But firſt you ſay. Though there be differences of Judgments in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, namely in ſuch things as are conſiſtent with the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Edification. It may be interrogat what Sins can conſiſt with the Foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So that here, <hi>Durham</hi> underſtands ſins of ignorance of duty, becauſe he ſaith, Mens underſtandings are not perfect, nor of equal reach. Now ignorance or ſimple infirmity, can never be cauſe of Seperation: Seing Separation conſiſts, either in Defect or elſe in Exceſs. Now it cannot be ſaid, That a Man in ignorance has made Defection; becauſe he never knew no better, nor yet was ever furder reformed; and therefore no ground there is to withdraw from him, nor yet from any Church that owns him as a Member. ſo long as his ignorance is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat and wilful, and that in oppoſition to all warning: But this do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. But Secondly, You ſay though there be diſſatisfaction with many Perſons, whether Officers or Members? To which I <hi>Anſ.</hi> Perſonal ſins, can never make any ſeparat from a true Church, who doth not aid and aſſiſt them in their ſin, nor yet from the guilty Perſons themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be obſtinat Deſenders thereof: But indeed if they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> there is one Remonſtrator in it, God and Chriſt hath not left that Church, and therefore Man ſhould not leave it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly he ſaith Union may be conſiſtent with many particular failings and defects in the exerciſe of Govrnment, as ſpareing ſome corrupt members and cenſuring others unjuſtly. To which I Anſwer, it would be interrogat, if the Aſſembly underſtands theſe defects? in ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome, from the rod of diſcipline to be ſimple deference flowing from the ſin of infirmity and deadneſs, not obſtinat; but ſubject to faith full warning, if this be? then their ought not to be ſepration But when the exerciſe of Diſcipline is not only defered, and delayed out deneyed, and the deney all thereof becometh an eſſential pillar of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: ſo that the free exerciſe of diſcipline is inconſiſtent with the being thereof, which is the caſe of your Church this day, and Therefore when this is, then their is cauſe of ſeparation; ſo the contraverſie is not about defering of diſcipline but the denaying and laying aſide of it in its free exerciſe as to all Perſons and Ranks without exception, which is your caſe this day. Moreover we acknowledge that no Church can be without failings and faults, for no perfection is to obtained in the Church milit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant here on Earth But however the endeavour of dutie, is not to be laid aſide, for we ought to ſeek perfection, withall Chriſtian ſincerity and prudence, Altho' we may faill and come ſhort therein.</p>
            <p>Furder you ſay there was in the primitive Churches a tollerating Iezabel and the Nicolaitans to which I anſwer: it cannot be denayed but it was ſo: however, was it not in them a defect and ſin? and was it not diſpleaſing in the ſight of GOD, as in <hi>Revelation</hi> 2, <hi>Chap</hi> 15, 16, and doth not the Lord highly praiſe and commend the faithfull exerciſe of diſcipline in the primitive Church? as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2 2 I know thy works and thy Labour and thy patience, and how thou canſt not bear them? which are evill and thou haſt tryed them which ſay they are Apoſtles and are not, and haſt found them liars what ſhal I ſay then in this? doth the great Aſſembly Glory in the defects and ſins of the primitive Churches; endeavouring to like them in evill, or ſay you that your caſe, and theirs is one, if this ye ſay, then I do deny.</p>

Than to teſtifie againſt your Sin, by our withdrawing from your deſtroying courſes. Oh! how miſerable would this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

If we were all jointly going on in Sin, and reſting ſatisfied with our Deadneſs and Toleration: Can ye ſay then that the ſins of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches were in oppoſition to all warning, I mean after that the holy Apoſtles did Write unto them; and if this you cannot do; then ye ought not to defend the ſtate of your Church, from their Example. But 2. Can it be ſaid that the exerciſe of Diſcipline, in the Primitive Churches was inconſiſtent with their being and Foundation, certainly it was not, for they could extend the Exerciſe of Diſcipline towards all that were Baptized and receaved into the Church, without reſpect of Perſons, as all Faithful Churches may and ought to do: But the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Diſcipline is inconſiſtent with your being and Foundation; by reaſon that you dare not Cenſure and reprove the Sins of all Ranks of ſuch as are Baptized, which Sins and Perſons, I ſhali have occaſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſpeak more particularly, when I come to the Sins and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations led againſt you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Ye inſiſt furder and ſays, That ſuch Defects as do not make Communion in a Church, and in its ordinances ſinful, will not warrand a Separation. <hi>Anſ,</hi> Theſe def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

This I ſay, doth coincidat with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Objection annent the inceſtous Perſon: Therefore I ſhall leave it while afterward. Moreover in Pag. 324. Ye ſay if a Man

be put to condemne anything he thinks Laufwll in his own practiſe, or the practiſe of others. or 2. if he be put to approve the deed or parctiſe of others, which he counted ſinfull, or affirme that to be truth, which he counteth error, theſe ye ſay may hinder union, this is likeways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſins. Now conſider the nature of the ſin wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the man is to condemn ye ſay that which he thinks lawfull in himſelf or, others, or to approve that which he thinks unlawful in others. I ſay no privat man can Separat from any particular Perſon upon alleadged offence without revaling the caſe to the Repreſentatives of the Church and if the offence be clearly decided already to be ſin by the Church: Then the Church is to Act Faithfully in it; and the Accuſer ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye inſtance Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> who ſpeaks of them who have the pure word of God Preached, and the Sacraments duly Adminiſtred, what if many of them led a Life contrair to what they profeſs? and yet the Governours uſe not the Rod of Diſcipline to cenſure them; Then whether ſhould the Members ſeparat from that Church, yea or no? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> A contrair practiſe can never be ſaid to ſubſiſt in Exerciſe (if ſtrickly taken) without a contrair Profeſſion, when Tryed and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined: For the will muſt be active either in choiſing or refuſing, or approving, or defending; or elſe diſſapproving. Now when Sin is defended, then a Man doth join his Profeſſion to it by the defence of his Practiſe, declaring that his Sin, and he is Friends, So that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Profeſſion is nothing elſe, but a ſhadow, becauſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat it is a duty to Cenſure ſuch; and the omiſſion is a Sin. The Queſtion then is, What ſhall the diſſatisfied do, whether ſeparat or no? <hi>Anſwer</hi> When duty is neglected, in ſuch a caſe, they are to uſe all Chriſtian means and prudence in the firſt place, to awaken them out of that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and deadneſs: And that by admonition again and again, by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97875:20"/>
holding out the Burden, that is on their Conſcience by reaſon of that neglect. All this muſt be done, before they ſeparat: For Seperation can not be, but where Sin is obſtinatly defended, nouriſhed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and that not only by a part, but by the whole. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Governours muſt either approve or diſapprove this neglect; if they approve the neglect and abuſe of Diſcipline, received and owned of them formerly: Then they fall in defection from their firſt Love, which is a ſin that the Lord hath threatned to puniſh, with no leſs than his leaving and departing, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. And when the Lord leaves the houſe, why ſhould Man abide in it?</p>
            <p>Furder it is urged, That the inceſtuous Mans Sin not Cenſured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Church, the infected Church infecteth the Worſhip. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection is moſt ſubtile, being hung up in the <hi>Abſtract</hi> a part from Exerciſe; but hower let us firſt conſider the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nceſtuous Perſon by deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſining him as he is in his Sin. I ſay the inceſtuous Perſon obſtinatly defending and impenitently Perſevering in his ſin, belongs materially (though not formally caſt out) to that Body and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which Satan is the head, the Church not conſenting, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving; but hating and abhoring the ſin, belongs to that Body of which Chriſt Jeſus is the head.

Only two pure Negatives or two Particulars, between which there is no Connexion, thats to ſay, The inceſtuous Perſon is not of the Church; and again the Church hath no affinity with the inceſtuous Perſon, and if no connexion? Then conſequently, no concluſion can be drawen, the ſin being Perſonal, and therefore no juſt cauſe of Separation from the whole.</p>
            <p>Now we are confident, That what is ſaid anent theſe premiſſes, drawn from theſe two Learned Pious Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> concerning the practiſe of riged Separatiſts; it may appear to any that are not byaſſed and prejudged, that we do not come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of Riged Separatiſts, ſeing we do acknowledge, That Separation is not to be ſtated, but where ſin is obſtinatly maintained, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and defended, and that not only by a part; but by the whole; and that in oppoſition to all warning as yours is. So that from this you ſhall never defend your ſelves by the Example of the Churches of

            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhall in the next place proceed to the complaints and ſins led againſt you. Where firſt it is ſaid we complain of Miniſters Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, that ſome are light and frothy. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This complaint is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the preſent contraverſie; our contraverſie not being about Perſonal ſins, but about your foundation and being. I ſay perſonal Accuſation, belongs to a Church right in its conſtitution, and pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the well being of it; So that we are not to think that any Church ever was, or ever will be (though never ſo pure) without Perſonal guilt, ſo long as the Church Millitant is upon Earth. Therefore I do reject this complaint, as being unfit for the preſent contraverſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye ſay there is many complaints of the Exerciſe of Diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Government, ſuch as it is much neglected, or but partially Exerciſed: Inſufficient Miniſters admitted, and Scandalous Elders. <hi>Anſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> This complaint is raſh and evil concocted, being a Remonſtrance belonging to a true Church, right in its Foundation and Conſtitution, and nowayes belonging to an Eraſtian Church. As for the neglect and partiality of Diſcipline. I ſhall ſpeak to it, when I come to illuſtrat the preſent ſtate of this Eraſtian Church, by ſhewing, that neglect and partiality are the eſſential Pillars and Props, on which this Church ſtands; and that the Faithful Exerciſe of Diſcipline, is inconſiſtent with the being thereof. As to the admitting of inſufficient Miniſters and Scandalous Elders. I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is a Circulating in affirming, that Scandal admitteth of Scandal. Now yield, that Miniſters and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were ſufficient, and free of all Scandal, dot not their joining with the preſent Church? make them ſcandalous, and doth not our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in withdrawing from them? declare it ſo to be, by our not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97875:21"/>
nor owning them as lawful Miniſters. But I hope this raſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding, of Remonſtration, will be acknowledged to be wrong after conſideration, and ſo will be amended by my Brethren.</p>
            <p>As for receiving of Currats, and not Excommunicating the Prelats. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This ſame Remonſtrance is Genuine with the former; for who can lawfully Excommunicat; But the Faithful, I mean theſe that has not changed their head Chriſt Jeſus: For i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this Church might Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat the Prelats; and the Excommunicating of them were a valid du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the ſight of God, and coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But take head Brethren what our Lord ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 42. <hi>Firſt caſt the Beam out of thine own Eye; and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly, to pull out the Mote that is in thy Brothers Eye.</hi> So I ſay, let the Miniſters of this Eraſtian Church, firſt caſt out the Sin of the Eraſtian Indulgence and Toleration (under their late Kings) by humble acknowledgment of the guilt thereof, in its high Aggra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> You ſay the inſtances we chiefly inſiſt upon, are the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Indulgence and Toleration, that theſe are either juſtified, or not confeſsed and condemned. Your <hi>Anſwer.</hi> is (1) You ſay that it is undenyable, that there were different Sentiments and Practiſes annent theſe things, amongſt them that were Reputed, Learned and Pious, and had ſuffered for their cleaving to the Government of this Church. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I wonder that the great Aſſembly, who profeſſeth to have ſo much Goſpel purity and ſimplicity; ſhould ſo jugle and ſhuffle over ſuch a great contraverſie with ſuch ambiguity and boutgates as to ſpeak of different Sentiments without ſpecefieing the Sentances. What doth the Aſſembly mean by their Sentiments? if they do underſtand incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and incommodities, about certain degrees and circumſtances: Then may I ſay, no Action ever was, ſince there were Plurality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World; but had different Sentiments: Some ſees more inconveniences, ſome leſs; And how oft doth it run that length? <hi>Quot capita tot Sententiae,</hi> thats to ſay. How many Heads, ſo many Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; So that every one almoſt hath their peculiar and proper Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97875:21"/>
Now on the other hand if ye underſtand theſe different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to be about the ſinfulneſs of the Indulgence and Toleration: Then why have ye not been plain and particular on the matter; by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the Hainous Aggravating nature thereof, in order to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our Conſciences. Certainly the Spirit of God (who knows all things, and the Burden that is on us by reaſon of that ſin) never led you to ſuch ambiguity as to ſpeak of different Sentiments.</p>
            <p>You ſay that is not the controverſie of our day, there is no matter nor occaſion of debate annent them now, nor any practiſe annent them now, that may be an offence to any Miniſters are no where now ſetled by Indulgence or Toleration. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This I deny, for ſtill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſie remains ay &amp; while the Sin be confeſſed and forſaken. True it is the Indulgence is over; but what change is come in its roum, not a change from ſin to duty, but from one ſin to another, from one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtian Toleration to another (as I ſhall make it appear afterward) ſtill ye are going on in the ſame ſin, which is an argument ſufficient in place of all other arguments, to prove the <hi>Indulgency</hi> and <hi>Toleration</hi> to be a ſin; becauſe ye are deſerted of God by reaſon of the guilt thereof, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2. So that ye are never in favour with God, nor honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him to own duty, but ſtill goes on in the ſame ſin: For what can obſtinat <hi>Sinners</hi> do? but ſin, ſeing the Lord is not preſent with them, to lead them by his Spirit. Furder I would interrogat the great Aſſemby, how they parted with the <hi>Indulgency</hi> and <hi>Toleration?</hi> that's to ſay, Whether they parted with it as Enemies to it; or as Friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, you have parted as Enemies to it: Then ſurely you have particulared both the Enemy and the Enmity, by holding out the high Aggravating nature and circumſtances thereof, as a Man uſes to do, with his Enemy, he will ever ſay the moſt and worſt, he can ſo ſhould ye be particular about your ſin, according to the Example of true Penitents in Scripture, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 14. <hi>Deliver me from Blood guiltineſs,</hi> and in <hi>Ezera.</hi> 9. 2. The ſtrange Marriages are confeſſed, but no confeſſion of the <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Toleration;</hi> neither in your National Faſt and Humiliation, in the Year 1690, you have not ſo much as once named the ſin. True it is ye ſpeak in Scripture Language, but they are general Scriptures, and general Confeſſions, &amp; binds your ſelves to them, and ſo burieth the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97875:22"/>
               <hi>Sins</hi> in contraverſie: yea and in this preſent Teſtimony, you cover &amp; hids this <hi>Sin</hi> with Boutgats and ambiguity, by ſpeaking of your diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Sentiments:</hi> So that when all this is conſidered, then it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Aſſembly hath not parted with the <hi>Indulgency and Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> as Enemies to it, but as Friends: And therefore by conſequence the contraverſie betwixt us remains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You ſay when pious and peaceable Divines treat of the peace and Unity of the Church, they adviſe to forbear the reviving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of former times among the Godly, or engaging to declare <hi>Men Sentiments</hi> annent them; as being con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rair to the peace and Edification of the Church, when preſent duty is not concerned: Or when it is not about a Fundamental truth or Neceſſar duty: And the forbearance doth not mar any duty, that the Church in general is concerned in, or in danger the Salvation of Souls, throw the want of clearneſs therein. <hi>Anſ.</hi> When debates are not about a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Truth and Neceſſar duty? Then it is not to be revieved: But our contraverſie is about a <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> Truth and neceſſar duty, being about the Kingly Authority of Chriſt Jeſus, that he is the only King and Head of his Church; &amp; ſo by conſequence the Bloody <hi>Perſecuting</hi> Magiſtrat hath no power to preſcribe and give a limited <hi>Indulgency or Toleration.</hi> For 1. I ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Church in her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſential parts, conſiſting in Authority and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. I mean the Head and Members, which is one body. How then can this Body admit of two diſtinct Authorities, or how can O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience conſiſt with it? I ſay can the Church which is Chriſts Body, ſerve two Heads? would not this make the Church a Monſter? to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of two diſtinct Authorities, and doth not this overturn the nature and Vows of Baptiſm? we being receaved into the Church as Members, and ſubjects to become obedient to the Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Kingly <hi>Government</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus, How then can any of the ſubjects become a Head contrair to Baptiſm? or how can any within the Church? give obedience to that Head, or can their obedience (though under great pretences of Liberty) be called any thing, but ſin and bondage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſo long as this Authority is retained and keeped; ſtill there is limits ſet to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church; by reaſon that although the Diſcipline were Exerciſed towards all; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannot
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97875:22"/>
reach this Head: And therefore at beſt the liberty is but a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and then by conſequence this liberty, (as they call it) is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the free, and Faithful Exerciſe of <hi>Presbyterian Government,</hi> and doth overturn the Foundation thereof, which is the caſe of the great Aſſembly in the matter of the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and the late and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj</hi> But ſome will object and ſay, Why may not a liberty be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from a Perſecuting Enemy; as for example, If the King of <hi>France</hi> would proclaim a Liberty to all the Baniſhed Proteſtants, were it not duty to them to imbrace the offer? <hi>Anſ,</hi> This I deny, and the reaſon is, That this he muſt do either as an Enemy or abſolute Maſter over the Church, or elſe as a Friend and Subject to the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt. Now as an Enemy retaining and adhearing to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Idolatrie, without repenting of his cruel Bloody Tyrranny former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed, in this he cannot give a liberty to the Goſpel; Becauſe it involveth a contradiction, by reaſon that he cannot ſerue two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, <hi>viz.</hi> The Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, and his Popiſh Idolatry: For this were to build and deſtroy <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> thats to ſay once and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which is a compleat contradiction according to our Saviours Words <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters: for either he will hate the one and love the other: or elſe he will hold to the one and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the other.</hi> Thats to ſay, He cannot with full D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſingle love, and fidelitie, ſerve them both (they being oppoſites) for Love and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity terminates only in one ſingle object; So that from this you ſee, that as an Enemy he can never give libertie to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As a Friend and Subject to the Crown and Kingdom of Chriſt, he cannot retain an Authoritie over the Church, that is <hi>Supra Sacra,</hi> by preſcribing Bounds and Limites to the Doctrine, Diſcip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, and Kingly <hi>Government</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus. But on the other hand as a Subject, he is to exerciſe his power <hi>Circa Sacra,</hi> that is that the power of Doctrine and Diſcipline be Faithfully exerciſed (in the Land) by theſe to whom the power is committed, and that according to Gods Word without partiality, and reſpect of Perſons. And when this or ſhall be, then he declares himſelf to be guilty of Death, by reaſon of his former ſins, in ſheding the Blood of Innocent Perſons, by reaſon that the Law
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97875:23"/>
of God requires that ſuch ſhall die, as in <hi>Num.</hi> 35, 31. <hi>Ye ſhall take no ſatisfaction for the Life of a Murderer, which is Guilty of Death: But he ſhall he ſurely put to Death.</hi> And Verſe 33. <hi>The Land cannot be cleanſed of the Blood that is ſhed therein, but by the Blood of him that ſhed it.</hi> Now if the King of <hi>France</hi> Act as a Friend and Subject, then he will acknowledge his Subjection to the Kingdom of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then by conſequence will deny any Authoritative Superioritie over the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Moreover in the next place, Proteſtants can never imbrace that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (as they call it) and the reaſon is. 1. it ſets limits to the extent of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſpel in its Doctrine, which is to go throw all Nations (and conſequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntly all places of the Kingdom) and teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever, I have commanded you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. Now if they ſhall declare this Command Faithfully, <hi>viz.</hi> That Popiſh Idolatry is to be rooted out of the Land, and not to be permitted, and Tyrrannie to be caſt out, and that the Throne and State are to be Reformed, and that Men of Truth Fearing God and hating covetouſneſs, are to be inveſted with the preſent power, that Juſtice may be Execute on the Guilty without reſpect of Perſons. Now I think this will overturn their Liberty, and make it null: And no otherwayes can they Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do, if they obſerve all that is given them in Commiſſion as Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul Ambaſſadors (in the Name of God and Chriſt) who are to declare the whole Will of God unto the People. So that from this you ſee, that a ſinful Indulgence is inconſiſtent with a Goſpel Liberty: And therefore nowayes to be imbraced, by any that profeſſes Jeſus Chriſt to be King and Head of his Church, and that by reaſon that it cuts off the Doctrine, Diſcipline and Kingly Government of Chriſt Jeſus, by their Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jecting to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat Government, which diſtinguiſhes from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, ſo that in this they are the Servants of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome will object and ſay, If a Heathen King would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a Liberty to the Goſpel, were it not a duty to imbrace it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>athen hath no Law: And therefore we are not to proceed in Law againſt him, either for his paſt or preſent Practiſe; For the Scripture ſays where is no Lw there is no Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom,</hi> 4. 15. Thats to ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey cannot be accuſed of Defection from that Law which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97875:23"/>
receaved, and conſequently cannot be puniſhed (whatever jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements the Lord may inflect upon them for their ignorance and miſerie) Now Papeſts or Malignants profeſſes the name of Chriſt and pretends to be under Law: therefore we are to ſee to the right maner and exerciſe of that Law; that it be according to the will and word of the Lawgiver. Moreover as to a heathens proclaming of liberty, in this we are not to give eare. For belivers hes this in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion allready to go throw all Nations: alſo it is Chriſts right and prerogative <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2 8, <hi>I ſhall give thee the heathen for thin inherie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> Now all that Belivers are to do in this, is that the occaſion and encouragement is the ſtronger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but but not their commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Moreover in the next place you ſay there are three Doctrinal Miſtaks that occaſion our diviſions (1) becauſe we think a thing to be duty therefore it is to be done at all Seaſons, and we conſider not that a thing may be good on the matter, which is not to be done at all times. I <hi>Anſ.</hi> we acknowledge prudence is to be exerciſed in going about Duty; but however it hath a time, which time we fear you would deny if put to it, or if ye ſhould go about this duty I fear accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your former practiſe it would be unſeaſonable, as for exemple in the matter of your late King, ye did never cry out againſt his ſin ſo long as he was in power commiting them but when his back was at the wall, and the Lords judgements powering down upon him; then ye did give witneſs, which witneſs was unſeaſonable, by reaſon of your unfaithfulneſs.</p>
            <p>The other is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat we cannot maintaine union with any that differs from us, and cometh not up to our minde in all things. <hi>Anſ.</hi> we denay to have any proper or peculiar judgement or mind but what hath been received, owned and avowed by our Anceſtors in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, and Covenants and if there be any new ſtep of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtarted by you or us, for the time here after, we deſire it may be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and tenderly carried on and not by Diviſion.</p>
            <p>The third is, that where we apprehend perſons guilty of ſins we cannot have communion with them unleſs they explicitly and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſse the ſame. <hi>Anſwer:</hi> we denaie likewaies to have anie pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar apprehenſion of guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onlie what the Scripture condemns, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97875:24"/>
the Acts and Conſtitutions of our Church: And is not agreeable to Scripture that Sins publickly committed, are to be publickly confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 6. 1, <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 20. <hi>Them that Sin rebuke before all, that others alſo may fear.</hi> I hope the Learned Aſſembly will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Sin muſt be confeſſed and forſaken or elſe the Lord cannot in juſtice forgive, and that becauſe the promiſe belongs only to ſuch, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13, <hi>He that hideth his ſin ſhall not proſper: But whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> confeſſes and forſakes them ſhall find Mercy.</hi> Indeed if any Tranſgreſſor ſhall find Mercy of God, and be honoured of him in the way of duty: Then ought we not to ſtick preciſly on the maner of his confeſſion; for aſſuredly the Lord has blotted out his ſin, and therefore let not man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſet it on the ſcore.</p>
            <p>Furder we charge you with three miſtakes, which are the Rocks on which our Church hitherto has ſpli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That you acknowledge a thing to be duty in it ſelf, ſuch as Fidelity in Doctrine and Diſcipline: But the Exerciſe of it moſt not come within Doors; but muſt be Shouldered to the Door with carnal prudence, and indulged exigences, becauſe as in Page 19. You ſay the Church will have more prejudice by the exerciſe thereof; than benefire. Now whether obedience to pleaſe God, or obedience to pleaſe Men, bringeth moſt loſs or benefite to the Church, let any tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence judge.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, more Tenderneſs towards Tranſgreſſors, than toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Truths of God: So that Truth ſhall be daſhed in pieces, rather than the Bulk of Profeſſors ſhould be broken. Alas! this ſin has been <hi>Epidemick</hi> in this Land to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uine of the Church.</p>
            <p>The third is, confident truſting and Relaying on Mercies and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, without Repentance and confeſsion of ſin; Forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Moreover you ſay, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind among our G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ievances, yet two more heavy Accuſations. The firſt is that there is corruption in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as it is now eſtabliſhed, being under the bondage of an Eraſtian Yoak ſubmited to. I <hi>Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For inveſtigating of a more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nited har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and Concatination of the controverſie. I ſhall Tranſlate the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97875:24"/>
handling of this Grievance to the poſterior place: and therefore ſhall firſt ſpeak to the Oath of Allegiance.</p>
            <p>Where I ſhall ſpeak to the Oath of Allegiance in the abſtract from the preſent contraverſie. I ſay the Oath of Allegiance when Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is cordially to be taken by the ſubjects; and is a piece of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work, and becomes Miniſters well to take <hi>Qua</hi> Subjects, and tends nowayes to their Qualifications <hi>Qua</hi> Miniſters; but only as Subjects: Therefore we do nowayes carp at an Oath of Allegiance when Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Now the Queſtion is, Whether the Oath of Allegiance to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King be lawful, yea or no. The Aſſembly affirmeth but we deny. And that 1. Becauſe the Perſon on the Throne, did at his firſt Entry to <hi>Britain</hi> Inveſt and Cloath himſelf with Prelacy, and that contrair to his former practiſe and Education. And this was done by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Prelats who were the principal moving Inſtruments in this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in bringing him to the Throne? So that as they did countinance him to his upſeting; ſo likewiſe he did countinance them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and maintaining. as is to be ſeen in his preſent and paſt practiſe, how he hath owned that <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> party, by erecting ſome to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, which is a thing very clear, that his ſetting up of ſuch, and alſo his hearing and Communicating with them in Worſhip, declares that he hath inveſted himſelf with Prelacy; and ſo has deveſted himſelf of the Qualifications of a lawful King according to our National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Solemn League and Covenant, and Coronation Oath,</hi> where Kings are engaged to ſwear, to maintain Presbyterian Government, and to the utmoſt of their power to oppoſe <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Prelacy and all fals Religion. Now ſeing that he hath inveſted himſelf with Prelacy; then how can any Faithful ſubject acknowledge him as their King; or ſwear allegiance to him: without being guiltie of the ſin of Prelacie by their conſenting to ſet it upon the Throne. Is not thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Breach of Covenant and perjure in the Subjects to elect a Perſon to the Throne, who has not the elective properties, ſuch as the Qualifications contained in our Fundamental Laws. For at beſt his Qualifications are but exerciſed indifferently, either toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Prelacy in <hi>England,</hi> or this ſuppoſed Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore doth not leave to the one, more than
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97875:25"/>
to the other, but inveſts himſelf with both, according to the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People: Which practiſe is contradictory, for how can one ſerve two Maſters? And therefore no Godlie Faithful Subject can in Conſcience elect and choiſe that which is contradictorie; ſeing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective properties are wanting; and ſo by conſequence no Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance can be given without Sin and Perjurie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is, Becauſe he did not take the Covenant at his Entrie to the Throne. Now according to the practiſe of our Anceſtors who in the Crowning of their K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Where <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond did take the Covenants; And likewiſe did ſwear and engage to endeavour the Reformation of Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But nothing of this hath ever yet been: I ſay the entrie to the Crown hath not come throw the Channal of a Covenant of Reformation: And therefore how can any Subject ſwear to be loyal to him who has not ſworn to be loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Faithful to the Crown and Intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt. Certainly our obedience and loyalty to Kings muſt be in the Lord; and not in ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ters ſinful and unlawful, either as to the Burieing, or yet as to the bearing down the Covenanted work of Reformation, which our Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did make a principal mark of a lawful King Anointed and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God; for ruling in righteouſneſs. Certainlie where this is either wanting, or yet denyed in a King: Then the Oath of Allegiance in the Subjects is Sinful and Unlawful according to our Fundamental Laws.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon is, Becauſe the Perſons who did elect him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not take the Covenant, and therefore were not the lawful Repreſentatives of this Covenanted Land: And ſeing we may refuſe a King upon his not taking the Covenant, then by conſequence we may refuſe theſe Repreſentatives. As for example, this the preſent Generation holds good in <hi>Theſi.</hi> as to the maner; For they acknowledge that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters hath no right to their Stipends; unleſs the Perſons who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97875:25"/>
elect them be qualified, with the Oath of allegiance. Now if I may argue from their conceſſion as to the maner: then much more may I argue from the matter and ground above mentioned, that king and people; ought in ſuch a great work to qualifie themſelves by entring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> 8. 4. <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me, they have mude Princes and I knew it not.</hi> That is not by my directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and approbation: As if the Lord had ſaid, Ye never ſought my council in this, neither did come before me with confeſſion of ſin, and Humiliation for your defection: In order to leave your ſin, and cleave to a Covenanted work of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>formation: And therefore ſaith the Lord I know it not, thats to ſay, I have no affection to it ſo as to approve it; and when the Lord diſproves, why ſhould Man approve? for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where there is no juſt right or title to a Crown, then it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that, That Government and theſe Governours, are full of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and of ſhort continuance, according to that triplicat threatning <hi>Ezek</hi> 21 27, <hi>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it ſhall be no more until he come whoſe right it is, and I will give it him.</hi> So I ſay we cannot acknowledge theſe Rulers to be lawful, or yet lawfully choſen, ſo long as the Covenant is laid aſide: And therefore from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this, the Oath of Allegiance muſt be unlawful, and that both according to Scripture and our Fundamental Laws.</p>
            <p>The Fourth reaſon is, becauſe he cannot take the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> as he is now ſtated, being inveſted with Prelacy; according to our Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, Kings are to Swear to maintain the true Religion of Chriſt Jeſus; the which Religion is Presbyterian Government, in it's power and purity: And alſo ſhall gainſtand and aboliſh all falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion contrair to the ſame; under which falſe Religion, <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Prelacy is comprehended, which I think the great Aſſembly will not

deny: True it is in the Year <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6. the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> was propoſed to the Perſon on the Throne (being ſent by the hand of a privat Perſon) to take, but whether or no taken it may be doubted, ſeing he walks contrair thereto, by denying all practical obedience. But however the ſin is greater in breach thereof; both by the Taker and Propoſers of this Oath, than it had never been, and that I prove from Scripture, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Better is it that thou ſhouldeſt not Vow, than that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Vow and not Pay.</hi> Now in the breach of this Oath, there is a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contended reſting thereon by both Parties, without Exhortation or Admonition from the one; or endeavour after obedience in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Is not an lawful Oath ſeriouſly to be performed, ſeing that the the taker finds it to be a duty: And therefore to be gone about, as in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Whatſoever thine hand findeth to do, do it with thy might</hi> Now if he ſhall with full power and might maintain Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then Prelacy ſhall get no aid nor aſſiſtance. And I hope the Aſſembly will acknowledge, that Prelacie is no where to be Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and that the maintainers thereof, are Enemies to the Crown and Kingdom of Chriſt; So that it is not enough to countinance Presbytrie now in its ſhadow; or yet I ſay in its ſubſtance in <hi>Scotland,</hi> unleſs that it be countinanced both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> which is to aboliſh and gainſtand all falſe Religion; and therefore Popery is no where to be Tolerated. But in this Revolution, there is a Toleration of falſe Religion; and therefore the preſent Perſon on the Throne, can neither be owned as a lawful King; nor yet be looked upon as a faithful Inſtrument of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Seing he ſends out contrair ſtreams from the ſame Fountain to thir Kingdoms. Now according to the Judgment of the Aſſembly, if it ſhall be yealded? that this is a deliverance and libertie, yet it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie to Scripture as in <hi>James</hi> 3. 11: <hi>Doth a Fountain at the ſame place ſend forth ſweet Water and bitter.</hi> This the Apoſtle denys, ſo I ſay can ſtreams of Liberty and Bleſſedneſs proceed from your King to <hi>Scotland</hi> and bondage and Thraldom to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no, our Liberty can never be purchaſſed with our Brethrens and Neighbours Thraldom. And now let this liberty be never ſo large in this Land, yet if it be not univerſall throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97875:26"/>
in its ſincere endeavour, to the maintaing of Presbytrie, &amp; to the aboliſhing of all falſe Religion contrair to the ſame, then it cannot be ſaid, that the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> is in the leaſt obſerved to one more than to another, for all comes under his Toleration; And ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence this Oath is made null; and therefore no Subject neither Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter nor People can Swear Allegiance to him, without involving themſelves in Perjurie and Breach of the Fundamental Laws.</p>
            <p>But ſome will object and ſay, That the Covenants and Coronation Oath, doth not engage us to reform without the Kingdom. <hi>Anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Yeild it be ſo, yet it binds us to reform our ſelves and King. 1. Our ſelves, in that we are not to ſuffer any Prelatick Perſon, or favourer thereof o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Conniver at any falſe Religion, to be ſet upon the Throne, without being guilty either of direct or indirect complyance therewith. I ſay direct complyance, when there is a conſenting and an aiding him in his upſetting, without evident ſigns, and qualifications for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 2. Indirectly, when there is a neglect of a Faithful Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the ſin, which ſin will (if not prevented) deſtroy the Soul, becauſe it is Rebellion and Enmity againſt Jeſus Chriſt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Antichriſtian Prelacy and Popery. For what can one be ſaid to be, who owns Presbytrie (if ſo it may be ſaid) in the one Kingdom, and <hi>Antichristianiſm</hi> in the other, but half Loyal to the Crown and Kingdom of Chriſt, and a Perſon half Loyal is but at beſt an Enemy; and ſo conſequently becomes lyable to the Wrath and Juſtice of God, And therefore it is the duty of a Faithful Aſſembly to forwarn the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned guilty perſon of his ſin, in order to make out of the way of Wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Otherwiſe they will be guilty, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 9. <hi>When I ſay unto the Wicked Man thou ſhall ſurely die, if thou doest not ſpeak to warn the Wicked from his way, that Wicked Man ſhall die in his iniquity; but his Blood will I require at thine Hand,</hi> So I ſay unleſs that there be Faithful warning given, and that in Doctrine, both as to Admonition and Exhortation, and likewiſe to the higheſt degree of cenſure and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in caſe of obſtinacie: Otherwayes we cannot be free of this guilt? nor yet be innocent from Perjurie, ſeing that the King (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Faith and Practiſe of the preſent profeſſing Generation) is a lawful King and nouriſhing Father to the Church, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97875:27"/>
is a Member of the Church, and therefore Subject to the Laws thereof, which I think the Aſſembly will not deny, conſidering that his Mercies comes under their inſpection as is to be ſeen, by their praying for proſperity and a Bleſſing to his undertakings: And why ſhould not his ſin, and miſerie, llikewayes be marked and teſtified againſt, or elſe we ſhall never reform our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But ſome will object and ſay, that the King has owned and counti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced Presbytrie in <hi>Scotland</hi> and declared Enmity againſt Prelacy. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This he hath done by way of an Eraſtian Toleration; and that from Self Intereſt; as is to be ſeen: Becauſe they Tolerat his ſin, and beco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that both contrair to Scripture and the principals of Presbytrie, which the Prelatick party out of wilfulneſs will not do; So that from this his Faithfulneſs doth not appear, unleſs that his Zeal were univerſal againſt all the Prelatick party. I ſay in other places as well as here. For certainly it is to be followed with Zeal and hatred in the other Kingdoms, as well as here, it being evil in it ſelf and according to that true <hi>Axiom quod Malum eſt per ſe non mutatur a Circumſtantjis,</hi> thats to ſay, That which is evil in it ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Furder you ſay, do we not think him our lawful King and is he not a bleſſed Inſtrument in Gods Hand, to work ſo great Deliverance for you and us. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This we have clearly denyed from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned grounds and objections, and we think any ſingle eye, that is not by aſſed and prejudged will aſſent to what we have ſaid. And if any be of that judgment (which I am not) <hi>viz,</hi> That it might pleaſe the Lord for a time to continue Kingly Government in this Land, and to raiſe up a King to rule in Righteouſneſs; for the good of his Church and People.

            <p>But thirdly the Intrinſcicall power of the Tolerating Magiſtrat: appears in the neglect of Diſcipline in that you dare not do any thing in the Aſſembly in order to the cenſuring. Confeſſing and ſetting of days of Humiliation a part for the ſins of the Throne: Such as manifeſt Perjurie in the Breach of the <hi>Coronation Oath;</hi> the joining in War with the Popiſh party, the ſad Oppreſſions in the Land, by Ceſſes and Impoſitions, the Tolerating of Poperie and Prelacie throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.

So that from this it doth appear. That neglect and partiality of Diſcipline, is not a ſin of deadneſs and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but a deliberat contented Omiſſion and neglect: And therefore partialitie and infidelity are made the Pillar of prudence and eſſential Prop, on which your Eraſtian Church ſtands: Now when all this is conſidered, may it not be ſaid upon grounds that your Church is <hi>Eraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and not <hi>Presbyterian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
