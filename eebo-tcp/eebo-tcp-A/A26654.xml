         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ABOUT
The Manner and Reaſons of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's

            <p>'TIS not leſs certain, That every Mortal
ſtrives to attain Happineſs; than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known, That notwithſtanding
the different Sentiments about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
nature, all reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
agree in the purſuit thereof. To wiſh well to
ones ſelf, is congenite; in ſo much, that <hi>Baſeneſs</hi>
it ſelf is not cheriſhed by the wicked, unleſs under
a notion of ſome <hi>good.</hi> And though perhaps our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect</hi>
cannot be inveagled ſo far, as to deem a thing
<hi>Moral,</hi> which is contrary to it; yet our blind <hi>Will,</hi>
upon a ſurmiſe of its being pleaſant or advantagious,
embraces it, for <hi>good,</hi> under ſuch or the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96929:4"/>
And if this <hi>Appetite</hi> be promiſcuouſly found in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Souls; it muſt doubtleſs, with an overplus,
diſplay it ſelf in ſuch, who being from their Youth
educated above the vulgar ſort, by aid of their culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
are furniſhed with <hi>means</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>cing into a
critick ſearch of a point, on which dependeth <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
thereby to reſcue their Souls from all imminent
danger, and to make it a Candidate of the deſired
Beatitude: due <hi>means,</hi> in this, as in all other caſes,
proving often <hi>Motives</hi> for taking in hand, what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would lie dormant.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſince my Parents (Jews by Birth) were
willing to beſtow coſt and charges on my breeding,
after their way; and the ſedulity of my Teachers, had
brought me to the perfect view of their Doctrine and
Traditions: 'twas no wonder, that being in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
accompliſht, I uſed thoſe <hi>means</hi> I had, in finding
out that object, wherein our chief and only happineſs
doth reſide. And though I was formerly perſwaded,
that this object was GOD; yet ſeeing that he was
ſought for in divers <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>manners,</hi> my Mind could
not be at reſt, until I had ſearch'd for the <hi>beſt.</hi> Thus,
our Mind is of ſo infinite and reſtleſs an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that after it hath attained the fruition of what
conſtantly reliſheth our fancy, it is yet ſtill appetent
of more; in ſo much, that as the object never wants
freſh glances of admiration, ſo our Mind is never
deſtitute of an eagerneſs for comprehending and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
of whatever is admirable in it.</p>
            <p>And there being three chief <hi>means</hi> now extant in
the World, which, as by ſo many lines, ſeem to tend
to the ſame Center; namely, the Jewiſh, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
and the Mahumetan perſwaſion, I conſequently
preſumed to dive into their ſeveral Truths and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96929:4"/>
What the <hi>Chair of Moſes</hi> could afford, therewith I
was ſufficiently acquainted, and indeed thought my
ſelf to be in poſſeſſion of Truth; whether by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
or that the two abovementioned profeſſions
themſelves did acknowledge God to be our Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
In the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, I could find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of ſenſe or reaſon, and Authority as little as
both, except wherein they agree in the Moſaick and
Moral Law: Eſpecially, I did want amongſt them,
the fullfilling of Promiſes, the chiefeſt Faith and Hope
of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thus looking back to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> where
I perceived the fulfilling of Promiſes pretended (as I
then thought) the aſſertion of a Meſſiah come, the
Covenant urged, the holy Canon of Scripture recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
conſidering alſo their Doctrine, Sobriety of Life,
and skill in all ſort of Languages and Learning; I was
perſwaded into a better belief of them than before.
My way therefore was firſt to compare Doctrine
with Doctrine, Predictions with Events, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Promiſes with their being accompliſhed, and
then, to make my Applications (though hidden, for
fear of the Jews) to ſome Divines, by their aſſiſtance
to be better informed in the concern of my Souls Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>After ſundry Conferences and Debates, over-ruled
by reaſon and evidence of Arguments, by the coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Grace of GOD, I at laſt did yield to Chriſtian
Truths, and concluded within me, that their <hi>Way</hi>
(waving the deplorable animoſities, which after a like
manner I found to have been amongſt the Jews of
old) was the ſureſt <hi>means,</hi> in order to the obtaining
of a bleſſed End; in conſideration, that GOD can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be enjoyed as an end of our Happineſs, unleſs by
what he is pleaſed to preſcribe in his ſeveral Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96929:5"/>
I. Whereupon in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, I conſidered the
Promiſes of GOD concerning the King <hi>MESSIAS</hi>
(by whom only we hope to be ſaved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12.) his
coming into the World. And here that notable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

which, although it did happen after Chriſt's Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
yet the fooling of the Romans in <hi>Canaan</hi> before
it, and the Jews being deprived of a formal Scepter
(though a material one is ſaid to have hung in the
Sanhedrim) was an antecedent to this Cataſtrophe.
The conſideration whereof did extort from a Jewiſh
Rabbi (as I remember I have read it) this Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that either GOD for their ſins did retard the
coming of the King Meſſiah, or elſe, if he was come,
there could be none elſe but this <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>

9. where that the Prophet foretells the time of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah
his entring into the World, the Rabbies do uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
allow. Now there we find the reſtriction of
time, from the Prophecy to the fulfilling of it, tied
to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>ſeventy Weeks:</hi> which being to

Weeks of Years, that is, <hi>ſeventy time ſeven.</hi> Making

70 Weeks of Years: The Captivity laſted 70
Years, and the ſecond Temple 420, which added,
makes 490. So, that this Prophecy is an invincible
Argument, for the Meſſiah being come about the
time, unleſs we are willing to argue the Spirit of God
to be falſe. Now, did not <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> come
about that time? whom, if the Jews are not willing
to acknowledge for the foretold Meſſiah, let them
produce another. And though there might be, (as
there are) ſome wranglings about the punctilioes of
time; yet that muſt prove a ſorry ſhift; The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
being not, whether the promiſed Seed ſhould
not appear <hi>about</hi> ſuch a time, but whether it ſhould
come <hi>after</hi> the expiration of it: or, after the <hi>Deſolator</hi>
coming with his abominable Army (even at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation

deſolation upon them that were to be deſolated?
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the <hi>third</hi> conſideration of
<hi>Haggai</hi> 2. 7. where the LORD promiſeth, that in
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>laſt Temple</hi> ſhould appear the deſire <hi>of all
Nations</hi> (to be ruled over, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.) which the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
themſelves expound of the Meſſiah, comparing
it with the other place, <hi>The Lord will appear in his
Temple,</hi> Mal. 3. 1. whereby the glory of this laſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96929:6"/>
ſhould by many degrees ſurmount that of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s.
And indeed, if we conſider, how that beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority
of the ſtructure of this, in compariſon to the
magnificence and ſtupendous riches of the former,
there were wanting <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> the Ark, the
Tables of the Law, the Manna, the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
the Fire from Heaven, immediate Revelation, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing
of the Cloud of Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what other
reaſon is there to think, or to believe, that this laſt
Temple ſhould exceed in glory the firſt, unleſs the
appearance of him in it, who is the LORD of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
of Gold, of all Riches, and the Univerſe; even
of Meſſias the King? And in that appeared <hi>Jeſus</hi> of
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> the ſuppoſed then, and now deſervedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
Meſſiah; after whoſe rejection, deſolation
came upon the place, without any hopes of its being
rebuilt again, at leaſt for former uſes (though <hi>Julian</hi>
the Apoſtate boldly ventured it) ſince that Viſion and
Prophecy were to be ſeal'd up (that is, never to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
again) <hi>v.</hi> 24. and Sacrifice with oblation to
ceaſe, <hi>v.</hi> 27. inſtead whereof, everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was to be inſtalled.</p>
            <p>Then I went to the place of the promiſed Meſſias,
his Nativity, which is clearly expreſſed in <hi>Micah 5. 2.
But thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be amongſt the
leaſt of the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall come
forth unto me</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, <hi>to be the
RVLER in Iſrael: whoſe goings forth have been from
old, from everlaſting.</hi> By this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Moſhel, the Jews
of old underſtood none but Meſſias, in ſo much, that
when <hi>Herod</hi> did hear the promiſed King of the Jews
was born, and preſently being inquiſitive where the
place of his Birth ſhould be, for reſolution, had this
very ſame ſaying, quoted by the chief Prieſts and
Scribes of the people, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1,—6.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96929:7"/>
But now 'tis notoriouſly known, that that <hi>Bethlehem</hi>
of <hi>Ephratah,</hi> at which the Prophet divinely inſpired
did then point, doth now lie in duſt and aſhes; ſo
that it muſt of neceſſity follow, the Promiſe was full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
when that place was as yet in being, elſe the
Prediction was a Fable. We do read indeed, that
<hi>Hierom,</hi> the old Father of the Chriſtian Church, had
once his Station at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> (which the Jews do
urge) but, beſides that the name was only left and
the Town quite demoliſhed, as this ſame Father doth
acknowledge, when he tells us of ſome ſmall Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
there erected; 'tis for certain, that now, there is
neither ſign nor reſemblance, no nor the name of the
City leſt; the <hi>Saracens,</hi> or rather <hi>Hagarens,</hi> having
laid it in aſhes; and yet the <hi>Ruler,</hi> or the <hi>Governour,</hi>
was to be born there. They have another ſhift to
except againſt this place, <hi>viz.</hi> That by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is here
not to be underſtood a <hi>Ruler,</hi> but a <hi>Parable,</hi> or a <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word.</hi>
Which to be a wretched eluſion, the context
evinces; ſince that, he who is here called <hi>Moſhel,</hi>
was to <hi>ſtand,</hi> and to <hi>feed</hi> in the ſtrength of the LORD,
in the majeſty of the LORD his GOD, and was
to be great unto the ends of the Earth, <hi>v.</hi> 4. which
can by no means be attributed to a <hi>Parable,</hi> that being
an <hi>accident.</hi> Not to ſay, that their Forefathers the
LXX. interpret it ſo as we do, and as it ought, by
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Governour,</hi> or a <hi>Ruler;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Matthew</hi> in the forequoted place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>II. Thus being ſatisfied about the time and place
of <hi>Meſſiah</hi> his coming, I next conſidered the manner;
and knowing what Chriſtians did aver in that point,
I preſumed to look back to the Prophecies. Here I
might have a large Field to expatiate into, and not
unpleaſant to the Reader; yet not intending this
<hi>Prooem</hi> for a Treatiſe, and haſtening to the diſplaying
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96929:7"/>
of the Covenant (though that alſo will be compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.)
I ſhall only touch the chief paſſages, interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with ſuitable obſervations thereunto.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore to be noted, that it is a Maxim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Jews, That every Promiſe of GOD
ought to be conſidered as it was pronounced at firſt,
without further additions or limitations following in
proceſs of time; theſe having a collateral tendency
to the ſame <hi>end,</hi> which yet muſt take effect in that
ſame ſimplicity, as it hath been held forth in the firſt
Promiſe.</p>
            <p>But it is agreed on all ſides, that <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. after
the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Meſſiah was promiſed in theſe
words; <hi>I will put an enmity between thee and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and between thy Seed and her Seed: it ſhall bruiſe
thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> Now theſe do
repreſent him to us as a ſeed of a Woman, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no mention made of a <hi>Man.</hi> And this was the firſt
promiſe made of a <hi>Womans Seed</hi> before ſhe <hi>had known
Man, Gen.</hi> 4. 1. Which, though it was reiterated to <hi>Abram,</hi>
who thereupon was call'd <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Sarai, Sarah,</hi>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as the Cabaliſts tell us) being taken out of
the <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> and added to both their names,
as well for confirming God's Covenant, as to ſhew,
they were equal ſharers in the benefit and conveyance
of the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5,—16. (upon which the
inſpired Apoſtle comments moſt ſignificantly, <hi>Gal. 3.
15, &amp;c.</hi>) though likewiſe this <hi>Seed</hi> be called the Rod
out of the ſtem of <hi>Jeſſe, Eſay</hi> 11. 12. yet they were
only as ſo many Channels, from which ſhould at laſt
iſſue forth a <hi>Woman</hi> to compleat the promiſe of the
Seed: or as ſo many holy Predeceſſors of that <hi>Virgin,</hi>
which was to conceive and bear a Son, whoſe name
ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">

to the promiſe made in Paradiſe, then ſhut, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96929:8"/>
ever ſhut after. This manner of Meſſias his Birth,
is expreſſed in <hi>Jer. 31. 22. The LORD hath created
a new thing in the Earth, a</hi> Woman <hi>ſhall compaſs
a</hi> Man. And if we will liſt to Cabaliſtical Myſteries
(who averr, that on every letter of the holy Word,
hung Mountains or Rocks of concealed Myſteries,
which being ſtruck at by refined <hi>reaſon,</hi> as a Hammer,
and by <hi>Grace</hi> as a hand, do yield an infinite number
of Sparks, tending to the illuminating of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.)
We may have a pleaſant obſervation in
the paſſage of <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 7. Where the Meſſiah, being
introduced as if he had appear'd already, is inveſted
with the following Attribute; <gap reason="foreign">

In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, the letter conſidered nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,
imports 600. Now, from this Prediction, to
the coming of Meſſiah, even the Lord Jeſus, are 600
years compleat. And, <hi>from henceforth</hi> (as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

had reflected upon his myſterious <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) the

at the <hi>end</hi> of 600 years from his prediction, thence,
to continue <hi>for ever:</hi> and to ſpread it ſelf over all
<hi>Nations:</hi> (the <hi>increaſe</hi>) not only over National <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
In the <hi>next</hi> place, this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be taken figuratively;
denoting, that the promiſed Child and the Son ſhould
be born of a <hi>Virgin</hi> (the Prophet, having in another
place depoſited the ſame in expreſs terms) that had
not interfer'd with a Man; the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being cloſe.</p>
            <p>From all this, it appears, that the promiſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah
was to be born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> the truth whereof
appear'd in the event, ſo uncontroulable, that beſides

            <p>III. Next to this, I ſearch'd into the Nature of the

<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>JEHOVA,</hi> whereon I will at preſent ſolely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
not willing to expatiate in a concern, of it ſelf
requiring a Volume, and which, this only inſtance is

               </gap> 
               <hi>Schem

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a proper and eſſential name
of GOD; if ſo, then it being attributed to Meſſiah,
he muſt properly and eſſentially be GOD. And that
the Meſſiah is called not only the <hi>mighty GOD,</hi> the
<hi>everlaſting father, Eſay</hi> 9. 6. whoſe goings forth are from
everlaſting, <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 2. but alſo <hi>Jehova,</hi> is manifeſt
out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. And this is the name whereby he
ſhall be called THE LORD (in the Hebrew it is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) OUR RIGHTEOUSNES. On which

This Rabbinical Comment, which may tend to their
own conviction <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
That is, the Scripture calls the name of
Meſſiah (<hi>Jehova tzidkenu</hi>) the LORD our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
becauſe the Mediator is to be GOD, by
whoſe hands we are to obtain Righteouſneſs from
God himſelf, and therefore it calls him by the name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And by this, and the like names and proprieties,
attributed to the Meſſiah in the Old Teſtament, I was
fully convinced of his Godhead. Thence reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Chriſt's Miracles of a meer ſupernatural Power, I
could not but ſatisfie my ſelf in that point alſo, that
he was the ſame that was to come.</p>
            <p>All this while, admiring the Divine goodneſs and
wiſdom, I was invited to glorifie his holy name, for
that he was pleaſed to open my Eyes, and to ſhew
me the true path of Salvation; that being reſcued
from the power of Sathan, I had been admitted to
the hope of enjoying him for ever, according to his
holy Covenant, under which I now found my ſelf
comprehended.</p>
            <p>And now as for the COVENANTS of GOD,<note place="margin">GOD'S CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENANT.</note>
willing ſhortly to handle the matter, we will in the
<hi>firſt place,</hi> conſider the Notion of the name. In He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>he hath choſen,</hi> for
that perſons and conditions are choſen in a <hi>Covenant,</hi>
which word, in the Engliſh, proceeds from <hi>Convening</hi>
or agreeing on ſuch Articles as are liked by them that
are upon a Treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next</hi> we will conſider the notion of the thing it
ſelf. And thus, it is taken (1.) in <hi>a large ſence;</hi> when
it doth import as much as a <hi>Commandment;</hi> as for
Example (to paſs by other paſſages for ſhortneſs ſake)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96929:9"/>
               <hi>Joſh. 7. 11. Iſrael</hi> hath ſinned, and they have alſo
tranſgreſſed my <hi>Covenant,</hi> which I <hi>commanded</hi> them;
for they have taken of the accurſed thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 15.
becauſe he hath tranſgreſſed the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the

under a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Joſ.</hi> 6. 17, 18. Or it is taken (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly)
in a more ſtrict ſenſe, only for a <hi>promiſe of</hi>
GOD, without any intervening conditions, as for
Example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 9. Behold (ſaying to <hi>Noah</hi>) with
you and with your Seed after you, and with every
living Creature that is with you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will eſtabliſh
my <hi>Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. Where that by this <hi>Covenant</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
only a <hi>promiſe</hi> of GOD, is manifeſt, not
only for that there was no ſtipulation, neither expreſs
nor implicit, but that the benefit thereof extended it
ſelf to the very Beaſts, without any regard of Souls
Immortal. Or <hi>laſtly,</hi> it is taken in the <hi>ſtrictest</hi> ſenſe,
for the <hi>Covenant</hi> (as it is commonly call'd) <hi>of Grace,</hi>
eſtabliſhed in the promiſed Seed, under the <hi>condition</hi>
of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> as was that, which GOD
uttered to <hi>Abraham, Gen. 15. 17. Gal.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhortly explain'd the ſeveral accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and meaning of the word <hi>Covenant,</hi> my poſition
is, That GOD never entred upon a <hi>Covenant</hi> (as
the word is duly to be taken) with Man, but the
Covenant of Grace in Chriſt. So that all other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
wherein the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is found, do inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
either a <hi>Commandment,</hi> or elſe a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſtipulation of the parties concern'd; except
<hi>that of Sinai,</hi> which, by reaſon of its ratihabition,
changed the Scene of GOD'S purpoſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.</p>
            <p>There is therefore no Covenant of <hi>Nature;</hi> for that
none was made before the Fall, and after it, none
could be made. The Tranſaction, that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96929:10"/>
GOD and <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Eden, Gen.</hi> 2. was a
meer <hi>Sanction</hi> on God's ſide, whereunto <hi>Adam</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to liſten by nature, which as yet uncorrupted,
was able to perform what was enjoined. We find
indeed a ſaying in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. 7. They have tranſgreſſed
the <hi>Covenant</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as <hi>Adam.</hi> But, if <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould
here be taken for the Protoplaſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Covenant, muſt
be taken in a large ſenſe for a <hi>Commandment:</hi>
However, 'tis agreed upon by the learned and skilled
in the Hebrew, that <hi>Adam</hi> is taken here for a noun
common, that is for every Mortal, according to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Tranſlations, in particular the Engliſh; But
they, <hi>like Men,</hi> have tranſgreſſed my <hi>Covenant:</hi> The
<hi>Poland</hi> tranſlation (that of my native ſoil) takes the
word adjectively, for <hi>human,</hi> they have tranſgreſſed
my <hi>Covenant,</hi> as a human, or as a <hi>Man</hi>'s Covenant,
not as if it had been of Divine Authority; wherein
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they have dealt <hi>diſloyally againſt me.</hi> To theſe
and the like interpretations (which are not againſt
the Analogy of Faith.) I will add one, which I deem
the moſt grammatical and ſignificant, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
And they, as <hi>one Man,</hi> tranſgreſſed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
That is, they were ſo unanimous to break
the LORD'S <hi>Inſtitution and Will,</hi> that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
of their ſinful and rebellious Enterprize, all
of them were as <hi>one Man</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thus the doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clear'd, and we having ſhewed that <hi>Adam</hi> is here
taken appellatively, I proceed.</p>
            <p>If there had been any <hi>Covenant</hi> of Nature, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
had been under ſome <hi>Covenant,</hi> for that ſuch
like conditions, as this Covenant might have had, (if
ever it could have been) were written in their hearts,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. yet the Apoſtle calls them ſtrangers from
the Covenants of Promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. From the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi>
in the plural, as pointing at that which was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96929:10"/>
uttered to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and, that of <hi>Sinai</hi> grounded by
the raſh ratifying of the Jews in ſome meaſure, upon
the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> (though not with a difannulling of
the <hi>promiſe</hi>) the like whereof we never read to have
been done by the Heathens.</p>
            <p>Which leads us to another conſideration, about the
impoſſibility of ſuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> as that of Nature;
for that, neither the Juſtice of God will permit, that
ſuch conditions as the Law of Nature containeth,
ſhould in a Covenanting way, be propoſed to Man,
after the fall of the firſt; nor is Man able to perform
them: and Grace without Chriſt, hath nothing to
do in meer naturals: yea, though general Grace may
extend it ſelf to the Heathens, yet, neither that
(ſpeaking ſtrictly) can be admitted to the retinue of
a Covenant of Nature, ſtanding on the bottom of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.</p>
            <p>At laſt, ſince whereever an Arithmetical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is obſerved, betwixt the tranſacting parties that
<hi>are unequal,</hi> there can be no <hi>Covenant;</hi> and, if there
could, ſuch a commenſuration cannot be expected
after the fall; it follows, there was not, nor is not,
yea cannot be any <hi>Covenant of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make here a long harangue, about the difference
between the arithmetical and geometrical proportion,
as it doth not belong to my Province, ſo it would
prove tedious to the Reader. Yet leſt I ſhould meet
with ſome not unwilling to underſtand me, waving
ſeveral niceties about it, I will give a taſte: <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical</hi>
proportion is, when the <hi>Medius terminus</hi> is
equally diſtant from both extreams: <hi>Geometrical,</hi>
when it is liker and nearer to one of the extreams
than to the other. Thence, to <hi>diſtributive</hi> Juſtice
is allotted <hi>Medium Geometricum;</hi> to the <hi>communitative,
Arithmeticum.</hi> And this commutative Juſtice is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96929:11"/>
when an equal proportion is obſerved between giving
and receiving, between the merit and reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the injunction and the performance. But pray
now, where is there a perſon, after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
that ſhould be able to draw this <hi>Radix</hi> equally diſtant
from, and equally commenſurate to the injoining and
the performing party. And if, at the beſt, it could
at any time be found, yet what ſhould the upſhot of
it be in reference to a reward, except that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Servants, we have done that which <hi>was
our duty</hi> to do. And what is it Man is ſuppoſed to
have done? When ye have done <hi>All, Luc.</hi> 17. 10.
Now, as this All, cannot be done by a Man in the
State <hi>of Sin;</hi> ſo if it had been done in the State of
<hi>Innocency,</hi> it had been but a duty, tending to no more
than <hi>Vnprofitableneſs,</hi> and therefore not a Reſult of a
<hi>Covenant,</hi> which, as to us, hath always a proportion
<hi>Geometrical,</hi> as being grounded upon diſtributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. by <hi>Grace purchaſed</hi> for us, through
the ſatisfaction of an equal in Nature, even by Chriſt
Covenanting for us with the Father.</p>
            <p>Here it may be, ſome will ſay, that by this aſſertion,
and a kind of a Paradox, I bereave GOD of the
power of exacting due obedience to his Law <hi>from,</hi>
and ſeem to have little regard of the tranſmiſſion of
original Sin, to the Poſterity of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Not in the leaſt. For, ſuppoſe a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
ſhould beſtow on his Subject a <hi>Feud</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Poſterity after him, as a meer token of
his bounty towards his new <hi>Creature;</hi> if this firſt
Feudatary ſhould break his Allegiance to his Prince,
he would doubtleſs involve his Poſterity in the ſame
diſadvantages he felt, meerly by not being truſty to
his charge, and would tranſmit to them, by <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>imputation,</hi> the ſame ignominy, he himſelf
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96929:11"/>
was branded with for his diſobedience, though no
ſuch thing as a <hi>Covenant</hi> had intercurr'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be broken; Allegiance being natural,
and ſufficient to keep a Subject within the bonds of
obligation, without a ſupervenient <hi>paction,</hi> which (in
our caſe) cannot be made but amongſt equals, where
the ſtipulating party is not obliged to any perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
whatſoever, but by free condeſcenſion, only for
the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>And as for the right of God to exact due obedience
to his law at the hands of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, though
there intervened no Covenant, it ſtill remains inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For though they cannot be tied to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that <hi>Sanction; Of every tree,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16.
having in their <hi>root</hi> tranſgreſſed it, and <hi>forfeited</hi> the
title to <hi>their happineſs;</hi> yet, they can be tied to the
moral Law, written in the hearts of Men, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of their Lives, not having <hi>forfeited their Nature;</hi>
by which they owe Allegiance to their Maker; who
as ſuch, hath right to exact due Obedience to his
Commandments, without a paction. And to obviate
all exceptions, 'tis to be conſidered, That though all
the Precepts of meer Morality, may appear to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by <hi>Adam</hi> in the tranſgreſſion of this Sanction,
yet the moral Law might have been, and, been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kept or violated, without ſuch a ſupervening San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
added to the Moral Law, for Man's trial and
final Conviction.</p>
            <p>And let none ſuſpect, that here I do ſhake hands
with the Socinians, becauſe they likewiſe deny the
Covenant of Nature. For beſides that, I do here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Son's coeſſentiality with the Father,
particular grace after the Fall, meritorious Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſatisfaction for ſin in <hi>our ſtead;</hi> Juſtification by
Faith taken relatively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which evert Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96929:12"/>
We differ in the ends of our Poſitions. They
do it to make <hi>Adam</hi> ſubject to mortality in the very
ſtate of Innocence, as to a conſequence of meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(which I expreſly deteſt ſomewhat lower.) I
again do it, to extol the wiſdom and goodneſs of
God; who not willing to create Man for a meer ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
Life, nor ground his happineſs on his frailty,
and foreknowing he would ſin, and offend his Juſtice,
found out means to bring him to the fruition of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Heaven: to purchaſe for him perſeverance,
to atone his own Juſtice by a <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>his
Son,</hi> which being <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> no <hi>other could be made</hi>
on God's ſide, that thereby all the glory, and the riſe
of it as well as the accompliſhing, might be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only to him, who tenders Grace for Grace, that
his Heavenly gifts to Men, for a gracious or free <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
fulfilled by the Son, in order to Mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And now emerges the adorable myſtery of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, the ſole <hi>tranſaction,</hi> which not only
by way of excellency, but abſolutely can challenge
the name of a <hi>Covenant.</hi> A myſtery which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
deſire to look into, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. A Myſtery,
whoſe dimenſions are unſearchable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. A
Myſtery, without controverſie great, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.
The tenour whereof, was by the myſtical King and
Prophet <hi>David,</hi> delivered in <hi>Pſal. 40. 5, 6, 7, 8.
Thy thoughts</hi> (ſpeaking in the Spirit of Chriſt, and
them he Covenanted for.) <hi>Thy thoughts</hi> (NB.) <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

            <p>Chriſtian Reader! This is the Key, let's now open
the Cloſet of Myſtery, and by aſſiſtance of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<hi>Truth,</hi> find out the hidden treaſures of God's
counſel about us.</p>
            <p>But firſt, give me leave to clear the Text. The
words in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſeem to differ from thoſe in the
Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in that particular paſſage,
whereon we lay the ſtreſs of our aſſertion: <hi>viz.</hi> In
<hi>the Hebrew</hi> it ſounds <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which the Engliſh

               </gap>, <hi>a body haſt thou prepared</hi> (or <hi>fitted) me:</hi> which
ſeem to be quite differing things. But, towards the
unfolding of it (1.) The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (St.
<hi>Paul</hi>) in quoting the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> did follow the LXX.
who were Jews, and underſtood the Hebrew phraſe,
whether proper or improper: therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the words may ſeem to jar with each other;
there is yet a Harmony in the ſenſe, whether (2.)
We do look upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which proceeding

               </gap>, denoteth not only to <hi>pierce,</hi> but alſo to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare;</hi>
in which latter ſence the LXX. having taken it,

rendred <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Ears</hi> by <hi>body, per Metonymiam adjuncti:</hi>
or elſe (3.) upon the <hi>res ſubſtrata,</hi> the myſtical mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
involved in this Veil, which the LXX. might alſo
have hinted at. For the piercing, or boring the Ear
with an Awl, was of Moſaical Inſtitution, for ſuch
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who having ſerved ſix Years with their <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
Maſters,</hi> were willing to continue in that ſtate
of ſervitude, till Death had freed them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 16,
17. By which <hi>piercing of an Ear,</hi> the Iſraelite Servant
took upon him, as it were a new <hi>political body,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being thus inaugurated, he could not be diveſted
till the period of his Earthly Life. So that this is the
true reaſon why the LXX. and greater than them, the
Apoſtle, as being the immediate Penman of the Holy
Ghoſt, rendred the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by <hi>fitted</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Metonymically</hi> by <hi>body;</hi> eſpecially, the promiſed <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
not only taking upon him the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,
Hebr. 2. 16. In the ſhape of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2. 7. whence
he is called a <hi>righteous ſervant,</hi> Iſai. 53. 11. with all
due attendance to the Word of God, piercing his Ears
to preach righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 9. but being alſo
the <hi>Word,</hi> which becoming fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. had
pierced them: To paſs by the myſtery, taken from
<hi>ſix years</hi> labour, and an entrance upon ſervitude at the
<hi>beginning of the ſeventh;</hi> to denote the time of God's
Promiſe concerning the Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. at the brink of
<hi>the ſeventh</hi> day, when God having put an end to the
work of <hi>Creation,</hi> reſted upon that of <hi>Redemption,</hi>
through the agreement of his <hi>righteous ſervant,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the purchaſing of that reſt, which remaineth
to the <hi>people of God,</hi> Hebr. 4. 9.</p>
            <p>I have, to my ſmall capacity, clear'd the Text, with
all poſſible brevity, not willing to enlarge upon what
the Holy Ghoſt hath by the hand of the holy Apoſtle,
convey'd to the Church for a Truth. And though I be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96929:13"/>
not ſo far a <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> or rather a nice <hi>Cabalist,</hi> as to
eſpouſe the numbers for undoubted verities; yet, when
myſtical predictions, calculated with event, ſuggeſt ſuch
like obſervations; I judge it an office of every Chriſtian,
as well for their own comfort, as to invite the curious,
whom <hi>Grace</hi> hath endowed with more critical Wits, in
order to a narrower ſearch, to lay hold on them; no
ways letting ſlip the opportunity of admiring the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
wiſdom, which hath thus liked <hi>All,</hi> in nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
pondere, &amp; menſura, <hi>in number, weight, and meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to the matter. God who is a <hi>Being,</hi> by
way of Excellency, and by reaſon of the inſeparable
goodneſs from his Eſſence, is <hi>Communicative,</hi> willing
to diſplay his Power and Wiſdom, reſolved to Create
the World; over which he thought fit to ſet a <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
as well as a <hi>Beholder.</hi> And becauſe the Univerſe
was to be <hi>material,</hi> the <hi>Ruler</hi> of it was to participate
of <hi>matter:</hi> But moreover, for the contemplating of its
decency and order, he was to be indued with a <hi>Mind,</hi>
able to admire and to adore the ſupream Architect,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. whom, as he could not ſuppoſe corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,
at leaſt for the immenſity of his unſupported
Work, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 6. ſo he could not apprehend him as
ſuch, without having ſomething of immateriality
within him. This Ruler therefore, was to be MAN,
and to be created after the Image of his Maker, <hi>Gen.</hi>
1. and to conſiſt of Body and Soul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. He
was to live for ever by the natural means of the Tree
of Life, which was able to continue his vigour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God, if ſo be he would ſtand to his preſcript: nor
was any conſequence of Nature able to uſher death
upon him, whilſt obedient, elſe deſtruction ſhould
accoſt him, and he periſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. But again, as
his goodneſs would, and his power could accompliſh,
ſo his wiſdom, that knew how to contrive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96929:14"/>
(<hi>loquimut humano more</hi>) did foreſee the flexible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and frailty of the <hi>material</hi> part of Man, by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
drift to things <hi>inviting,</hi> even <hi>forbidden, Ja.</hi> 1.
13, 15. and that the Soul, which was to reſtrain
the body and its ſenſitive <hi>Appetites,</hi> ſhould by the
ſuggeſtion of Sathan (who was to fall before Man)
yield to <hi>them,</hi> as having a power that it <hi>might</hi> not,
not that it <hi>ſhould</hi> not exorbitate <hi>in a ſinleſs capacity of
ſinning,</hi> and thereby draw upon it ſelf, not only ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
confuſion, but alſo for a puniſhment, be, for
the future, <hi>ſubject</hi> to what it was to <hi>command;</hi> GOD
in his Juſtice, whoſe Eyes are purer than to behold
Sin, did in his predetermination, condemn <hi>Man for
Sin,</hi> which he had foreſeen; and conſequently, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
all his Poſterity under the ſame guilt, <hi>Rom.
3. 9. Gal.</hi> 3. 21. condemn'd them alſo for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8.
By the by, I quote theſe Scriptures, for that there is
nothing <hi>comes</hi> to paſs in <hi>time,</hi> which hath not been
in the <hi>Idea</hi> of GOD, from <hi>Everlaſting.</hi> Thus, a
Man, being ideally come to nothing before he was
ſomething, the ſecond perſon of the moſt holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
out of a meer compaſſion to ſo noble a Creature,
in the production of whom he was (if I may ſay ſo)
to be inſtrumental, <hi>Pſal. 33. 6. Joh.</hi> 1. 3. enters upon
a Covenant with his Father, and for making an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
ſince no other ſacrifice would do, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
to the taking upon him the humane nature,
therein to take away the guilt of the future Man and
his Poſterity, by offering up <hi>his own ſelf</hi> a Sacrifice,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2, 24, 25. and by becoming a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19, 20. The ratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof, on both ſides, was grounded upon the

by the chief Prieſt, at the ſolemn bleſſing of
the people, <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 24, 25. Here is the true order
of the Covenant betwixt God the Father and his Son
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> in order to our Salvation, on which depends
that Grace whereby we are ſaved, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
whereof to us in Chriſt, is called the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
by way of excellency; and, more ſignificantly, the
COVENANT of GRACE.</p>
            <p>From hence it is, that it is called the <hi>everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
(none, in order to the effecting of Gods final
purpoſe before it, none after it) <hi>Hebr. 13. 20. through
the blood</hi> of the everlaſting Covenant: hence it is, that
the ſecond perſon of the Deity is called <hi>the lamb ſlain
from the foundation of the World,</hi> wherewith he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
by his forerunner, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. yea hence it is,
that he is termed the firſt-born of the dead, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 5.
for that <hi>Adam,</hi> and all in him, were <hi>dead</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
nor could hope for Life, until the Seed was promiſed
to a dead <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who after that, was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
<hi>Mother of all living;</hi> as being the primitive Mother
of the <hi>LORD of life,</hi> and by him, a reſtorer of the
plenitude of Angels, ſome of which being fallen and
dead in treſpaſs, upon Mans creation, that was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crute
the number, drew him and embroyl'd him in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96929:15"/>
ſame crime they were guilty off, and made him <hi>dead</hi>
alſo. Which again was adumbrated in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> born
by <hi>promiſe,</hi> out of <hi>Sarah,</hi> when her Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s,
body were <hi>dead, Rom.</hi> 4. 19. on which point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively
inſiſts the enlightned Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
and clears it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 6. God, when we were
<hi>dead</hi> in ſins, hath <hi>quickned</hi> us: NB. <hi>together with Chriſt</hi>
in our firſt and ſecond reſurrection: adding immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately;
<hi>By GRACE you are ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the LORD, cuts off all occaſion of boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and therefore, would never enter on his own
accord, upon a Covenant with a meer Man, for that
a meer Man could never draw a parallel to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God, by reaſon of his <hi>meer natural abilities,</hi>
before the fall, and <hi>meer ſinfulneſs</hi> after it. Therefore,
GOD hath ſet forth his own SON (by mutual
agreement) a propitiation through Faith in his Blood;
to declare his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins
that are paſt through his forbearance: that he might
<hi>be juſt,</hi> and the <hi>juſtifier</hi> of him which believeth in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. As therefore there was an arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
proportion, betwixt the Father and the Son:
betwixt the claim of God's Juſtice and Chriſt's ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
ſo the purchace of redemption, was, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to the mutual <hi>Covenant,</hi> a tie for GOD to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelf <hi>juſt,</hi> by juſtifying them that laid hold
on his Son's ſatisfaction, diſcharging in full the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and by an overplus uſhering in Grace, for the
benefit of them that were included in this Covenant,
under condition of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> And the
Redeemer ſhall come to <hi>Zion,</hi> and unto them that
turn from tranſgreſſion in <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaith the LORD.
<hi>As for me</hi> (here GOD declares himſelf juſt, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
his Promiſe to Chriſt concerning his Seed
(<hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 10.) after redemption.) <hi>As for me</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96929:15"/>
the LORD) <hi>this is my Covenant with them; my ſpirit
that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the
mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed,
ſaith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever,</hi> Eſay
59. 20, 21. Here, after the atonement by Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
followeth <hi>Faith</hi> (my words, <hi>&amp;c. Deut. 31. 14.
Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 9.) and <hi>Repentance (to them that turn from
tranſgreſſion.</hi>) And thence, the relyance of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
on this ſatisfaction, is ſynecdochically call'd a
Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. comp. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. as before:
as ſometimes, (becauſe of the mutual interweaving of
myſtical affairs) the whole body of the Church is
call'd Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12.</p>
            <p>This Covenant was from the beginning of the
Creation, variouſly adumbrated: even to the Angels,
before the Creation of Man (which I modeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and ſubmit to the cenſure of the Church) <hi>when
the morning ſtars ſung together, and all the Sons of God
ſhouted for joy,</hi> Job 30. 7. ſeeing (by God's intimation)
that that Man, who was to be created and aſſaulted,
yea ſeduced by the Devil, their former Companion,
and now an unhappy Rebel and Enemy, ſhould be
reſcued by the Son of God their head, and ſhould be
brought to that condition (though the manner of it
was hidden to them as yet) they, under him were
in. And here the Battel between <hi>Michael</hi> and the
<hi>Dragon</hi> preſents it ſelf, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. both for the reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Woman, whom Sathan was to perſecute,
and for maintaining the body of <hi>Moſes (viz.</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
typifying Chriſt, for the comfort of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
until he came) <hi>Jud.</hi> 9. Whereupon the
<hi>Heavens rejoice, and</hi> they <hi>that dwell in them,</hi> Rev.
12. 12.</p>
            <p>From which period, the ſecond perſon of the Deity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96929:16"/>
was often after call'd an Angel of <hi>God's Countenance,</hi>
and emphatically an Angel of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not be bold, yet it is not againſt the analogy
of Faith to think, that the <hi>Cherubim</hi> likewiſe ſtanding
at the entrance of Paradiſe, after Man's baniſhment,
was the ſecond perſon of the Deity, by his flaming
Sword (his Word, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 12, 14.) to undeceive him
of all he could preſume of the earthly Tree of Life,
in order to his full relying upon the promiſed Seed,
which only was the <hi>way, the truth,</hi> and <hi>the life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the actual fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> this <hi>Covenant</hi> of God
was repreſented in the promiſed Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and
Chriſt's ſatisfaction, in Sacrifices, until his coming,
at which, by <hi>one offering</hi> he was to <hi>perfect for ever
them that are ſegregated,</hi> Hebr. 10. 14. Afterwards it
was intimated to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with intermixt additions
about the Land of <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 15. 17. everywhere
on Man's ſide the conditions of Faith and Repentance,
(though under ſeveral Etymologies) being annexed.
Then it was to be renewed with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,
Exod.</hi> 19. 5. and that this tranſaction ſhould have been
a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> in the promiſed Meſſiah, appeareth
by God's Meſſage to his people; <hi>If you keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
(that is the ſame that was intimated to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
according to <hi>Deut. 29. 13.) then you ſhall be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
people,</hi> &amp;c. comp. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. But what
ſaith the people to it. They did not proceed ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
as <hi>Abraham,</hi> who believed God's abilities above
his own, and <hi>it was counted to him for righteouſneſs,
Gen. 15. 6. afterwards</hi> manifeſting his Faith by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the LORD, and being perfect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.
1. but preſently ratifies it by a promiſe of <hi>Self-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
All that the LORD hath ſpoken we will do,
Exod. 19. 8, &amp;</hi> 24. 13. placing their <hi>Works</hi> afore their
<hi>Faith,</hi> and their own righteouſneſs before that of God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96929:16"/>
and Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32. whereby they ſinned againſt
God, and tyed themſelves by their ratihabition to the
rigour of the Law, under the brandiſhing of a Curſe,
<hi>Curſed be he, that confirmeth</hi> (N.B.) <hi>not all the words of
this Law to do them,</hi> Deut. 27. 26. And this is the chief
reaſon, why they are ſaid to have <hi>vexed,</hi> or made ſad
the <hi>holy ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Angel of preſence,</hi> who in his love
and pity had redeemed them, and bare them, and
carried them all the days of old (<hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16.) and
now was willing to make them feel the fruit of the
<hi>Covenant</hi> between him and his Father, without an
impending curſe, had they but relyed on his, and not
their own ability; had they required the ſpirit of
Grace, and not boaſted of natural ſelf-performance.
In deſault whereof, he turn'd their Enemy, and he
fought againſt them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 10.</p>
            <p>May be you will ſay, <hi>What had become then of the
Law? Anſwer.</hi> It had been of the ſame uſe as it is
now under the Goſpel to them that rely not upon
their own righteouſneſs and abilities, but upon thoſe
of Chriſt; and, what the Law is now to a Believer,
is a point ſufficiently known.</p>
            <p>However, notwithſtanding this unconſiderate ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of the Children of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whereby on their
ſide the <hi>Law</hi> got the name of a <hi>Covenant;</hi> the mercy
of God was of that tendency, as not to forget the firſt
<hi>Covenant</hi> under this Moſaical diſpenſation, wherein
conſequently it exerted it ſelf, and was confirmed by
ſo many Types and Sacrifices, in ſome meaſure miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
the rigour of the Law, which it ſelf alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
the Iſraelites of their folly, became to them
at laſt, by the forbearance of God, grounded upon fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Redemption, <hi>Rom. 3. 24, 25. A Schoolmaſter,</hi> Gal.
3. 24. Thus divinely St. <hi>Paul; And this I ſay unto you,
that the Covenant, that was confirmed before of God in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96929:17"/>
Chriſt, the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years
after, cannot diſannul that it ſhould make the promiſe of
none effect,</hi> Gal. 3. 17. God's <hi>promiſe</hi> was of longer date,
and a greater conſequence (being grounded upon the
name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the ratifying of his Son) than the
preſumptuous ratihabition of the Law by the Children
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who in a manner had annul'd the <hi>promiſe</hi> by
ſetting up their own righteouſneſs inſtead of God's,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. as if they had not ſtood in need of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and a Mediator; and therefore it would ſtand,
notwithſtanding the Idol of Self-performance (here it
is obſervable, by the bye, that the Apoſtle terms the
one a <hi>Law,</hi> and the other a <hi>Covenant.</hi>) And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
of their former proceeding with God, is clearly
ſet forth, in many paſſages of the holy Volume; but
one may ſerve for all, and that is <hi>Eſay 64. 6. We are
all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſs are as
filthy rags,</hi> &amp;c. Whereupon is renewed the Promiſe,
under the name of a <hi>righteous branch of David,</hi> which
ſhould be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>The LORD (Jehova)
our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. It was no longer; We
ſhall do whatever the Lord commands, but <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVA</hi>
(the name of Grace, on which the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was grounded) ſhould be their <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> He
was ſhortly to diſplay the Banner of Salvation, and
by the ſhade thereof, cover the iniquities, not only
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but of all the World, as being made unto it;
Wiſdom, Sanctification and Redemption, as well as
<hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> for that he <hi>that glorieth,</hi> may <hi>glory</hi> only
<hi>in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>GOD therefore having entred upon a <hi>Covenant</hi>
with his Son, rejecting all other Sacrifices and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as no way commenſurate to his perſon and
juſtice (<hi>Sacrifice thou wouldſt not</hi>) and accepting of
his Son's blood, for Man's iniquity, did pour down
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96929:17"/>
upon the elect GRACE, in order to their Salvation.
And the whole Tract of adminiſtring the ſame, after
ſuppoſed and accepted of ſatisfaction of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
is called the Covenant of Grace, (as Chriſt, upon
that ſame account is called <hi>FAITH,</hi> Gal. 3. 23.)
<hi>By Grace you are ſaved, through Faith,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. <hi>And
of his fullneſs, have all we received GRACE</hi> (NB.)
<hi>for GRACE,</hi> Joh. 1. 6.</p>
            <p>The benefit whereof derived on Mankind, is in
the firſt place <hi>Adoption,</hi> whereby we are declared to
be <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. <hi>and joint heirs with Chriſt,
Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and that, <hi>from the foundation of the World,</hi>
Eph. 1. 4, 5, 14. <hi>manifeſted in the fullneſs of time, by
taking away the curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6, 7. This
adoption was firſt adumbrated in the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
when GOD delivered them from the bondage
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and called them <hi>his Son,</hi> Hoſea 11. 1. only
in Chriſt, <hi>if the Son therefore make you free, you ſhall be
free in deed,</hi> Joh 8. 36. For which reaſon, this ſame
paſſage (though myſtically grounded on another) is
applied to our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 15. for that as the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> were the firſt Enemies of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that
kept them in bondage and ſubjection; ſo Sathan was
the firſt Enemy of Mankind, and they in his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
out of which they were freed by this Angel of
the Covenant; whereupon, by an intervening ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing
of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and of Chriſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
by their return to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Head and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
compoſing one ſpiritual Body, are call'd a Son;
<hi>I call'd my Son out of Egypt.</hi> And ſuch like Emperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choreſies
are often found in Scripture, as for inſtance,
that of JESUS; <hi>Saul, Saul, Why doſt thou perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
me?</hi> And as this adoption was repreſented in the
Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo it was afterwards extended to
all the believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. there being no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96929:18"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. And this gives us the confidence
of calling God <hi>Abba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Juſtification,</hi> wherein a Sinner (in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
is by God the Father proclaimed juſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.
upon the ſcore of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, purfuant to
the Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. Wherein the firſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> viz. Faith, is a hand applying to
our Souls the merit of our Redeemer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25.
and whereby <hi>God</hi> ſhews himſelf <hi>just,</hi> in ſtanding to
his Covenant, after the appeaſing of his wrath by the
blood of the Mediator; <hi>That he might be juſt,</hi> Rom. 3.
26. and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhews himſelf <hi>righteous,</hi> in performing
what was ſtipulated for the taking off of Man's Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
<hi>My</hi> righteous <hi>ſervant ſhall juſtifie many.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?
<hi>By his knowledge, ibid.</hi> which is believing in him,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. expreſſed to the life by the Lord, <hi>Joh. 17.
3. And this is life eternal, that they might</hi> know <hi>thee,
the only true GOD, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt
ſent.</hi> The whole proceſs and accompliſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
equally glorifieth the Father and the Son; <hi>Father,
the hour</hi> (NB.) <hi>is come, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son
alſo may glorifie thee,</hi> Joh. 17. 1. through the truth,
<hi>v.</hi> 19. kept on both ſides, purſuant to the everlaſting
paction, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 24. upon which account GOD the
Father, after Chriſt's Prayer for the ratification of
the approaching Work, is by him called, the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Father,</hi> by which Righteouſneſs Chriſt was raiſed
from the dead, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 20. for our juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. 25.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thence ariſeth Sanctification; Chriſt of
GOD is made unto us ſanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.
whereby is not only underſtood the ſegregation from
all things common, but alſo a ſeparation from all ſinful
acts by the ſpirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. 1 Theſſ.</hi> 4. 3, 4.
And here the ſecond condition of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96929:18"/>
               <hi>Grace</hi> hath place, <hi>viz. Repentance,</hi> Mark 1. 15.</p>
            <p>By this Repentance a Believer becomes a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. renewed <hi>in knowledge,</hi> after the image
of him that created him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. (not after him by
whom he was deceived; <hi>you ſhall know.</hi>) In righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and true holineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 23. preſenting for
the blood of the <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> Creatures, a
<hi>living</hi> Sacrifice, and a <hi>reaſonable</hi> ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.
Which works are acceptable to God, upon the ſcore
of their being the gifts of GOD, whereof he doth not
repent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. but as ſuch (<hi>coronat Deus dona ſua,
non merita noſtra</hi>) rewards them with a Crown of
Righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. according to <hi>promiſe,</hi> Jam.
1. 12. to ſhew himſelf a <hi>righteous judge</hi> by granting
an Equivalent for the purchace of his Son. And here
falls the conceit of meritoriouſneſs of Works; becauſe
they being no ways ours but Chriſt's, and his holy
Spirit's within us, can no more of themſelves deſerve
Heaven, than they could Redemption, whoſe effects
they are, in order to the better fitting of us for that
end (thence <hi>via ad regnum,</hi> Bern.) for which we were
pre-ordained by Grace. Thus all things have their
Off-ſpring from GOD, and through him, end in
him, not unlike to the periphery of a Circle (the
moſt perfect figure, and ſuſtaining its own ſelf) end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſame point from which it began; <hi>Of</hi> him,
<hi>through</hi> him, <hi>to</hi> him, are all things, to him be glory
for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, After the Conditions follow the ſigns
and ſeals of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> In the firſt place <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
a ſign of initiation into the benefit of Chriſt's Death,
Burial, and Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5. for that
we may put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. and <hi>even as water,</hi>
be united in one Body, until the whole Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>by it and the word,</hi> ſanctified and cleanſed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96929:19"/>
26, 27. we become an aggregate Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11,
12. The manner of its adminiſtration, I will leave
untoucht, and ſtraight proceed to the ſecond ſign, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi> which, to be ſhort (for I have
already gone beyond the limits of my Province) is a
viſible ſign of inviſible grace, purchaſed by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Chriſt, which, to our comfort, and for the
ſealing up of God's Promiſes) it doth efficaciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to us. To give an inſight into the nature of
it, without launcing into the doleful Chaos of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and ſometimes blaſphemous Controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, I will only take notice of a paſſage amongſt
the Jews, which, if it ſhould not clear the doubt, will
yet give ſome light to the lovers of truth. 'Twas
therefore, and is now, a common Cuſtom amongſt
the Jews, for the chief of the Family, after the eating
of the Paſsover, at their going to reſt, to take the
Unleavened-Bread, and to diſtribute the ſame amongſt
his Houſhold, and after that, Wine, with that nicety,
that not one crum of the Bread, nor one drop of
Wine, is to be left; and this they do in remembrance
of the Sacrifice of the Lamb, and ſeparately, of its
Body and Blood, having no Temple wherein to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
as thoſe that were at the ſtanding of the Temple,
without <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could not, and this they call
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Whereupon Chriſt the true <hi>Paſſover-Lamb,</hi>
who was to <hi>bear</hi> the iniquity of the people, and to
<hi>take away</hi> the Sacrifice and the oblation by his Death,
following this Rite, inſtituted <hi>his Sacrament,</hi> by <hi>Bread
and Wine,</hi> and call'd it <hi>his Body and Blood,</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his Paſſion and Death.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Upon this Covenant is grounded our hope
of <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> Chriſt himſelf inſiſts upon it, <hi>Matth.</hi>
22. 31, 32. I am the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here Chriſt puts the Sadducees in mind of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96929:19"/>
grounded upon his name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6, 7,
8. For if God be an Eſſentiator of Beings, by way of
a Covenant, he cannot call himſelf an Eſſentiator of
what is devoid of being. If therefore God be a Jehova
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. it muſt be by making them exiſtent,
for their upholding of the impreſſion of <hi>that Covenant,</hi>
by which <hi>he is theirs.</hi> If ſo, the Patriarchs muſt be
ſtill exiſtent after death, ſince that after it, God bears
that denomination in reference to them; a non Entity
not being able to bear the ſtamp of an Entity, as a
ſhadow or nothing cannot repreſent the lineaments
of a Seal. Hence it proceeded (as we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
that at the day of annual propitiation, this
name was thrice (not without a myſtery) put upon
<hi>Iſrael, Num.</hi> 6. 27. to remember them of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and their Eternal Welfare.</p>
            <p>To which, <hi>all ſpiritual Iſrael,</hi> being brought once
at the Conſummation of the World, and Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
finiſhed his work, ſhall lay down the Office of
a Mediator, and deliver the Kingdom to his Father,
that then being only conſpicuous by his name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and needing no further Covenanting, he together
with his Father, may begin the period of an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Sabbath.</p>
