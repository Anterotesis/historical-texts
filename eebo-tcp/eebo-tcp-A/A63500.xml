            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Do <hi>her</hi> but look how <hi>her</hi> lived when <hi>her</hi> was in <hi>VVales, her</hi> Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were not able to buy or allow <hi>her</hi> a new Cushion for <hi>her</hi> Pulpit then, how many holes and rents were in <hi>her</hi> Cushion, how did <hi>her</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers flye about, and how did the Cony wool flye about <hi>her</hi> ears: <hi>her</hi> was not able to afford <hi>her</hi> a new coat but once in 2. or 3. years: what did <hi>her</hi> mean to come to <hi>Wales,</hi> by Cod, <hi>her</hi> whole Country was very poore; and <hi>her</hi> was there in a very pad condition; if <hi>her</hi> had not good store of tyth Pigs, Hens, Capons, Eggs, and such like, <hi>her</hi> should not know how to subsist with <hi>her</hi> wives and children; so much shall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough which <hi>her</hi> hath spoken for the Text, which is the <hi>Terminus ad quod;</hi> that is, wherefore, and for what <hi>her</hi> did come for into <hi>VVales,</hi> which <hi>her</hi> has told <hi>her</hi> sufficiently off, and <hi>her</hi> hopes will take notice and amend.</p>
            <p>Now a word of Admonition, and so <hi>her</hi> will conclude, and that is this; <hi>her</hi> do wish <hi>her</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> to go <hi>her</hi> waies home quietly into <hi>her</hi> own Country, go <hi>her</hi> saies young Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> home to <hi>her</hi> good Lady and Mother, as <hi>her</hi> have said before, for every honest man will do as <hi>her</hi> is bidden and comfort <hi>her,</hi> who is very sorry to <hi>her</hi> knowledge, to heare how <hi>her</hi> doto abuse <hi>her</hi> selfe and <hi>her</hi> Country of <hi>England, her</hi> cood Lady and Mother is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heartly sorry for <hi>her</hi> rashnesse, goe home young Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and be obedient to <hi>her</hi> deare Mother; <hi>her</hi> hath sent for <hi>her</hi> two times already, and if <hi>her</hi> do not go before the third time of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>her</hi> will tell <hi>her</hi> plainly, that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> is a Canary-bird, and <hi>her</hi> will send two Tivels, and bid <hi>her</hi> take him Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
