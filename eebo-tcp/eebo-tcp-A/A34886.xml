            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I ſhall come directly to Anſwer the ſaid Papers, I ſhall premiſe ſome few Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And firſt of all, I ſhall doe my Opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent that Right as to acknowledge two things, the one is that though he findes his Deſign oppoſed by ſeveral Diſcourſes under the Name of <hi>W. C.</hi> (and chiefly by one called <hi>Englands Intereſts)</hi> yet that he writes like a Gentleman, and not as too many do in our dayes in matters of another nature, like enemies expoſing each other to ſhame.</p>
            <p>The next thing is this, that he doth grant divers things in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of mine to be true, though it be but a handfull of Corn (as he calls it) amongſt abundance of Chaff, and to evidence his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, he hath done me the Honour to Front his Diſcourſe with divers Propoſitions, allowed even by himſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore anſwerably endeavour to treat the ſaid Authour with all that Civility which a perſon of Quality doth deſerve, (as I ſuppoſe he is though he be unknown to me) granting to him what is true, Rectifying what I humbly conceive to be miſtaken, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Objections as are material, preſuming when after this is done, and is maturely conſidered by my Opponent, we may joyn in our endeavours, to carry on the general good of the Kingdom, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that is both our Deſigns.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs ſay, that I had no thoughts of appearing in Publick any more, and could not eaſily have been moved thereunto, had not my zeal to the Commerce of the Nation, (which is at preſent ſolely
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48530:3"/>
maintained by the woollen Manufacture of it) Raiſed my fears ſo farre, as to believe a Ruine is coming upon us, and ſo farre as to doubt alſo that we may be haſtning of it, by thoſe very means we would endeavour to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot now but like the dumb child ſpeak when he ſaw a knife at his fathers Throat, I mean when I conſider the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we are like to be in from the French Kings Vigilancy, and the great endeavours that he hath of late uſed to acquire the making of the woollen Manufacture in his own Kingdom, and what Artifice and vaſt Expence he doth uſe to effect his ſaid deſign, both in <hi>France,</hi> and by his Agents here in <hi>England,</hi> even at this very day notwithſtanding, his minde is and cannot but be ſo much engaged in the preſent warrs; and if he doth this in the very midſt of his diſtractions, what will he not do, or what may we not expect hereafter from him when he is at Peace with all his Neighbours, eſpecially having already gotten ſuch quantities of our wooll, as he hath?</p>
            <p>And to encourage the Manufacture thereof, the ſaid <hi>French</hi> King (for his Intereſt it is we are about to promote) hath even very lately <hi>(viz.</hi> within this few Moneths) iſſued forth his <hi>Edict,</hi> (which is their Law) for the Erecting Hoſpitals in many Towns in <hi>France,</hi> both for the ſetting all ſorts of Perſons at work (that are able) in the woollen <hi>Manufacture,</hi> and for the Maintenance of all Indigent perſons, and not to ſuffer a beggar there.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>French</hi> King, how farre ſoever he pretends a friendſhip to us, be deſigning by all manner of wayes and means, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Commerce, and by it to Ruine us conſequently in our Trade, and in our ſhipping, and in our ſtrength by Sea, I may I hope be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, if I am more than indifferently concerned, or more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily warm, to think that we our ſelves ſhould endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>French</hi> Kings deſign by delivering up the foundation of ſo rich a <hi>Manufacture</hi> into his hands, and by this means delivering up all our Forts, Caſtles and ſtrong holds: for that which is moved is moved Principally, (if not ſolely) for the French Kings advantage, and that which is deſired (if granted) tends onely to our own inevitable Ruine and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Seeing the thing deſired is that after the French King hath laid all this method in a readineſs, to Rob us of our Clothing Trade, we to the end we may ſhew our ſelves not onely his good friends, but his obedient Servants and Vaſſals, deſire that what wooll our Clothiers cannot work out in Cloth by reaſon of the French Kings late
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48530:3"/>
Impoſition upon it, to the breach of Commerce (and conſequently as farre as in him lyeth, to the Breach of the Peace with us) may for the time to come be ſold to his Subjects, that we may not hereafter think of ſo vain and idle a thing, as to preſerve or recover our woollen <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> any more, or to preſerve the Kings Cuſtoms, or the ſtrength and ſhipping of this great Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Upon all which conſiderations I cannot but humbly entreat our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (and more eſpecially ſuch as have the Honour to ſerve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Parliament) ſeriouſly to reflect upon the wiſdom of that great Prince King <hi>Edward 3d.</hi> and upon the method which he in his Reign uſed, now ſo long ſince, to gain the woollen <hi>Manufacture</hi> out of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> into this Countrey, and impartially to compare this with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Practice of the French King before mentioned.</p>
            <p>And then to conſider whether we have not reaſon to do the utmoſt we may to prevent his deſign, or whether we have reaſon to do all that we can (nay more than he himſelf doth ask or expect from us) by a Law to promote and incourage his deſign; and therefore to conſider whether there be Reaſon upon the ſuppoſition, that our own people do not ſteal wooll enough into <hi>France,</hi> ſufficient to pleaſure the French Kings deſign fully; and in regard the carrying our wooll thither by ſtealth, doth not manifeſt friendſhip enough to him to deſire therefore that his Majeſty and the Parliament will pleaſe to make a Law, that all the French Kings ſubjects without any controle may (after ſuch a day of the year) conſtantly come and buy what wooll they pleaſe here as at a free Mart, becauſe it is more for the intereſt of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and more for the Advancing the Honour, wealth and repute of the Nation in General, and conſequently more for the enhauncing the price of Lands, that the whole woollen <hi>Manufacture</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> together with the ſtrength of our Shipping, and all the <hi>Forts</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> be given to the <hi>French King</hi> and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that we be his <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> here to breed his wooll for him, rather than to carry our woollen <hi>Manufacture</hi> into <hi>France</hi> our ſelves, or rather than to ſuffer ſo good a deſign of the <hi>French King's</hi> to fall, as tends to the utter Ruine of our Forreign Trade.</p>
            <p>For if in ſtead of preventing his deſign, we ſhall by ſupplying him all we can with our wooll, Reſolve rather to advance it and make a Law for it; we muſt be very ſhort ſighted if we underſtand not that after he hath ſupplyed his own Countrey he will not only endeavour, but will ſoon be able to ſupply <hi>Flanders, Portugal, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Streights,</hi> to gain an advantage to his own Subjects, for if he may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48530:4"/>
break the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Commerce,</hi> and lay what <hi>Impoſitions</hi> he <hi>Arbitrarily</hi> pleaſeth upon our <hi>Cloth, Sugar,</hi> and all other our <hi>native Commodities,</hi> even while we are at <hi>Peace</hi> with him, why may he not alſo lay an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> upon all our <hi>Ships</hi> that paſs the <hi>Streights,</hi> or that ſhall dare to <hi>Trade</hi> or bring the ſame <hi>Commodities</hi> that he doth in any <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> where the <hi>Subjects</hi> of his <hi>Greatneſs</hi> comes; and when our <hi>Commerce</hi> is loſt, and our <hi>Manufacture</hi> gone, and our <hi>Ships</hi> impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſhall paſs the <hi>Seas,</hi> what ſhall be left to defend our ſelves in caſe we will not alſo receive his <hi>Codex,</hi> or <hi>Laws,</hi> or his <hi>Religion,</hi> or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhall (for the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of his <hi>Name)</hi> think fit to require of us?</p>
            <p>All which things, whether they be convenient not only to be wiſhed but to be contributed to by a Law, I humbly leave to my <hi>Opponent,</hi> themſelves to Judge, for when the <hi>Trade,</hi> that is, the Riches, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly onely of His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but alſo the main <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> thereof ſhall be loſt, as it is now <hi>Declining</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our <hi>Imaginations</hi> are to the <hi>Contrary?</hi> what way or means may we as rational <hi>Perſons</hi> think to prevent any of thoſe things?</p>
            <p>This General being premiſed, I ſhall now enter upon the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> it ſelf, the main aim or ſcope of which ſeems to divide it ſelf into two Parts, the one tends to prove that there ought to be a <hi>Limitted Tranſportation</hi> of <hi>wooll;</hi> the other to prove that by a <hi>Limited Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>wooll</hi> the Price of it may be <hi>Raiſed,</hi> and by <hi>Raiſing</hi> of this, the <hi>Rents</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> may and will be <hi>encreaſed,</hi> and his <hi>Majeſties Cuſtoms</hi> greatly <hi>Advanced</hi> and if theſe things were <hi>Really Practicable,</hi> I ſhould not only be ſo juſt to my ſelf, and juſt to my <hi>Oponents,</hi> but ſo juſt to the <hi>Nation,</hi> as not to put pen to Paper to trouble my <hi>Reader,</hi> and much leſs to <hi>expoſe</hi> my ſelf to a <hi>ſtage</hi> of <hi>contention,</hi> as I am now like poſſibly to do; but for as much as the quite contrary will (if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not) appear, I ſhall therefore <hi>Examine</hi> and <hi>Weigh</hi> thoſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> which my <hi>Opponent</hi> hath brought for thoſe <hi>Aſſertions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, Whereas my <hi>Opponent</hi> doth endeavour to <hi>Allarm</hi> the <hi>Nation, that for want of the vending our ſuperfluous wooll abroad, that the Farmer, and the Landlord are ſo much damnified; that the one cannot pay his Rent, nor the other ſuſtain his Taxes; and that this is the chiefeſt if not the ſole Reaſon of ſinking our Rents, and throwing up Farms, and them ſery of the whole Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Conſequence</hi> is not allowed, that being aſſigned for a general Cauſe, which is but one among many, and that a very ſmall one. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48530:4"/>
true cauſe of the abating the Price of <hi>Land,</hi> and leſſening the <hi>Rents,</hi> being to be taken from the proportion that the ſaid price alwaies holds to the rate of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as is <hi>generally</hi> given for <hi>Money,</hi> which <hi>Rate</hi> depends whether we will or no upon the <hi>plenty</hi> of <hi>Bullion;</hi> and that our <hi>Bullion</hi> is decayed, and the decay of this is the <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Principal cauſe</hi> of the fall of our <hi>Lands,</hi> will eaſily appear to any that ſhall conſider, Firſt, the <hi>great Loſs</hi> that <hi>this Kingdom</hi> did receive by the two laſt <hi>Dutch wars.</hi> Secondly, The further ſad, and almoſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>computable Loſs</hi> which it ſuſtained by the firing of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and by firing of a great part of the <hi>Suburbs</hi> ſince. And Thirdly, by the vaſt <hi>Expence</hi> that this <hi>Nation</hi> hath been put to for the <hi>Rebuilding</hi> of the ſaid <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Suburbs.</hi> Fourthly, by the <hi>Over-ballance</hi> of the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> through the <hi>French Kings Arbitrary Impoſitions,</hi> and the breaking the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Commerce</hi> with us, to the prejudice of our <hi>Trade,</hi> and to the loſs of near One <hi>Million of pounds ſterling</hi> by the year: which four cauſes of the decay of our <hi>Bullion,</hi> as they are no way to be denyed, ſo neither can it be doubted, but that we have by all theſe means, loſt near, if not above the one half of the <hi>Bullion</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> (as it was before the ſaid <hi>Accidents</hi> did <hi>Happen)</hi> and are daily looſing; and if the <hi>Bullion</hi> be thus decreaſed, no marvel if the <hi>Landlord</hi> find it in his <hi>Rents,</hi> and the <hi>Shopkeeper</hi> finde it in his <hi>Trade,</hi> and the <hi>Farmer</hi> find it in his <hi>Market,</hi> and no marvel, if all degrees of Perſons whatever do make a <hi>Complaint,</hi> how hard money is to be got.</p>
            <p>So that if we ſhall ſpeak <hi>Accurately,</hi> though the fall of <hi>Lands</hi> doth <hi>Mainly</hi> and <hi>Principally</hi> depend (as we have ſaid) upon the loſs and decay of <hi>Bullion,</hi> in regard where plenty of <hi>Money</hi> is in any <hi>Nation,</hi> there will be ſtore of <hi>Chapmen</hi> for <hi>Land,</hi> (and perhaps greater ſtore of <hi>Buyers</hi> than there may be of <hi>Sellers,)</hi> and in regard where there is on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a <hi>great ſcarcity</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> there will be few <hi>Buyers</hi> to many <hi>Sellers,</hi> nevertheleſs there are other concurrent <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the fall of <hi>Lands,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Principal</hi> one.</p>
            <p>For it is alſo to be <hi>Conſidered,</hi> that in former times, the <hi>Main Chapmen</hi> for the <hi>Buying</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> were the <hi>Merchants</hi> or <hi>Citizens,</hi> which being reduced now to a very ſmall Number, partly through the <hi>Accidents</hi> before mentioned, and partly through the ſhutting up the Exchequer, the <hi>Buyers</hi> muſt now of neceſſity be reſtrained to the <hi>Gentry,</hi> or to the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who obſerving that the <hi>Building</hi> of <hi>Houſes</hi> doth oft-times bring in <hi>Greater Profit</hi> than the <hi>Buying</hi> of <hi>Land,</hi> eſpecially if the <hi>Rents</hi> prove good, they have therefore for this Reaſon been induced to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48530:5"/>
lay out their Money in Building, rather than in Land.</p>
            <p>And we know it is matter of fact, that beſides the Building of the City again, there hath within theſe twenty years been more Building upon new foundations, eſpecially more fair and coſtly Buildings, and more eſpecially in the Weſt part of the City, than in any one age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince this Nation ſtood.</p>
            <p>To all theſe Cauſes let me add that alſo, which hath been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years complained on, and oft mentioned or diſcourſed of even in Parliament it ſelf, which is the bad defective and uncertain title of Lands for want of regiſtering, and which how much ſoever it hath been complained of, hath never hitherto been remedied; becauſe there are ſome Callings which gain more by mens Contentions, and Abuſes of one another in bargains, than they do by mens Integrity one towards another.</p>
            <p>And indeed if it be a good argument on my Opponents part, that one occaſion of the decay of our <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> is our falſe and baſe making of it, and if this Argument be ſo juſt and ingenious that I cannot but freely confeſs it. Then I know not why my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſhould not in ingenuity, as well allow of my argument for the fall of the Price of Land, that among many other Cauſes this is one very conſiderable, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the bad fraudulent and defective Titles of Land for want of a Regiſter or for want at leaſt of ſome other method to aſcertain the purchaſer of them in his title to them.</p>
            <p>And if the ſeveral cauſes which we have here aſſigned for the fall of Lands, be ſuch as every man will grant to be ſelf-evident, then my Opponent will I hope not take it ill, if I allow not his to be a cauſe at all, or at leaſt to be ſo ſmall a one, as it is ſcarce to be reckoned in a day with theſe that we have here named.</p>
            <p>And whereas my Opponents next pretence in this head, is, <hi>That it is much more the concern of the Nation to preſerve the Nobility, Gentry and thoſe that the land of this Countrey belongs unto; rather than regard a few Artificers, who are employed in the working up of the Wooll of this Nation, or to regard the Merchant who gains by the Exportation of our Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas he gives many reaſons why the firſt of thoſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Nobility and Gentry, ſhould be preferr'd before the latter, which is the contemptible <hi>Merchant, and Marriner, and Artificer,</hi> I humbly crave leave to ſay, that the ſaid Argument doth wholly depend upon a ſuppoſition which is no way fit to be granted, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as if the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48530:5"/>
of the <hi>Merchant, Marriner and Artificer</hi> were not only oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to, but wholly inconſiſtant with the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry and Farmers,</hi> whereas there is nothing more evident than the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo that the whole <hi>Argument</hi> it ſelf falls for want of a Foundation. For the clearing of which let us conſider, That in as much as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that we ſhould defend our ſelves, as an Iſland, otherwiſe than by the ſtrength of our <hi>Shipping,</hi> and ſeeing this is much leſs poſſible to be done now at ſuch a juncture of time when our neareſt Neighbors do partly out of fear, and partly out of emulation multiply <hi>Shipping</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and uſe all endeavours that are poſſible to gain the Dominion of the Sea from us, it is hence clear that we muſt either ſay that the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry and Farmer,</hi> is not the ſame with the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> or if it be the ſame with the intereſt of the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it muſt be their <hi>Intereſt</hi> then to uphold the <hi>Trade and Shipping</hi> of this <hi>Countrey,</hi> and conſequently to uphold the Merchant.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as all that underſtand <hi>Trade,</hi> do well know that all the Commerce of this <hi>Nation</hi> doth for the value and bulk of it intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon the <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> conſequently it muſt be the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry and Farmer</hi> to uphold the <hi>Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,</hi> as much as 'tis to uphold <hi>Trade,</hi> or to uphold the ſtrength of our <hi>Shipping</hi> by Sea. For what will the <hi>Lands</hi> of the <hi>Nobility and Gentry</hi> profit them, or what will become of the <hi>Priviledges and Rites</hi> of Engliſhmen, if through the loſs of our <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> we loſe our <hi>Trade,</hi> and if by the loſs of this we want <hi>Shipping</hi> to defend our ſelves?</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Argument</hi> let us alſo add, that if there be no oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Nobility and Gentry,</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Farmer,</hi> (as no man doth pretend there is) then there can be no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Nobility and Gentry,</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Artificer</hi> who works up the <hi>Wooll</hi> of all the Countrey.</p>
            <p>For beſides the profit that doth ariſe to the <hi>Nobility and Gentry</hi> by the Houſes which are taken, and by the lands that are rented by the <hi>Clothiers</hi> and by the <hi>Workmen</hi> under them, it's well known that the ſaid <hi>Clothiers and Workmen</hi> are ſerviceable to the <hi>Farmer,</hi> not only for the buying up his Wooll, but for the buying up all manner of Victualls alſo; by the which not only one but all the parts of the <hi>Farmers</hi> rents come to be diſcharged, one <hi>Clothier</hi> employing not only one or two hundred perſons, but ſometimes one or two Thouſand; and conſequently, if we ſhall admit that there are in <hi>England</hi> not above five thouſand <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and admit that each of theſe one with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48530:6"/>
another do maintain but two hundred and fifty workmen, the whole will amount to upward of twelve hundred thouſand; wherefore if we ſhall allow for each of theſe people but four pounds per year, one with another, the whole will amount to between four and five Millions of pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> by the year, which yearly Sum the <hi>Farmer</hi> doth immediately receive, and conſequently the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> from the poor and contemptible <hi>Artificer,</hi> over and above what is further contributed by them to the <hi>Shoomakers, Taylers</hi> and other <hi>Trades,</hi> that could not live and be maintained without them, nor the <hi>Farmer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if all theſe <hi>Trades</hi> ſhould fail.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And here I muſt humbly crave leave to rectify another miſtake in my <hi>Opponent,</hi> and ſuch as is no ſmall one; which is, that in as much as it is matter of Fact, and ſuch as may be clearly demonſtrated, that there is at leaſt, if not more than a <hi>Million</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> young and old of both Sexes, employed in the <hi>Cloathing Trade;</hi> and in as much as all that are thus employed, are ſuch as have their dependance ſolely and wholly upon the ſaid <hi>Manufacture,</hi> without intermixing themſelves in the labours of <hi>Hedging Ditching, Quick ſetting,</hi> and others the works belonging to <hi>Husbandry;</hi> it's hence evident how much my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> hath clearly miſtaken himſelf, in ſuppoſing that though our <hi>Cloathing Trade</hi> ſhould be loſt, yet all the <hi>Perſons</hi> that are now employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, might find work from the ſervice of the <hi>Farmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſeeing it's matter of Fact that the <hi>Farmer</hi> is able to ſupply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all the year, with as many Labourers, and more than he hath an occaſion for, without ſo much as medling with, or requiring aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe who are now employed in the <hi>Clothing Trade,</hi> it muſt unavoidably follow, that if our <hi>Manufacture</hi> ſhould be totally loſt, as there will be above a <hi>Million</hi> of People that muſt either ſtarve, or beg, or be put to the charge of the ſeveral Pariſhes, or be forced to ſteal, or rob, or leave the Kingdom; ſo it's as evident, that the <hi>Farmer</hi> after all this will not onely be leſs able to employ Labourers, then he was before, but leſs able to pay his Landlord, by four or five <hi>Millions</hi> every year.</p>
            <p>And when ſuch an abatement as this ſhall be made of the <hi>Farmers Income,</hi> I ſhall leave it to any wiſe man then to conſider, what will become of the price of Lands, or value of Rents, and how much this will advantage the <hi>Grower</hi> or <hi>Breeder</hi> of <hi>wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to make good this Computation, and free it from all ſuſpition of ſlightineſs, we ſhall further offer to conſideration, that whatever is the true value of all the woollen <hi>Manufacture</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48530:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Commonalty</hi> do receive among them, near, if not more than Nine parts of it in Ten. For in as much as all who are well acquainted with the <hi>Clothing Trade,</hi> do know that it is not a tenth part of the profit, nor ſometime the twentieth that is gained by the <hi>Clothier</hi> or firſt employer who frequently loſeth of the very Intereſt of his money, conſequently it muſt of neceſſity follow, that nine of ten parts, if not 19 of 20 parts of the whole value of the ſaid <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> muſt be diſtributed to the Nation; ſo that admitting the whole <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> comprehending <hi>Cloth, Stuffs, Bayes, Stockings,</hi> and all other ſort of the ſaid <hi>Manufacture,</hi> do amount to four millions of pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> per year (more or leſs,) there will not come of that great ſum to the <hi>Clothier</hi> or firſt employer much above two hundred thouſand pounds (if ſo much;) ſo that three Millions and eight hundred thouſand pounds per year, muſt of neceſſity be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Nation</hi> by virtue of the ſaid Clothing Trade: whereof we cannot but ſuppoſe the <hi>Farmers</hi> and therefore the <hi>Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> muſt receive the greater part.</p>
            <p>It is well known alſo that it is ſolely by our Trade that not only this great City of <hi>London</hi> it ſelf, but ſeveral other large Cities of this Nation do wholly depend, and which if our Trade were removed they would ſoon be deſerted by their reſpective Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Then we cannot but offer to conſideration where the <hi>Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Farmers</hi> would find a Market for their Commodities, or find a price anſwerable to them.</p>
            <p>All which particulars I have been the larger in, to remove that miſtake which is all moſt as deſtructive to this Nation as the Peſtilence it ſelf, which is that mentioned by my Opponent, <hi>(viz.) That the Intereſt of the Merchant or the Intereſt of the Clothier and Artificer is not conſiſtant with the Intereſt of the Nobility and Gentry;</hi> the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being now made ſufficiently to appear.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, My Opponents third Argument is, <hi>That Wooll was at 10 l. per Pack in the year 1647. when it was Prohibited, and that in the following year it was ſold for 16 l. per Pack, but that Wool hath ever ſince by reaſon the ſaid Prohibition abated, as is pretended of the price of it and is now not worth above 4 or 5 pounds per pack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Argument there ſeems to be a failure in two reſpects, one as if the Wool of the Nation hath never bore any price ſince the time of the Prohibition, whereas it may be made appear that after the year 1650. Wooll bore a very conſiderable price from 10 l. per Pack to 24 l.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48530:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
per Pack, according to the goodneſs of the ſaid Wool, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo for ſome time, which ſhews us an other miſtake in his Arguments, as if the fall of the price of Wool were wholly to be aſcribed to the Prohibition of it, whereas indeed there are two other cauſes that are very evident. Firſt, From the diſcouragement that hath been put upon the <hi>Clothier,</hi> and upon the vent of our <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> by the <hi>French Kings</hi> Arbitrary impoſitions upon it to the almoſt utter prohibition of it; wherby now there cannot be ſo much wrought of it as formerly, which had otherwiſe certainly been, and then no ſuch occaſion or pretence as this would have been taken to complain of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Woll, and therefore as this cannot be denied to be a true cauſe why more of our Wool comes to be unwrought then formerly, ſo 'tis clear that thoſe very men that are now pleaded for by my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, (I mean the ſtealers and tranſporters of Wool about <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the places adjacent, not for neceſſity but for filthy greedineſs of gain and lucre) have highly contributed, notwithſtanding the Laws of the <hi>Nation</hi> againſt it, and notwithſtanding the ruine of the <hi>Nation</hi> that is daily Jeopardied by it; in which reſpect I cannot but confeſs that <hi>Rumney Marſh</hi> hath indeed created an intereſt by it ſelf, but it is ſuch an intereſt which neither is nor hath been conſiſtent with the intereſt of the <hi>Nation,</hi> nor with the intereſt of the <hi>Nobility and Gentry</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo that the ſaid ſtealers or tranſporters of Wooll have been the main and principal cauſe of both theſe inconveniences <hi>(viz.)</hi> both of the loſs of our <hi>Manufacture</hi> and the lowring the price of Wool.</p>
            <p>The other cauſe of the fall of the price of Wool eſpecially of late years, hath been the neceſſitating of <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſtock their <hi>Paſture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds</hi> with <hi>Sheep</hi> inſtead of great Cattel, and thoſe of the beſt breed of <hi>England,</hi> by which means, as Wool hath of late years been more increaſed than ever at any time before within his Majeſties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo the conſequence of this extraordinary increaſe (and not any fault in the <hi>Clothier</hi> or <hi>Manufacturer)</hi> is that which hath not only brought down the price, but hath occaſioned ſo great a quantity of it to be ſent abroad into forreign parts, as it bears now almoſt as ſmall a price beyond Sea as here, and therefore that in this Argument my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent hath aſſigned that for a cauſe which is no cauſe at all may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, becauſe it's matter of fact, that Wool bore as good a price if not (after the ſaid prohibition as it did before for many years till that breach of Commerce was put upon us by the <hi>French King</hi> which we before mentioned, and untill that unfortunate Act (for ſo I muſt humbly crave leave to call it) was made againſt the importing the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48530:7"/>
               <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle upon ſuppoſition that it would raiſe the price of Land here in <hi>England,</hi> whereas the quite contrary effect hath been too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it hath laid ſuch a foundation for the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhing <hi>England,</hi> as will not quickly (I fear) be recovered.</p>
            <p>4thly. The next thing alleadged by my Opponent, is, <hi>That a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Exportation of Wool will be more for the advantage of our Woollen Trade, and leſs for that beyond the Sea, than the hindring of it hath been.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which aſſertion if my Opponent had really, ſufficiently and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made good, he might juſtly have merited the name, for being the greateſt maſter of reaſon in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed ſeeing a paradox more ſtrange and more hard to be conceived, could not eaſily be ſtated, I could not but expect that ſome Arguments more remarkable than ordinary would immediatly have followed it, but finding (contrary to my expectations) nothing beyond a bare affirmation that if ſtrangers had a liberty to buy what Wooll ſoever they pleaſe, they would pay the dearer for it, by much than now they do, and that our <hi>Clothiers</hi> would therefore have it the cheaper, and by this advantage would be able to under ſell, the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their <hi>Manufacture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay finding little or nothing more to be brought either by way of Reaſon or of Argument to maintain this paradox, I was ſoon convinced that it remained as uncapable to be proved as it was before, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to evidence the improbability of the ſaid conſequence, we ſhall here offer ſome few reaſons to the contrary, and firſt, I crave leave to ſay, That it is no way likely that the Grower in any part of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould not be willing to get the utmoſt price for his Wooll that he can, and therefore not likely that any Grower whatſoever will ſell his wool to the Natives of this <hi>Countrey,</hi> for a leſs price than he preſumes he may have of ſtrangers, and therefore not at all likely that our own <hi>Manufacturers,</hi> ſhould buy it cheaper than others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Admitting that it ſhould be made unlawful for any ſtranger to buy up wool till ſuch a Time or Seaſon of the year, to the end that our <hi>Clothiers</hi> might firſt provide themſelves of what they need, yet it would no way follow but ſtrangers may have their <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Factors</hi> here, that may purchaſe it at the ſame eaſe, with the ſame conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and at the ſame rates that our <hi>Clothiers</hi> are like to do; nor can I perceive any thing propounded by my Opponent that would be able in the leaſt either to prevent it or to obviate it. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48530:8"/>
Thirdly, And this great ommiſſion in my Opponent I could not but take the more notice of, becauſe if no expedient can be found out by him (which I doubt there will not) to prevent <hi>Strangers</hi> from giving what Commiſſions, they pleaſe to buy up what quantities of wooll ſoever they ſhall think fit, here in this <hi>Countrey,</hi> as I ſee not how or by what means the Exportation of our Wooll ſhould be any way po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly limited, ſo neither do I ſee how the <hi>Clothiers</hi> here ſhould be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and certainly furniſhed, or how the <hi>Manufacture</hi> it ſelf ſhould be capable of being any way preſerved, and if theſe miſchiefs, and inconveniences cannot but follow, and cannot but be neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch a Law, as is propounded by my Opponent; and that nothing to obviate or prevent theſe inconveniences hath been either regarded, or ſo much as attempted by him; I cannot but take it to be a very great blot to his judgment, barely and boldly to offer at ſuch a thing, which is attended with ſo much hazard.</p>
            <p>But Fourthly, Becauſe my Opponent ſeems to put his chiefeſt ſtreſs in this, <hi>(viz.) That a large Cuſtom may be put upon all wooll that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Strangers, and that at leaſt by this means they may come to pay double the price of what our Clothiers do, and not only ſo, but by this means alſo his Majeſty may receive an advantage by the Cuſtom that is impoſed upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To try the weight or ſtrength of this expedient, or rather to ſhew the vanity of it. Let us ſuppoſe that <hi>3d.</hi> or <hi>4d.</hi> per pound ſhall by a Law be impoſed upon all wool that ſhall be ſhipped out by <hi>Strangers</hi> or others, as it will not follow that the ſaid Cuſtom ſhould be paid to his Majeſtie for the one half of the wooll, that ſhall be ſo ſhipt out ſeeing under the colour of 100 packs many hundred may be exported. So this will much the leſs follow from the very obſervation which my Opponent himſelf hath made, of the nature and temper of the <hi>Stealers</hi> or <hi>Tranſporters</hi> of Wool; for if as he confeſſeth they will be contented with <hi>12d.</hi> a day profit ſo they may play the Merchants, and if they are content to run the hazard of their necks, and to be tryed as Fellons, for ſo ſmall a matter as this amounts to, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be above 8 or 10s. upon a pack, how much more then will they been couraged to ſteal the Cuſtom of it when their excuſe ſhall be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and their advantage much greater, and the hazard leſs a hundred times than now it is.</p>
            <p>But in the fifth and laſt place, Let us admit for Arguments ſake, that <hi>4l.</hi> was impoſed upon every pack of Wool that was tranſported, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48530:8"/>
let us admit that all this Cuſtom was duly paid, yet I ſee not the leaſt ground, for my Opponents confidence that we ſhall for this cauſe be able to underſell the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>woollen Manufa-cture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For beſide that the nature of their <hi>Manufacture</hi> being but ſleight, and ſuch as takes up much leſs wool than ours doth, and a great part of their warps being made of their fine ſpun Linnen and their own courſe wool, I ſay beſides this the impoſitions that have been of late Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily put-upon all our woollen <hi>Manufacture</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo there is no Cuſtom at all put upon wool there when import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both theſe will utterly prevent our ſelling the ſaid <hi>Manufacture</hi> there cheaper than the <hi>French</hi> can make it, though they ſhall give not only double but treble the price that we ourſelves do give for wool.</p>
            <p>5thly. The next thing alledged by my Opponent is, <hi>That our Fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did never prohibit the Tranſportation of wooll unleſs upon ſome great occaſion, and for a certain Seaſon, till of late years, for making good of which a ſummary of ſeveral Statutes, are brought from the time of</hi> Edw. <hi>the</hi> 3d. <hi>downwards to our own times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to all which Statutes, I ſhall make uſe of no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument than what my Opponent himſelf hath put into my mouth, which is, that wool was for many ages, by the wiſdom of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt very often prohibited; and that whenſoever the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf ſaw there was a greater occaſion than ordinary for it, they did always prohibit it; and conſequently if the Intereſt of the Nation at preſent be ſuch and the circumſtances relating to our Neighbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, being not only ſo great, but ſo inſtant and importune that theſe two conſidered there will be much more reaſon, and much more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for the prohibiting of it now than formerly.</p>
            <p>Then all that my Opponent labours at in producing inſtances of other kinds and where the circumſtances are not the ſame falls wholly to the ground.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of which, let us conſider that the circumſtances pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to this preſent time is, That we have not only been poſſeſſed for many ages of the Manufacturing of our wool but have of late ſo improved our Trade and Commerce by it, that we have exported it by ſhipping of our own, not only into <hi>France, Portugal and Spain,</hi> but into <hi>Italy, Turkey,</hi> and to the moſt remote parts of the World.</p>
            <p>By which means as our wealth came greatly to encreaſe, ſo we our ſelves became more powerful in Shipping than ever, which greatneſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48530:9"/>
of our <hi>Trade</hi> and the ſtrength of our <hi>Shipping</hi> being not only obſerved but forthwith emulated by ſome of our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe clearly diſcerned, that the chiefeſt means for the maintenance of it proceeded from our <hi>woollen Manufacture,</hi> as the <hi>Hollander</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt ſo the <hi>French</hi> ſince have by many undue Laws and preſſures upon us, contrary to the ancient treaties of Peace and Commerce, endeavoured to rob the ſaid <hi>Manufacture</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>Nor is the ſtate of the conteſt now at preſent between us only, who ſhall have the Trade, but who is fitteſt to have the ſtrength and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if my Opponent be not only an <hi>Iſlander,</hi> but ſo much an <hi>Engliſh Man,</hi> and be ſo true a Subject to the intereſt of his Majeſty, which I doubt not but he is, as to think there is none ſo fit as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is to command the Sea, then my Opponent muſt of neceſſity grant that nothing ought at this time to be done by us that may hazard the greatneſs of our Trade and Commerce, and conſequently that nothing ought to be ſuffered by us) ſo far as we are able in any wiſe to prevent it) that may either leſſen or indanger our <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> and conſequently if nothing can ſo much hazard it, and hazard the very loſs of our Trade and of the Dominion of the Sea it ſelf through it, as the countenancing and contributing to the <hi>woollen Manufacture</hi> now ſet up in <hi>France,</hi> then this is not to be done by us, but is rather, if we will perſue the intereſt of the Nation by all means to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by us.</p>
            <p>And conſequently till my Opponent ſhall be able to make it appear, that the Dominion of the Sea, if loſt will be no great harm to us, or till he make it appear that we are able to keep the Dominion of the <hi>Sea</hi> even notwithſtanding our <hi>Trade and Commerce</hi> ſhould be utterly loſt, and notwithſtanding our <hi>woollen Manufacture</hi> ſhould be wholly carried away by our Neighbours:</p>
            <p>Or till he makes it appear by other arguments than hitherto he hath done, that the <hi>French</hi> though they increaſe their <hi>woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture</hi> will neither be able to underſell us abroad, nor be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our <hi>Clothes</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> from going into <hi>France</hi> as formerly:</p>
            <p>I ſay till my Opponent ſhall be able to make good all theſe things, I muſt crave leave to differ from him wholly, and plainly to affirm on the contrary firſt that the Tranſportation of Wool if allowed by a Law can no way be limited.</p>
            <p>Becauſe if the Tranſportation of Wool ſhall be allowed by a Law,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48530:9"/>
no means, (ſpeaking rationally) is able to prevent the <hi>Hollanders, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to give each of them, ſuch Commiſſions as they pleaſe to buy up here what quantity of Wool ſoever they ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In regard that this can no way be prevented, and that my <hi>Opponent</hi> himſelf offers not the leaſt grain of an expedient towards it; I therefore farther affirm, that it cannot appear that our <hi>Clothiers</hi> or <hi>Manufacturers</hi> here, ſhould have the leaſt priviledge above the ſtranger, either in point of proviſion, or in point of price.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That our Clothier, or Manufacturer here, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have a far greater diſadvantage, with reference to the furniſhing himſelf, than the ſtranger abroad, in regard it cannot be thought, he ſhould be able to raiſe any ſuch ſtock of money as the ſtranger can, to prevent the ſtrangers Foreſtalling of him, and conſequently if it be lawful to talk reaſon, there can be no ground to imagine, that our <hi>Manufacture</hi> ſhould not in ſhort time be utterly loſt, and this being loſt, as our Trade and Strength at Sea muſt be inevitably loſt with it, ſo not only the Honour, Wealth and Rents, but the very priviledges Liberty and Property of this Nation muſt be hazarded to ſuch ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as ſhall carry away the Trade, and Strength from us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As to the next Allegation, made by my <hi>Opponent, viz. That the Tranſportation of Wooll, will better His Majeſties Cuſtomes;</hi> I ſee but little in it that may require my Anſwer to it, in as much, as I have ſpoken already to this under the fourth head, Nevertheleſs, I muſt crave leave to ſay, that my <hi>Opponent</hi> here alſo goeth upon an Extraordinary miſtake, it being not at all in diſpute between us, whether his Majeſties <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> would be bettered, if a Subſidy were paid only for that wooll, that is now Exported, in ſtead of having it all ſtoln; But the diſpute between us ſtrictly is, what His Majeſties Cuſtomes will hereafter amount to comparitively to what they at preſent now are, in caſe there ſhould be a Law, for the free and unlimited Exportation of Wooll, and that by reaſon of this Law and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> that muſt follow from it, our Wollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture ſhall come to be wholly and entirely loſt; for it becomes not a wiſe man (and ſuch, I muſt in Civility Judge my <hi>Opponent</hi> to be) in making ſuch propoſals, as tend to the altering of Lawes, to look at the preſent only, but to look more Principally at the time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48530:10"/>
And therefore it is not in this caſe at all to be conſidered what the advantage will be that may come to his Majeſties <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> for a few Moneths, or for a ſingle year, but it is to be conſidered, what the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or diſadvantage, will be to His Majeſties <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> for the time to come; admitting theſe inconveniences, which I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to be unavoidable, from the Law, which is propounded by my <hi>Opponent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides my <hi>Opponent</hi> cannot doubtleſs be ſo ignorant, as not to have conſidered, that the greatneſs of His Majeſties <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> (which is at this day greater than ever) is not at all raiſed comparatively from the export but from the Import, which is 10 if not 20 times greater than the Export, the value of all which Import muſt proportionally fall as the quantity of our Manufacture ſhall fail to be carried out, and as our raw and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought wooll alone ſhall in ſtead of it be Exported, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to pretend that by ſuch a Law as is deſired, his Majeſties <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes</hi> would be advanced, is either greatly to betray ignorance, or greatly to betray the Revenue of the Cuſtomes it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The next thing Alledged by my <hi>Opponent</hi> is, <hi>That the cauſe of the decay of our Clothing doth not lye in the Exportation of our wooll, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> (viz.) <hi>becauſe our wooll is no more freely Exported than it is,</hi> And that we may be ſure not to miſtake his ſenſe, herein he further Adds, <hi>That in as much as the decay and fall of our Manufacture comes properly from the prohibition of our wool, the ſtopping or hindring therefore of our wooll to go out, is but the applying to our Diſeaſe a wrong Remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Argument if it had been brought by a ſtranger we ſhould immediately have turned it into merriment, as ſuppoſing he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by it to drole and make ſport with us, or ſuppoſing that he thought us ſuch meer Children, as that any thing would eaſily chouſe us, but being brought by a Gentleman, and an Engliſh man, I confeſs I could not poſſibly think what might be the meaning of it, unleſs it were that my Opponent was reſolved to the croſs Proverb for a while, and by a peice of wit to make it appear that it is not alwayes true, <hi>that Intereſt cannot lye;</hi> for that nothing can be more contrary to truth than what is here alledged, or more againſt the intereſt of the Nation, and of an Engliſh man than what is here aſſerted, (if that be the very intereſt of my Opponent) is moſt clear.</p>
            <p>For if it be true which my Opponent ſayeth, that the decay of our <hi>Cloathing Trade</hi> is not from our Exportation of Wooll, but rather the contrary, becauſe no more of our wool is carried out raw, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48530:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unmanufactured, it muſt follow then, that by how much the more our wool is thus exported, by ſo much the more our manufacture will not only be preſerved but encouraged, and the reaſon for this muſt needs be, that if we are once rid of our wool, and have got a good price for it, we need not trouble our heads ſo far as to imagine that they who buy it will do any thing with it, but only will lay it up to look upon it.</p>
            <p>For if we ſhall ſeriouſly believe that they will have ſo much wit as to make uſe of it, and to make uſe of it as becomes Rational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in order to the increaſe of their own <hi>Cloathing</hi> by it, we cannot be ſo ſottiſh as to think that they do then intend after this to buy our <hi>manufacture</hi> any more, but do on the contrary deſign to prevent, and ſhut out the Importation of it, as a thing not expedient for them.</p>
            <p>And if this, and no other be really the intent of buying up our wooll by our Neighbours, then muſt it not neceſſarily follow that by how much the more wool they have, by ſo much the more <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture</hi> they will make for the furniſhing themſelves, and furniſhing their Neighbours, by ſo much the leſs place, or poſſibility there will be that we ſhould be able to furniſh them, and by ſo much the greater ſtop muſt of neceſſity be put to the vending our <hi>Cloathes</hi> and is it not plain that by how much the leſs we vend our <hi>manufacture,</hi> by reaſon of the increaſe of it abroad in other places, by ſo much the more our <hi>manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture</hi> muſt decay: not only in point of the price, but in point of its neceſſity and uſe?</p>
            <p>And is it not then as manifeſt that by how much our <hi>manufacture</hi> decayes, our <hi>Trade</hi> muſt decay, and our Wealth muſt decay, and the Strength of our Shipping muſt decay, and we our ſelves muſt be the more made a ſcorn, a prey, and a laughing-ſtock by it to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>And if all this be not for the Intereſt of the Nation but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wholly, is it not plain that my Opponent ſeeing he is an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſeeing it is for the intereſt of the Nation that he writes, doth croſs the proverb, and give us a demonſtration by his thus arguing, that Intereſt may now and then lye, though not alwayes?</p>
            <p>But in the next place to try whether my Opponent be in earneſt or not, let me humbly beg of him, to tell me truly, why thoſe naughty men that uſurped the Government in the year, 1647. did upon ſuch penalties ſtrictly prohibit the Exportation of our woolls if he ſaith, it was becauſe they were only not Rebells, but Men of no Reaſon, and underſtood not the Intereſt of the Nation; wil he not by this brand
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48530:11"/>
many of the Parliament alſo that now ſits? who though they did not confirm the Rebels Law, did think fit at leaſt to make a new Law to the ſame purpoſe, even ſoon after his Majeſties moſt Happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Granting then that the Laws now in force of the 12. and 14. of His Majeſties Reign, were not made by other than by the wiſeſt and moſt Loyal Perſons of this Nation, the ſaid Perſons muſt conſequently have ſome grounds or other for making the ſaid Laws, and if we may gueſs at their grounds by their own words in the preambles of the ſaid Laws, they appear mainly to be theſe three following. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>For the ſetting on work the Inhabitants of this Realm.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>For the improving the Native Commodities of this Countrey to its beſt, fulleſt, and utmoſt uſe.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>And that the Advantage accruing hereby might redound to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom and not to the Subjects of Forreign Realms, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and as it would and muſt otherwiſe do.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Wherefore either theſe their grounds when the ſaid Laws were made, were either good and ſufficient motives for the prohibiting our wooll, and for the laying ſo great a penalty upon ſuch as ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, or they were not: if my Opponent ſhall ſay they were not good and ſufficient grounds, then he muſt ſay that the Wiſdom of thoſe Honourable and Loyal Perſons, who at that time ſerved in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, were indeed not much better than that of the uſurpers of the Government in the year 1647.</p>
            <p>But if the ſaid grounds were good, valid, and ſufficient, and ſuch as did both regard and comprehend the true and ſincere Intereſt of the Nation, then my Opponent muſt confeſs the ſaid Laws ought to ſtand, or he muſt ſhew wherein the caſe is altered now, from what it was then, with reference to the ſaid motives or grounds that the ſaid Parliament then went upon in making the ſaid Laws.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If my Opponent can make it appear by Letters that he hath lately received, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hath laid down the <hi>Woollen manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,</hi> and that they in <hi>France</hi> are altogether grow ſick and weary of it, and that the <hi>French King</hi> hath wholly forbidden it, and hath releaſed all the Impoſitions that he hath of late years put upon it, then I muſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48530:11"/>
needs confeſs the caſe is altered, and that the ſaid Laws ought juſtly to be repealed; or,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If my Opponent hath received information from ſure and good hands, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> make uſe of no other wool than that of their own growth, though they breed no Sheep; and that he hath alſo received information from good and ſure hands, that the <hi>French</hi> make uſe only of their own wool in all their Manufacture; or,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If my <hi>Opponent</hi> can make it appear that the ſetting on work the Inhabitants of this Realm is not now a thing ſo convenient or fit as it was when the ſaid Acts were made; or,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if the improving the Native Commodities of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to its beſt, and utmoſt uſe be found by experience to be no good Policy but to bring many inconveniences with it; or</p>
            <p>Fifthly, if it be much more adviſeable that <hi>Forreigners</hi> ſhould go away with the gain of our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> and with the ſweet of our <hi>Trade,</hi> rather than that his Majeſties Subjects ſhould have it, in all theſe caſes I muſt confeſs it muſt inevitably be for the Intereſt of the Nation to repeal the ſaid Acts and lay them aſide.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand if none of all theſe five caſes can poſſibly be put, and that thoſe very reaſons and grounds do ſtill remain, and are the ſame now which they were when the ſaid Acts were made.</p>
            <p>Then my Opponents motion to repeal the ſaid Laws, muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Intereſt of the <hi>Nation</hi> or Intereſt doth not alwayes ſpeak true; which was the Paradox intended to be argued by my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is clear then by both theſe Arguments, that my <hi>Opponent</hi> hath wholly miſtaken himſelf in the cauſe of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> decay, ſo to evidence yet farther the manifeſtneſs and palpableneſs of this miſtake, we affirm that it is matter of Fact that our <hi>Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture</hi> did greatly increaſe after the ſaid Prohibition of wool in the year 1647. For at leaſt 16 or 18 years together, and not only increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but bore a good price, and that I may not be found like ſome others, who regard not the credit of what they affirm, (and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly like him who hath contracted the Arguments of my Opponent, and hath publiſhed them together in one ſheet of paper) I ſhall to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what I ſay, appeal for the truth of it not only to the Cuſtomhouſe-Books,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48530:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to the quantity of the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> there entred, but to the <hi>Gentry</hi> themſelves: and to the price that Land bore, and Victualls bore for many years together after the ſaid prohibition, and to the plenty of Money that was then in the Land.</p>
            <p>Yea as our Manufacture did increaſe for many years together, after the ſaid prohibition of the Exportation of wool, ſo it had to this day ſtill increaſed, had not thoſe Accidents happened that laid ſo effectual a foundation for the ruine of it, as it was neither in the power of the <hi>Clothier</hi> nor in the power of the Grower to prevent, I mean thoſe new and immoderate Taxes which were laid upon our <hi>Manufacture</hi> by the <hi>French King,</hi> on purpoſe to encourage his own workmen to gain the ſaid <hi>Manufacture</hi> from us; and on purpoſe to prevent our <hi>Clothes and Stuffs</hi> from being brought into his Countrey, although we yearly take of his Commodities to the value of above a Million of Pounds, <hi>ſterl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and I mean in the ſecond place, the making of that unfortunate Act againſt the Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle, which hath not only tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Ruine of the Grower, but to the Ruine of the <hi>Clothier,</hi> and to the Ruine of very <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf; and which if it ſhould continue to ſtand unrepealed, muſt neceſſarily and inevitably Ruine more and more both the <hi>Gentry, Merchant,</hi> and <hi>Clothier</hi> every day.</p>
            <p>And therefore as a further proof to what I ſay I ſhall give one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſtead of many and leave the truth of it to be ſtrictly examined and judged accordingly; which is, that ſince the ſaid Accidents have befallen us, (I mean of the <hi>French Kings</hi> Arbitrary impoſitions upon us, and that Act againſt the Importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle) <hi>Exeter</hi> alone, hath loſt of what it did formerly vend, near if not above three hundred thouſand pounds <hi>ſterling,</hi> every year: and if we ſhall reckon proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably from all other <hi>Counties and Cities,</hi> we ſhall then eaſily ſee there is a juſt ground for the decay of our woollen manufacture, and for the fall of the price of our wooll by it, and for the fall and ruine of our Rents, not as my Opponent alleadgeth by reaſon of the prohibition of tranſporting our wool, but truly and really by reaſon of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and increaſe of our wool, to that degree, that the Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it hath almoſt been neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The ſerious conſideration of which true and real cauſe of the decay of our manufacture, I ſhall humbly leave to the Wiſdom of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>And ſhall likewiſe leave it to their Wiſdom to be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this conjuncture of affairs, and according to the circumſtances
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48530:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which now attend us, while our Neighbours do not only emulate us, but are become actual Rivals with us not only for Clothing but for our Trade it ſelf; and for our Strength and Dominion at Sea, we ſhall or ought ſo far to contribute towards the deſign, and towards the certainty and effectualneſs of our own Ruine, as either to repeal our Acts that prohibit the exportation of wool, or to let that unfortunate Act ſtand, which makes the tranſporting of wool abſolutely neceſſary, whether we will or no, and by this means makes our Neighbours ſcorn-the Commerſe and Trade that they formerly had with us, and thanked us for<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And whereas my <hi>Opponent</hi> doth lay a great ſtreſs upon the falſe making of our <hi>Manufacture,</hi> as one main cauſe of the decay of it; I cannot but confeſs there hath been too much, and too great cauſe for this complaint, formerly, while thoſe good Lawes for the ſealing of Clothes in the water, and for acertaining the length of them, were wholly eluded through the negligence and corruption of the <hi>Aulua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> but though this abuſe hath not to this day been redreſſed, yet there hath been ſo great an alteration in the making of our Cloth within this thirty years, I ſay again within this thirty years, even ſince that naughty Act that commenced in the year 1647; that neither <hi>Dutch</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> do come near us, either for the Accurateneſs and Goodneſs of our Workmanſhip, or for the honeſty, and Integrity that is uſed in making both of Clothes, Stuffs, and Bays.</p>
            <p>And that I may here alſo vindicate the Credit of what I ſay, and that it may be clear, I ſpeak nothing but Truth, I ſhall appeal to the moſt conſiderable Dealers in all <hi>London,</hi> either as <hi>Merchants, Drapers,</hi> or <hi>Mercers,</hi> whether there be not many <hi>Clothiers,</hi> many <hi>Stuff</hi> and <hi>Bay-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who though they be under no Check at all at preſent, do never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſo value their Name, their Word, and their Repute, that they dare adventure all the Commodity they make, to be forfeited, if it do not prove in every reſpect as Long, as Broad, and as truly made, and as well qualified, as they ſell it for, which is a thing ſo well known as though none will now truſt to the Seal of the <hi>Aulnager,</hi> or to the Common Stamps in uſe formerly; yet there are many both <hi>Drapers, Mercers,</hi> and <hi>Merchants,</hi> who will truſt to the private mark of divers Clothiers with leſs ſcruple than they will truſt to the ſtamp of ſome Coyn.</p>
            <p>Yea I ſhould much wrong the generallity of the Cloathiers of <hi>England</hi> if I ſhould not upon this occaſion proſeſſedly declare (and whoever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48530:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
denyeth it will greatly injure them) that ſuch is the ſenſe which they themſelves have had for divers years, how much it is for their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and for the Name, and Honour of the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> it ſelf, To keep up an exact goodneſs in all the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> of this Kingdom, that they have for many years, not onely ſollicited the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that they might be Incorporated in each County, And that none might be admitted to take upon them the making of Cloath and all other woollen <hi>Manufactures,</hi> but ſuch only as ſerving a due number of years to learn the profeſſion of it, might be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently verſed and skilled in it; But they have for many years deſired alſo that all and every the ſorts of woollen <hi>Manufacture,</hi> might be brought to ſuch a certainty of Regulation for the length and breadth of each <hi>Manufacture,</hi> and for the true making of it; that it may not be in the power of any unskilfull perſon to falſifie it, But that by marks of their own, as is uſed in the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Bayes, all manner of cheats and defects ſhould be openly ſignified; which propoſals, if they might be hearkned unto, might ſoon be effected; and made practical through a ſtanding Councel, eſtabliſhed to no other end than for the <hi>Cloathing-Trade,</hi> with power only to receive ſuch propoſals as are to be made by the <hi>Clothiers,</hi> and their reſpective <hi>Factors</hi> here relating to each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and to prepare the ſaid Propoſals into diſtinct Acts againſt the Parliament ſhall be next convened; than which I humbly conceive there is ſcarſe any thing can be inſtanced that might, or would tend more to the General good and advantage of this Nation, and to the promoting and recovering of our <hi>Manufacture</hi> again, and conſequently for the conſumption and advancing the price of our Wool, which is the thing mainly my <hi>Opponent</hi> ſeems to drive at, and in that we ſhall agree.</p>
            <p>But here my <hi>Opponent</hi> may perhaps ſay, that after all I cannot deny but there is a ſurplus of wool which cannot be wrought up by the <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers,</hi> and that I offer' not one word how it ſhould for the future be diſpoſed of.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt that it appeareth not by any thing which my <hi>Opponent</hi> hath hitherto ſaid, at leaſt not by any thing that he hath hitherto proved, That the <hi>Clothier</hi> either cannot or doth not work up the wool of the proper growth of <hi>England</hi> to the full of it, but if a far greater quantity of wool be brought into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Ireland</hi> then ever before was brought untill of late years, as the <hi>Clothier</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſponſible for his not buying up all the wool which is ſent into <hi>England,</hi> ſo neither can he or ought he to be reſponſible for the glut
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48530:13"/>
proceeding from the importation of it, or for the cheapneſs of the ſaid wool, by reaſon of the ſaid glut.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the proper and only way for removing all evil effects, be to remove their reſpective cauſes, and that this is and muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all rational Perſons, then conſidering what we have ſaid before, and not only ſaid but proved and made it to appear, <hi>viz.</hi> That the cauſe of that ſurplus of wool, (with the cheapneſs of it at preſent) among us is partly from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act that prohibiteth the bringing in of Live Cattle, and puts that Kingdom upon the breeding of wool whether they will or no, and partly by the decay of our <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture</hi> through the ſupply that we our <hi>Selves</hi> do make to our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> of our own wool, for the promoting of their <hi>Manufacture</hi> to the ruine of our <hi>Selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proper remedy then for the removing the cheapneſs of our <hi>wool</hi> on the one hand, and for employing our <hi>Poor,</hi> and recovering our <hi>Trade</hi> on the other hand, muſt neceſſarily be the ſtopping the exceſſive <hi>Growth</hi> of it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and as ſtrictly ſtopping, and reſtreining the export of it from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from hence.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt take the boldneſs to ſay again what I have in part ſaid already in my ſecond Argument, <hi>(viz.) That where a Nation is not rich in Mines of Gold and Silver, it is not capable to be inriched by any other way then by its Manufactures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſequently if it be from our <hi>Manufactures</hi> alone that the Riches of this <hi>Nation</hi> comes; and if it be from our <hi>Manufacture</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that our Shipping is employed, and our <hi>Marriners</hi> bred, if it be from our <hi>Trading</hi> alone, and from the riches, which our <hi>Trading</hi> brings in, that His Majeſties Cuſtoms are raiſed, and that our <hi>Fleet</hi> have been hitherto <hi>Built</hi> and <hi>Maintain'd,</hi> and the <hi>Dominion of the Seas</hi> hath been preſerved, than it is muſt be from our <hi>Manufacture</hi> only that our <hi>Bullion</hi> hath been brought in, and that the Rents of our <hi>Nobility and Gentry</hi> doth depend and are ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>And therefore if it muſt be granted me that there is no higher Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the <hi>Nation,</hi> then that which preſerves his <hi>Majeſties Cuſtoms,</hi> and that which ſuſtains the <hi>Nobility and Gentries Rents,</hi> and that which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports our <hi>Navy and Shipping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then in regard <hi>our manufacture</hi> alone doth do all this, <hi>our manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture alone,</hi> and the encouragement of it muſt neceſſarily be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Intereſt of the Nation,</hi> it ſelf; and I muſt crave leave to ſay that whoever placeth it in any thing elſe (as the circumſtances of this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſtands at preſent) muſt either miſtake the <hi>Intereſt of this Nation,</hi> or can be no Friend to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48530:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Wherefore if it be granted by the wiſeſt of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> that a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is better then an inconvenience, ſome private men ought to ſuffer rather then the whole <hi>Nation.</hi> Which I humbly conceive is a ſolid, and a ſufficient anſwer to my <hi>Opponent</hi> as to this part of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing alſo that <hi>our Manufacture</hi> and the encouraging of it, is the main and chief, if not the ſole and only <hi>Intereſt of this Nation,</hi> then as no <hi>Intereſt</hi> beſides can, or ought in reaſon to ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it, ſo much leſs the <hi>Iriſh Act,</hi> without the repealing of which nevertheleſs it is ſimply impoſſible, that either <hi>our Manufacture,</hi> or that the <hi>Trade or Navigation</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhould be preſerved.</p>
            <p>For if there be no reaſon to make a Law that they muſt ſtrave in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there can be reaſon to forbid their breeding of <hi>Sheep,</hi> if we will not let them employ their <hi>Lands</hi> in the breeding of <hi>Live Cattle.</hi> Admitting alſo that the <hi>Paſture Lands</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the bigneſs of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> far larger then the <hi>Paſture Lands</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as they are and muſt neceſſarily be, partly through the ſmallneſs of their Tillage (their <hi>Corn</hi> being not capable to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) and partly through the thinneſſe of their Inhabitants, and it muſt neceſſarily follow, that theſe being converted moſtly to the feeding of <hi>Sheep</hi> muſt breed a vaſt quantity of wool, and ſuch as muſt equal if not exceed the quantity breed in <hi>England</hi> by our <hi>Selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it muſt needs be plain to every perſon, that not only the breeding of wool, but the diſpoſing of it, and the diſpoſing of it to moſt advantage, is now become the <hi>Intereſt of the Nobility, Gentry, Yeomandry,</hi> and of all others whatever that have a concern in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which if it were poſſible to prevent, it ought to be allowed to none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>our ſelves,</hi> whoſe whole proper and entire <hi>Intereſt</hi> it is to be ſole <hi>Manufacturers</hi> or <hi>Workers</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Breeding, Growing, Diſpoſing</hi> and <hi>Improving</hi> of wool being now by <hi>our ſelves</hi> made the entire <hi>Intereſt of Ireland</hi> who deſired it not of us, and would have been very well content without it, if we cannot deſire their <hi>Nobility</hi> or <hi>Gentry</hi> to burn their wool, we cannot then deny them to take all ſuch Lawful and juſt courſes whereby they may improve their wool.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing theſe courſes can be but two ways, either to ſend it is where it moſt wanting, and where it will yield the beſt price, which is to <hi>our Neighbors</hi> to improve and increaſe their <hi>Manufacture,</hi> or elſe to keep it themſelves, and <hi>manufacture</hi> it up in that <hi>Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing one of theſe courſes are wholly, inevitable and that both
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48530:14"/>
one; and the other do not only tend, but muſt and will certainly and effectually bring an utter deſtruction to the Trade, Commerce, Strength, Shipping and Navigation of this Kingdom; we have ſmall reaſon to expect our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or our Neighbours the <hi>French</hi> ſhould help us, or pity us, when we do willfully contribute to the Ruin of our ſelves, and may if we will either prevent it, or eaſily Remedy it.</p>
            <p>And indeed if our All be at Stake, by reaſon of the countinuance of that unfortunate Act; and if this All, I mean the very Intereſt of the Nation it ſelf, will not move us to alter it, I think it would be very Impertinent to inſiſt upon Leſſer Arguments.</p>
            <p>And therefore though it would be for the Intereſt of the Nation greatly, to Arreſt this occaſion, I mean the Cheapneſs of the Wooll, to beat out our Neighbours in the Forreign Trade of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, by under-ſelling them at leaſt abroad.</p>
            <p>And though this might now more eaſily be done then ever, ſeeing our Manufacture is Improved of late years in the Goodneſs of it, and might ſoon as we ſaid before be brought to an Abſolute perfection.</p>
            <p>And though it be but Equal and Juſt to forbid the Commodities of thoſe Countreys that are near us, who refuſe to deal with us for our Commodities or by <hi>Exorbitant</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Impoſition laid upon them do in effect prohibit them; and though the doing of this, is but agreeable to the Rules of Juſtice, and to the Law of Nations, and Law of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Though alſo it cannot be denied that it muſt be greatly conſiſtant with the Publick Good of the Nation to make Sumptuary Lawes, and to reſtrain the Exceſs that is at preſent among us; yet I muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave Leave to ſay that this is but like the taking much pains to ſtop the Leaks of a Barrel and let the Liquor run out at the Bung: For theſe are all Petty things to the Main Concern of the Nation, which muſt be Ruined, and Ruined as I humbly conceive irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Acts doth ſtand.</p>
