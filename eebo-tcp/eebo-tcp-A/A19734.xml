         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to pray, this dyd he of his benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:3"/>
whereby he vouchesaued to
gyue and conferre other thynges,
that whyle we in prayer and ory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that the son taught vs, speke
to the father, we may be the soner
hard. He than tolde vs before, the
howre commeth, whan the trewe
worshyppers, shulde worshyp the
father in spirite and trouthe, and
hath fulfylled that he before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed,
that we, which of his sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
haue receyued spyrite
and trouthe, of his tradition also
shall truely and spiritually pray.
For what prayer can be more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
than that, that is gyuen vs
of Christe, frome whome also the
holy ghoste is sente to vs? What
prayer maye do more with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than that, that the son, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is the veritie spake with his
owne mouthe? in soo moche that
<pb facs="tcp:9671:4"/>
to praye otherwyse than he hathe
taught, is not onely ignoraunce,
but also offence,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> seinge he hath set
forthe, and sayde, Ye caste asyde
the commandement of god, to the
ende you wolde stablysshe youre
own tradition. Therfore dere bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thern,
let vs pray, as god our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
hath taught vs. It is a frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
and familyar oryson, to praye
god of his owne, the prayer of
Christe to ascend to his eares, the
father wyll acknowlege the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of his sonne. Whan we make
our prayer, lette hym that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
within the breaste be in the
voyce. And seynge that we haue
hym as an aduocate to the father
for our synnes, whan we synners
pray for our offences, let vs bring
forth the wordis of our aduocate.
For syth he saith:<note place="margin">Ioan. 1</note> What so euer ye
<pb facs="tcp:9671:4"/>
wylle desyre of the father in my
name, he shall gyue it you: than
howe moch more effectually shall
we obteyn that we axe in Christis
name, if we craue it with his own
prayer? But suche as woll praye,
let their wordis &amp; prayer be lowly
quiete and honest. Let vs thinke,
that we stand in the syght of god.
The diuine eyes must be pleased
bothe with the behauyour of the
body, and maner of speche. For as
it is an imprudent poynt, to make
a clamorous noyse, so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywise
it is conuenient, shamefastely to
praye with sober and temperate
prayers. Furthermore the lorde
commandeth vs secretely to pray
in priuie, secrete, or out places, ye
in oure bedde chaumbers, whiche
thynge dothe greately agree with
our fayth, to thende that we shuld
<pb facs="tcp:9671:5"/>
knowe God to be presente euerye
where, to here and see vs all, and
with the fulnesse of his maiestie,
also to perse and enter into secret
and hydde places, as it is writen,
I am god drawyng nere,<note place="margin">Hier. 23.</note> and nat
god afarre of. If a man were hid
in priuie and secrete places, ergo
shall nat I see hym? Do not I fyl
both heuen and erth?<note place="margin">Pro. 15.</note> And ageyn,
The eies of god do beholde in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
place bothe the good &amp; bad.
Whan we com togyther with our
brethern, and do celebrate diuine
sacrifyces with goddis mynister,
the prieste, we must be myndefull
of shamefastnesse and dyscipline,
not to blaste abrode our prayers,
with vnordered voyces, nor oure
petition, soberly to be commended
to god, we shuld cast out with tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mustuouse
ianglynge, for god he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:9671:5"/>
the harte, and not the voyce.
Nor we shoulde crye out to hym,
whyche seeth oure thoughtes, the
lord prouokyng and saying,<note place="margin">Luc. 5.</note> what
thynke you wyckednesse in youre
hartis? and in an other place.<note place="margin">Hier. 17.</note> And
let all congregations knowe, that
I am the sercher of the rainis and
harte. Whiche thyng Anna in the
fyrst boke of kynges, bearing the
figure of the church, obseruid and
kepte, whyche not with a clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
peticion, but styll and softly
within the pryuye partes of her
breast, prayd vnto the lorde. She
spake with a hyd prayer, but with
an open fayth: she spake not with
voyce, but with harte, for soo she
knewe god herde, and she obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
effectuallye that she desyred,
bycause she axed faythfully. Holy
scripture declareth what she sayd:
<pb facs="tcp:9671:6"/>
She spake in her harte,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 1.</note> and her
lippes moued, and her voyce was
not harde, and god herd her. Also
we rede in the psalmes:<note place="margin">Psalm. 4.</note> Speke in
your hartes, and in your beddes,
and remember your selfis. By Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remye
also, the same thynges the
holy ghooste dothe perswade and
teache, sayenge:<note place="margin">Hier. 29.</note> It behoueth the

yet well beloued brethern, he that
dothe pray, shuld not forget, after
what maner in the temple the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blycane
prayed with the pharisee,
his eies not vnsemely lifted vp to
heuen, nor his handes insolently
stratched out, knocking his brest,
and acknowlegynge his secrete &amp;

that he had no hope of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, sythe no man
is innocente, but confessynge his
synnes, he humbly prayde, and he
that forgyueth the humble, harde
his prayer: The whiche thinges
the lord in his gospel putteth and
sayth:<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> Two men went vp into the
temple to pray, the one a pharisee,
and the other a Publycane: The

This rule of prayer, the thre chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
inclosed in the forneis of fire
<pb facs="tcp:9671:8"/>
obserued, agreing and accordyng
in prayer and consente of spirite.
Whiche thynge the trouthe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
scripture declareth, &amp; whan
it teacheth howe they prayd, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
example, whiche in our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
we ought to folowe, that we
may be suche as they were.<note place="margin">Daniel. 5.</note> Than
(sayth, the scripture) they thre as
out of one mouth, sang an himne,
and blessed the lorde. They spake
as out of oone mouthe, and yet
Christe had not tought theym to
pray, and therfore to theym pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge,
their wordes were effectuall
and toke place, for their peasyble,
symple, and spirituall prayer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
to be accepted of god. And
so we fynd, that the apostels with
the disciples prayid after thascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the lorde.<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> They were all,
sayth the scripture, of one mynde,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:8"/>
and continuynge in prayer, with
the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Mary the mother
of Iesu, and with his bretherne.
They being of one mynde perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
in prayer, declaryng bothe
the instance and concorde of their
prayer. For god whyche maketh
the inhabitantes of one mynde in
the house,<note place="margin">Psal. 67.</note> admitteth none into the
diuine and eternall house, but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as are of one mynd in prayer.
But what be the misteries of the
lordis prayer, most dere brethern,
how many, how great, how brefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gathered togither, but in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
spirituall, howe copious and
abundant? that there is nothing
omittid, that is not in our praiers
and orysons, comprysed in this
compendiouse heauenly doctrine.
Thus sayth he, pray ye,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Our father
whiche arte in heauen,</hi> The man that
<pb facs="tcp:9671:9"/>
is renewed and borne ageyn, and
restored to god by his grace, sayth
in the fyrst place, <hi>Father,</hi> bycause he
begynneth nowe to be his sonne.
He came (sayth the scripture) into
his owne,<note place="margin">Ioan. 1.</note> and his owne receyued
hym not, But as many as recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
hym, to theym gaue he power
to be the chylderne of god, which
beleue in his name. Therfore he
that beleueth in his name, and is
made the chyld of god, must forth
withall begyn both to gyue than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and acknowlege him selfe to
be the chylde of god, whan he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
his father to be in heauen,
god. He woll also among the first
wordes of his byrthe declare hym
selfe, to haue forsaken his erthely
and carnall father, and to begyn
to haue hym his only father, that
is in heuen, as it is writen: They
<pb facs="tcp:9671:9"/>
that say to the father and mother,
I knowe the not, &amp; they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged
not their children, they haue
kepte thy preceptes, and haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
thy testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.<note place="margin">Matt. 23.</note> Also the lord
in his gospel commaundeth, that
we shulde calle no man father in
erthe, bycause we haue one father
whiche is in heuen. And to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple,
that shewid, that his father
was deade, he sayde:<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> Suffre the
deade to burye the deade. For he
sayde, that his father was deed:
sythen they that beleue, haue a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
father. Nor we ought not
dere bretherne, to marke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder
this onely, that we shuld cal
hym father that is in heauen, but
we ioyne therwith, and say, <hi>Oure
father,</hi> that is of them that beleue
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that by hym bd sauctifyed,
and with the natiuite of spiritual
<pb facs="tcp:9671:10"/>
grace restored, beganne to be the
chyldren of god. Whyche voyce
also doothe wrynge and sharpely
touche the Iewes, whych not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnfaythfully despised Christe,
forshewed to them by the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and to them fyrst sent, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
cruelly slewe hym. The whiche
Iewes can nat nowe call god fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
sythen the lord confoundeth
and reproueth them, sayeng:<note place="margin">Ioan. 8.</note> You
are of the father the dyuelle: and
after the lustes of your father wyl

not in hym. And by Esaie<note place="margin">Esay. 1.</note> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
god disdaynyng crieth out:
I haue begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chyldren, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
them, but they haue despised
me. The oxe knowith is lord, &amp;
the asse his masters stable, but Is<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raell
<pb facs="tcp:9671:10"/>
knoweth not, and my people
hath not vnderstand, out vpon ye
synfull nation, people full of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
wycked seede, vngracyouse
childerne. you haue forsaken the
lorde, and haue prouoked him the
holy one of Israel to indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>To whose rebuke and shaame,
whan we Christians pray, we say,
<hi>Our father.</hi> bycause he hath begon
to be ours, and hath lefte to be the
Iewes father, which forsoke him.
Nor a synfulle people can nat be
his chylde, but they, whose syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
are forgyuen, be callyd chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne,
and to theym euerlastynge

for euer. But howe greate is
<pb facs="tcp:9671:11"/>
the gentylnesse of the lorde? howe
plentiful is his fauour &amp; goodnes
towarde vs? That so wolde haue
vs celebrate our prayer in goddis
sight, that we shuld cal god, fader
and that as Christ is the sonne of
god, so we also shoulde be cleped
the chyldren of god. Which name
none of vs durste ones touche in
prayer, but if he had permitted vs
soo to praye. Therfore deere bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne,
we ought to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre and
knowe, that whan we cal god, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we oughte to behaue vs as
children of god, that as we take a
pleasure to haue god our father,
so he maye be pleased to haue vs
his chyldren: we shoulde behaue
vs as the temples of god, that it
myght appere, that god dwelleth
in vs. Ne our dedes shoulde not
vary from the spirit, that we that
<pb facs="tcp:9671:11"/>
haue begunne to be heuenly and
spirituall, shulde thynke nor doo
but heuenly and spiritualle thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
For god hym selfe saythe:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 2.</note> I
wyll glorifie theym, that glorifie
me, and he that despiseth me, shal
be despised.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> Also the blessed apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel
in his epistell sayth: ye are not
your owne, for ye be bought with
a great price: glorifie and beare

            <p>¶After this we saye, <hi>Halowed be
thy name,</hi> not that we desyre of god
that his name shulde be halowed
by oure prayers, but we aske of
him, that his name maye be halo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
in vs. For of whome is god
sanctified, whiche hym selfe san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
other? but bicause he saith
Be ye holy,<note place="margin">Leuit. 20.</note> for I am holy, therfore
we desyre and pray, that we, that
are sanctified in baptysme, maye
<pb facs="tcp:9671:12"/>
perseruer &amp; abyde in that we haue
begun: and this daily we pray for.</p>
            <p>For truly we had nede to be dayly
sanctified, that we, whiche synne
dayly, might pourge our synnes
with continuall fanctifycation.</p>
            <p>But what this sanctification is,
that god vouchsafeth to giue vs,
the apostelle declareth,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.</note> sayienge:
Nother fornicatours, nor Idoll
worshippers, nor brekers of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke,
nor weakelynges, nor abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of them selfes with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kynd,
nor theues, nor the couetous, nor
drunkardes, nor sclanderers, nor
cursed speakers, nor extorcioners
shall inheryte the kyngedome of
god. And suche haue you ben, but
ye be washed, ye ar made rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ye are sanctified in the name
of oure lorde Iesu Christe, and in
the spirite of our god. He saythe,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:12"/>
we be sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified in the name of our
lorde Iesu Christe, and in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of our god. That this sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
shulde remayne in vs, we
pray: and bycause god our iudge
menasseth the healed and the rely<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
of hym, to sinne no more now
leste he shulde be worse handled,
we make this continuall prayer,
this we craue bothe daye &amp; night,
that the sanctification and viui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that is goten by the grace
of god, might be kept by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>There foloweth in this prayer,
<hi>Thy kyngdome come.</hi> We desyre al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that his kyngedome be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
vnto vs, lykewyse as we
aske that his name maye be halo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
in vs. For whanne doth not
god reigne? or whan begynneth
his reigne, which alway was, and
<pb facs="tcp:9671:13"/>
euer shalbe? We desyre our kyng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome
to come, of god to vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed,
and with the bloudde and
passion of Christ gotten, that we,
which before serued in the world,
may afterward reigne with Christ
rulyng, lyke as he promyseth and
sayth:<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> Come ye blessed of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
take and receyue the kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
whiche is prepared for you
from the beginnyng of the world.
Truely it may be, dere bretherne,
that Christ hym selfe is the kyng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome
of god, whiche dayly we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre
to come: whose commyng we
couete soone to se. For seyng that
he is oure resurrection, and that
we ryse agayn in him: so likewise
he may be vnderstande the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of god. For in hym we shall
reigne.<note place="margin">Heauenly and erthly kyngdom.</note> And we do well, to desyre
the kyngdome of god, that is,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:13"/>
the kyngdom of heuen. For there
is also an erthely kyngdome. But
he that now forsaketh the worlde,
is greatter than the honours and
kyngedome therof: and therfore
he that dedicateth hym self to god
and Christe, desyreth not the erth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but the heauenly kyngdome.
We had nede to pray co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually,
leste we falle frome the heauenly
kyngedome, as the Iewes dyd, to
whom it was fyrste promysed, as
oure lorde hym selfe manyfestely
proueth:<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> Many (saythe he) shall
come from the easte and west, and
shall reste with Abraham, Isaac,
and Iacob, in the kyngedome of
heuen. But the chylderne of the
kyngedome shall be caste out into
vtter darknesse, there shalbe wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
and gnashynge of tethe. He
sheweth this, bycause the Iewes
<pb facs="tcp:9671:14"/>
were afore chylderne of the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as longe as they continued
to be the chyldren of god. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the name of the father ceassed
amonge them, theyr kyngedome
ceassed withall. And therfore we
christians, whiche in our prayer
haue begonne to call god, father:
do also praye, that the kyngedom
of god may come to vs.</p>
            <p>¶We adde therto and saye, <hi>Thy
wyll be done in erthe, as it is in heuen,</hi>
not that god shuld do that he wol,
but that we may do that god wol.
For who withstandeth god, but
that he may do what he wol? But
bycause the dyuelle withstandeth
vs, that our myndes in all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and in euery act obeyeth nat
god, we praye and desyre that the
wylle of god maye be done in vs,
whiche to the ende it may be done
<pb facs="tcp:9671:14"/>
in vs, we haue nede of Goddes
wyll, that is, of goddis helpe and
protection: for no man is stronge
of him selfe: but is sure and safe
by the indulgence and mercye of
god. For god declaryng the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of man, whiche he bare him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe,
sayth:<note place="margin">Matt. 26</note> Father, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
let this cuppe passe from me.
And gyuynge an exaumple to his
disciples, that they shulde not do
theyr owne, but goddis wylle, he
added therto sayinge: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse,
not as I wylle, but as thou
wylte. And in an nother place he
saythe:<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> I discended not from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to do myn owne wyll, but his
that sente me. If that the sonne
was obedient to doo the fathers
wyll: Howe moche more oughte
the seruaunt to be obedient to do
goddis wyll;<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 2</note> Saynte Iohu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alsoo
<pb facs="tcp:9671:15"/>
lykewyse in hys epistle exhortethe
and instructeth vs to do the wylle
of god, sayenge: Se that ye loue
not the world, neither the thinges
that are in the world. If any man
loue the world, the loue of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is nat in hym. For all that is
in the worlde, is the luste of the
fleshe, the luste of the eies, and the
pryde of lyfe, whyche is not of the
father, but of the concupiscence of
the worlde, and the world passeth
awaye, and the luste therof. But
he that doth the wyll of god, aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for euer, lyke as god abydeth
for euer. We that woll abyde for
euer, must fulfyl the wyll of god,
whiche is eternalle. The wylle of
god is, which Christ both taught
and fulfilled: humilitie in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
stablenesse in feyth, myld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in wordes, ryghtousenesse in
<pb facs="tcp:9671:15"/>
dedes, mercy in workes, discipline
in maners, not to knowe to do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
and to suffre wronge done,
to lyue quietly amonge brethern,
to loue god with all the harte, to
loue hym bycause he is the father
to feare hym bycause he is god, to
esteme nothynge aboue Chryste,
for he estemed nothing aboue vs,
to cleaue to his charitie insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
&amp; to sticke to his crosse strong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
and faythefullye, whan for his
name and honoure there is anye
stryfe: to shewe constancy in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
that we confesse hym with:
and sure truste in question, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we assayle other: pacience in
dethe, wherto we contende, this is
to wylle to be heire wyth Chryste,
this is to do goddis commaunde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
this is to fulfyll the wyll of
the father. We desyre the wylle of
<pb facs="tcp:9671:16"/>
god to be done in erthe as it is in
heuen: bothe whiche apperteyne
to the consummation of our wyll
and saluation. For sythen we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
a body of the erth, and a gost
of heuen, we be erthe and heuen,
and in bothe, that is, bodye and
gooste, we praye, that the wyll of
god be doone. Trewely there is a
wrastlyng betwene the fleshe and
the spirite, and stryuinge oone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynste
the other, they dayly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
together, that we canne not
doo the thynges that we wolde:
while the spirite seketh for heuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and diuine thynges, the fleshe
coueiteth erthly and worldly thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges.
And therfore we ernestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre,
that betweene these two, by
the ayde and helpe of god, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be made, that whan the
wylle of god is fulfylled bothe of
<pb facs="tcp:9671:16"/>
the spirite and the fleshe, the soule
whiche by hym is borne agayne,
may be saued. Whych thynge the
apostel Paule playne and openly
declareth with his owne voyce:
The fleshe (saythe he) lusteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
the spirite, and the spirite
agaynst the fleshe. These two are
so contrarye one to the other, that
you can not do what thinges that
ye wolde.<note place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> The dedes of the fleshe
be manyfeste, whiche are, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
fornications, vnclennes, fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
wantonnesse, idolatry, witch-craft,
murder, hatred, contention,
spite, wrath, prouocation, debate,
heresye, enuye, dronkennes, glot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
and suche lyke, which I tell
you before, as I haue tolde you,
that they whiche do such thinges,
shall not possesse the kyngedome
of god. But the fruit of the spirite
<pb facs="tcp:9671:17"/>
is Charitie, ioye, peace, long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferynge,
feythe, mekenesse, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
chastite. And therfore daily
yea continually we praye, that the
wyll of god be done concernynge
vs, bothe in heauen and in erthe,
For this is the wylle of god, that
erthely thynges shuld gyue place
to heuenly, and that spiritual and
diuine thynges, shulde preuayle.
It may also be thus vnderstande
dere bretherne: that bycause god
commandeth, ye and monyssheth
vs to loue our ennemies, and also
to pray for them that ꝑsecute vs,
we shulde praye for them that be
as yet erthy, and haue not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to be heuenly, that touchyng
them the wyl of god may be done,
whiche Christ fully dyd, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
and renewynge man. For
sythen he called his disciples not
<pb facs="tcp:9671:17"/>
erthy,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> but the salte of the erth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> and
the apostell calleth the fyrste man
of slyme of the erthe, erthy, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
of heauen, heauenly: with
good cause we, whiche oughte to
be lyke god the father, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his sonne to ryse vppon the
good and bad,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> and sendeth rayne
vpon the iuste and vniuste, shulde
so praye and desyre (god admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishynge)
that we myghte make
prayer for the helthe of all men.
That lyke as in heuen, that is, in
vs by our faythe, the wylle of god
is done, that as we shuld be of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
so eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in erth, that is in them
beleuynge, the wyll of god maye
be done, that they, whiche as yet
of theyr fyrste byrthe, be erthye,
borne of water and the holy goost
may begynne to be heuenly.</p>
            <p>¶Procedyng forth in our prayer
<pb facs="tcp:9671:18"/>
we aske and say: <hi>Gyue vs this daye
our dayly breade,</hi> whiche saieng may
be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spiritually and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
for bothe the vnderstandyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with diuine vtilitie, profytte
vnto saluation. For the breade of
lyfe is Christ, and this is not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans breadde, but it is oures.
And lyke as we saye, our <hi>Father</hi> by
cause it muste be vnderstande, he
is father of theym that beleue: so
we cal hym our bread.<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> For Christ,
whose bodye we touche, is oure
breade. This bread we aske day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be gyuen vs, leste we, that be
in Christe, and receyue dayly his
precious body, by some greuouser
offence chaunsynge, whyle we be
accursed out of the churche, &amp; not
communicating,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> shulde be prohy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
from that heuenly breadde,
and shulde be separated from the

body of Christe, hym selfe before
shewyng and monysshynge:<note place="margin">Iohan. 6.</note> I
am the breade of lyfe that descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from heuen. he that woll eate
of this breade, shall lyue for euer.
The breade that I woll gyue for
the lyfe of the world, is my fleshe.
Therfore whan he saythe,<note place="margin">Eodem.</note> he that
woll eate of this bread, shall lyue
for euer, it is than manyfest, they
lyue, whiche touche his body, and
receyue it by the right of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
soo contrarywyse it is to be
feared and prayed for, leste while
one accursed out of the churche, is
separated from the body of Christ
he remayne farre from saluation,
hym self thretnynge and saying,
Excepte ye eate the flesshe of the
sonne of man,<note place="margin">Eodem.</note> &amp; drynke his bloud,
ye shall haue no lyfe in you. And
therfore we aske daily our breade,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:19"/>
that is, Chryst to be gyuen to vs,
that we, that abyde and lyue in
Chryste, shulde not departe from
his sanctification and body.</p>
            <p>It may also be thus vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
that we, whiche haue forsaken the

feythe, haue caste away the riches

oure meate and foode, seinge
Chryst woll vouchsafe to instruct

that we shuld desyre to lyue longe
in this worlde, whiche prayer, that
the kingedome of god may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come. And so the blessed apostel
monisheth, forinynge &amp; strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
the stedfastnes of our hope
and faithe:<note place="margin">1. Timo. 6</note> Nothynge (sayth he)
we brought into the worlde, aud
truely we can carye nothyng out.
Therfore hauyng foode and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
let vs be content therwih.
For they that woll be ryche, falle
into the temptation and snares of
the dyuell, and into many noysom
lustes, which drowne a man into
<pb facs="tcp:9671:20"/>
distruction and damnation. For
couetousnes is the roote of all y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:
whiche, some moch desiring,
haue rounne to wrecke frome the
faythe, and tangled theym selfes
with many sorowes. He teacheth
not onely, that ryches shoulde be
despised, but also that they be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryllous,
and that in theym is the
rote of blandysshinge yuelles, the
blyndnes of mans mynde, begy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with priuie deceyt. Wherfore
Christe reprouynge the foolysshe
ryche man, that had set his mynde
on his worldly substance, &amp; reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in him self for the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his fruites, saythe in the
gospell:<note place="margin">Luce. 12.</note> Thou foole, this nyghte
shall they require thy soule frome
the, than whose shall those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
be that thou haste prepared?
The fole that shuld dye the same
<pb facs="tcp:9671:20"/>
nyght, reioysed in his fruites, and
he, whose lyfe nowe fayled, was
carefull for abundance of foode.
But Christe teacheth a contrarye
lesson,<note place="margin">Matth. 19</note> that he that wol be perfect,
muste selle a way all that he hath,
and deale it amonge poore men,
and make hym a tresure in heuen.
This man (saith Christ) foloweth
him, and the glorie of his passion,
whiche is expedite and lyght ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parayled,
not wrapped and loded
with householde stuffe, but leuse
and at lybertie, his goodes and
substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce sent afore to god, he also
foloweth after. To the which that
eche of vs may p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare him selfe, he
lerneth vs to pray, &amp; to knowe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what maner our prayer ought
to be. For no ryghtous man can
lacke his dayely foode,<note place="margin">Prou. 10.</note> sythe it is
written: The lorde kylleth not the
<pb facs="tcp:9671:21"/>
soule of a iuste man with hunger.<note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note>
And agayne: I haue ben yonger,
and nowe am olde: and haue nat
sene the iuste man forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor his
sede seke theyr breadde.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> Also the
lorde promyseth and saythe: Be
not ye carefull, sayeng: what shall
we eate, or what shall we drinke,
or wherwith shall we be clothed?
For those thinges the hethen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
seke. But your heuenly father
knowethe, that ye haue neede of
those thynges. Seke ye fyrst the
kyngedome of god, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes
therof, &amp; all these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
shall be ministred vnto you.
To them that seke the kyngdome
and rightuousnes of god, al those
thynges he promyseth to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.
For sythen all thynges be
goddes, he that hath god, lacketh
nothynge, yf he hym selfe be not
<pb facs="tcp:9671:21"/>
wantyng to god.<note place="margin">Deute. 14</note> So for Daniel,
by the kynges commaundemente
inclosed in the lyons denne, a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
from heauen was prepared,
and he the man of god dydde eate
among the hungry wyld beastes,
that hurte hym not.<note place="margin">3. Reg. 17</note> So Helyas
in his flyght was fed, and in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
by rauens and byrdes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrynge
and bryngynge to hym
meate, he was norished in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
O detestable crueltie of
mans malyce, the wylde beastes
forbeare to doo hurte, the byrdes
bryng fode to nourishe, men prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
wyles, and cruellye demeane
them selfes.</p>
            <p>¶After all this we praye for our
synnes, sayeng: <hi>And forgyue vs our
trespaces, as we forgyue them that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas
agaynst vs.</hi> After helpe of fode,
forgyuenesse of synne is desyred,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:22"/>
that he that is fedde of god, may
lyue in god, hauynge respecte not
only to this present and temporal,
but to the eternal lyfe, to the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he may come, if his synnes be
forgyuen, whiche the lorde callith
dettes, lyke as in his gospelle he
sayth:<note place="margin">Matth. 18</note> I haue forgyuen the all thy
dette, bycause thou praydest me.
But howe nedefully, howe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and howe holsomly be we
admonyshed, that we be synners,
whiche be compelled to praye for
our synnes, that while forgiuenes
is craued of god, the mynde maye
remember his conscience. For to
the ende no man shulde stande in
his owne conceyte, as though he
were an innocent, and extollynge
hym selfe, shuld peryshe the more
he is instructed &amp; taughte, that he
synneth dayely, sythen he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb facs="tcp:9671:22"/>
dayely to praye for his
synnes. And thus fynallye Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in his epistell admonyssheth vs,<note place="margin">1. Iohan. 1</note>
sayeng: If we saye that we haue
no synne, we deceyue our selues,
and the truth is not in vs. But if
we woll confesse oure synnes, the
lorde is faithfull and iuste, whiche
wol forgyue vs our sinnes. Both
these he hath comprised in his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell:
that we oughte to praye for
our synnes, and that we shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
forgyuenes whan we praye.
And therfore he saith, god is faith
full to forgyue synnes, holdynge
the faith of his promise. For why
he that taught vs to praye for our
sinnes, hath ꝓmised, that fatherly
mercy and forgyuenes shulde fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.
He hath ioyned and added
therto a lawe, constraynynge vs
with a certayn condition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:23"/>
that we shulde so desyre our
synnes to be forgiuen vs euen as
we forgiue theym that trespas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynste
vs: Knowynge well, that
it canne nat be obteyned, that we
aske for our sinnes, rxcept we wol
doo the lyke to them that trespas
agaynste vs. And therfore in an
other place he saithe:<note place="margin">Matth 7</note> With what
measure ye mette, with the same
shall it be mesured to you agayn.
And he the seruaunt, whiche after
his lord hadde forgyuen hym all
his duetie, wolde not forgyue his
felowe, was trowen into pryson.
Bicause he wold not gentilly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
his felowe, he loke that that
his lord had courteisly giuen him.
Whiche thynges Chryste in his
preceptes more strongly, and with
more vigour of his sharpe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
fortolde vs:<note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> And whan ye
<pb facs="tcp:9671:23"/>
stande to praye (sayth he) forgiue,
yf ye haue ought against any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that your father also whiche is in
heuen, may forgiue you your tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes:
but if you wol not forgiue,
no more woll your father that is
in heauen forgyue your offences.
There is no excuse for the, at the
day of iudgement, whanne thou
shalt be iudged after thyne owne
sentence: and that thou hast done,
that shalt thou suffre. For god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
that such as loue peace,
concorde, &amp; to liue in vnitie, shuld
dwelle in his house: and suche as
he made vs in our seconde natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
suche he woll vs beinge borne
againe, to perseuer: that we whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
haue begunne to be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of god, shuld remain in the peace
of god, and we that haue one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,
shoulde be of one minde and
<pb facs="tcp:9671:24"/>
intent: for so god receyueth our
sacrifice. He commaundethe the
stryuer, retournyng from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,
fyst to reconcile hym to his
brother, that with prayers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge
from an harte, that loueth
peace, god may be pacified. Our
peace and brotherly concorde, and
the people knytte togyther in the
vnitie of the father &amp; of the sonne,
and of the holy goste, is a sacrifice
hyghly acceptable vnto god. For
god regarded not the gyftes and
offerynges that Abill and Cayne
the fyrst,<note place="margin">Genes. 4.</note> offred vp in sacrifice, but
he behelde theyr hartes, that he
shulde pleace hym with his gyfte,
that pleased hym in his hart. The
peasible and iust Abell innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offrynge vp his sacrifyce vnto
god, taught all other, whan they
offre theyr gyft at the altare, so to
<pb facs="tcp:9671:24"/>
come with the drede of god, with
a symple harte, with the lawe of
iustice, with the peace of concord.
He that was suche in the sacrifice
of god, was afterwarde worthily
made a sacrifyce to god: that he
fyrste shewyng a profe of martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
with the glory of his bloud
tasted the lordes passion, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
had in hym bothe iustyce and
peace. Suche the lorde crowneth,
such at the day of iudgement shal
with the lorde be reuenged. But
he that is at debate and strife, and
lyueth not in peace with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
(lyke as the blessed apostle
&amp; holy scripure witnesse) though
he shuld be slayne for the name of
Chryst, yet coude he not escape the
cryme of dyssention. For as it is
written:<note place="margin">1. Iohan. 3</note> who soo euer hateth his
brother, is a mankyller: &amp; a man
<pb facs="tcp:9671:25"/>
sleer commeth not to the kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heuen, that he may lyue
with god. For he can nat be with
Chryst, that had rather be the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of Iudas than of Chryste.
What maner synne is it, that can
nat with the baptisme of bloudde
be washed awaye? What faute or
offence is it, that can nat be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with martyrdome?</p>
            <p>¶This also our lord necessarily
werneth vs, that in our prayer we
shulde saye: <hi>And let vs not be ledde
into temptation.</hi> In the whiche part
it is sheweth, that our aduersarye
can nothynge do ageynst vs, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
god before permytte hym: to
the ende that all our feare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
and obseruation, shulde
be conuerted to God. For in oure
temptations the fende hathe noo
power, without it be gyuen hym
<pb facs="tcp:9671:25"/>
of god, as holy scripture proueth,
whiche sayth:<note place="margin">4. Reg. 24.</note> Nabuchodonosor,
the kynge of Babylon camme to
Hierusalem, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querid it, and
god gaue it into his hande. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is gyuen to the dyuell ageinst
vs, after as our synnes be, as it
is wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:<note place="margin">Esay. 42.</note> Who gaue Iacob and
Israel to them to be trode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder
foote and spolyed? Dyd not god,
ageynst whome they synned, and
wolde nat walke in his ways, nor
here his lawes, therfore hathe he
brought on them the wrath of his
displeasure? And agayne, of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
synnynge and leauyng the
commandementes and wayes of
the lorde, thus it is wrytten:<note place="margin">3. Reg. 12.</note> The
lorde raysed an aduersarye vnto
Salomon.</p>
            <p>¶Power is gyuen agaynste vs
two maner of wayes: eyther for
<pb facs="tcp:9671:26"/>
our punishment, when we offend,
or elles for our glorie, when we be
proued: lyke as we see doone on
Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> god declarynge and saying,
Beholde, all thyuges, what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he hath, I gyue into thy han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
but beware thou touche hym
not. And Christ in the tyme of his
passion,<note place="margin">Iohan. 19</note> saith in the gospel: Thou
shuldest haue no power on me, yf
it were not gyuen the from aboue
Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray, that we fal not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation, we be admonished
of our infirmitie and weakenes,
while we so pray, to thend no man
shuld extolle hym selfe, that noo
man shuld proudely &amp; arrogantly
take any thing vpon him, that no
man shuld repute it his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie,
eyther of confessyon, or of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
sithen our lord hym felf tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge
humilitie,<note place="margin">Marc. 14</note> sayth: Watche
<pb facs="tcp:9671:26"/>
and pray, that ye fal not into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
The spirite is wyllynge,
but the flesh is weke: so that when
an humble and lowly confessyon
goth before, and al togither ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vnto the lorde: what soo euer
in lowly wyse, with feare and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of god is asked, of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he woll graunt vs.</p>
            <p>¶After all these thynges, in the
fynyshynge of our prayer cometh
this clause in a briefe collection,
concludyng all our petitions, and
prayers. For in the laste place we
saye: <hi>But delyuer us from euyll,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendynge
all aduersities, that
our ennemye endeuoureth to doo
agaynst vs in this worlde: frome
the whiche a trustye and sure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
may be, yf god woll delyuer
vs, yf we humblye prayenge and
tenderly besechynge hym, he woll
<pb facs="tcp:9671:27"/>
vouchesafe to helpe vs. Whan
we say: <hi>Delyuer vs from euyll,</hi> there
remaynethe nothynge nowe that
ought to be farther asked, whan
we shall haue oones desyred the
Protection of god agaynst yuell:
whyche being opteyned agaynste
all thynges, that the dyuell and
the worlde worketh, we may stand
sure and safe. For wat dreede of
the worlde is to hym, to whom in
the worlde god is the defendour?
What meruail is it, dere brethern
if the prayer be suche, whiche god
taught, whiche as a maister most
worthye, hath abreuiate all oure
peace with his helthefull worde?
Nowe this thing was before told
by the prophete Esaye, whanne he
beinge replenyshed with the holy
gooste,<note place="margin">Esaye. 10.</note> spake of the maiestie and
pitie of god: A worde consumyng
<pb facs="tcp:9671:27"/>
(sayth he) and breuiatynge in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styce:
for god shall make shorte
his worde in all the roundnesse
of the erthe. For whan the worde
of god, our lorde Iesus Christe,
came to all men, gatherynge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther
bothe the lerned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerned,
to euery kynde and aege,
he gaue preceptes of saluation:
he made a compendyous worke
of his preceptes, bycause the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of the lerners shoulde not
be greued in the heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly discipline
but shulde quickly lerne that that
shuld be necessary to the pure and
symple faith. So whan he taught
what euerlasting life is, in a great
and diuine briefenes, he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the mistery of lyfe,<note place="margin">Iohan. 17</note> saying:
This is the lyfe euerlastyng, that
they know the, to be the only true
god, &amp; whom thou hast sent. Iesu
<pb facs="tcp:9671:28"/>
Christ. Also when he gatherid out
of the law &amp; prophetes, the fyrst &amp;
chiefest preceptes:<note place="margin">Deuter. 6</note> Harke (he said)
Israell, thy lorde god, is one lord
onely. And thou shalte loue thy
lorde god with all thy harte, with
all thy soule, &amp; with all thy myght
and power. This is the fyrst, and
the seconde is lyke to this: Thou
shalt loue the neyghbour as thy
selfe. In these two commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
hange al the lawe and the
prophetes. And agayne he sayth:
What so euer you wold that men
shulde do to you, euen so do ye to
them.<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> This is the lawe and the
prophetes. And the lorde hath not
taught vs with onely wordes to
praye, but also with dedes: he him
selfe ofte prayenge, and with the
wyttenesse of his owne exaumple
shewynge vs, what we oughte to
<pb facs="tcp:9671:28"/>
do, lyke as it is wryten:<note place="margin">Luc. 9.</note> He was
goynge into wyldernes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge.
And agayne:<note place="margin">Mat. 14.</note> He went into
a mountay ne to praye,<note place="margin">Marc. 6.</note> and was
all nyghte in his prayers. Nowe
if he prayed, that was withoute
synne, howe moche more oughte
synners to praye? And yf he wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge
all the nyght longe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
continually, howe moche more
ought we to watche in the nyghte
and busily praye? The lorde prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and made petition, not for hym
selfe: for what shuld an innocent
praye for hym selfe? but for our
offences, lyke as he hym selfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
where he saythe to Peter:
Beholde, Sathan hath desyred,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note>
that he myghte syfte you euen as
wheate: but I haue prayd for the,
that thy feyth fayle not. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
he prayed the father for
<pb facs="tcp:9671:29"/>
all sayinge:<note place="margin">Iohan. 17</note> I praye not for these
onely, but also for those, whiche
throughe theyr worde shall beleue
on me, that they all maye be one,
lyke as thou father art in me, and
I in the, that they also may be one
in vs. Great is the benignitie and
mercy of the lorde for our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that was not contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme
vs with his bloud, but more
ouer wolde vouchesafe to pray for
vs. But se what he desyred in his
prayer, That lyke as the father
and the sonne be one, soo we also
shuld remayne in that <hi>Vnitie,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
we maye well perceyue, howe
gretly he offendeth, that breaketh
that vnitie and peace, seinge the
lorde prayed for it, wyllynge to
haue his people knytte to gether
in one: knowynge full well, that
<hi>Discorde</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not to the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:9671:29"/>
of god. But whan we stand
to praye, dere bretherne we muste
watche, and with all the hole hart
applye our selfe to prayers. All
worldely and carnall care muste
be laid apparte, ne the mind shuld
runne on no other thing than that
that is prayed for. And therfore
the priest before he prayeth, with
a preface prepareth the mindes of
his bretherne, sayeng, <hi>Sursum corda,</hi>
vp the hartes: that whan the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
answereth. <hi>Habemus ad dominum,</hi>
we haue to the lorde: he is admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed,
that he shulde thynke on
none other thing than on the lord.
Let the breaste be shutte agaynste
the aduersary, &amp; open to god one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
ne he shulde not suffre the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of god to approche nere hym
in the tyme of prayer: For often
tymes he cometh priuely, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
<pb facs="tcp:9671:30"/>
in, and subtilly deceyuynge,
draweth our prayers frome god:
to thend we shuld haue one thing
in our hartes, and an other in our
wordes. whan the mynde &amp; sense,
and not the sounde of the voyce,
must pray to the lorde with a syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
intention. For what a slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gysshe
slouthfulnesse is it, to be
withdrawen and caught with py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysshe
and prophane thoughtes,
whan thou shuldest praye to the
lorde, as thoughe there were any
other thynge, that thou shouldest
more thinke vpon, than that thou
speakest with god? Howe desyrest
thou to be herde of god, whanne
thou canst not here thy selfe? wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou haue god myndefull of
the in thy prayer, whan thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrest

not to be beware vtterly of thyne
<pb facs="tcp:9671:30"/>
ennemie, that is, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou prayst
the lorde, to offende the maiestie
of god with thy negligent praier:
that is, to watche with the eyes,
and flepe with the hart: where as
a chrysten man ought to watche
with the harte, whanne he slepeth
with the eyes. Lyke as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the name of the Churche

watchynge in the same, teachyng

before god. The prayers do soone
ascende vp to god, whiche the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of our worke do bryng vnto
god. So the aungelle Raphaell
was alway to Tobie praying and
workynge a continuall wytnesse,
sayenge: To reuele and aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
the warkes of god is moche
honourable. For whan thou and
Sara prayedst, I offered vp the
memorie of your prayer before the
syght of the clerenes of god. And
whan thou symplye buriedst the
deade, and bycause thou taryedst
nat to rise, and to leaue thy dynar
and wentest &amp; buriedst the deade,
and I was sent to tempte the, and
agayne god sent me, to heale the,
and Sara thy daughter in lawe.

For I am Raphael one of the. vii
ryghtous aungels, whiche stande
and ar conuersant before the clere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of god.<note place="margin">Esay. 58.</note> Also the lord, by Esai
admonysheth and teacheth lyke
thynges, sayenge: Unknyt euery
knotte of vnryghtuousnes: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lose
the stranglynges of wycked
bargaynes: Let the oppressed go
free, and disparple al vnrightous
thoughte. Deale thy bredde to
the hungrye, and bryng the poore
fatherles home into thy house. If
thou see oone naked, clothe hym
and despise not the household ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uauntes
of thy sede. Than shall
thy lyght breake forthe in tyme,
and thy garmentes shall soone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryse,
and ryghtousnes shall goo

shall compasse the aboute. Than
thou shalte crye out, and god shal

here the, whyle thou art speakyng
he shall saye: Lo, I am here. He
promyseth to be present, and to

vnknytte the knottes of vnright

p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceptes, whyle they here that god
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth to be done, they also
meryte to be harde of god. The
blessed apostle Paul,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> being holpe
of the bretherne in the nede of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
calleth the workes that
were done to him, the sacrifices of
god: I was (saith he) euen fylled,
receiuyng of Epaphroditus those
thynges, whiche were sent frome
you, an odour of swetenes, a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
acceptable and pleasant to
god. For whan a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taketh pitie
on the poore, he playeth the vserer
<pb facs="tcp:9671:33"/>
with god: and he that gyueth to
the pore and nedy, gyueth to god,
spiritually he doth sacrifice to god
an odour of swetenesse. In cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratynge
prayers we fynde, that
the thre chyldern with Daniel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stronge in feith, and victours
in captiuitie, obseruyd the thyrde,
the syxte, and nynthe howre, as a
sacramente of the Trinite, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
shoulde be opened in the laste
dayes. For the fyrste houre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge
into the thyrde, shewethe
the perfecte nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Trinite.
Also from the fourthe, procedyng
to the syxte houre, declareth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Trinite. And whan from the
vii. the. ix. houre is accomplished,
by thyrde houres the perfecte try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
is numbred: whiche spacys
of houres, the true worshyppers
of god, dyd lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge sence spiritually
<pb facs="tcp:9671:33"/>
determine, that they seruid to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at certayne lauful and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
tymes, and afterwarde, the
thynge was manyfest, to be some
tyme a sacrament, that iuste men
afore dyd so praye. For the thyrde
houre, the holy ghost came downe
vpon the disciples, whiche fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
the grace of the lordis promise.
Also Peter, at the. vi. houre ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
vp into the howse aboue,
was instructed bothe with sygne
and voyce of God, monysshynge
hym, that he shulde admyt al men
to the grace of saluation, when he
before doubted, whether he shuld
admyt and clense the gentyles or
no. And the lorde being crucified
at the howre of. vi. at. ix. of the
clocke, with his bloud dyd washe
away our synnes: and to thende
he myght redeme and reuyue vs,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:34"/>
he than with his passyon accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plysshed
his vyctorie. But to vs,
dere bretherne, besyde the howres
of praying, of olde time obserued,
bothe the tymes and sacramentes
haue increasid. For now we must
praye in the mornynge, that the
lordes resurrection maye be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
with the mornynge prayer:
whiche thynge the holy goost dyd
notifie longe ago in the psalmes,
saying:<note place="margin">Psalm. 5.</note> My kynge and my god,
yarly in the mornynge to the lord
woll I pray, and thou shalte here
my voyce, Betime in the morning
I woll gette me to the, and wolle
intentiuely beholde the. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne
by the Prophete, the lorde
saythe: Yarly before the sonne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng,
they shall watche to me, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge:
Lette vs go and returne to
the lorde our god.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9671:34"/>¶Also whanne the sonne gothe
downe, and the daye fayleth, it is
necessarye that we praye ageyne.
For, bycause Christe is the verye
sonne and the very day, the sonne
and the day of this worlde depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
whan we pray and desyre,
that lyght maye come ouer vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne,
we craue the commyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne
of Christe, the grace of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
light, to be giuen vs. That
Christe is called the day, the holy
ghooste declareth in the psalmes,
sayenge:<note place="margin">Psal. 117.</note> The same stone, whiche
the buylders refused, is made the
hed stone of the corner: this is the
lordis doinge, and it is meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in our eies. This is the day,
whiche the lorde hath made, lette
vs walke, and be ioyfull in it.</p>
            <p>Also that he is callid the Sonne,
the prophet Malachie doth wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:35"/>
sayeng:<note place="margin">Malach. 3.</note> But vnto you, that
feare the Lordes name, shall the
sonne of rightousnes arise, and in
his wynges is healthe. Howe yf
Christ in holy scripture be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sonne and the very daye, there
is no houre exceptid to christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but that god ought to be ofte and
alwaye adored: that we, whyche
be in Christe, that is, in the verye
sonne, and in the very day, shuld
styl pray, and bryng the day to an
ende with prayers: and whan the
day is gone, and the nyght by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
and course is come, it is
noo dammage to them, that woll
praye in the darke season of the
nyghte. For with the chyldern of
lyghte, the daye is in the nyghte.
For whan is he without lyght, in
whose harte is lyghte? Or howe
dothe the sonne and the day fayle
<pb facs="tcp:9671:35"/>
hym, with whome the sonne and
the day Christe, is? We that be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in Christ, that is, in the light,
shulde not in the night cesse from
prayer. Soo Anna the wydowe,
without intermission praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
and watchynge, perseuered
in meritynge with god, lyke as it
is written in the gospell:<note place="margin">Luc. 2.</note> She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
not (sayth he) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nyght and day seruynge god
in fastynge and prayeng. Let the
gentiles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not yet illumined:
or the Iewes, which leauyng the
light, haue remained in darknes,
Ioke vp and se. We dere brethern,
which be alway in the light of the
lorde, whyche remember and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
what we haue begun to
be sens we receyued grace, shulde
recken the nyght for daye. Let vs
beleue, to walke alway in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light,
<pb facs="tcp:9671:36"/>
we can not be hyndered with the
darknes, which we haue escaped:
let no houre scape vs from prayer
in the nyght, let no prayer be lost,
through slouth and sluggyshnes.
We, that by the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of god, are spiritually newe
made and borne ageyne, shoulde
folowe that that we shall haue in
the kyngdome of heauen, oonely
day without any night. So in the
night as in the light, let vs alway
watche and pray, and gyue than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
to god. Also lette vs not here
ceasse to pray and thanke hym.</p>
