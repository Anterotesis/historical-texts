            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Will not so far Rail at my own <hi>Practice,</hi> as to Exclaim against <hi>Epistles</hi> of this Nature, to People of the First Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, from Persons below 'em: However, I think, 'tis much more Reasonable, to Express our Gratitude to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friend in the best manner we can; than Court one, to be so, who values neither the <hi>Man,</hi> nor his <hi>Dedication,</hi> farther, than it Flatters his Vanity. The <hi>Author</hi> is not allways Guiltless of this Weakness; To shew that he is Acquainted with a <hi>Man of Note and Dignity,</hi> he shall Confess Favours he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Receiv'd; and, more often Petition for 'em, than he shall ever Succeed. 'Tis Pity, indeed, Men of <hi>Generous Education</hi> and <hi>Sentiments,</hi> shou'd be Expos'd to such Mean Things, as to have an Occasion to Complain, that there are in <hi>England</hi> (the Noblest Nation of <hi>Europe</hi>) a People, Wearing all the Marks of Grandeur and Magnificence, whose Souls wou'd, much better, Agree with the Good Husbandry of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi> A People, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing a Value for the <hi>Muses,</hi> and such as Belong to 'em; while, in the Little Care they take, to Incourage their Studies, we Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Concern for the <hi>Sisters</hi> and their <hi>Sons</hi> Consists in nothing more, than Promoting their Interest, and Humouring their own Conceit of Inspiration. <hi>Praise</hi> is ever Wellcome when it Costs Nothing: and if a Good Word, or a Fair Promise, will Engage a <hi>VVriter</hi> to Speak Well of one that wants it, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is Cheap enough, when it can be so easily Purchas'd. Tho' a Little VVarmer Assistance, wou'd, sometimes be necessary: Yet this is the Entertainment we have Generally found. And since the <hi>Patrons</hi> are of such Miserable Dispositions, I see no reason why we shou'd not Prefer the <hi>Friends we Converse with,</hi> and who are fond of Serving us, before such as Treat us, like their <hi>Domesticks,</hi> in every thing but Promoting us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61978:3"/>
               <hi>Experience</hi> tells me, there are many, whose <hi>Names</hi> are not so often repeated, nor their <hi>Liveries</hi> so much seen, who Deserve as well to be Remembred, as those who Affect to be Popular, only by having it in their <hi>Power</hi> to do Good, tho' it is never in their <hi>Natures.</hi> A <hi>Free, Easie Conversation,</hi> a <hi>Pleasant Temper,</hi> and a <hi>Readiness</hi> to <hi>Oblige</hi> a <hi>Friend,</hi> in Every Thing that a Man is able; are Qualities, which will Eternally Render such a one Happy Himself, and all those Happy who know him.</p>
            <p>That you Possess these, every body, of your Acquaintance, must Confess; tho' no Man has had more Temptation than you to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse his <hi>Stars,</hi> and consequently to be allwayes out of Humour, and Help to make your Friends as uneasie as Himself; as I have known some Persons, with whom the VVorld, being with Justice disgusted, endeavour to make those they Converse with, as wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as themselves, in their perpetual Spleen and Vexation. The <hi>Persecution</hi> of a Father is sufficient to give a Man an Ill Opinion of Mankind in General; but, as yours is no more your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, than the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> has made him, you have Learn't to Treat him with the same Indifference his <hi>Ill Practices</hi> have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd from the rest of the VVorld: A Man must have a great deal of Good Nature, that can stand out against the Injustice and Oppression of those, who, in Duty, are bound to Protect him. But there are some Men, so Awkard in their VVicked Actions, that they make themselves Ridiculous, when they aim at being Dreadful; and, like the Person you deal with, provoke Pity rather than Terror. Folly being generally its own punishment: and those that aim at Ruining another, seldom fail of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves. I would not say so much of this in so open a place, but that I believe there are many Labouring under the same Inconvenience, who have not heart to Disingage themselves so well as you, from the Troubles of a Marry<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Life and a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and, to appear as Gay, in the midst of Disappointments, as if you were the Master of your Vows and Fortune. I beg you to accept this <hi>Present,</hi> as a
Hearty Return for the many Civilities I have Receiv'd from you: and, since 'tis much more <hi>Shakespears</hi> than Mine, to make it a part of your Diversion, in the Long Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement of a <hi>Vacation.</hi>
