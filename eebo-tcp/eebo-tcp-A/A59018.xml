            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THO' we ought not rashly to rake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ashes of Princes, and expose either their Personal Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, or their Failures, in Management of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet, no doubt, but the making them Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, may sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, not a little, to the General Good: This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb facs="tcp:93088:3"/>
from the Effects of our <hi>Secret History</hi> of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Two last Monarchs;</hi> since by it, the most wilfully Blind may be convinced how infinitely Happy we are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their present Majesty's Government; beyond what we were, in the late Reigns; which were but a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable matter (if any thing) below the <hi>French Tyranny;</hi> and by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the unparallel'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that are so Resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns,
<pb facs="tcp:93088:3"/>
in opposition to those Ignominious Vices that reigned in the Other, we may, with all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World, assure our selves of a lasting Peace; and as much Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness under Them <hi>Now,</hi> as we had Troubles and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions under the <hi>Former:</hi> For Their Religion, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and Moderation, (which must always be in conjunction with Princes, that are truly <hi>Patres Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi>) are as Notorious to
<pb facs="tcp:93088:4"/>
the World, (so that Their greatest Enemies cannot deny them) as were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, and furious Bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of the Two former Reigns; Vices much of the same pernicious Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to a Kingdom, if the latter be not the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; since the greatest Villanies, that ever were perpetrated in the World, have been Masqued with seeming Zeal for Religion.</p>
            <p>But since there are not a few, who, tho' they seem to
<pb facs="tcp:93088:4"/>
decry the Tyrannies of the <hi>Two late Kings,</hi> yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of much the same Actions of the <hi>Two</hi> that Preceded Them, (One of whom, some Men have Vainly, if not Blasphemously, compared to the <hi>King of Kings.</hi>) I thought it not amiss, to Communicate a few Passages of Their Reigns, that do not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly occur; especially since they laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of that Tyranny, which the Others brought
<pb facs="tcp:93088:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to so great a Perfection. As to the former of Them, <hi>viz.</hi> K. <hi>James I.</hi> it will easily appear, from this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing History, what great steps He made towards Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: It is certain, That the reason He gave for setting up Episcopacy in <hi>Scotland</hi> was, That He might have so many Friends to rely upon in Parliament, <hi>i. e.</hi> That by them, as the <hi>Dead-Weight,</hi> He might the better carry on His Designs there: And herein
<pb facs="tcp:93088:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His Politicks did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Him; for, by their Means, He and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, found it no hard matter to reduce that Kingdom to as great Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as any <hi>Europe</hi> hath groaned under of late Years. How great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient He was, in the Art of Dissimulation, or King-Craft, will be no less ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: I shall only insert one Instance of it Here, which I omitted in the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> especially, because I
<pb facs="tcp:93088:6"/>
think it may not be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>Reader, viz.</hi> That after His return from <hi>Denmark</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> seeming mightily satisfied with the Care the Kirk-Party had taken to preserve the Kingdom in Peace, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Absence; He was pleased to express himself thus, in a general Assembly, <q>That He blest <hi>God,</hi> that He was Born at sike a Time of the Gospel, and to be King of sike a Kirk, the purest Kirk in the
<pb facs="tcp:93088:6"/>
World: The Kirk of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> says He, keep <hi>Yeul</hi> and <hi>Pasch;</hi> What have they from the Word of <hi>God</hi> for that? And for our Neighbour Kirk of <hi>England,</hi> What is their Service, but an ill said Mass in <hi>English?</hi>
               </q> And concluded with the Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Promises, to Maintain &amp; Preserve the Kirk; when (in the mean while) He was taking all underhand Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to Supplant it, as He did a few Years after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93088:7"/>And as to His Successor, tho' a Kalender'd Saint; yet after all the lying Insinuations of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing, and—ridden Persons, of that Princes singular Religion, that very Act of Instituting <hi>Plays</hi> and <hi>Sports</hi> on the Lord's-Day, is no extraordinary Proof of it. Nay, it would be as easie to perswade a Person of any Religion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the <hi>Alcharon</hi> is the Word of <hi>God,</hi> as that a Prince, of any Religion, could be guilty of so <hi>Irreligious</hi> an Act, as that was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I will not weary the <hi>Reader's</hi> Patience with a large Preface, since the very Subject of the following <hi>History</hi> will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it self sufficiently to the Perusal of all Lovers of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93088:8"/>And now all Preparations was made to meet the KING in <hi>York,</hi> that he might, in that <hi>Northern Metropolis,</hi> appear like a King of <hi>England,</hi> and take that State on him there, which was not known in <hi>Scotland:</hi> There met Him all the Lords of the Council, and there did they all make Court to the <hi>Scotch</hi>-Men, that were most in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King; and there did the <hi>Scotch</hi> Courtiers lay the first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their <hi>English</hi> Fortunes; the chief of them was Sir <hi>George Hewme,</hi> a kind of Favorite; but not such as after appeared, with young Faces and smooth Chins; but one that for his Wisdom and Gravity had been in some Secret Counsels with his Master, which created that dearness between them; and the chief of those Secrets, was that of <hi>Gowry</hi>'s <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> though that Nation gave little credit to the Story, but would speak both slightly and despitefully of it; and those, the Wisest of that Nation; knowing indeed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93088:8"/>
there was no such Conspiracy; yet, that the World might be still abused, they continued to Mock Almighty <hi>GOD,</hi> by a Weekly Commemoration in the <hi>Tuesday</hi>'s Sermon, and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary-Feast, as great as it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, for the Kings Preservation, ever on the Fifth of <hi>August:</hi> And I wish the effects of those <hi>Sermons</hi> in the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s time, were not one cause of <hi>God's</hi> Anger towards the <hi>Son.</hi>

Enslave the Nation; which, though it took well then, yet it hath been of sad and dangerous consequence in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times; for, first, he caused great numbers of <hi>Parliament Precedents,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Liberties of the Subject,</hi> to be burnt; next, raising Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thousand Pounds, for making Two Hundred Baronets; telling the King, <hi>He should find his</hi> English <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects like Asses, on whom he might lay any Burthen;</hi> but this Statesman died soon after very Miserable, coming from <hi>Bath,</hi> and was Buried on the top of a <hi>Mole-Hill,</hi> near <hi>Marleboroug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93088:10"/>
surely they did, because they knew not of any: The <hi>Protestants</hi> were, the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and <hi>George Brook</hi> his Brother; the one very Learned and Wise, the other a most silly Lord: The <hi>Puritan,</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Walton,</hi> a very hopeful Gentleman: The <hi>Papists, Watson</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> Priests; and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a Gentleman: The <hi>Atheist,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Rawleigh,</hi> then generally so belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though after brought by Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the best School-Mistress) to be (and so Died) a most Religious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. This <hi>Sham-Plot</hi> was chiefly designed by <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in which he has a double benefit; first, in rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself of such as he feared would have been Thorns in his sides; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by endearing himself to the King, by shewing his diligence and vigilancy for his Safety.</p>
            <p>They were all Araigned of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at <hi>Winchester;</hi> whither the King sent some secretly to observe all Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages; upon whose true and faithful

Relations of the Innocency of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Arraigned, and slight proof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they were Condemned, he would not be drawn to Sign any Warrant for the Execution of <hi>Rawleigh, Cobham,</hi> and <hi>Grey:</hi> For <hi>Rawleigh</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it was so brave and just, as (had he not wilfully Cast himself, out of very weariness, as unwilling to detain the Company any longer) no Jury could ever have Cast him.</p>
            <p>Yet Sir <hi>W. Rawleigh</hi> was Executed many years after for the same Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as much against all Justice, as beyond all Reason and Precedent. Yea, after he had been a General by the Kings Commission, and had, by that, Power of the Lives of many others, utterly against the Civil Law, which saith, <hi>He that hath Power of the Lives of others, ought to be Master of his Own.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was so Powerful at that time at Court, as that Faction could command the Life of any Man, that might prove dangerous to their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93088:11"/>
Designs: His Death was by him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with so High, Generous, and Religious a Resolution, as if a Roman had acted a Christian, or rather a Christian a Roman. During his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, he was Delivered of that <hi>Minerva,</hi> The History of the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now did the great Mannagers of the State (of which <hi>Salisbury</hi> was Chief,) after they had Packed the Cards, begin to deal the Government of the Kingdom among themselves; yet, for all their setting their Cards, and playing their Games to their own advantages, there was one Knave in the Pack would couzen their designs, and Trump in their way, if he might not share with them in their winning; and that was one <hi>Lake,</hi> a Clerk of the Signet, afterwards made Secretary, and after that turned out in disgrace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This <hi>Lake</hi> was a fellow of mean Birth, and meaner Breeding, being an under Servant to make Fires in Secretary <hi>Walsingham</hi>'s Chamber; and there got
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93088:12"/>
some experience; which afterwards, in this King's Time, made him appear an able Man, which in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Time, when there was none in Court but Men of Eminency, made him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable Fellow: This <hi>Lake</hi> had linked himself with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, helping them (<hi>per fas aut nefas</hi>) to fill their Purses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For his good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of abusing his Country and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, he was made Clerk of the Signet, to wait on the King in his Hunting Journies; and in these Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies got all the Bills Signed, even for the greatest Lords, (all Packets being addressed to him,) so that <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the greatest Lords, made Court to him: By this means did he raise himself from a mean, to a great Fortune; but much over-awed by his Wife, which after proved his overthrow; besides, he would tell Tales, and let the King know the passages at Court, and great Men; as who was <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Mistress,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93088:12"/>
and who governed all; who govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Northampton;</hi> and discovered the Bawdery, which did infinitely please the King's Humour; and in truth, had so much Craft, as he served his turn upon all, but was Ingrossed by none, but by the Bed-Chamber; who stuck so close to him, that they could not yet remove him. And now do the <hi>English</hi> Faction (seeing they could not sever the <hi>Scots</hi> from him) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to raise a Mutiny against the <hi>Scots</hi> that were his Supporters; their Agents divulging every where, <hi>The</hi> Scots <hi>would get all, and would Beggar the Kingdom:</hi> The <hi>Scots,</hi> on the other side complain to the King, they were so poor they under-went the by-word of <hi>Beggarly-Scots:</hi> To which the King returned this Answer, <hi>Content your selves, I will shortly make the</hi> English <hi>as Beggarly as you,</hi> and so ended that Controversie: This is as true, as he truly performed it; for however he enriched many, in particular, as <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93088:13"/>
Suffolk, Northampton, Worcester, Lake,</hi> &amp;c. yet he did beggar Himself, and the Nation in general.</p>
            <p>But they that lived at Court, and were curious Observers of every Mans Actions, could have then affirmed, That <hi>Salisbury, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and their Friends, did get more than the whole Nation of <hi>Scotland, (Dunbar</hi> excepted;) for what-ever others got, they spent here, only <hi>Dunbar</hi> laid a Foundation of a great Family.</p>
            <p>To take off the Subjects Eyes from observing the Indulgency used by K. <hi>James,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Papists</hi> (whom, though he had no cause to Love, he thought he found reason enough to Fear) a Quarrel was revived (now almost asleep, because it had long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped Persecution, the Bellows of Schisme) with a People stiled <hi>Puritans,</hi> who meeting no nearer a definition than the Name, all the conscientious
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93088:13"/>
Men in the Nation shared the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; neither was any charged with it, though in the best relation thought competent for Preserment in Church or State; which made the Bad glory in their Impiety: Court-Sermons were fraught with bitter Invectives against these People, whom they seated in a Class far nearer the Confines of <hi>Hell,</hi> than <hi>Papists:</hi> And to avoid the very Imputation of Puritanism (a greater rub in the way of Preferment than Vice) our Divines, for the generality, did Sacrifice more time to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> than <hi>Minerva;</hi> and for their ordinary Studies, they were School Points and Passionate Expressions, as more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with the F—than the Fathers; scoffing in their ordinary Discourse at <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> but especially at the last; so as a certain Bishop thank'd <hi>God</hi> he never (though a good Poet himself) had read a Line in him or <hi>Chaucer.</hi> The same used this simile at Court, <hi>That our Religion, like the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93088:14"/>
Kings-Arms, stood between Two Beasts, the</hi> Puritans <hi>and</hi> Papists. Nor did the Extravagancy of many of the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy add a little to the Rent, much augmented by the <hi>Scotish</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity to <hi>Presbytery;</hi> nor did the often and sudden Translation of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, from less to greater Sees, give time to visit sufficiently their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Charges; being more intent upon the Receipt of such Taxes, as a long abused custom had estated them in, than upon Reformation. The Court-Sermons informing His Majesty, He might, as <hi>Christ's</hi> Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, command all; and that the People, if they denied him Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or enquired after the disposure of it, were Presumptuous Peepers into the Sacred Ark of the State; not to be done, but under the severest Curse, though it appeared likely to fall, thro' the falshood or folly of those at the Helm: But on the contrary, other qualified Preachers did fulminate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93088:14"/>
               <hi>Non-Residency, Profanation of the Lords-Day, Connivance at</hi> Popery, <hi>Persecution of</hi> God's <hi>People,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, by this time, the Nation grew Feeble, and over-opprest with <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, Monopolies, Aids, Privy-Seals, Concealments, Pretermitted Customs,</hi> &amp;c. besides all Forfeitures upon <hi>Penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> with a multitude of more Tricks, to cheat the Subject (the most, if not all, unheard of in Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days) all spent on Favorites, and other Fooleries: True it is, all Kings <hi>cast-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> Money the Day of their Enthrone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but King <hi>James</hi> did it all his Life.</p>
            <p>In this place my Memory presents me with Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> after Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> famed for a grand Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the King, by perswading him, <hi>This Nation was so Rich, it could neither be Exhausted, nor Provoked;</hi> a Saying generally laid to his Charge, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted in this Practice of his; for the Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> being in the

the <hi>Church;</hi> in which the <hi>Son</hi> could not take so much Felicity, as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> did Discontent, to find all the Worth he imagined in himself wholly lost in the hopes the People had of this Young Gentleman: From whence Kings may be concluded far more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy than ordinary Men; for, tho' whil'st Children are Young, they may afford them safety, yet, when arrived at that Age, which useth to bring Comfort to other Parents, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce only Jealousies and Fears.</p>
            <p>And, if common Fame did not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip Truth, King <hi>James</hi> was by Fear led into great Extreams, (finding his Son <hi>Henry</hi> not only averse to any <hi>Popish</hi> Match, but saluted by the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> as one prefigured in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> for <hi>Rome</hi>'s Destruction) insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, as if the Prince was not kindly dealt withal at his Death; but it is so common with Report to rate the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Death of Princes, at the price of Poyson; as I should quite have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93088:16"/>
this conjecture, or left it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the decision of the great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, was it not certain, that his Father did dread him, and that the King, though he would not deny him any thing he plainly desired, yet, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather the result of Fear and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Complyance, than Love and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection, being harder drawn to confer an Honour or Pardon, in cases of Desert, upon a Retainer to the Prince, than a Stranger: From whence might be calculated a Malignity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Heart against the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his Sons Retinue. One day he was called to a remarkable Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sons Grandeur, by <hi>Archee</hi> his Jester, on the Plains about <hi>New-Market,</hi> when He and the Prince part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, few being left with the Father, and those mean Persons, which drew Tears from him.</p>
            <p>One Reason King <hi>James</hi> was so poorly followed, especially in his Journies, was his Partiality used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93088:17"/>
the <hi>Scots;</hi> which hung like Horse-leeches on him, till they could get no more, falling then off, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into their own Country, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at ease, leaving all chargable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to the <hi>English:</hi> The Harvest of the Love and Honour he reaped, being suitable to the ill Husbandry he used in the unadvised distribution of his Favours; for of a number of empty Vessels, he filled to compleat the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our Infelicity, unless such as by reason of their vast runnings out, had need daily of a new supply; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these, the Earl of <hi>Carlisle</hi> was one of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> that brought in the vanity of Anti-Suppers, not heard of in our Fore-Fathers time; and for ought I have read, or at least remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, unpractised by the luxurious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. The manner of which was, to have the Board covered at the first enterance of the Guests, with Dishes as high as a tall Man could well reach, filled with the choicest and dearest
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93088:17"/>
Viands Sea or Land could afford; and all this once seen, and having feasted the Eyes of the Invited, was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thrown away, and fresh set on to the same height; having only this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the other, that it was hot. I cannot forget one of the Attendance of the King, that at a Feast made by this Monster in Excess, eat to his single share a whole Pye, reckoned to my Lord at Ten Pounds, being composed of Ambergrease, Magesterial of Pearl, Musk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after such Suppers, huge Banquets no less profuse, a Waiter returning his Servant home with a Cloak-Bag full of dried Sweat-Meats and Confects, valued to his Lordship at more than Ten Shillings the Pound. This Lord lay always under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Aspect of King <hi>James</hi>'s favour, though he was never found in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, a place reserved for younger Men, and of more endearing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, and these went under the appellation of his Favourites or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93088:18"/>
who, like Burning-Glasses, were daily interposed between Him and the Subject, multiplying the heat of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in the general opinion, tho, in his own, he thought they screened them from reflecting on the Crown. Now, as no other reason appeared in his choice but handsomness; so the love the King shewed, was as amorously conveyed, as if he had mistaken their Sex, and thought them Ladies; which <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> did labour to resemble in the Effeminateness of their Dressings; though in W—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looks, and wanton gestures, they exceeded any part of Woman-kind. Nor was his Love, or what else the World will please to call it, carried on with a discretion sufficient to cover a less scandalous Behaviour; for the King kissing them after so lascivious a Mode in Publick, and upon the Theatre (as it were) of the World, prompted many to imagine things done in the Tiring-House, that exceed my Expressions, no

But, to leave this to the Faith of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, the Actions of Kings being written in such dark Characters, and relating to so many several ends, as they are not easily deciphered, I shall return to the <hi>German</hi> Affairs; towards which, had <hi>England</hi> contributed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the <hi>Head of a Union,</hi> it may be presumed (from the King of <hi>Sweeden's</hi> Success, who had at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining no such advantages to rely on) that the Eclipsing, if not the Ruine of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> had not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to so long a day. And he that shall turn over the Adviso's of those Times, may (without danger, or much trouble) find what Opinion the <hi>Germans</hi> had of Us, and in how great a dismay it cast their Proceedings, when the smallness of the Lord <hi>Vere's</hi> Forces were known; but when they read a Commission (only enabling him to do nothing,) they apprehended themselves, some out of Malice Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed; others, that knew the temper

of King <hi>James</hi> better, were so Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as to impute it to the true Cause, which was his <hi>Fear;</hi> upon whose Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar he was not only ready to Sacrifice his present Honour and future Safety, but the Blood of those he stiles, in all his <hi>Manifesto's, His dearest Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For after his Daughter, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, were Crowned King and Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they lost, together with this Shadow, all her Substance, and what he was, for so many Descents, Born to; the Palatinate at the Battle of <hi>Prague,</hi> (where few blows were dealt on the Electors side) reported to be so Mad, as to think the Souldier would venture his Life in a Cause, where he to whom it most concerned was afraid to venture his Money. It being then too late to spare, when Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Fortune lay at the Stake: By which this miserable Prince did not only lose what he might possibly have gained, but most of the Wealth he desired to save.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93088:23"/>The Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, was sent by King <hi>James</hi> (when they looked for an Army) to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Peace: By whose help (though a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>) the Elector and his Lady found means, though with much difficulty, to Escape to the <hi>Hague</hi> with their new assumed empty Titles, having nothing else to support them but Patience and Hope, the only and ordinary Comfort of those depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all help besides: yet it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reported by the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> That <hi>Portland</hi> was too far engaged to their Party, to be the Author of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful a Service: But this being his first Employment, no less than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in the Pope to see the Power of the Emperour moderated, (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Incroach upon the pretended Immunities of the Church) he might probably take this advantage, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Embassy the more acceptable, upon his return, to the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if not to the King: Persons of

their Quality falling seldom by the Sword; and therefore thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps better Thrift, to maintain them at Liberty, than in Restraint, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them at such a Ransom as a Victorious Prince might Impose; to the Payment of which, his Majesty was engaged in Honour and Nature.</p>
            <p>However, I am more charitable than to conclude all <hi>Papists</hi> imployed by this King, so dishonest as to falsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It being the intent of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to use his help, it may be, as he did of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Daughter, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this Vertuous Lady out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whose Misfortunes kindled such a Fire in <hi>Germany,</hi> as (before it was extinguished) lick'd up the choicest Blood in the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family; some

one or other prosecuting the like At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, amongst whom was Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> that had little else than his own Fortune and Valour to carry him so far as he went; but what he pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually did, or promised to do, was at too great a distance to be certainly known, more than could be Learned from the Eccho it made at Court, which sounded diversly, according to the Inclinations and hollowness of their Hearts that made the Reverberation. This is certain, That <hi>Mansfield</hi> was in appearance well received at Court; but how King <hi>James</hi> could like a Man that laboured to bring in so Anti-Monarchial a Precedent, as to struggle for Liberty with his Native Prince, I cannot but question, who himself daily inculcate into the People, through the Mediation of his Divines, and by the Terror of his Laws, <hi>That no other Refuge was left in any saving Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the unjustest and most cruel Tyranny, but Prayers and Tears;</hi> a

Tenet, if he had believed himself, or thought such as owned either Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Power did, he would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less have Governed much better, or (if possible) abused the Nation, and debauched his Succession much worse. Yet to give a countenance to a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness he had so shamefully dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before, he sent for the Count over in one of his Royal Ships, which was cast away upon the <hi>English</hi> Coast; an Example, almost as remote from a Precedent, as for a Mighty Prince to be a quiet Spectator of the Ruine of his Family.</p>
            <p>Such as were of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Faction spoke most disgracefully of Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> for getting the lower foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they assigned for his Rise, they admirably Proclaimed his dexterity in Mounting himself so High; who, at his going from hence, was furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with Men and Money, the most of them lost before their Landing: Such Proceedings being much in use
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93088:25"/>
with King <hi>James;</hi> who, like a ready Horse, did often seem to the World, as if he meant to run, yet did little more in effect than stand still.</p>
            <p>And here we shall give a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Poysoning business of Sir <hi>T. Overbury;</hi> on which account King <hi>James</hi> made so many dreadful Imprecations against himself and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, on his Knees, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Judges, If he should spare any that were found Guilty in that affair; but how he failed, the ensuing Relation will inform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montgomery</hi> being in the Wain of his Favour, as given more to his own Pleasures, than to observe the King: Then was a young Gentleman Mr. <hi>R. Carr,</hi> one that was very handsome and well bred, who, by the Interest of the <hi>Scots,</hi> had a Grooms place of the Bed-Chamber; he did more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, associate himself with Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> a Man of excellent parts, but those made him Proud and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93088:25"/>Now was <hi>Carr</hi> Knighted, and made Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and <hi>Overburies</hi> Pride rose with the others Honours; then was the strife between <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross this great Favourite <hi>Pythias Overbury,</hi> and make him their Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly; each presenting, proffering, and accumulating favours on <hi>Overbury's</hi> Kindred; the Father made a Judge in <hi>Wales,</hi> and himself offered an Office; but being naturally of an insolent Temper, which was elevated by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so intimate with a Favourite, and wholly having ingrossed that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, which could not be retailed but by him and his Creatures, with a kind of Scorn, neglected their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, yet made use of both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Northampton</hi> finding himself neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by so mean a fellow, (as he thought) cast about another way, and followed <hi>Balaam's</hi> Counsel, by sending a <hi>Moabitish</hi> Woman unto him, in which he made use of one <hi>Coppinger,</hi> a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93088:26"/>
Gentleman, who had spent a fair For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune left him by his Ancestors; and now, for Maintenance, was forced to lead the life of a Serving-man, (that formerly kept many to serve him,) and as an addition, the worst of that kind, a slat Bawd.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman had lived a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Life, by keeping a Whore of his own, therefore was fittest to trade in that commodity for another; and in truth, was fit to take any Impression, Baseness could stamp on him, as the sequel of this Story will manifest: This <hi>Moabitish</hi> Woman was a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earl of <hi>Suffolks,</hi> Married to a young Noble Gentleman, the Earl of <hi>Essex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Train took, and the first pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meeting was at <hi>Coppingers</hi> House, and himself Bawd to their Lust, which put him into a far greater Bravery for a time, than when he was Master of his own; but it had bitterness on all hands in the end: This Privacy in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93088:26"/>
their stollen Pleasures, made <hi>Coppinger</hi> a Friend to <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> though but a Servant to Viscount <hi>Rochester,</hi> (for so was our new Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Carr</hi> made;) and now had they linked him so close, as no breaking from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Overbury</hi> was that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> that reproved the Lord, for the Sin of using the Lady, and abusing the young Earl of <hi>Essex;</hi> he would call her Strumpet, her Mother and Brother Bawds; and used them with so much Scorn, as in truth was not to be endured by one of his Rank, to persons of that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, how faulty soever otherwise they were.</p>
            <p>Then to satisfie <hi>Overbury,</hi> and blot out the name of Sin, his Love led him into a more desperate way, by a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to Marry another Mans Wife; against this then did <hi>Overbury</hi> Bellow louder, and in it shewed himself more like an affectionate, than a discreet and moderate Friend; had he compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93088:27"/>
one dram of Discretion, with an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ounce of Affection, he might with such a Receipt have preserved his own Life, and their Fortunes and Honors.</p>
            <p>For those that infinitely hated that Family, did as infinitely condemn his Insolent carriage and behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; so that had any of those Brothers or Name killed <hi>Overbury,</hi> either by picking a Quarrel with him, or Pistolling him, or any other despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate way, or bravely in a Duel, upon some other ground of a Quarrel, than blemishing their Sister, the World would have justified the Action, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had stood with God; but <hi>Buchanan's</hi> Character of that Family, barrs all expectation of so much bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Spirit; but a Council must be held to put him to Death by some Baser means.</p>
            <p>The Plot then must be, he must be sent a Leidger Ambassador into <hi>France;</hi> which, by Obeying, they should be rid of so great an Eye-sore;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93088:27"/>
by Disobeying, he incurred the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of his Prince, a Contempt that he could not expect less than Imprisonment for, and by that Means be Sequestred from his Friends.</p>
            <p>And thus far I do believe the Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> (for so was he now made) was consenting; this Stratagem took, and <hi>Overbury</hi> might truly say, (<hi>Video meliora, deteriora sequar,</hi>) for he indeed made the worst choice; it could not be thought, but such an Imployment was far above his Desert, and much better for him to have accepted, than to be confined to a loathsome Prison; and for want of Judgment, had his Sufferings been less than loss of Life, he had not been worthy of Pity; but, <hi>Jupiter quos vult perdere hos dementat;</hi> he would go to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from whence he never returned, rather than accept of an honourable Imployment; from whence he might not only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but done his Friends accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Service, either in Private, or in Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:93088:28"/>In his mannaging of this Business, (that Wisdom which formerly he had been esteemed for) suffered under the censure of Wise Men, as well as Fools. Having him now fast in Prison, <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> by pleasing her <hi>Herod,</hi> must also ask, and have his Life; for, <hi>Per scelus ad scelera, tutior est via;</hi> to that end, they prefered <hi>Emposides,</hi> to be Servant to Sir <hi>Gervas Elwayes</hi> then Lieutenant of the Tower: This Gentleman was ever held Wise and Honest, but Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, in having that place thrust upon him without his thought; he was also so Religious, that few in the Court did equal him; so Wise, as he obtained the Character of Wise Sir <hi>Gervas Elwayes;</hi> yet, neither could his Wisdom, nor the opinion of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Honesty, prevent that Fate; he was so ignorant of the Plot, as he never Dreamt of any such matter, until one day (as it should seem) <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> being told, <hi>Elwayes</hi> did know wherefore he was preferred unto him
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93088:28"/>
to wait on <hi>Overbury;</hi> he asked the Lieutenant, whether he should now do it, <hi>Elwayes</hi> asked him what? <hi>Weston</hi> at that being somewhat abashed, which <hi>Elwayes</hi> quickly apprehended, replied, <hi>No, not yet;</hi> for he did believe there was something known to <hi>Weston;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly he hasted away, (being a little before Dinner) and went into his Study, and sent for <hi>Weston</hi> to come unto him, examining him the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that question; at last, between sair means and threatning, perswaded him to confess the Truth; then <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi> as he well could, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aid before <hi>Weston</hi> the horridness of the Fact, the torments of Hell, and the uncertainty of his momentary enjoying of either Reward or Favour, after the Fact done, but that it must necessarily follow, so many Personages of Honour, would never Cabinet such a Secret in their Breast, that might ruin them; at last, made him so sensible of his Danger in this life, and more sensible of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93088:29"/>
in the other, that <hi>Weston</hi> falling on his knees, said, <hi>O Lord! how good and gracious art Thou, and thy Mercy is above all thy Works; for this day is Salvation come to my Soul, and I would not for all the World have had such a Sin upon me.</hi> He gave the Lieutenant humble thanks, for that he had been Instrumental in saving his Soul, by putting him off from so foul Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The Lieutenant having thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Grace in him, by making him (as he thought) a new Man; said thus to him, <hi>You and I have a dangerous part to Act; but if you will be true and honest to me, I doubt not (with Gods help) but we shall perform it well, both before God and the World: Weston</hi> faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him, and for a long, time as faithfully performed with him. The Lieutenant willed him, to bring all such things as was sent to give <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> unto him, which he accordingly did; the Lieutenant ever gave them to Dogs and Cats, which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

ready in his Study for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; some died presently, others lay lingering a longer time; all which, with the Jellies and Tarts sent to <hi>Overbury,</hi> he cast into his Privy, they staining the very Dishes.</p>
            <p>This continued long, the Earl ever sending to visit <hi>Overbury,</hi> assuring him he did not forget his Release, which would not be long deferred; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in most Men did verily believe, he did mean both Nobly and Truly, though others conjectured his meaning was a Dissolution: At last, the Countess sent for <hi>Weston,</hi> Reviling him, and calling him Treacherous Villain; for had he given those things sent, <hi>Overbury</hi> had not been now alive, vowing she would be revenged on him; upon the very fear whereof, he after gave those Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons sent him, without acquainting the Lieutenant; yet, for all this school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Weston,</hi> and his assurance given of his future Fidelity to the Countess, she would not trust him any more,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93088:30"/>
but put another Co-adjutor to him, one <hi>Franklin,</hi> a greater Villain than <hi>Weston;</hi> and truly they may be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ill, that could seek out such Instruments.</p>
            <p>These two Villains came into <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's</hi> Chamber, and found him in infinite Torment, with contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Strength of Nature, and the working of the Poyson; and it being very like, Nature had got the better of it in that contention, by the thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Boyls, Botches, and Blains, they fearing it might come to light, upon the judgment of Physicians, that foul Play had been offered him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to stifle him with the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths, which accordingly was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and so ended his miserable Life with the assurance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators, that he Died by Poyson; none thinking otherwise but these two Murtherers.</p>

               </gap> those met in this Lord and Lady.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93088:31"/>The Arch - Bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Abbot,</hi> to his everlasting Fame, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed all the Proceedings, and protested against them; for which he ever after lived in Disgrace, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Council-Table, and Died in disrespect of the King on Earth, tho' in favour of the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>Yet, forsooth, to make up the full measure of Bawdery, and to justifie <hi>Neal</hi>'s Discourse, That all things in the former Marriage conduced to be a Nullity; a search must be made, to find whether there had been a Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and a Jury of Grave Matrons were found fit for that purpose; who, with their Spectacles ground to lessen, not to make the Letter larger, after their Inspection, gave Verdict, She was, <hi>intacta Virgo,</hi> which was thought very strange; for the World took notice that her way was very near beaten so plain, as if <hi>Regia Via;</hi> and, in truth, was a common way, before <hi>Somerset</hi> did ever Travel that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93088:32"/>
way; besides, the World took notice, they Two had long lived together in Adultery; yet had Old <hi>Kettle</hi> a trick for that also. The Lady of <hi>Essex,</hi> for Modesty sake, makes humble Suit to the Bawdy Bishops, (who were also Plotters in this Stratagem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that she might not appear Bare-fac'd, for Blushing; but desired to come Vailed, with a Taffety over her Face; this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by all means, was thought so reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a pretty Modest Lady, that the Bawdy Bishops and Pur-blind La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which had forgotten Modesty themselves, could not think it worthy the denial: One Mrs. <hi>Fines,</hi> near Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman to Old <hi>Kettle,</hi> was dressed up in the Countesses Cloaths, and that time too Young to be other than <hi>Virgo intacta;</hi> though, in Two Years after, had the Old Ladies made their Inspection, the Orifice would not have appeared so small, to have delivered such a Verdict as they did and a just one upon their Views; tho
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93088:32"/>
upon some of their Knowledges, it was not that Lady they were to give Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict upon.</p>
            <p>Now is the Nullity pronounced, and the Marriage with <hi>Somerset</hi> spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Solemnized; for which they, and the whole Family of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> paid dear in after time, and had sowre Sauce to that sweet Meat, of their great Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law.</p>
            <p>And surely, he was the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in that Marriage; being as generally Beloved, as for himself and Disposition, as Hated afterwards for his linking himself in that Family: For in all the time of this Man's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, before this Marriage, he did nothing obnoxious to the State, or any base thing for his private gain; but whether this was his own Nature that curbed him, or that there was then a Brave Prince living, and a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queen that did awe him, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so easily judge; because, after this Marriage, and their Death, he did many ill things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93088:33"/>Now began to appear a glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a new Favorite, one Mr. <hi>George Villers,</hi> a younger Son, by a second Venter, of an Ancient Knight in <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>-shire; his Father of an Ancient Family; his Mother of a Mean, and a Waiting-Gentlewoman; whom the Old-Man fell in Love with, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; by whom he had Three Sons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all raised to the Nobility, by mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of their Brother Favorite. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was come but newly from Travel, and did believe it a great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to Marry a Daughter of Sir <hi>Roger Aston</hi>'s; and, in truth, 'twas the height of his Ambition; and for that only end was a hanger upon the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Gentlewoman loved him so well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as could all his Friends have made her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But before the closing up of this Match, the King cast a glancing Ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:93088:33"/>
towards him; which was easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, by such as minded their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Humor, and then the Match was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid aside; some assuring him a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Fortune was coming unto him: Then one gave him his place of Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earer, that he might be in the King's Eye; another sent to his Mercer and Taylor, to put good Cloaths on him; a third to his Sempster, for curious Linnen; and all as In-comes, to obtain Offices on his future rise: Then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers took upon them to be his <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo</hi>'s, to undertake his Quarrels, upon Affronts put upon him by <hi>Somerset</hi>'s Faction; so all hands helped to the piecing up this new Favorite.</p>
            <p>Then began the King to Eat abroad, who formerly used to Eat in his Bed-Chamber; or, if by chance, Supped in his Bed - Chamber, would come forth to see Pastimes and Fooleries; in which Sir <hi>Edward Souch,</hi> Sir <hi>George Goring,</hi> and Sir <hi>J. Finet,</hi> were the chief, and Master Fools: and surely,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93088:34"/>
this Fooling got them more than any others Wisdom, far above them in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert: <hi>Souch</hi>'s part was to Sing Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Songs, and to tell Bawdy Tales: <hi>Finet</hi> to compose these Songs: The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were a Sett of Fidlers, brought up on purpose for this Fooling: And <hi>Goring</hi> was Master of the Game for Fooleries; sometimes presenting <hi>David Droman;</hi> and <hi>Archee Armstrong</hi> the King's Fool, on the back of the other Fools, to Tilt at one another, till they fell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ears; sometimes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Dances; but Sir <hi>John Millisent,</hi> who was never known before, was commended for a notable Fool; With this Jollity was this new Favorite ushered in. This made the House of <hi>Suffolk</hi> fret; and <hi>Somerset</hi> carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more proudly; and his <hi>Bravado</hi>'s ever quarrelling with the others; which, by his Office of <hi>Lord-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,</hi> for a while carried it; but <hi>Somerset</hi> using of Sir <hi>Ralph Wynwoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of State) in so scornful a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (he having only the Title, the Earl himself keeping the Seals, and doing the Business) made <hi>Wynwood</hi> endeavor to ruine him; who soon got an opportunity, by frequenting the Countess of <hi>Shrewsburies,</hi> then Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in the <hi>Tower;</hi> who told <hi>Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> on a time, That <hi>Overbury</hi> was Poysoned, which she understood from Sir <hi>Gervase Elwayes;</hi> who did labour, by her means, to deal with her Two Sons-in-Law, <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Pembroke, (Winwood</hi> being also great with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>action) that when it came into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, he might save his own Stake; who, truly, was no otherwise Guilty, but that he did not discover it at <hi>Weston</hi>'s first disclosing it (he being Keeper of the Prison) so by In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erence, his not disclosing it, was <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Death; and had he revealed it then, he certainly had been brought into the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for it, and undone (for it was not the Time fit for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93088:35"/>
               <hi>Winwood,</hi> it was thought, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the King with it, knowing how willingly he would have been rid of <hi>Somerset;</hi> yet the King durst not bring it in question; nor any Doubt ever would have been, had not <hi>Somerset</hi> sought to cross him in his Passion of Love, to his new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite; in which the King was more impatient, than any Woman to enjoy her Love.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Thrumbal,</hi> Agent at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> had (by an Apothecaries Boy, one <hi>Reeve,</hi> after an Apothecary him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in <hi>London,</hi> who lived sometime after) gotten hold of this Poysoning business; for <hi>Reeve</hi> having, under his Master, made some of these desperate Medicines, either run away, or else his Master sent him out of the way, and fell in Company with <hi>Thrumbal's</hi> Servants at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it; and they to their Master, who Examining the Boy, discover'd the Truth: <hi>Thrumbal</hi> presently wrote
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93088:35"/>
to Secretary <hi>Wynwood,</hi> he had business of consequence to discover, but would not send it; therefore desired License to come over. The King would not yield to his Return, but willed him to send an Express: That <hi>Thrumbal</hi> utterly refused, and very wisely, for letting any thing appear under his Hand, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t the Boy should Die, or run away, and then himself made the Author of that, which the Courtesie of another must have justified.</p>
            <p>The King being of a longing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, rather than he would not know, admitted <hi>Thrumbal's</hi> Return; and now had they good Testimony, by the Apothecary, who revealed <hi>Weston,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> and <hi>Franklin,</hi> to be the principal Agents; yet this (being now the time of Progress) was not stired till about <hi>Michaelmas:</hi> But still <hi>Wynwood</hi> now carry himself in a kind of braving way of Conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station against <hi>Somerset,</hi> struck in with the Faction of <hi>Villers's:</hi> And now
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93088:36"/>
on Progress, the King went <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> where, at the several places as he came, he was highly Treated.</p>
            <p>After all his Feastings, homewards came the King, who desired, by all means, to reconcile this Clashing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his declining and rising Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite; to which end, at <hi>Lulworth,</hi> the King imployed Sir <hi>Humphry May,</hi> a great Servant to <hi>Somerset,</hi> and a wise Servant to <hi>Villers;</hi> but with such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, as if it came from himself; and <hi>Villers</hi> had order, presently after Sir <hi>Humphry May's</hi> return, to present himself and Service to <hi>Somerset.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>Sir</hi> George Villers <hi>will come to you, to offer his Service, and desire to be your Creature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuse him not, Embrace him, and your Lordship shall still stand a great Man; tho' not the sole Favorite.</hi> My Lord seemed averse: Sir <hi>Humphry</hi> then told him, in plain terms, <hi>That he was sent by the King to advise it; and that</hi> Villers <hi>would come to him, to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93088:36"/>
cast himself into his Protection; to take his Rise, under the shaddow of his Wings.</hi> Sir <hi>Humphry May</hi> was not parted from my Lord half an hour, but in comes Sir <hi>George Villers,</hi> and used these very words: <hi>My Lord, I desire to be your Servant, and your Creature; and shall desire to take my Court-Preferment under your Favour; and your Lordship shall find me as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Servant unto you, as ever did Serve you.</hi> My Lord returned this quick and short Answer; <hi>I will none of your Service, nor you shall none of my Favour; I will, if I can, break your Neck, and of that be confident.</hi> This was but a harsh Complement, and favoured more of Spirit, than Wisdom; and since that time, breaking each others Necks was their aims: And it is verily believed, had <hi>Somerset</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with <hi>Villers, Overbury's</hi> Death had still lain reaked up in his own Ashes; but <hi>God,</hi> who will never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Murther to go unpunished, will

have what He will, maugre all the Wisdom of the World.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Windsor</hi> doth the King return, to end his Progress; from thence to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> then to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and shortly after to <hi>Royston,</hi> to begin his Winter-Journey. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the Game to be plaid, in which <hi>Somerset</hi> must be the Loser, the Cards being shuffled, cut and dealt, between the King and Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> Chief Justice, (whose Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Purbeck Villers</hi> had Married, and therefore a fit Instrument to ruine <hi>Somerset</hi>) and Secretary <hi>Wynwood:</hi> These all play'd the Stake, <hi>Somerset</hi>'s Life and his Ladie's, their Fortunes, and the Family of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> some of them played Booty; and in truth, the Game was not played above-board. The Day the King went from <hi>White-Hall</hi> to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> and so to <hi>Royston,</hi> He sent for all the Judges, (his Lords and Servants encircling him;) where kneeling down in the midst,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93088:37"/>
he used these Words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords, the Judges, It is lately come to my hearing, that you have now in examination a business of Poysoning; Lord! in what a most miserable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall this Kingdom be, (the only famous Nation for Hospitality in the World,) if our Tables should become such a Snare, as none could eat without danger of Life, and the</hi> Italian <hi>Custom should be introduced among us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Lords, I charge you, as you will answer it at the great and dreadful Day of Judgment, that you examine it strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without Favour, Affection, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; and if you shall spare any guilty of this Crime, God's Curse light on you and your Posterity: And if I spare any that are found guilty, God's Curse light on Me, and my Posterity for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how this dreadful Thunder-Curse or Imprecation was performed, shall be shewed hereafter.</p>
            <p>The King with this took his Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel for a time of <hi>London,</hi> and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

with <hi>Somerset</hi> to <hi>Royston,</hi> (where no sooner he brought him) but instantly took leave, little imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what Viper lay amongst the Herbs: Nor must I forget to let you know, how perfect the King was in the Art of Dissimulation, or to give it his own Phrase, King-Craft.

Earl was scarcely in his Coach, when the King used these very words (in the hearing of four Servants, of whom one was <hi>Somerset</hi>'s great Creature, and of the Bed-Chamber, who reported it afterwards to many about the Court,) <hi>I shall never see his Face more.</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Reader, whether this <hi>Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> of <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare,</hi> was not as well performed in this Passage, as his <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> in the whole course of his Life; and his Love to the latter, made him be beaten with his own Weapon in the other, by all Princes and States that had to do with him. But before <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset's</hi> Approach to <hi>London,</hi> his Countess was apprehended; at his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, himself: And the King being that Night at Supper, said to Sir <hi>Thomas Morson,</hi> My Lord Chief Justice hath sent for you: He asked the King, when he should wait on him again; who replyed, You may come when you can. And (as in the Story<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93088:39"/>
               <hi>Byron,</hi> and many others,) there have been many foolish Observations, as presage, so was there in this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was the King's Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faulconer; and in truth, for his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Dexterity and Skill, no Prince in <hi>Christendom</hi> ever had the like.</p>
            <p>So, that you see, the Plot was so well laid, as they could be all within the Toil at one instant, not knowing of each other.</p>
            <p>Now are in Hold the Earl, his Countess, Sir <hi>Thomas Monson,</hi> Mistress <hi>Turner,</hi> (a very lewd and infamous Woman of life) <hi>Weston</hi> and <hi>Franklin,</hi> with some others of less Note; of which one <hi>Simon</hi> a Servant of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Monson</hi>'s, who was employed in carrying Jelly and Tart to the <hi>Tower;</hi> who upon his Examination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for his pleasant Answer, was instantly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed. My Lord told him, <hi>Simon,</hi> you have had a hand in this Poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Business: No, my good Lord, I had but one Finger in it, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93088:39"/>
cost me my Life; and, at the best, cost me all my Hair and Nails; for the truth was, <hi>Simon</hi> was somewhat liquorish, and finding the Syrrup swim from the top of a Tart as he carried it, he did with his Finger skim it off; and it was to be believed, had he known what it had been, he would not have been his Taster at so dear a Rate. And now poor Mrs. <hi>Turner, Weston</hi> and <hi>Franklin,</hi> began the Tragedy; Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Day of Mourning being better than the Day of her Birth; for she died very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, and shewed much modesty in her last Act, which is to be hoped, was accepted of with God; after that died <hi>Weston,</hi> then was <hi>Franklin</hi> Arraigned, who confessed that <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was smoothered to Death, not poysoned to Death, though he had Poyson given him.</p>
            <p>In the next place came the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess to her Tryal, at whose Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as also at Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi>'s before,

            <p>The next that came on the Stage was Sir <hi>Thomas Monson;</hi> but the Night before he was to come to his Tryal, the King being at the Game of Maw, said, <hi>To Morrow comes</hi> Tom Monson <hi>to his Tryal:</hi> Yea, said the King's Card-holder, where, if he do not play his Masters Prize, your Majesty shall never trust me: This so run in the King's Mind, as the next Game, he said, He was sleepy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would play out that Set the next Night; the Gentlemen depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Lodging, but was no sooner gone, but the King sent for him; what Communication they had was not known; but is most certain, next under God, that Gentleman sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Life; for the King sent a Post presently to <hi>London,</hi> to let the

Lord Chief-Justice know, he would see <hi>Monson</hi>'s Examination and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to see if it were worthy to touch his Life, for so small a matter: <hi>Monson</hi> was too wise to set any thing but fair in his Confession; what he would have stabbed with, should have been (<hi>viva voce</hi>) at his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment. The King sent word, He saw nothing worthy of Death, or of Bonds, in his Accusation or Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And now for the last Act, enters <hi>Somerset</hi> himself on the Stage, who (being told, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Moor</hi> quiver and shake; and however, he was accounted a Wise Man, yet he was near at his Wits-end.</p>
            <p>Yet away goes <hi>Moor</hi> to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> as late as it was, (being Twelve at Night) bounceth at the Back-stairs, as if Mad; to whom came <hi>J.

The King falls into a Passion of Tears; <hi>On my Soul,</hi> Moor, <hi>I wot not what to do; thou art a Wise-Man, help me in this great streight, and thou

shalt find, thou dost it for a thankful Master,</hi> with other sad Expressions: <hi>Moor</hi> leaves the King in that Passion; but assures him, he will try the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his Wit to serve his Majesty; and was really rewarded with 1500 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Moor</hi> returns to <hi>Somerset,</hi> about Three the next Morning, of that day he was to come to his Tryal, enters <hi>Somerset</hi>'s Chamber, tells him, <hi>He had been with the King, found him a most affectionate Master unto him, and full of Grace in his intentions towards him; but</hi> (said he) <hi>to satisfie Justice, you must Appear, although return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly again, without any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; only you shall know your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and their Malice; though they shall have no Power over you.</hi> With this trick of Wit, he allayed his Fury, and got him quietly, about Eight in the Morning, to the Hall; yet feared his former bold Lauguage might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert again; and being brought by this Trick into the Toyl, might have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93088:42"/>
more enraged him to fly out into some strange Discovery; he had Two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants placed on each side of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Cloak on their Arms, giving them a peremptory Order, if that <hi>Somerset</hi> did any way fly out on the King, they should instantly Hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink him with that Cloak, and take him violently from the Bar, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him away; for which he would secure them from any danger; and they should not want also a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reward: But the Earl finding himself over-reached, recollected a better Temper, and went on calmly in his Tryal; where he held the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany until Seven at Night: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had seen the King's restless mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all that Day, sending to every Boat he see Landing at the Bridge, Cursing all that came without Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, would have easily judged all was not right, and there had been some grounds for his Fears of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>'s Boldness: But, at last, one brings
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93088:42"/>
him word, he was Condemned, and the Passages all was quiet. This is the very Relation, from <hi>Moor</hi>'s own Mouth, told to several of undoubted Credit.</p>
            <p>And there were other strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to believe <hi>Somerset</hi> knew, that (by him) he desired none other should be partaker of; and that all was not Peace with him in the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker himself; for he ever Courted <hi>Somerset</hi> to his Dying-day; and gave him <hi>4000l. per annum,</hi> for Fee Farm-Rents, after he was Condemned; which he took in his Servants Names, not his own (as then being Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not capable of) and he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved never to have Pardon. It is credibly reported, he was told by a <hi>Wizzard,</hi> That could he but come to see the King's Face again, he should be re-invested in his former dearness: This had been no hard Experiment; but, belike, he had too much Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to trust to <hi>Wizzards;</hi> or else some

            <p>And now begins the new Favorite to Reign, without any controulment; now he rises in Honour, as well as swells with Pride, being broken out of the modest bounds (formerly had impailed him) to the High-way of Pride and Scorn; turning-out, and putting-in all he pleased: <hi>First,</hi> He gets the Lord-Admiral turned out, and himself made Lord High-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Next, He procured the Seal to be taken from <hi>Egerton,</hi> Lord-Keeper, and procures the Place for <hi>Bacon, gratis;</hi> for he neither paid any thing, neither was he able: For now was there a new Trick to put in Dishonest and Necessitous Men, to serve such Turns, as Men of plentiful Fortunes,

            <p>And now <hi>Buckingham</hi> having the Chancellor, Treasurer, and all great Officers, his very Slaves, swells in the height of Pride, summons up all his Country Kindred; the Old Countess providing a place for them, to learn to carry themselves in a Court-like Garb.</p>
            <p>Then must these Women-Kindred be Married to Earls, Earls Eldest Sons, Barons, or chief Gentlemen of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Estates; insomuch that the very Female Kindred were so numerous, as sufficient to have Peopled any Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Nay, very Kitchin-Wenches were Married to Knights Eldest Sons.</p>
            <p>Then was there a Parliament Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned; in which, <hi>Bacon,</hi> for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, was thrust out; being closely Prosecuted by one <hi>Morby,</hi> a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, and one <hi>Wreham;</hi> and was, by the said Parliament, justly put out of his Place.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now being come to the height of his Preserment, he did estrange himself from the Company of the old Countess, having much younger Ware, who had Keys to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to come to him; yet was there a Necessity of keeping him in this Place for a time, the <hi>Spanish Match</hi> being yet in Chase; and, if it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93088:45"/>
this Man was to clap the Great Seal, (through his Ignorance in the Laws) to such Things, that none that understood the Danger by knowing the Laws, would venture upon; and for this Design he was at first brought in; (no Prince li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowing how to make use of Men better than King <hi>James.</hi>)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish Match</hi> having been long in Treaty, and it being suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did juggle with the State in this, as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did in a Match with that brave Prince <hi>Henry;</hi> and in truth, in all other Things, wherein any Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been, only feeding the King with fair Hopes, and fair Words, yet foul Deeds. Whether the King sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any such Matters, or any Whimsie came in the Brain of the great Favourite and Prince, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the old Stories of the Knights-Errand; but agreed it was, (it should seem) between the Favourite
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93088:46"/>
and the Prince only, (no one other so much as dreaming of any such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture) except <hi>Cottington,</hi> which also accompanied them, that the Prince must go himself into <hi>Spain.</hi> Away they went under the borrowed Names of <hi>Jack</hi> and <hi>Tom Smith,</hi> to the amazement of all wise Men, only accompanied with Three more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, taking their way by <hi>France;</hi> had the Ports laid so, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none should follow them, or give any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the <hi>French-Court,</hi> till they might get the start, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet their Wisdoms made them adventure to stay in the <hi>French-Court,</hi> and look on that Lady whom he after Married: And there did this <hi>Mars</hi> imitate one of Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Knights, in seeking Adventures in foreign Princes Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. First beheld this <hi>French Beauty, Mars visemque cupit, patiturque cupita;</hi> as in our Discourse will afterward appear: From thence away to <hi>Spain;</hi> but as the Journey was only plotted
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93088:46"/>
by young Heads; it was so childishly carried, that they escaped the <hi>French-King's Curriers</hi> very narrowly; but escape they did, and arrived safely in <hi>Spain,</hi> their wished Port, before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther welcome or expected by our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, or that State.</p>
            <p>Yet now must the best Face be put on, at all hands; that put their Grandees to new Shifts, and our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> to try his Wit: For at that time Sir <hi>W. Aston</hi> was also Ambassador at <hi>Spain,</hi> in all Occurrences. <hi>Aston</hi> complyed with the Prince and Duke; <hi>Bristol</hi> ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; and the Duke and <hi>Bristol</hi> hated each other mortally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bristol</hi> had the advantage of them there, as having the much better Head-piece, and being more conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and dear to that State, wholly complying with them; and surely had done them very acceptable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, (and in this very Treaty, was of the Pack;) <hi>Buckingham</hi> had the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93088:47"/>
advantage of him in <hi>England,</hi> (for, although the King did not hate <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> yet was so awed, that he durst not discover it.) Then <hi>Buckingham</hi> had all Interest in his Successor by this Journey, so that he layd a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and future Foundation for his succeeding Greatness.</p>
            <p>For all his Power and Greatness, <hi>Bristol</hi> did not forbear to put all Scorns, Affronts, and Tricks on him; and <hi>Buckingham</hi> lay so open, as gave the other advantage enough by his Lascivious Carriage and Miscarriage. Amongst all his Tricks, he play'd One so cunningly, that it cost him all the Hair on his Head, and put him to the Dyet; for it should seem, he made court to <hi>Conde Oliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>res</hi>'s Lady, who was very handsom: But it was so plotted betwixt the Lady, her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and <hi>Bristol,</hi> that instead of that Beauty, he had a Notorious Stew sent to him; and surely, his Carriage there was so Lascivious, that had
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93088:47"/>
ever the Match been really intended for our Prince; yet such a Companion or Guardian, was, enough to have made them believe, that he was that way inclined; and so have frustrated the Marriage, that being a grave and sober Nation: <hi>Bucking.</hi> being of a light and loose Behaviour; and had not the Prince himself been of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary staid Temper, the other had been a very ill Guardian unto him.</p>
            <p>But now many Lords flock over, and many Servants, that he might appear the Prince of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and like himself, though he came thither like a private Person: Many Treaties were; sometimes Hope, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Fear; sometimes great Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; then all dasht again; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his Entertainment was as great as possible that State could afford; yet was his Addresses to, and with the Lady such, as rendred him mean and a private Person, rather than a Prince of that State, that formerly

had made <hi>Spain</hi> feel the Weight of their Anger and Power, and was like a Servant, not a Suitor; for he never was admitted but to stand bare-head in her Presence, nor to talk with her, but in a full Audience with much Company.</p>
            <p>At last, after many Heats and Cools, many Hopes and Despairs, the Prince wrote a Letter to his Father of a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Despair, not only of not enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lady, but of never more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning; with this Passage; <hi>You must now, Sir, look upon my Sister and her Children, forgetting ever you had such a Son, and never thinking more of Me.</hi>

            <p>Now the Folly of this Voyage, plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by green Heads, began to appear, many shewing much Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, many smiling at their Follies, (and, in truth, glad in their Hearts;) and however the King was a cunning Dissembler, and shewed much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sorrow, as he did for Prince <hi>Henry's</hi> Death; yet something was

discerned, which made his Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve little Grief came near his Heart; for that Hatred he bore to <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> long, (as being Satiated with him) and his Adoring the Rising-Sun, not looking after the Sun-Setting, made the World believe, he would think it no ill Bargain, to lose his Son, so <hi>Buckingham</hi> might be lost also.</p>
            <p>The Reason the King so hated <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> was, (besides his being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Him, and his Marriage, after which the King's Edge was ever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from all Favourites; yet this had so much the over-awing Power of Him, that He durst not make Shew to affect any other:) There was one <hi>Inniossa,</hi> a <hi>Spanish Ambassador</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, being an old Souldier, and a Gallant Fellow, thought that <hi>Buckingham</hi> did not give that Respect to Him, which was due to his own Person, or to the Person of so Great a King, whose Person He represented.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Inniosa</hi> being a daring Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93088:50"/>
used some Speeches in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Prince and <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> as if they were dangerous to the old King: Nay, <hi>Inniosa</hi> sent one <hi>Padro Mecestria,</hi> (a <hi>Spanish Jesuit,</hi> and a great States-man) to King <hi>James,</hi> to let Him know, that He, under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, had found the King was by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> or by his Procurement, to be Killed; but whether by Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Pistol, Dagger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he could not tell.</p>
            <p>The King, after the Hearing of this, was extreamly Melancholly; and in that Passion was found by <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> at his return to Him: The King, as soon as ever He espyed him, said, <hi>Ah, Stenny, Stenny</hi> (for so He ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him in familiarity.) <hi>Wilt Thou kill Me?</hi> At which, <hi>Buckingham</hi> started, and said; <hi>Who,</hi> Sir, <hi>hath so abused You?</hi> At which the King sate Silent; Out went <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Fretting and Fuming; asked, <hi>Who had been with the King in his Absence?</hi> It was told
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93088:50"/>
him, <hi>Padro Mecestria:</hi> Then <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> went immediately and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Padro Mecestria;</hi> Which Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel <hi>Inni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssa</hi> undertook, and told him, <hi>He would maintain him a Traytor; and, wear his Master's Person off him, He was a Chivalier, and better Born than Himself, and would make it Good on Him with his Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buckingham</hi> being fully Satisfied on several Accounts, of the great Hatred the King now bare unto him, He turned as great an Hater of the King; and though the King had more Power to Revenge, He had less Courage; and <hi>Buckingham</hi> less Power, and more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, sharpned with Revenge: And however the World did believe the King's Inclination was out of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ground that He might not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; yet it was no other but a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Disposition, that durst not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. But although the King lost his Opportunity on <hi>Buckingham;</hi> yet the Black Plaister and Powder did
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93088:51"/>
shew, <hi>Buckingham</hi> lost not his on the King; and that it was no Fiction, but a Reality, that <hi>Padro Mecestria</hi> had formerly told the King.</p>
            <p>And now to return from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, (which is not impertinent, besides a great Secret;) The Prince returns from <hi>Spain,</hi> contrary to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, in which the Wisdom and Gravity of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> failed him; especially if they did believe <hi>Padro Mecestria,</hi> (besides, Nature could not long Support the old King;) and then the <hi>Spaniard</hi> might have made no little Advantage, by enjoying such a Pledge.</p>
            <p>Now is all the Fault (of the Match not succeeding) laid on <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s False Play, and Unfaithfulness to his Master, and Combining with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for his own Ends: And <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> the most Hated Man then living, from an Accused Man in the former <hi>Parliament,</hi> came to be the very <hi>Darling</hi> of this <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93088:51"/>In the <hi>Banquetting-Hhouse,</hi> before both <hi>Houses of Parliament,</hi> does <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> give an Account at large of his <hi>Spanish-Voyage;</hi> and to every full Point, (as a further Attestation) he saith, <hi>How say You, Sir?</hi> To which the Prince answered, <hi>I, Yea,</hi> or <hi>Yes;</hi> and thorough all his Discourse, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make <hi>Bristol</hi> as hateful to this <hi>Parliament,</hi> as Himself had been to the Former: <hi>Bristol</hi> having some Friends that sent him Advice of All into <hi>Spain,</hi> He immediately Posts for <hi>England,</hi> makes <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Accusation wholly Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and False, and becomes a great Favourite to <hi>King James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Place, I hold it not unfit to shew the <hi>Reader,</hi> how the <hi>King</hi> hath ever been Abused, and would be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by over-much Credulity in the <hi>Treaty of Spain</hi> for <hi>Marriages,</hi> as well as in all other <hi>Negotiations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You shall now perceive, how the <hi>King</hi> was Abused in this <hi>Treaty;</hi> which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93088:52"/>
was an Error inexcusable in Himself, and whole Council. The <hi>Italians</hi> having a Proverb, <hi>He that Deceives me Once, it is his Fault; but if Twice, it is my Fault:</hi> This second time could not but be the only Fault of the King and Council.</p>
            <p>In Prince <hi>Henry</hi>'s Life-time, the King had a little Man, but a very great and wise Councellor, little <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> his Secretary of State, that great Statesman, who did Inherit all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wisdom, as well as his Offices.</p>
            <p>There was a Treaty, in the like case, for Prince <hi>Henry; Salisbury</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly discovered the Jugling, before any other did think of any; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it went forward cunningly, yet did <hi>Salisbury</hi> so put the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> unto it, that either it must be, or they must confess their Jugling.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> denied, that ever there had been any Treaty, or any Intention from that State: <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> sent for the Ambassador to a full
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93088:52"/>
Council, and told him, <hi>How he had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King and State, about a Treaty for Marriage, which he had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for; that therefore he was liable to the Laws of our Kingdom: For when any Servant doth abuse a State by their Master's Commission, then that Servant was freed; but, without Commission, was culpable, and liable to be Punished, by the Laws of that State; as being disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed to be Servant to the King his Master.</hi> The Ambassador answered gravely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He did not understand the cause of his coming; therefore was then unprepared to give any Answer; but, on <hi>Monday,</hi> he would again come, and give his Answer. On <hi>Monday</hi> he comes, begins with these words; <hi>My Soul, is my God's; my Life, my Master's; my Reputation, my Own: I will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit my First and Last, to preserve the Second:</hi> Then lays down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and Letters of Instruction, under the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>'s own Hand. He acquitted himself Honestly in this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93088:53"/>
State, yet lost his own; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly sent for Home, where he lived and dyed in Disgrace; here was, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus vir bonus peregre missus sed non ad mentiendum reipublicae causa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this you see the advantage and benefit of one Wise Counsellor in a whole State; and although <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>By the multitude of Councellors, doth a Kingdom Flourish;</hi> yet, surely, he intended they should be Wise Men, that are Councellors: for we had such a multitude of Councellors, that a longer Table, and a larger Council-Chamber was provided; yet our State was so far from Flourishing, that it had been almost utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>I shall now bring my Story to an end, as I shall this King's Life; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have made some Digressions, yet all pertinent to the <hi>Secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues</hi> of this King's Reign.</p>
            <p>He now goes to his last Hunting-Journey, (I mean, the last of the Year,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93088:53"/>
as well as his Life) which He ever ended in <hi>Lent,</hi> and was seized on by an extraordinary <hi>Tertian Ague;</hi> which, at that Season, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, was Physick for a King; but King <hi>James</hi> did not find it so; and, poor King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what was but Physick to any other, was made Mortal to him: Yet 'twas not the <hi>Ague,</hi> as himself Confessed to many of his Servants; one of which crying, <hi>Courage, Sir, this is but a small Fit, the next will be none at all:</hi> At which he most earnestly looked, and said, <hi>Ah! it is not the Ague afflicteth me; but the black Plaster and Powder given me, and laid to my Stomach:</hi> and, in truth, the Plaster so troubled him, that he was glad to have it pulled off, and, with it, the Skin also: Nor was it fair Dealing, if he had sair Play, (which himself su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, often saying to <hi>Montgomery,</hi> whom he trusted, above all Men, in his Sickness, <hi>For</hi> God's <hi>sake, look I have fair Play</hi>) to bring in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perick,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93088:54"/>
to apply any Medicines, whil'st those Physicians, appointed to attend him, were at Dinner; nor could any but <hi>Buckingham</hi> Answer it, with less than his Life. <hi>Buckingham</hi> coming into the King's Chamber, even when He was at the point of Death, an honest Servant of the King's, crying, <hi>Ah! my Lord, you have Undone us, all his poor Servants; although you are so well provided, you need not care:</hi> At which <hi>Buckingham</hi> kickt at him, who caught his Foot, and made his Head first come to the Ground; where <hi>Buckingham</hi> presently rising, run to the Dying-King's Bed-side, and cryed, <hi>Justice, Sir, I am abused by your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and wrongfully Accused:</hi> At which the poor King Mournfully fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Eyes on him; as who would have said, <hi>Not wrongfully;</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Speech or Sense.</p>
            <p>It were worth the knowledge, what his Confessions was, or what other
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93088:54"/>
Expressions he made of himself, or any other; but that was only known to the dead Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and the then living Bishop <hi>Williams,</hi> and the Lord-Keeper; and, it was thought, <hi>Williams</hi> had blabbed something, which incensed the King's Anger, and <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Hatred, so much against him, that the loss of his Place could not be expiatory sufficient, but his utter ruine must be determined, and that for the great Crime of <hi>Lapsus Linguae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having brought this King (who was stiled the <hi>King of Peace</hi>) to rest in all Peace; the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> his Son, by Sound of the Trumpet, was Proclaimed King, by the Name of <hi>CHARLES the First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Father's Reign began with a great Plague, and we have shewed what his Reign was: His Son's, with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93088:55"/>
a greater Plague, (the greatest that ever had been in these parts): We come now to shew what his Reign was, in the ensuing Discourse.</p>

            <p>THE Misfortunes of this Monarch, Son to King <hi>James,</hi> with the uncouth, dismal, and unexpressible Calamities that happened thereupon, appear yet so great a Sacrifice in the Opinions of all, Interested by the Loss, or Suborned by that natural Propensity, inherent in the most, to expunge or palliate the Lapses of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Princes (whose Indulgence is not seldom so defensive, as to expiate for the Faults of those standing in a far remoter Relation, than that of a Father) that they have hitherto stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Pen, from making any farther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93088:56"/>
Progress that way; till, led on by a Zeal to Truth, and illuminated from the brighter Judgments of others, I found not only the Imprudent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, but voluntary Omissions of King <hi>James,</hi> so much instrumental in the promotion of our late <hi>Unnatural Wars:</hi> As it may justly be said, He, like <hi>Adam,</hi> by bringing the Crown into so great a Necessity, through profuse Prodigality, became the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of his Son's Fall: who was, in a manner, compelled to stretch out his Hands towards such Gatherings and Taxes, as were contrary to Law; by which He fell from the Paradice of a Prince, to wit, The Hearts of his People; though the best Polititians extant, might miscarry in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of a Civil-War, immediately to follow, upon the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in Vindication of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Titles and Opinions, then cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: Yet the Beggarly Rabble attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>James,</hi> not only at his first
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93088:56"/>
coming out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but through his whole Reign, (like a fluent Spring) found still crossing the River <hi>Tweed,</hi> did so far justifie the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, as it was only thought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, in relation to Time.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> departing this Life, at <hi>Theobald</hi>'s, the <hi>27th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> 1625. in the Fifty Ninth Year of his Age, when He had Reigned Twenty Two Years compleat: In the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, of the same day, <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> his only Son then living, was Proclaimed King of <hi>Great Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing He did, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Ceremonies of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Funeral; in which the King himself, in Person, followed as Chief Mourner. He then proceeded to consummate the Marriage with <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietta Maria,</hi> Younger Daughter of the great <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>France,</hi> whom He had formerly seen
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93088:57"/>
in his Journey, through that Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King then called a Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Assembled the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> following; to whom He represented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a short Speech, <hi>The urgent necessity of raising a Subsidy, since it would not agree with his Kingly Honour to shrink from the War with</hi> Spain, <hi>which his Father, upon solid Consideration, had, by consent of Both Houses, undertake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; although prevented, by Death, from putting it in Execution,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Parliament would not resolve on raising of Money, till they had first presented their Two Petitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning, <hi>Reasons of Religion, and Complaint of their Sufferings;</hi> which Points had been offered to his Father, King <hi>James,</hi> in the close of his last Parliament; and, by his Death, were left hitherto unanswered: In Both which, they received satisfaction; and likewise an account of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears which were due to the Forces,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93088:57"/>
by Sea and Land; together with an estimate of the future Charge and Expence of the <hi>Spanish</hi> War: Upon which, the King obtained, of the Laiety, Two Subsidies to be paid by <hi>Protestants,</hi> and Four from <hi>Papists;</hi> and Three Subsidies from the Clergy. In this Parliament, Dr. <hi>Montague,</hi> the King's Chaplain, was questioned for certain Tenets, in his Answer to a Book, called the <hi>Romish Dagger.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Laws were Enacted in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; as one about the <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's-Day;</hi> and another, for <hi>Restraint of Tippling in Inns and Ale-Houses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1629. the Parliament, by reason of the great <hi>Plague</hi> or <hi>Sickness,</hi> that then raged, Adjourned till <hi>August</hi> the <hi>1st;</hi> where the King, first by Himself, and next by his Secretaries, the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and Sir <hi>J. Cook,</hi> declared to them the necessity of setting forth a Fleet, for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> The
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93088:58"/>
Lord Treasurer likewise Instanced the several Summs of Money, which King <hi>James</hi> Died Indepted to the City of <hi>London.</hi> This occasioned very warm Debates in the House of Commons; who alledged, <hi>That Evil Counsels guided the King's Designs: That the Treasury was misimployed: That our Necessities arose through Improvidence: That it would be necessary to Petition the King, for a stricter Hand, and abler Council, to manage his Affairs: That though a former Parliament engaged the King in a War; yet, if things were managed with contrary Designs, and the Treasury were misimployed, this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was not bound to be carried blindfold in Designs, not guided by sound Counsel: That it was not usual to grant Subsidies upon Subsidies in one Parliament, and no Grievances Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed:</hi> with many other Passages of the like nature. They likewise very much reflected on the Miscarriages of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93088:58"/>
then a Person of a very Considerable Trust: They presented the King with a Petition against <hi>Popish Recusants, &amp;c.</hi> Unto which, a Satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was returned: And thereupon there followed a Debate about Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; Some were for Contributing presently, Others Demurred, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking the Design in Hand; and, in Conclusion, the Major-part agreed not to give: And then being Incensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke of <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they began to think of Divesting Him of his Offices, and to require an Account of the Publick Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, the King Dissolved the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Spain</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, both for the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to prevent Disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our <hi>Civil State;</hi> but by reason of the Dissolving of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was Necessitated to take up Money upon <hi>Loan,</hi> of such Persons as were of Ability to Lend: And to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93088:59"/>
that end, he Directed his Letters to the Lord Lieutenants of the several Counties; <hi>To return the Names of those Men they thought most Sufficient; the Places of their Abodes, and what Sums each might be judged able to Lend.</hi> And to the Persons returned, <hi>Letters</hi> were Issued forth in the <hi>King's Name,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That His</hi> Majesty, <hi>having Observed, in the</hi> Precedents <hi>and</hi> Customs <hi>of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Times, That all the</hi> Kings <hi>and</hi> Queens <hi>of this Realm, upon Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occasions, have used either to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to those</hi> Contributions, <hi>which arise from the Generality of the</hi> Subjects, <hi>or to the Private Helps of some Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected in that Particular, by way of Loan:</hi> With many <hi>Cogent Reasons,</hi> shewing, How His present pressing Emergencies required His having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Method of Raising Moneys.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> was the <hi>Coronation;</hi> at which the <hi>King</hi> did
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93088:59"/>
not pass through the City in State from the <hi>Tower,</hi> as was usual; but went by Water from <hi>White-Hall</hi> to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> for fear of the Danger of the Concourse of People; the <hi>Pestilence</hi> which Raged the Year before, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite ceased.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> Summons a <hi>Parliament</hi> to Sit <hi>February</hi> the <hi>Sixth;</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Met accordingly, the <hi>King</hi> Chose Sir <hi>H.

            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>House of Commons</hi> were very busie in Searching the <hi>Signet-Office,</hi> for the <hi>Original</hi> of a <hi>Letter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Signet,</hi> Written to the Mayor of <hi>York,</hi> for Reprieving divers <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits.</hi> This was Reported by

               <hi>Pim,</hi> Chair-man to the Committee for <hi>Religion;</hi> but their Proceedings therein was interrupted, by a Message from the <hi>King,</hi> sent by Sir <hi>R.

            <p>But, notwithstanding these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, the <hi>Commons</hi> taking the <hi>King's Necessities</hi> into Consideration, Voted
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93088:60"/>
               <hi>Three Subsidies,</hi> and <hi>Three Fifteens;</hi> and the <hi>Bill</hi> should be brought in as soon as the <hi>Grievances,</hi> which were Represented, were Redressed. But the <hi>King</hi> Observing they did not make as much Hast as He expected, to answer His last Message, Summons both <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> together; and, by the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> Complains to them, <hi>For not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dr.</hi> Turner, <hi>and</hi> C. Cook; <hi>and likewise, for Searching his</hi> Signet-Office; <hi>and also Justified the Duke of</hi> Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham <hi>to have Acted nothing of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment, without His</hi> Special Warrant: <hi>He blamed them for being too Sparing in the matter of Supply; and for Ordering the Bill not to be brought in, till their Grievances were Heard and Answered, which He would not Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Commons,</hi> in Answer, present a Remonstrance, and justifie Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> again Earnestly pressed the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> for a speedy
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93088:61"/>
Supply, by their <hi>Speaker</hi> Sir <hi>H. Finch;</hi> giving them to understand, <hi>That if they did not pass the Bill of Subsidy by the end of the Week following, it would enforce Him to take other Resolutions; and if, by their Denial, or Delay, any thing of ill Consequences should fall out, either at Home, or Abroad, He called God and Man to Witness, That He had done his Part to prevent it, by Calling his People together, to Advise with Him; whose Sitting (if they dispatched This, according to his Desire) He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to continue, for the Dispatch of other Affairs; and after their Recess, to bring Them again together the next</hi> Winter.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Commons</hi> sent an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, they drew up a Petition to His Majesty; <hi>That He would be pleased to Remove from all Places of Trust and Authority, all such Persons as were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Popish Recusants, <hi>or, according to the Directions of former</hi> Acts of State, <hi>justly to be suspected to be such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93088:61"/>And herewith they likewise sent a large Scroul, of the Names of all such Noblemen and others, as continued in Places of High Trust in the several Counties of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Presently after the <hi>Commons</hi> drew up another <hi>Declaration of Grievances</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom they Resolved utterly to Overthrow, though much contrary to the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>King;</hi> who being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Incensed, Dissolved the <hi>Parliament</hi> the very next Day, <hi>June 15th,</hi> 1626. After which, the <hi>King</hi> Published a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> shewing the Grounds and Reasons of his Dissolving this, and the former <hi>Parliament.</hi> Then several ways were Resolved on, for Advancing the <hi>King's Revenue:</hi> First, Levying of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi> and <hi>Impost</hi> on all Merchandize, (supposed to be settled to the <hi>King</hi> by the Two last <hi>Parliaments.</hi>) Privy Seals also were Issued out, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence proposed; and, at length, a Commission for a General <hi>Loan</hi> was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93088:62"/>
Resolved on. Sir <hi>Randolph Crew,</hi> for not appearing Vigorous in promoting the <hi>Loan,</hi> was Displaced from being Lord-Chief-Justice; the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was likewise Informed against in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> by Sir <hi>J. Lamb,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> for speaking against the <hi>Loan,</hi> and seeming to Favour the <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Assessment of the <hi>Loan,</hi> was generally Opposed; whereupon the People of the lower Rank, were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Appear in the <hi>Millitary-Yard,</hi> next St. <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi> before the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> to be Listed for Souldiers; it being thought Necessary, that those which refused to Assist with their Purses in Common Defence, should be forced to Serve in their Persons; Others of better Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, were bound to Appear at the Council-Table; several of whom were Committed Prisoners to the <hi>Fleet, Marshalsea, Gate-house, &amp;c.</hi> and among others, Sir <hi>J. Elliot,</hi> who Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93088:62"/>
His Majesty, and repeated many Precedents; <hi>That all manner of</hi> Taxes, <hi>in former King's Reigns, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Levied, but by the General Consent of the Nobility and Commons, Assembled in Parliament.</hi> However, he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Prisoner to the <hi>Gate-House;</hi> and upon the same account, Sir <hi>P. Haymon</hi> was Commanded to Serve the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> which he did accordingly.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and Dr. <hi>Maynwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> two Eminent Preachers at Court, about this time, Preached up <hi>the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and Duty of the</hi> Loan; One of them Asserting, <hi>That the</hi> Prince <hi>had Power to Direct his Council, and make Laws; and that Subjects, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exhibit Active Obedience, in case the Thing commanded should be against the Law of God, or Nature, or more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; yet nevertheless, they ought to yield Passive Obedience; and, in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cases, they were bound to Active Obedience.</hi> The other Affirmed, <hi>That
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93088:63"/>
the</hi> King's <hi>Royal Command, in Imposing of Laws and Taxes, though without Common Consent in</hi> Parliament, <hi>did Oblige the Subject's Conscience, upon Pain of Eternal Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Position being entertain'd by the Court with Applause, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Dr. <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s, call'd, <hi>Apostolick Obedience,</hi> was Licensed by Doctor <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> And an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command was sent from the <hi>King</hi> to Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence it, which he refused: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was Suspended from his <hi>Archiepiscopal-Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1627. (being the Third Year of His Majesty's Reign) the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to clear his Reputation, as to the Charge of Negligence in his Admiralship, with much ado Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his Naval Forces, consisting of Six thousand Horse and Foot, in Ten Ships Royal, and Ninety Merchant-Men; with which he set Sail from <hi>Portsmouth, June</hi> 27th, and Published a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93088:63"/>
               <hi>Manifesto,</hi> of the <hi>K.</hi>'s Affections to the Reformed Churches in <hi>France:</hi> But by several Accidents, this Great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign miscarried. At this Time the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> was very low; and several late Enterprizes having miscarried, it was Resolved, That a Parliament should be immediately Called, and Writs were accordingly Issued out: A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission likewise passed under the Great Seal, for raising Moneys through the Kingdom, in nature of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise: There was some Discourse of Levying of <hi>Ship-Money;</hi> but it was declined at that Time, because of the Parliament's approaching.</p>
            <p>Upon the 17th of <hi>March,</hi> 1627, the Parliament Assembled; and the <hi>King,</hi> with the <hi>Lord-Keeper,</hi> in two Speeches, earnestly Pressed them to Consider of some speedy way, for Supplying His Majesty's Necessities. The first Thing taken into Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by the <hi>Commons,</hi> was the Grievance of the Kingdom; and the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93088:64"/>
first Thing insisted on, was the Case of those Gentlemen, for refusing the <hi>Loan;</hi> and who, notwithstanding their <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> were remanded to Prison; and it was Resolved in the House, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> That no Man ought to be Restrained by the <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> without some Cause of the Commitment. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> ought to be Granted upon Request to every Man that is Restrained, though by the Command of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> or any other. Thirdly, That if a Free-man be Imprisoned by the Command of the <hi>King, &amp;c.</hi> and no Cause of such Commitment expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the same be Returned upon an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> granted for the said Party, then he ought to be Delivered, or Bailed.</p>
            <p>Then the Parliament proceeded to draw up a Petition against <hi>Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants;</hi> to which the <hi>King</hi> gave them a Satisfactory Answer: After which,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93088:64"/>
Five Subsidies were granted to the <hi>K.</hi> which gave so great Satisfaction to His Majesty, that He sent them word, <hi>He would deny them nothing of their Liberties, which any of his Predecessors had granted:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> fell upon the Memorable <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and was afterwards agreed to by both <hi>Houses,</hi> that it should be settled to the <hi>King.</hi> And when the Petition was Presented to His Majesty, the Answer following was quickly returned: <q>The <hi>King</hi> willeth that Right be done according to Law and Customs of the Realm, and the Statutes be put in due Execution; that His Subjects may have no Cause to complain of any Wrongs or Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions contrary to their just Rights and Liberties; to the Preservation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, He holds Himself in Conscience as well Obliged, as to that of his Prerogative.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Answer being read in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> was not judged
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93088:65"/>
Satisfactory; and therefore, upon their humble Petition, His Majesty, to shew how Free and Candid His Concessions were to His Subjects, sent them this short, but full Answer; <hi>Soit Droit Fait come il est desire; Let it be done according to your Desire:</hi> Which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer mightily pleased both <hi>Houses;</hi> and His Majesty, for further Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, suffered the Commission of <hi>Loan</hi> and <hi>Excise</hi> to be Cancelled, and received <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> into his Favour again; so that all Discontents, on every side, seemed to be Banished.</p>
            <p>In 1628. (the Fourth Year of His Majesty's Reign) the Parliament drew up a Remonstrance against <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and against Bishop <hi>Neal,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Laud;</hi> which they Presented to the <hi>King,</hi> with the Bill of Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; His Majesty telling them, <hi>That He expected not such a Return, for His favourable Answer to the</hi> Petition of Right; <hi>and as for the</hi> Grievances, <hi>He would take time to Consider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93088:65"/>An Information being likewise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited against the Duke, in the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> an Order was made in that Court, That all Proceedings thereupon should be taken off the File, by the King's express Will and Pleasure: And the King being resolved to hold up the Duke, sent so brisk an Answer to their Remonstrances, as provoked the Commons, to question his taking <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage;</hi> which being of too valuable a consideration to be hazarded, His Majesty Obviated, by Adjourning the Parliament to the 20. of <hi>Octob.</hi> following. The Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> having Sailed with Fifty Ships, to the Relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> was repelled with much Loss; so that despairing of Success, he returned back to <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth:</hi> Whereupon another Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was resolved on, with a more considerable Navy, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was designed Admiral; who going to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> in order to hastening of Business, one <hi>John Felton,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93088:66"/>
a Lieutenant, Stabbed him to the Heart with a Knife; <hi>Felton,</hi> after he had committed the Fact, did not Fly, but voluntary acknowledged he was the Person; and being asked, What inclined him to commit so Barbarous an Act? he boldly answered, <hi>He Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him for the Cause of</hi> God, <hi>and his Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament was to have met in <hi>October;</hi> but, by reason of some ill News, during this Expedition, they were Adjourned to <hi>January</hi> 20. In which time, the Merchants refusing to pay Custom, had their Goods seized: Complaint thereof being made to the Parliament; the King Summons the Two Houses, to the <hi>Banqueting-House</hi> at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and requires them to Pass the promised Bill of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> for ending all Differences; since it was too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Jewel of the Crown, to be so lightly forgone.</p>
            <p>But the Commons answered, <hi>That</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:93088:66"/>
God's <hi>Cause was to be prefered, before the King's; and that they would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the first place, consult about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> And therefore, they appointed one Committee for Religion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for Civil Matters: In the last, was a Complaint, about the Customs; and the Farmers of the Customs were Challenged; but the King excused them, as acting by His Command: Yet this being not clear to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they would have proceeded against them, as Delinquents: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King sent them word, <hi>That in Honour he could not, nor would give way thereunto:</hi> which so incensed the Parliament, that they Adjourned themselves for some Days; and then Meeting again, the King Adjourned them till <hi>March</hi> 10. The Commons inraged thereat, blamed their Speaker, for admitting the Message; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Sir <hi>J. Elliot</hi> to draw up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance; which was in very high terms, about the <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:93088:67"/>The Commons having prepared their Remonstrance, about the Bill of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> they required their Speaker to put it to the Vote, whether it should be Presented to the King or not, but the Speaker refused it; and, according to the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, would have gone away; but Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> would not suffer him to stir, till himself had read the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of the House, consisting of Three Heads.</p>

            </list>
            <p>These were so much disliked by the King, that he immediately sent for the Serjeant of Mace out of the House of Commons; but Sir <hi>M. Hobart</hi> took the Key from him, and locking the Door, would not suffer him to go forth: At which the King being very much offended, sends the Usher of the <hi>Black-Rod</hi> to Dissolve Them, who was not admitted in: Whereupon the King, with his Guard of Pensioners, were resolved to force their Entrance; which the Commons having notice of, they suddenly went all out of the House: And this was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93088:68"/>
the End of this Parliament.</p>
            <p>After their Dissolution, the King Published a Declaration, setting forth the Cause thereof; notwithstanding which, it procured great Animosities in the People, against the Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, which occasioned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Libels to be dispersed abroad; whereof one against Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> was found in the Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Yard, to this effect; Laud, <hi>look to thy self, to be sure thy Life is sought; as thou art the Fountain of Wickedness, Repent of thy Monstrous Sin, before thou be taken out of the World: And assure thy self, that neither</hi> God, <hi>nor the World, can endure such a vile Whisperer and Councellor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some, considering the unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of This, and the Two former Parliaments, advised the King never to Call any more: And, to that end, the famous Book of <hi>Projects</hi> was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and Addrest to the King; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing some Methods, to prevent the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93088:68"/>
               <hi>Impertinency of Parliaments</hi> (as he called them) from time to time, by the Example of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. of <hi>France;</hi> who pretending that the Commons, or Third part, did encroach too much on the Nobility and Clergy, Dissolved it; and never after suffered the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple freely to Elect their Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but nominated certain Eminent Persons himself, instead thereof; which is called, <hi>L' Assembly des Notabiles,</hi> or the Assembly of the Chief or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Men.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>May</hi> 29. 1630. the Queen was Delivered of a Son, at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, who was Christened <hi>Charles;</hi> who afterwards Succeeded his Father in these Kingdoms, by the Name of <hi>CHARLES the Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1633. (and the Ninth of His Majesty's Reign) the King made a Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was Solemnly Crowned at <hi>Edinbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, June</hi> 18. And then the King Calls a Parliament, and passed an Act,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93088:69"/>
for the <hi>Ratification of the Old Acts.</hi> In this <hi>Scotish Parliament,</hi> that Nation shewed some sign of Disaffection to the King: And the generality of the Common People would not suffer the Bishop of <hi>Dumblaine,</hi> Dean of the King's private Chapple there, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Prayers twice a day, after the <hi>English</hi> manner: Neither durst they receive the Communion on their Knees; nor wear a Surplice upon <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holy-Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1634. the design of <hi>Ship-Money</hi> was first set on foot; and Attorney-General <hi>Noy</hi> being consulted about it, he pretends, out of some Old Records, to find an Ancient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of raising a Tax on the Nation, by the Authority of the King alone, for setting out a Navy, in case of Danger; which was thereupon put in Execution: And, by this Tax, the King raised (by Writ) above Twenty Thousand Pounds <hi>per</hi> Month, though not without great Discontent, both
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93088:69"/>
among the Clergy and Laiety.</p>
            <p>The Discontent in <hi>Scotland</hi> began farther to increase; and a Book was Published, charging the King with indirect Proceedings in the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and a tendency to the <hi>Romish</hi> Belief. And now, to blow up these <hi>Scotch</hi> Sparks to a Flame, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> sent over his Chaplain, and another Gentleman, to heighten their Discontents. The Author of that Book was Seized, and found to be abetted by the Lord <hi>Balmerino;</hi> who was thereupon Arraigned by his Peers, and Sentenced to Death; but Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the King.</p>
            <p>The latter end of the Year, 1635. great Differences arose about Church Matters, chiefly occasioned by Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s strict and zealous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Ceremonies; as placing the Communion-Table at the <hi>East</hi>-end of the Church, upon an Ascent with Rails, Altar-fashion; with many other things, not formerly insisted on; and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93088:70"/>
now vehemently opposed, by those who were formerly called <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformists;</hi> which caused them to be charged with Faction: Yet some of the Episcopal Party as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>That the Communion-Table ought to stand in the middle of the Quire, according to the Primitive Example:</hi> And a Book, supposed to be Written by Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> was Published, to this purpose.</p>
            <p>Several Gentlemen of Quality had refused to Pay the <hi>Ship-Money;</hi> and among the rest, Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham-shire;</hi> upon which, the King refers the whole Business to the Twelve Judges, in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, 1636. Ten of whom, that is, <hi>Bramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Finch, Davenport, Denham, Jones, Trever, Vernon, Berkly, Crowly, Weston,</hi> gave their Judgments against <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> but <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi> refused it.</p>
            <p>His Majesty desiring an Uniformity in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, enjoyned the <hi>Scots</hi> the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93088:70"/>
use of the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, and other Habiliments; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first in his own Chapple: And in this Year, 1637. Proclamation was made, That the same should be used throughout all Churches, wherewith the Bishops were contented; but not the <hi>Kirk,</hi> nor the People; who were so inraged thereat, that in <hi>Edinborough,</hi> and divers other Parts of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where the Liturgy was begun to be read, committed very great Outrages and Violences, against the Persons that read it; and could not be appeased, by the Power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate: And some time after, the <hi>Scots</hi> entred into a solemn League and Covenant, to preserve the Religion there Profest. This Covenant the <hi>Scots</hi> were resolved to maintain; and, to that purpose, they sent for General <hi>Lesly,</hi> and other great Officers, from beyond Sea, providing themselves likewise with Arms and Ammunition. After this, they Elect Commissioners
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93088:71"/>
for the general Assembly; whom they cite to move the Arch-Bishops and Bishops to appear there, as Guilty Persons; which being refused, the People present a Bill of Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, to the Presbitery at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinbrough;</hi> who accordingly warned them to appear at the next <hi>General Assembly:</hi> At their Meeting, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops sent in a Protestation against their Assembly, which the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would not vouchsafe to read: And soon after they abolished Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; and then prepared for a War.</p>
            <p>On which, the King of <hi>England</hi> prepares an Army for <hi>Scotland;</hi> with which, in the Year, 1639. He March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Person into the <hi>North;</hi> but, by the Mediation of some Persons, a Treaty of Peace was begun, and soon finished; but a while after broke by the <hi>Scots.</hi> The King therefore resolved, since fair means would not prevail, to force the <hi>Scots</hi> to Reason: And, to that end, considers how to make
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93088:71"/>
Provisions for Men and Money; and calling a Secret Cabinet Council, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting only of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and Duke <hi>Hamilton;</hi> it was concluded, That for the King's Supply, a Parliament must be called in <hi>England,</hi> and another in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but because the Debates of Parliament would take up some time, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, That the Lords should Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to Lend the King Money: The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> Subscribed 20000 <hi>l.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> as much: The rest of the Lords, Judges, and Gentry, contributed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Ability,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> on the other side, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the Storm, prepared for their own Defence; making Treaties in <hi>Sweeden, Denmark, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And the Jesuits, who are never Idle, endeavour to Foment the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; to which end, <hi>Con,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio, Sir <hi>Tob. Matthews, Read,</hi> and <hi>Maxwel,</hi> Two <hi>Scots,</hi> endeavoured to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93088:72"/>
perswade the Discontented People, <hi>That the King designed to Enslave them to his Will and Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1640. (and the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the King's Reign) a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was called at <hi>Westminster, April</hi> 13. In which, the King presses them for a speedy Supply, to Suppress the Violences of the <hi>Scots.</hi> But whil'st the Parliament were Debating, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Grievances of the People, or the King's Supply should be first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, and Matters were in some hopeful Posture, Secretary <hi>Vane,</hi> either accidentally, or on purpose, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw all at once; by declaring, <hi>That the King required Twelve Subsidies;</hi> whereas, at that time, he only desired <hi>Six:</hi> which so enraged the House, and made things so ill, that, by the advice of the <hi>Juncto,</hi> the Parliament was Dissolved, having only Sate Twenty Two Days.</p>
            <p>Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> by his earnest Proceedings against the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93088:72"/>
by his strict enjoyning of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, especially reviving Old Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, (which had not been lately observed) procured, to himself, much Hatred from the People; That upon <hi>May</hi> 9. 1640. a Paper was fixed on the Gate of the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Prentices to go and Sack his House at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the <hi>Monday</hi> after; but the Arch-Bishop had notice of their Design, and provided according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that at the time when they came, endeavouring to enter his House, they were Repulsed.</p>
            <p>The King grew daily more offended against the <hi>Scots,</hi> and calls a Select <hi>Juncto,</hi> to consult about them; where the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> delivered his Mind in such terms as were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made use of to his Destruction. War against them was resolved on, and Money was to be procured one way or other: The City was Invited to Lend, but refused: The Gentry contributed indifferent freely: So that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93088:73"/>
with their Assistance, the Army was compleated: The King himself being <hi>Generalissimo;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Lieutenant-Generals: And Marching the Army into the <hi>North,</hi> between <hi>New-Castle</hi> and <hi>Berwick,</hi> there was some Action between the Two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; in which, the <hi>Scots</hi> had the Better: A Treaty is then set on Foot; and, to that end, the King receives a Petition from the <hi>Scots,</hi> complaining of their Grievances: To which He Answers, by his Secretary of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, That he expects their particular Demands,</hi> which he receives in Three days, all tending to Call a Parliament in <hi>England;</hi> without which, there could be no Redress for them: They had likewise, before their March into <hi>England,</hi> Published a Declaration, called, <hi>The Intentions of the Army,</hi> viz. <hi>Not to lay down Arms, till the Reformed Religion were settled in both Nations, upon sure grounds; and the Causers and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93088:73"/>
Abettors of their present Troubles, (that is, Arch-Bishop</hi> Laud, <hi>and the Earl of</hi> Strafford) <hi>were brought to Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in Parliament.</hi> At the same time, Twelve <hi>English</hi> Peers drew up a Petition, which they delivered to the King, for the Sitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>To which the King condescends: And now the time approaching for the Sitting of the Parliament, who accordingly Met, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. 1640. Mr. <hi>W. Lenthal</hi> was Chosen Speaker of the House of Commons: And the King, in a Speech, tells them, <hi>That the</hi> Scottish <hi>Troubles were the cause of their Meeting; and therefore requires them to consider of the most expedient Means for casting them out; and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Supply from them, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Commons</hi> began with the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down all Monopolies; and all such Members as had any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them, were Vottd out of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93088:74"/>
               <hi>House:</hi> They then Voted down <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> with the Opinion of the Judges thereupon, to be Illegal; and a Charge of High-Treason was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be Drawn up against Eight of them; and they resolved to begin with the Lord-Keeper <hi>Finch. Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 11th, Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> and some hundreds of Citizens, presented a Petition, Subscribed by Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Hands, against <hi>Church-Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and a while after the <hi>House of Commons</hi> Voted, <hi>That the</hi> Clergy <hi>in a</hi> Synod <hi>or</hi> Convocation, <hi>have no Power to make</hi> Canons <hi>or</hi> Laws, <hi>without</hi> Parliaments; <hi>and that the</hi> Canons <hi>are against the Fundamental Laws of this</hi> Realm, <hi>the</hi> King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, <hi>and the</hi> Property <hi>of the</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>the Right of</hi> Parliaments; <hi>and tend to Faction and Sedition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In pursuance hereof, a Charge was ordered to be drawn up against Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> as the Principal Framer of those <hi>Canons,</hi> and other <hi>Delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:93088:74"/>
which Impeachment was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by another from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners: Upon which he was Committed to the <hi>Black-Rod;</hi> and Ten Weeks after Voted Guilty of High-Treason, and sent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> likewise preferred a Charge against the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> then in Custody, requiring Justice against them both, as the great Incendiaries and Disturbers both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord-Keeper <hi>Finch</hi> was the next Person designed to be Censured; and notwithstanding a Speech made in his own Vindication, He was Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Traytor upon several Accounts: But he fore-saw the Storm, and went over into <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Monday, <hi>March</hi> 26. 1640, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Tryal began in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> the <hi>King, Queen,</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> being present; and the <hi>Commons,</hi> being there likewise as a Committee, at the managing their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93088:75"/>
Accusation: The Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> though he had but short Warning, yet made a Noble Defence. The Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation was managed by Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> consisting of Twenty eight Articles; to most of which, the Earl made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Replies.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Commons</hi> were resolved to Prosecute him to Death; and had therefore (not only procured the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Prosecute him there as Guilty of High-Treason) but resolved to proceed against him by Bill of Attainder, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to dispatch: And <hi>April</hi> 19. 1641. they Voted the Earl Guilty of High-Treason, upon the Evidence of Secretary <hi>Vane,</hi> and his Notes: And upon the 25th, they passed the Bill, and sent it to the Lords, for their Concurrence; who a few Days after, likewise agreed to it.</p>
            <p>The Bill being finished, and the <hi>K.</hi> fearing the Conclusion, and being willing to do some good Office to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93088:75"/>
the Earl, His Majesty, <hi>May</hi> 1. 1641, Calls both <hi>Honses</hi> together, and in a Speech, tells them; <hi>That he had been present at the Hearing that great Cause; and that in his Conscience, possitively he could not Condemn him of High-Treason, and yet could not clear him of Misdemeanours; but hoped a way might be found out to Satisfie Justice, and their Fears, without oppressing his Conscience.</hi> And so dismissed them, to their great Discontent: Which was propogated so far, that <hi>May</hi> 3. were One thousand Citizens, most of them Armed, came thronging down to <hi>Westminster,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for Justice against the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> The <hi>Commons</hi> had now finished a Bill, <hi>for the Continuance of the Parliament;</hi> which having passed the Lords, was tendred to the <hi>King</hi> to be Signed; together with the Bill for the Attainder of the E. of <hi>Strafford:</hi> His Majesty Answered; That on <hi>Monday</hi> following He would Satisfie them; and on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> spent the whole Day with the Judges and Bishops, in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93088:76"/>
Consulting: The Judges told him; <hi>That in Point of Law, (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Oath made by Sir</hi> Henry Vane) <hi>he was Guilty of Treason.</hi> The Bishops all agreed; <hi>That the King might shew Mercy without Scruple; and that he could not Condemn the Earl, if he did not think him Guilty.</hi> This was to matter of Fact; but as to matter of Law, He was to rest in the Opinion of the Judges.</p>
            <p>Monday, <hi>May</hi> 10. the <hi>King</hi> gives Commission to several Lords to Pass two Bills; One, <hi>The Bill of Attainder against the Earl of</hi> Strafford. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The next Day the <hi>King</hi> being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about the Earl, writes a Letter to the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> telling them; <hi>That whereas Justice had been satisfied in his Condemnation, an intermixture of Mercy would not now be unseasonable; and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93088:76"/>
therefore He desired them, that if it might be done without any Discontent to the People, the Earl might be permitted to fulfil the Natural Course of his Life in close Imprisonment, Sequestred from all Publick Affairs; provided he never attempted to make an Escape: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He thought it a Work of Charity, to Reprieve him till Saturday.</hi> But nothing could be Obtained in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him.</p>
            <p>The Fall of this Powerful Man, so startled other great Officers of State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that several Resigned their Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 5. A Charge was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> against Dr. <hi>Wren</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> being Accused of Treasonable Misdemeanours in his Diocess.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> 6. Both the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Armies were Disbanded; and Four Days after the <hi>King</hi> went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was Entertained with great Demonstrations of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by that Nation, and Conferred se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

Places of Honour and Power upon divers of them: He Confirmed likewise the Treaty between the Two Nations, by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 23, 1641. A Horrid and Notorious Rebellion broke out in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was in divers Places ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with such Secresie, that it was not Discovered at <hi>Dublin</hi> till the Night before it was to be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; but, in most other Places of the Kingdom, it was carried on with such Fury, That two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>English</hi> Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were in a short Space barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Murdered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> to Dishearten the <hi>English</hi> from any Resistance, bragged, <hi>That the</hi> Queen <hi>was with their Army; That the</hi> King would come <hi>amongst them also, and Assist them: That they did but maintain His Cause against the</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans: <hi>That they had the</hi> King's <hi>Com-Commission for what they did.</hi> The Lords Justices sent Sir <hi>H. Spotswood</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:93088:77"/>
to the <hi>King,</hi> then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with an Account of all that happened: He dispatched Sir <hi>J. Stuart,</hi> with Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the Lords of the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and to carry all the Money, his present Stores would supply. He likewise sent an Express to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (as being near) for their Assistance; but they excused it: And indeed, the <hi>Irish</hi> pretended that the <hi>Scots</hi> were in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with them; and to seem to Confirm it, they abstained, for some time, from destroying the Estates, or Murdering any of that Nation. And on the other-side, to Encourage the <hi>Irish,</hi> they produced pretended Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; wherein they said, They were Informed from <hi>England; That the</hi> Parliament <hi>had passed an Act, that all the</hi> Irish <hi>should be Compelled to the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant <hi>Worship;</hi> and for the First Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in refusing, to Forfeit all their Goods; for the Second, their Estates; and for the Third, their Lives: And
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93088:78"/>
besides this, they presented them with the Hopes of Liberty: That the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Yoak should be shaken off: That they should have a <hi>King</hi> of their own Nation; and that then all the Goods and Estates of the <hi>English</hi> should be divided amongst them. With these Motives of Spoil and Liberty, which were strengthned by the Former, of <hi>Religion,</hi> the Rebellion was carried on throughout the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being returned out of <hi>Scotland, December</hi> 2d. Summoned both <hi>Houses</hi> together, and tells them; <hi>That he had staid in</hi> Scotland <hi>longer than He expected, yet not fruitlesly; for He had given full Satisfaction to the Nation; but cannot choose but take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and Wonder at the unexpected Distractions He finds at Home; and then Commends to them the State of</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>After which, the <hi>Commons</hi> Ordered a Select Committee to draw up a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and Remonstrance to the <hi>King:</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:93088:78"/>
The One was against the Bishops, and Oppressions in Church-Government; and for Punishing the Authors of it. In the Other was Contained all the Miscarriages and Misfortunes, since the beginning of His Majesty's Reign.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> Issued out a Declaration, in Answer to the Remonstrance; the Summ of which was; <hi>That He thought He had given sufficient Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his People's Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, concerning</hi> Religion, Liberties, <hi>and</hi> Civil Interests; <hi>by the Bills which He hath Passed this</hi> Parliament: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring the Misunderstandings might be removed on either Side; and that the Bleeding Condition of</hi> Ireland <hi>might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to Unity, for the Relief of that Unhappy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after happened the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tumults of the <hi>London</hi> Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and <hi>Westminster. December</hi> 28. the <hi>King sends a</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the Lords; <hi>That He would raise ten Thousand</hi> Volunteers <hi>for</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93088:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>if the Commons would undertake to Pay them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime after, the <hi>King,</hi> upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and Five of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> viz. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stroud,</hi> had Correspondence with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and Countenanced the late City-Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults; He thereupon Ordered their Trunks, Studies, and Chambers to be Sealed up, and their Persons Seized; the Former of which was done, but having timely Notice, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side: Upon which the <hi>Commons,</hi> the same Day, Voted high against these Actions of the <hi>King.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>King</hi> Charges the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the Five Members, with several Articles; and Acquaints both <hi>Houses,</hi> That He did intend to Prosecute them for High-Treason,; and required that their Persons might be Secured: And the next Day, the <hi>King,</hi> Attended with His Guard of <hi>Pensioners,</hi> and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93088:79"/>
some Hundreds of Gentlemen, went to the <hi>House of Commons;</hi> and the Guard staying without, the King, with the <hi>Palsgrave,</hi> entred the <hi>House;</hi> at whose Entrance, the Speaker rises out of the Chair, and the King sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down therein, views the <hi>Houses</hi> round, and perceives the Birds He aimed at were flown; whereupon He tells them, <hi>That He came to look for those Five Members, whom He had Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of High-Treason; and was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have them, where-ever He found them; and expected to have them sent to Him, as soon as they should come to the House; but would not have them think, that this Act of His was any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act of the King's was so highly resented by the <hi>House,</hi> that the next day, <hi>Jan.</hi> 5. the <hi>Commons</hi> Voted it a <hi>Breach of Priviledge:</hi> And Reports were raised in the City, That He intended Violence against the <hi>House of Commons;</hi> and came thither
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93088:80"/>
with Force, to Murther several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and used threatning Speeches against the <hi>Parliament;</hi> with which the City was so possessed, that the Guards and Watches were Set, as if some desperate Assault were to be made upon the City: And <hi>Both Houses</hi> Adjourned till the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following; appointing a Committee, in the mean time, to sit at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> to consider of the most effectual Means for their Security. And then they Published a Declaration, <hi>That whosoever shall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest any Member of Parliament, by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the King only, is guilty of the Breach of Priviledges of Parliament: And likewise, That all those who At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the King, when He came to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Five Members, were guilty of a Traiterous Design against the King and Parliament: That the Proclamation for Apprehending and Imprisoning the said Members, was False, Scandalous, and Illegal; and not of Validity enough to hinder them from Attending the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93088:80"/>
House: Wherefore, They intreat His Majesty to discover the Names of those Informers, and Evil Councellors; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring all such Persons to be Publick Enemies to the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Londoners</hi> came thronging to <hi>Westminster,</hi> with Petitions, inveighing Bitterly against some of the Peers; but especially the Bishops, whom they Affronted as they went to the House: Upon which they were so affrighted, that Twelve Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops absent themselves from the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> drawing up a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station against all Laws, Orders, Votes, Resolutions and Determinations, as in themselves Null, and of none Effect, which had Passed, or should Pass, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their forced Absence. Presently after which, at a Conference between <hi>Both Houses,</hi> it was agreed, <hi>That this Protestation of the Twelve Bishops, did extend to the deep intrenching on the Fundamental Priviledges, and Being of Parliaments:</hi> And, in a short time,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93088:81"/>
they were Accused of High-Treason, Seized, and brought on their Knees at the Lords-Bar: Ten of whom were Committed to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and the other Two, in regard of their Age, to the <hi>Black-Rod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, at this Time, thinking Himself unsafe without a Guard, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the offer of some Gentlemen of the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> to be a Guard to Him; which, instead of Security, was (by Subtil Men) made more prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the King; by taking this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to raise the Rage and Jealousie of the City against Him: For, at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, there were cries made in the Streets of <hi>London, That all the People should rise to their Defence; for the King, with His Papists, were come to Fire the City, and Cut their Throats in their Beds:</hi> The People, by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving such Alarms, being terrified from Sleep, the Impressions of those Night-fears lay long upon their Spirits in the Day, and filled them almost
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93088:81"/>
with Madness; of which the King Complained to the <hi>Common-Council</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Commons,</hi> to obviate this, upon Suspicion of some Design upon their Persons, Petition the King for a Guard, to be Commanded by the Earl of <hi>Essex;</hi> of whose Fidelity to the King and State, no question was ever made. This Petition was deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King, as not willing to have them too strong; yet promised to take such Care for their Security from Violence, as He would for the Preservation of Himself and Children.</p>
            <p>This Answer being unsatisfactory, the City joyns with them; and in their <hi>Common-Council,</hi> drew up a Petition, complaining, <hi>That the Trade of the City was decayed, to the utter Ruine of the</hi> Protestant <hi>Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of</hi> Papists, Foreigners, <hi>and</hi> Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks (<hi>more particularly their foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Irish <hi>Rebellion) by changing the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93088:82"/>
Constable of the</hi> Tower, <hi>and making Preparation there; by the Fortifying of</hi> White-Hall; <hi>and the King's late Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the</hi> House of Commons: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they Pray, <hi>That, by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Advice, the</hi> Protestants <hi>in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>may be Relieved: The</hi> Tower <hi>to be put into the Hands of Persons of Trust: A Guard appointed for the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Parliament: And that the Five Members may not be Restrained, nor Proceeded against, but by the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To their Petition the King returned Answer, <hi>That He could not Express a greater sence of</hi> Ireland, <hi>than He had done: That, meerly to satisfie the City, He had removed a Worthy Person from the Charge of the</hi> Tower: <hi>And that the Tumults had caused Him to Fortifie</hi> White-Hall, <hi>for the Security of His own Person: That His going to the</hi> House of Commons, <hi>was to Apprehend those Five Members for Treason, to which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament could not extend;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93088:82"/>
and that He would proceed against them no otherwise than Legally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now such numbers of ordinary People daily gathered about <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and <hi>White-Hall,</hi> that the King (doubting of their Intentions) thought fit to withdraw to <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> taking with Him, the Queen, Prince, and Duke of <hi>York;</hi> where He and his Retinue, and Guard quickly encreased, by accession of divers of the Gentry. But the next day, the Five Members were Triumphantly Guarded to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> by a great number of Citizens and Sea-men; with Hundreds of Boats and Barges, with Guns in them, shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hallowing as they passed by <hi>White-Hall;</hi> and making large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations at <hi>Westminster,</hi> of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Adherence and Fidelity to the Parliament. About this time, the Parliament had notice, that the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and Col. <hi>Lunsford,</hi> were raising Troops of Horse at <hi>Kingston,</hi> where the County Magazine was lodged:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93088:83"/>
Whereupon they order, <hi>That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and the Trained-Bands, shall take care to secure the Countries, and their Magazines. Lunsford</hi> was Seized, and sent to the <hi>Tower;</hi> but <hi>Digby</hi> escaped beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>The King removed to <hi>Royston;</hi> at which time, Sir <hi>E. Herbert,</hi> Attorny-General, is questioned at the Lords-Bar, to Answer concerning the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles against the <hi>Five Members;</hi> where it had gone hard with him, if the King (at his earnest Supplication) had not taken him off, by a Letter to the Lord-Keeper <hi>Littleton;</hi> wherein the King clears the Attorny-General, and takes the whole Business upon Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; yet concludes, <hi>That finding Cause, wholly to desist from Proceeding against the Persons Accused, He had Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Attorny-General to proceed no farther therein, nor to produce nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any Proof concerning the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. The King sends a Message to the Parliament, proposing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93088:83"/>
of his own just Rights, and Royal Authority; and, <hi>That since par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grievances and Distractions were too many, and would be too great to be Presented by themselves, that They would Comprize and Digest them into one entire Body, and send them to Him: And it should then appear, how ready He would be, to equal or exceed the greatest Examples of the most Indulgent Princes, in their Acts of Grace and Favour to the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>Commons</hi> move the <hi>Lords</hi> to joyn with them, in Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Tower;</hi> but They not complying, the <hi>House of Commons</hi> singly of themselves, importune the King, to put those things into the Hands of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> as the only available Means, for the removal of their Fears and Jealousies. But the King not willing to part with the Principal Jewels of his Crown, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to them, <hi>That He thought the</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:93088:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Militia <hi>to be lawfully subject to no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd but his Own; and therefore would not let it go out of his Hands: That he had preferred to the Lieutenancy of the</hi> Tower, <hi>a Person of known Fortune, and unquestionable Reputation; and that he would Prefer none but such, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Forts and Castles: Yet would not intrust the Power of Conferring those Places and Dignities from Himself; it being derived to Him, from his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom.</hi> Yet the <hi>Commons</hi> would not desist, but again Petitioned; and were again refused. Soon after, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Petitions were delivered to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> against the Votes of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi> Lords and Bishops in the House of Peers; as One from <hi>Suffolk,</hi> with 1500 Hands; Another from <hi>London,</hi> with 2000 Hands; and a Third from the <hi>City-Dames:</hi> To all which were Answered, <hi>That the</hi> Commons <hi>had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready endeavoured Relief from the</hi> Lords, <hi>in their Requests; and should so
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93088:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continue till Redress were obtained.</hi> And shortly after, the Lords Passed the Bill, <hi>For disabling all Persons in Holy-Orders, to have any place or Vote in Parliament; or to exercise any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Jurisdiction.</hi> At the same time, they Petition the King again for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and for clearing <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the Five Members: By his Answer to Both, they understood his Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Not to trust the</hi> Militia <hi>out of Himself; nor to clear the Members, but only by a general Pardon;</hi> which was unsatisfactory.</p>
            <p>The King now at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> thought fit to send for all his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Servants of either Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and particularly, the Earls of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> but they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to come.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> at a Conference, complaining of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral flocking of Papists into <hi>Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> affirmed, <hi>That since the Lieutenant had ordered a stop upon the Ports, against
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93088:85"/>
all</hi> Irish Papists, <hi>many of the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, now in the head of the Rebels, had been licensed to pass thither, by his Majesty's immediate Warrant.</hi> The King was highly offended at this Speech, which He signified to the House; who, in their Answer to his Message, justifie Mr. <hi>Pym</hi>'s words to be the Sense of the House; and that they had yet in safe Custody, the Lord <hi>Delvin,</hi> Sir <hi>G. Hamilton,</hi> Col. <hi>Butler,</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>Miniard,</hi> now in Rebellion, and one of the Lord <hi>Nettervil</hi>'s Sons: To which the King replies, <hi>That he thought Mr.</hi> Pym's <hi>Speech was not so well grounded, as it ought to have been; and that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Persons had their Passages granted, before he knew of the</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Order of Restraint; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expected their Declaration for his Vindication from that odious Calumny of Conniving, or underhand Favouring that</hi> Horrid Rebellion.</p>
            <p>But the King's Desire proved fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93088:85"/>
for they next moved to have Sir <hi>J. Byron</hi> turned out, from being Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Tower;</hi> and, at their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Sir <hi>J. Coniers</hi> Succeeded.</p>
            <p>They then proceeded to Name fit Persons, for Trust of the <hi>Militia,</hi> of the several Counties: And, by Act of Parliament, disabled all Clergy-Men from exercising Temporal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction: The <hi>Commons</hi> then drew up a Petition, for Vindicating their Five Members; wherein they desire the King to send them the Informers against the said Members; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to desert their Prosecution would not suffice; because the whole Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was concerned in the Charge. And then they proceeded to settle the <hi>Militia,</hi> for the defence of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>Tower,</hi> and City of <hi>London,</hi> under the Command of Maj. General <hi>Skipton,</hi> who had formerly been an experienced Soldier in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> The King had deferred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Answer to their Petition, for settling
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93088:86"/>
the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Counties, according to their nomination, till His Return from <hi>Dover;</hi> where He took leave of his Wife and Daughter; and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> from whence He sent to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> for his Two Eldest Sons to come to him; though contrary to the Mind of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who would have disswaded Him from it.</p>
            <p>The King being now at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> sends this Answer to the Petition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Militia; That he is willing to condescend to all the Proposals about the Militia of the Counties, and the Persons mentioned, but not of</hi> London, <hi>and other Corporations; whose Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that particular, he thought it neither Justice nor Policy to alter; but would not consent to divest Himself of the Power of the County</hi> Militia, <hi>for an indesinite Time, but for some limited Space.</hi> This Answer did not satisfie; so that the Breach growing every day wider, the King declined these Parts,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93088:86"/>
and the Parliament, and removed to <hi>Theobald</hi>'s; taking with Him, the Prince, and Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> He receives a Petition from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wherein they require the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> more resolutely than before; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, <hi>That in case of denial, the Eminent Dangers would constrain them to dispose of it by the Authority of</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; desiring also, <hi>That he would make his Abode near</hi> London, <hi>and the</hi> Parliament; <hi>and continue the</hi> Prince <hi>at some of his Houses near the City, for the better carrying on of Affairs, and preventing the Peoples Jealousies and Fears.</hi> All which being refused; They presently Order, <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be put into a posture of Defence, in such a way as was agreed upon by</hi> Parliament; <hi>and a Committee to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a publick Declaration from these Heads.</hi> 1. <hi>The Just Causes of the Fears and Jealousies given to the</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; <hi>at the same time clearing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93088:87"/>
themselves from any Jealousies concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against Himself.</hi> 2. <hi>To Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of all Matters arising from his Majesty's Message, and what was fit to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now began our Troubles, and all the Miseries of a Civil-War: The Parliament every day entertaining new Jealousies and Suspicions of the King's Actions; which, howsoever in Complement, they made shew of imputing only to his Evil Council; yet obliquely had too great a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his Person. They now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, on a suddain, to make great Preparations both by Sea and Land: And the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England,</hi> is commanded to Rig the King's Ships, and fit them for Sea: And likewise all Masters and Owners of Ships, were perswaded to do the like. The Beacons were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Sea-Marks set up, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Postings up and down with Pacquets; All sad Prognosticks of the Calamities ensuing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:93088:87"/>
               <hi>August</hi> 22. 1642. The King comes to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there Erects His <hi>Standard;</hi> to which, some Numbers resorted; but far short of what was Expected: And three Days after, the <hi>King</hi> sends a Message to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to propose a <hi>Treaty:</hi> The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers were, the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Dorset,</hi> Sir <hi>John Culpeper,</hi> and Sir <hi>W. Udal:</hi> None of which were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Set in the <hi>House,</hi> to deliver their Errand; therefore it was sent in by the Usher of the <hi>Black-Rod;</hi> to which the <hi>Parliament</hi> Answered: <hi>That until His Majesty shall recal His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and Declarations of</hi> Treason, <hi>against the Earl of</hi> Essex, <hi>and Them, and their Adherents: And unless the</hi> King's Standard, <hi>now Set up in pursuance thereof, be taken down, They cannot, by the Fundamental</hi> Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>give His Majesty another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> Replies, <hi>That He never intended to Declare the Parliament.</hi>

Traytors, <hi>or Set up his</hi> Standard <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; but if they Resolve to</hi> Treat, <hi>either Party shall Revoke their Declarations against all persons as</hi> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; <hi>and the same Day to take down his</hi> Standard.</p>
            <p>To this they Answer; <hi>That the Difference could not any ways be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, unless He would forsake his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Counsellors, and return to his</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And accordingly, <hi>September</hi> 6th, They Order and Declare, <hi>That the Armswhich they have, or shall take up for the</hi> Parliament, Religion, Laws, <hi>and</hi> Liberties <hi>of the</hi> Kingdom, <hi>shall not be laid down, until the</hi> King <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Protection from such Persons as are, or shall be Voted</hi> Delinquents, <hi>and shall leave them to Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The War being now begun, the New-raised Souldiers committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Outrages upon the Country-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> upon Complaint, endeavour to Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.

over his Own; His Captain-General was first, the Marquess of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and afterwards the Earl of <hi>Lindsey;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> for the <hi>Parliament:</hi> The <hi>King</hi>'s Forces recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the first Repulse at <hi>Hull,</hi> by Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Meldrum;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> takes up his Quarters at <hi>Shrewsbury: Portsmouth</hi> was next Surrendred to the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and presently after, Sir <hi>John Byron</hi> takes <hi>Worcester</hi> for the <hi>King:</hi> In <hi>September,</hi> the two Princes Palatines, <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> Arrived in <hi>England;</hi> who were presently Entertained, and put into Command by the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This uncivil <hi>Civil-War</hi> was carried on in General, with all the Ruines and Desolations imaginable; wherein all Bonds of <hi>Religion, Alliance,</hi> and <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> were utterly destroyed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Fathers and Children, Kindred and Acquaintances, became unnatural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to each other.

for near Four Years; <hi>viz.</hi> From <hi>August</hi> the 22d, 1642.

The War in <hi>England</hi> being now (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so much Blood-shed and Ruine) brought to some End; the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were at leisure to Dispute with the <hi>Scots,</hi> concerning the Keeping of the <hi>King;</hi> who fearing lest <hi>Fairfax</hi> should fall upon them, and compel them to Deliver Him up, Retreated further <hi>Northwards,</hi> towards <hi>New-Castle:</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> sent an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to come to <hi>London,</hi> with promise of Honour and Safety; but He did not think fit to venture.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Feb.</hi> the 8th, the <hi>King</hi> sets forward with the Commissioners for <hi>Holmby,</hi> and after a Fortnight, came to His Journeys-end; being met by the way by General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and many of his Officers.</p>
