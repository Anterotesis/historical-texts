            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He world must
forgive me my
trouble, and
perhaps its owne; if I
throw my selfe on censure
by this publicke Edition
<pb facs="tcp:55555:3"/>
of my private studie.
These observations are
history, such as surpris'd
me in the reading, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
least my memory should
betray me, I committed
to writing. They are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
accidents, and
therefore more powerfull
to arrest the eye, and
make the imagination
stand amaz'd at the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude
of time and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
And where can
Phylosophie finde such
<pb facs="tcp:55555:3"/>
sober precepts as out of
history? History, that
faithfull preserver of
things past, that great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer
of the present,
and certaine Prophet
of the future. By it wee
may discover the print
which former ages made,
and treading that, know
how to avoyd the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of errour and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
By it wee are
taught the value of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
things, by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
<pb facs="tcp:55555:4"/>
of the frailtie and
ruine of which wee are
elevated to the love of
the Eternall. For when
we reade the subversion
of Empires, and looke for
those great Princes who
commanded them, and
finde not so much dust
left of them, as may serve
the smallest wind to sport
with, what variety of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is not confounded?
What authority with
most famed Monarchs
<pb facs="tcp:55555:4"/>
can secure it selfe, to the
least complacence, when
the proud manreades the
folly of all those cunning
Arts which advance to
greatnesse, but never
could protect from ruin?
And who can looke
cloudie on his owne poore
fortune; when he findes
that the too much favour
of Princes, like the too
neere rayes of the Sunne,
tans them they shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Neither can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content

by the
weaknesse of her
Sexe, lost that Crowne she
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55555:7"/>
had title to in being sole
Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the
first. The ungratefull <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
opposing powre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
infirmitie; and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
that oath they had
sworne to her succession;
as if fealtie could not be
obleiged to woman: and
the more politick regards
had authority to dispence
with the more honest. Yet
did her son prevaile, and
Anchor'd in the Haven of
that Monarchie; from
which so various tempests
such broken tides, and so
many shelfs and rockes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55555:7"/>
had bar'd her. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Genius of this Nation
by a strange dotage on the
male heires, hath still bin
cruell to the female, when
they had a sonne able for
government. <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
like this great <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
not disputing the title
of a mother, when youth
and action rais'd him
to be acceptable to the
Kingdome: though in that
some contempt reflected
on her reverend weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
So little did the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of power regulate it
selfe by the streight rule
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55555:8"/>
of conscience.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> the second
disdain'd this disordered
voting in the people; who
were in danger as easily to
misplace Authority, if fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
should mis-leade them
to doate unlawfully: since
in how dangerous a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
an unwarrantable
president instructs poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie?
And with what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
difficultie the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
breakes all dutie, if
by an awfull hand not
kept to the most severe?
The libertie of such electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
having beene ever of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55555:8"/>
ruinous consequence to
that Nation which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
it.</p>
               <p>Among many gallant
sonnes to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
no dispute about
the choyce, he gave order
for coronation of his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
thereby to exempt
the people from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of an hereafter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage.
For since the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
entrance of his great
grand father, <hi>William</hi> the
Bastard, on the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England;</hi> passion
had disorder'd succession,
and no Prince but might
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55555:9"/>
challenge in his tyrannie, a
descent from the first usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
But King <hi>Henry</hi>
brought justice to the
throne, and making claime
to the Monarchie by a
streight line, with more
earnestnesse endeavour'd
to continue it to posterity.</p>
               <p>But when pollicie shoots
too farre, her arrowes fall
ever wide; for humane
judgement hath no sight
into the future, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
when it endeavours
beyond a lawful distance.
The wit of man delights
to finde eternitie in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55555:9"/>
and to build a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
edefice on a quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
For what Arts can
perpetuate Monarchie, and
how fraile a reede is all
our wisedome to support
an empire? This very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in King <hi>Henry</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
such folly, that his
friends were enforst to
pittie. For while in the
pompe of this Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he seem'd even to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
himselfe, and see his
eldest sonne succeed: which
happinesse no Prince here
had for long time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
A sudden Devill
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55555:10"/>
(for what els can we terme
ambition?) was rais'd,
which no exorcisme of a
parents awe had powre
to lay. For this new ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
created new passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the sonne having
equall title with the Father
disdain'd to want equall
greatnesse. Why should he
bee made a mockery of
Princes, and weare the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem
without the power?
why should he be thought
worthy the throne, and
not the Scepter? why
should his youth active to
great attempts, be frozen
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55555:10"/>
up by the cold advice of a
declining father? If it was
wisdom to raise him to so
eminent a degree; why wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
he justice to exercise it?
Vnlesse his father design'd
to make the most serious
act of government, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude
of mirth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Church into a stage
to represent the Comedie
more to the life. But though
this was intended onely
for a Pageant; yet did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoove
him in this first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to the world, to
shew himselfe farre above
the scorne or sport of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55555:11"/>
his enemies or
friends.</p>
               <p>This was whisper'd in his
eare, and the discourse
pleasing the vanitie of his
passion, soone wonne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
on his reason. For
with how little remorse is
the conscience perswaded
when the least apparence
of justice priviledgeth am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition?
what thoughts at
first he feard to trust his
heart with; by this advice
he enlarged to his tongue:
and from private discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he began open com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
so that hee tooke
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55555:11"/>
confidence to urge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to a resignation of
his Kingdome and other
Provinces, which with so
eminent a fame he hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
had govern'd. Nor
was a powerfull faction
wanting both in <hi>England</hi>
and abroad, who though
at the inward tribunall of
their judgement they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
so unnaturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
yet outwardly
did applaude the young
Kings most crooked
wayes: which easily
are made streight to opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
when they carry in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55555:12"/>
them matter to foment
hopes of innovation.</p>
               <p>The father endeavourd
by reason to calm this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
&amp; advis'd the son not
to anticipate vexation; for
how smoth a brow soever
Majestiepretended; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
aspect must needes
prove rugged. Since no
command is happie, if not
innocent. The least traine
of wicked pollicie under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the firmest edifice
of empire. That hereafter
when the Fathers death
shall prepare the passage
to the sons government,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55555:12"/>
the entry not being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
might bee happie
and carrying with it no
cloud of sinister practises,
might shine glorious. For
the present, he intreated
that patience which the
Divine Law commanded;
and all humane customes
had still observed. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he perswaded him to
tame his wild ambition:
ambition; which if natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
is a sickenesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
the body it posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
if infusive, a venome,
ministered by the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
against which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55555:13"/>
there is no antidote but
ruine.</p>
               <p>That his association in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdome, was not
prejudice the present au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Father, but
to confirme the greatnesse
of the sonne in future.
That it was high ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to retribute disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for so unexampled a
favour.</p>
               <p>But reason forc't by
strongest arguments was
to weak to prevaile against
those many Castles built
high in the ayre of his
vaine thoughts. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55555:13"/>
his desires batter'd by
his fathers just resolutions
when he expected no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance;
pride perswaded
him to seeke remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
and to force what
he could not intreate. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
therefore hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes
himselfe and all his
passions to King <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> whose daughter he
had married, but never
bedded: King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Father carefully providing
against the consummation
of those Nuptialls; least
his Sonne might by the
alliance increase in power
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55555:14"/>
and dependencies. But
this pollitick barre which
divided the young Princes
mature for love, created
rage in the young King,
disdaine in the Ladie, in
<hi>Lewis</hi> discontent, but in
Queene <hi>Aeleanor (Henry</hi> the
fathers wife) an impious
jealousie. For she who in
her youth had made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite
of her honour, and
in her lust (repugnant to
Christian Lawes) chose a
<hi>Sarazen</hi> for her Lover; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
this restraint of
the young Kings wife, to a
vicious designe in the old
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55555:14"/>
King and that all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
pretended were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the more artifice
and secrecie to secure the
fruition of his injurious
pleasures. And shee seem'd
to have ground for her
suspitions in the much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of his former life;
which seldome had in his
restraint condemn'd that
action dishonest, which
his blood prompted was
delightfull.</p>
               <p>This calumnie wrought
the old King into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
hard censure, and
brought compassion to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55555:15"/>
the young King, whose
injuries seem'd of that
qualitie as might autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
disobedience. So that
not onely <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
who as being a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
King, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernd
to foment that
discord: but even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the subjects to
the Crowne of <hi>England</hi>
prepared their Armes for
an unnaturall warre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
chiefe heads of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
at home, were the
Earles of <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester:</hi>
who to give their
King despaire of any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55555:15"/>
quiet, fortified their
Castles and other strong
holds, with so much Art
as if they design'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
mischiefe. And
what encouraged them to
danger, was, beside hopes
of greatnes in the change
of government; confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
with the King of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> by whose power
joyn'd to that of <hi>France,</hi>
they doubted not either
to advance their fortunes
by warre, or make an
honorable retreate by
peace. For when did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
subjects presume to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55555:16"/>
arme, without promise of
ayde from forraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
And when bad at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
with them proved
unsuccessefull; what stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
but disavowed all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand
darke intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence?
But the wonder
of this mischiefe was, that
<hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Geoffrey</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the young King
entred into this conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
as if the blood of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had not flowed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and the eminencie
of birth, had elevated them
above the Lawes of filiall
Dutie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55555:16"/>
To wrest justice to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quarrell, both betrayd
themselves: for infamie
and rage shot no arrow to
wound the others honour
but repercussively flew
backe. Even he who most
apparently proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
injured, being guilty:
and no man safe to fame,
who had best title to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
his enemie. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
had nature ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
them, that their
fortunes and honours
could admit no disunion:
and none could triumph,
but when part of him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55555:17"/>
was ruin'd.</p>
               <p>The Father amaz'd at
the irreligious quarrell;
forgot not neverthelesse,
that he was to maime him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
if he destroy'd his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie:
and therefore by
most loving addresses
courted his Sonnes to
more peacefull thoughts.
He urged them to returne
to dutie, with confidence
that he retain'd a mercie
greater than their errour.
That their demand should
end in no deniall, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that Reason gave it
moderation; and that they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55555:17"/>
would not chide with
time, which yet enlarged
their father life That from
their best confederates
they could expect nothing
but the breach of faith:
and who could bee more
interessed to advance their
businesse than a father? All
other allies onely dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
friendship to entrap
their youth: and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
this discord to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
all the Ligaments of
our Empire, and purchase
safety at the cost of our
ruine.</p>
               <p>But no perswasion could
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55555:18"/>
humble the young Kings
desires, his cause now ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by a generall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and his Armie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creast
by an universall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.
For into conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of mischiefe, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
are men drawne, who
value the justice of the
quarrell at the rate of their
owne profit?</p>
               <p>All the territories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Crowne
of <hi>England</hi> were now on
fire: the King of <hi>France</hi>
with the unnaturall sons
wasting <hi>Normandie</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55555:18"/>
                  <hi>Aquitain;</hi> the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with the disloyall
Lords destroying <hi>England.</hi>
In the meanetime, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
people were offer'd
a victim to both their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and the honest labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
forc't to the sweate of
warre, to obey the passions
of those Lords, whose
quarrell hee understood
not. So cruell is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the vulgar, that
they can make no just
account of their owne
lives or states, when Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are pleas'd to follow
the disorder of their rage.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55555:19"/>
For at the expence of the
common blood highest
discords are maintain'd;
and at their losse chiefely
the ambition of the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is purchast.</p>
               <p>Victory at length
brought the old King to
the Majestie of a Father:
and the young King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to obedience, when
by overthrow of the King
of <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
he found his faction
weakned. For adversitie
hath a more powerfull
Oratory, than all the wit
of Pietie, to perswade the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55555:19"/>
proud from their usurped
height. And seldome can
we stoope to confesse our
frailty, till compel'd by
some accidentall weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But the Father had
his armes open, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Sonne would
throw himselfe into his
embraces; never wanting
affection to entertaine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
And concord was
thus restored: when the
Sonne perceiv'd his inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
longer to continue
impious; and the father
found that his revenge
would be most cruell to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55555:20"/>
his owne Nature. The
young King was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
his marriage
with the Daughter of
<hi>France</hi> (for in all tragedies
the amorous businesse
acts a part) with an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
great as the dignity
he wore, but no Soveraign
power. For the Father
gain'd by this treatie from
his Sonne, the liberty to
live a King.</p>
               <p>All discor'd by this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
appear'd rooted
up, when indeede nothing
but the branches were cut
downe: For no free deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55555:20"/>
of all the prisoners ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the late battle, and
fully re-invested in their
greatnesse: no over liberall
allowance, no solemne
protestations of a Father
could winne authoritie
with the Sonne. New dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts
on the least grounds
were built, by his owne
unquiet spirit, and the
suggestions of cunning
instruments. For he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that absolute power
his title challeng'd: from
which he was debar'd by
his fathers life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
they who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55555:21"/>
heard to his disobedience
expected recompence for
mischeife: and hee unable
to pay them for their
sinnes, rewarded their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
with discontent.
His disease of minde was
incapable of cure: for no
Phificke without the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Fathers vitall
blood could minister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe;
&amp; that the old King
preserved against all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise:
And to a resignation
of Empire, no Argument
could perswade him; not
willing to encoffin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in a Church soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55555:21"/>
till death enforc't
him.</p>
               <p>At length unquiet
thoughts destroy'd the
young King who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to live and not to
raigne: and since he could
be onely the mockery of
his owne title, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
not to bee at all. For
while with his brother
<hi>Geoffrey</hi> he was in armes
against his Father, and
found no successe to his
designes: a violent fever
with a flux seiz'd, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisht
him he was to
dye: which he entertain'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55555:22"/>
with little horrour, till at
last the conscience of his
many crimes frighted him
with apprehension of that
world he was suddenly to
travaile to. The racke
which put his soule to the
extreamest torture was the
injurie hee had contriv'd
against his father: which
hee redeem'd by humble
penitence: for the old
King sent his signer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he durst not trust his
person: and assured his
sonne a pardon; which
gave courage to his death
and made him with lesse
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55555:22"/>
trouble resolve for his last
account. Having by his
preposterous association
into the Soveraigne title,
created to his father dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
and repentance, and
to himselfe onely enlarg'd
the shadow.</p>

fortune unavvares to his
endeavours, having leade
him to a secret cave,
vvherein foolish Avarice,
or feare of some sudden
surprise had buried vast
treasures.</p>
               <p>This severe pursute
thrust the distracted Lord
into severall passions,
vvhich councel'd him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to foregoe his allei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance

and knovving hovv safe
even innocence and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
are against the assault

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55555:25"/>
                  <hi>Limosin</hi> (a Country which
owed to King <hi>Richard</hi> no
obedience but what his just
title and sharpe sword did
force) and in the strongest
towne there hee inclosed
himselfe, and the purchase
of that treasure which
created him so many
feares and so little safety.
By the communication of
his gold, he brought the
townesmen into associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his danger: for
where they are interested
in a regard to profit; what
tye hath fealtie upon the

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55555:25"/>
is a life esteem'd, when
money (that supreame fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
of fooles) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd?</p>
               <p>The King disdained thus
to be opposed, threatning
ruine and devastation to
that place, which could
so easily sell its homage;
and in the heate of rage
and power he assaulted it,
ventring for a poore bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and his principalities
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> For
if his life miscarried in the

him to Empire, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
children despair'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to survive in that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary

did passion take advice of
truth? Or when powerfull
Avarice inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
what reason could
give a bound to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe?</p>
               <p>But the Towne resolv'd
to oppose: since no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
could bring more
desolation, than to yeeld
to that passion which hath
no affinitie with mercie.
And while the King when
violence receiv'd repulse,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55555:26"/>
labourd by Art to master
the place, an envenomed
Arrow, shot by a reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

wound being drest by a
rude unskilfull Surgeon,
made the anguish insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to any man
whom rage arm'd not
with a new kinde of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
For neglecting all
complaint, he so seriously
used his wit and courage
to prosecute his designe;
that within twelve dayes
he brought the towne to
yeeld to mercie: Where
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55555:27"/>
after narrow search, hee
found the treasure hee so
vainely followed, a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vision that misled him
to his ruin.</p>
               <p>This conquest finisht
he began to acknowledge
he was but man: for death
commanded him away,
and hee obeyd the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
Then hee found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
law to over-rule
his spirits, and being to
appeale from the severity
of the eternall Iustice, hee
laboured in himselfe to
practise mercie. And in
this short intervall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55555:27"/>
the glorious
thoughts of life, and his
last houre, hee left his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
an example to the most
religious, as his valour had
beene an envie in the most
ambitious. For when the
Paracide, in a pride of the
high mischiefe hee had
committed, refused to lay
fault on errour: but impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
aver'd hee did that
great sinne to revenge his
Father and two brothers
slaughtered by the King:
the King forgave him
with so much pietie, that
hee rewarded even the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55555:28"/>
Executioner: and conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his servants that this
unhappie man might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the comfort of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and survive a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phee
of so eminent a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
But this pious Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had no obedient
Executors; the King no
longer obey'd than he had
liberty from death to
command. For justice then
unsheath'd her sword,
and least the example of
too much favour might
afterward become an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie,
the Paracide was
fleade and hang'd upon a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55555:28"/>

of his punishment
more effectually expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his owne treason and
the Kings mercie.</p>
               <p>Before this holy Prince
parted with his life, by
much penitence he parted
with his sins. For highest
courages fall lowest when
overcome by supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
grace. And how vast
a progresse toward heaven
can a soule so illuminated
make even in a moment?
For the immence bountie

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55555:29"/>

               <p>His testament beares e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to posteritie, that
his minde was no way da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel'd
looking downe on

precipice of Empire. For
discreetly he made distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of his command

Kingdome, neglecting
the weaker yeares of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi>
and having more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the peoples safety
than the right of blood:
To his Nephew (though
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55555:29"/>
then Emperor, he left one
part of his treasure, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his servants; and
the third to the poore,
whom the wealthy never
thinke their friends till
death.</p>
               <p>His bodie hee disposed
too, though corruption
still challengeth that lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and commanded it at
<hi>Fonteverard</hi> to be layd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
at his fathers feete,
that even after death hee
might crave him pardon
whom in life hee had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
offended: To
<hi>Roane</hi> in testimony of his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55555:30"/>
love, hee gave his heart;
that great undaunted
heart, which being more
valiant than that of man,
and the heavenly spirits
wanting proportion for
the comparison was forc't
to permit it selfe to bee
call'd a Lyons heart. But
his entrailes he bequeath'd
to Poeters: to obrey'd it

designe to secure his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
by treatie with an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55555:32"/>
Infidell, whom necessitie
could onely make religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and whom want of
power could onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a friend.</p>
               <p>This consideration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<hi>Iulian</hi> the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,
and agent for other
Christian Princes in this
cause, to perswade <hi>Vladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaus</hi>
to repent his former
peace; and to settle his
Conscience without scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to prosecute the war.
For what Religion could
obleige him to preserve
an oath of faith, with him
who onely endeavour'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55555:33"/>
by pretence of fidelity to
entrap him? Or why
should a nice pietie hinder
the growth of Religion?
Or to what purpose
should only one party be
obleig'd, when experience
instructed him that the
<hi>Turke</hi> never swore but to
tye the Christian and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
himselfe? But now
was it more than ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
to have peace, when
all men concur'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
a warre so holy:
where victory was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Religion, and
even to be overcome the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55555:33"/>
highest triumph of the
soule, since it assured a
Martyrdome.</p>
               <p>And beside the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of heaven, whose
cause they fought, and
whose souldiers they were;
all polliticke regards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
to assertaine the
ruine of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre:
which not to doe
upon the too tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a league, was an
injurious pietie, which
onely merited reproach
for a reward. For <hi>Iohn
Paleologus</hi> Emperour of
the East, was then prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55555:34"/>
with mighty Forces,
and protested that in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to the Christian
cause, hee had refused by
making peace to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
his owne safety. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Princes likewise of the
<hi>Turkes</hi> invited the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
to this warre; desirous
rather to abate the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne
Empire of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi>
then to continue the
splendor of their Sect
with danger to their state.
For religion hath but a
slender tye upon that
soule, which is over-ruled
by ambition or private
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55555:34"/>
interest. And where main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of command
was concern'd; what
wonder if <hi>Mahometans</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
the Christians,
common enemies of their
law into association?
Moreover all the States of
<hi>Italy</hi> had prepared for the
present warre, sending
their fleete into the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont</hi>
to joyn with the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Emperour, that the
<hi>Turke</hi> on both sides assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
might in neither
meete with any thing but
ruine.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Amurath</hi> himselfe;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55555:35"/>
age and evill fortune had
throwne him into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
and that confin'd
him to a solitude: where
in an impious pietie with
certaine Monkes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeite
base coyne of the
right Christian stampe,
he tyred his time away,
and expected an ugly
death. The whole govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that usurped Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
now by resignation
of the Father under <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
but fifteene yeares of
age, fitter for a Schoole
and obedience to Tutors
than the manage of warre
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55555:35"/>
against as able Souldiers
as the most warlike age e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
boasted.</p>
               <p>But these regards onely
look'd on pollicie; that
which made the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
free from obligation
to preserve this league Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
was a former made
with the Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.
With whom to
breake faith, was Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious;
and to maintaine
it with an Infidell, sinfull
and ruinous. Vnlawfull
oathes being vicious in
the making, but far more
in the performance. Hee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55555:36"/>
who sweares the burning
of an Altar commits a
crime: but his absolution
comes farre easier if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
make him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
then if obstinacie
render him sacrilegious.</p>
               <p>Easily was the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>Vladislaus</hi> untyed
from his former league:
the appetite of glory and
extent of Empire often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
taking as soone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all scruple from the
soule, as the most sober
resolution of Divines.
For <hi>Huniades</hi> (upon whose
valour and fortune the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55555:36"/>
successe of the warre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended)
had promise of
the Kingdome of <hi>Bulgaria:</hi>
and who not miraculously
awed by vertue, will not
endanger to bee but a bad
Christian to become a
powerfull Monarch? The
<hi>Despot</hi> of <hi>Servia</hi> had his
hopes too, of a more setled
principalitie, and some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of power; and that
made his Religion which
never much troubled his
preferment; dispence with
an oath, himselfe had
beene the chiefe actor to
worke <hi>Vladislaus</hi> to. But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55555:37"/>
above all <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> that
miracle of true and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
courage animated to
this warre: promising to
bring 30000. Souldiers
both for strength of body
and observation of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
excelling the most
famed of Europe.</p>
               <p>This joynt power, in so
much security of <hi>Amurath</hi>
precipitated <hi>Vladislaus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
warre, which he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with as much good
order and secrecie, as a
businesse so generall could
admit. For first present
notice was given to the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55555:37"/>
                  <hi>Italian</hi> fleete now in the
<hi>Helespont,</hi> that it should no
way retire upon any ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of peace. Then was
it mutually agreed that
<hi>Scanderbeg</hi> should at an
appointed day meete in <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
and there both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
joyne in the common
cause.</p>
               <p>The season of the yeare
might have deter'd any
man, from this attempt in
the depth of winter. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King was
come into <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and
had numbred his men;
<hi>Dracula Vayvod</hi> of <hi>Valachia</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:55555:38"/>
disswaded any farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
into that Country,
<hi>Scanderbeg</hi> not yet come
with his Forces, being in
command of an enemie,
who used often to Hauke,
with a retinue more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
than his Armie. But
ambition and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grounded on former
good successe, deafen'd
him to sober councell: so
that he went on as if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
had beene tyed by
miracle still to come
downe to his succour,
Which obstinacie when
<hi>Dracula</hi> perceiv'd he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55555:38"/>
the King with two
lustie young men to bee
his guides through the
Country, and two swift
horses to serve him for
flight upon the worst of
fortune: desiring his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
since contrary to his
long experience hee vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
was carried into so
inevitable a danger, that he
would accept that gift
which might bee of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
if that happen'd,
the very thought whereof
he trembled at: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he prayd that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
might prove to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55555:39"/>
to vaine, whereby his
prayers would appeare to
have taken effect.</p>
               <p>But no ill aboding lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
abated his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
and Religion which
before deter'd, now gave
courage: for what at first
was held a resolution
doubtfull to Conscience,
became from dispensable
to be lawfull, and in fine
meritorious. So uncertaine
is the judgement of man;
that frequently those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
which carry the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of sinne at the
first sight, become by long
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55555:39"/>
acquaintance of the eye,
amiable, and win upon us
by the apparencie of vertue.
Mistake either deluding
in the first encounter; or
errour betraying upon a
long discourse. For pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of sinne begets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and when pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
wants swiftnesse
in the execution, it loseth
by little and little upon
the beleefe.</p>
               <p>The noyse of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
weaken'd <hi>Amurath</hi>
out of his devout dreame;
and fearing his enemie
might force him to that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55555:40"/>
solitude, hee voluntarily
had undertooke, againe
he entred upon the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Which hee
found running into disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by the weake age of
<hi>Mahomet;</hi> no just title or
hopefull youth creating
authority to that Prince,
who wants vertue to
make his subjects beleeve
him their superiour. <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi>
suddenly gathered in
<hi>Asia</hi> a vast power, and
presently marcheth to
transport it into Europe.
Two parts of the world
being brought together
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55555:40"/>
to decide the great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
betweene these two
Princes. But the <hi>Hellespont</hi>
was stopt by the <hi>Popes</hi> and
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies; and
the distracted <hi>Turke</hi> began
to feare his command was
to be imprisoned in the
third part of the then
knowne earth. To enlarge
himselfe he marcht by the
sea side up the <hi>Streights</hi>
of <hi>Bosphorus;</hi> where hee
found the Marchant ships
of <hi>Genoway,</hi> ready to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke
with him: who
transported his Armie,
selling Europe for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55555:41"/>
thousand Duckets.
Though some lay this
crime to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who
were possest of the strong
holds upon the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi>
and whose faith the <hi>Turks</hi>
gold corrupted so farre,
that in the event every
man became a Traytor to
himselfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkish</hi> Armie past
the <hi>Streights,</hi> the King of
<hi>Hungary</hi> began to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
danger and intreate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Those violent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
who disdain'd the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
a farre off, approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
now somewhat
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55555:41"/>
neere, too much over-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
him. Passion, like
some <hi>Opticke</hi> glasse, that
presents a man at one end
a Pigmie, at the other a
Gyant, never faithfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
They who with most
swiftnesse had ranne thus
farre, wanted not now the
same motion to carry
them backe. And the King
though hee never fail'd in
courage, was not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have provided for
his safety, with some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his honour. But
the brave <hi>Huniades</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55555:42"/>
and let him know that
the number of the <hi>Turke</hi>
was over-macht by the
courage of the Christian;
and that the Almighty,
who disposeth victory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in so just a cause
to appropriate the honour
of the day to his owne
power. That the happie
course of their attempts
hitherto had instructed
them, how feeble that
enemie is, and how weak
arm'd, who brings to the
battle the inward horrour
of a wicked conscience
That they with whom
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55555:42"/>
now the conflict was to
bee, were no other but
those effoeminate slaves,
who had yeelded to the
<hi>Hungarians</hi> still matter of
triumph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vladislaus</hi> was not unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to be perswaded to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and when he perceiv'd
there was no retreate but
must suffer the scandall of
flight, hee resolv'd his life
to want weight, if put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the scale with honour.
He left therefore the order
of the battle to <hi>Huniades;</hi>
who to frustrate the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
the <hi>Turkes</hi> had in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55555:43"/>
number order'd his Army
so that on side was a
marsh, on the other the
Carriages, and at the back
a steepe hill. Thus out of
danger to be encompassed
by the multitude of his
enemie he entertain'd the
battle; and perform'd so
well the part of a great
Commander, that the
<hi>Turkes</hi> began to despaire
and the Christians to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
of victory: when old
<hi>Amurath</hi> seeing his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ready to flye, and by
the example of former
overthrowes misdoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55555:43"/>
the present fight,
pull'd out of his bosome
the League of late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into, and solemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sworne by <hi>Vladislaus,</hi>
and holding it in his hand
with his eye fixt upon the
Crucifixe (which the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Christians bore
for their ensigne) cryed
out to Christ to revenge
the perjurie of his people,
who vvithout just cause
had violated the faith they
in his name had given, and
to shevv himselfe a God
novv his honour vvas
concern'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55555:44"/>
The prosperitie that so
flatter'd the Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
through the disorder
of the Clergie men, and
over confidence of the
zealous souldier on the
suddaine to change and
the King engaged by too
much courage among the
thickest of the <hi>Ianizares</hi>
vvas slaine, aud vvith him
the glory of the day fell
to the enemie. For his

have dravvne revenge
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55555:44"/>
from so barbarous an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
lost all courage: As
if Religion to God had
not equally animated
them, with the zeale they
owed the Prince. But
there is a strange kinde of
more than humane vertue
in the presence of a King,
who as the soule quickens
the body of an Armie;
which if he miscarries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an unactive dead
lumpe. A King whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is vitall heate to the
loyall but lightning to the
Rebellious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Huniades</hi> by flight reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

there lesse wounded by
the enemies cymiters than
the reproaches of the
Christians, who obrayded
him to have perswaded
with breach of league; to
enter into this fatall war.
Which had it ended in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
the world would
have said that Christ dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to regulate successe
according to the vaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation

impressions of Religion.
But he soone assured the
world that his blood by

                  <hi>Constantine,</hi> having no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and therefore no
friends; sought by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to the Princes of
the West, to move them
by Religious compassion
to participate his dangers.
But they had their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells
at home, hopes to
encroach upon their
Neighbours territory: Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losie
of anothers growing
power: Subjects not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
regulated to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and other small ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
begot a ruinous neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the common cause.
With much solicitation
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55555:50"/>
the Pope, the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and the state of <hi>Venice</hi>
condiscended to furnish
out thirtie Gallies in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that place, for
which what Christian
should not blush, not to
have hazarded a life? But
this assistance was no
more remedie than treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
comfort of a Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to a patient past all
cure: For it onely serv'd
to please the imagination
of the wretched Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
who like a man now
drowning was willing to
catch at every smallest
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55555:51"/>
hold. For this ayde, which
could not have beene of
strength to resist such an
opposition, fail'd him
too.</p>
               <p>But what title had the
<hi>Graecians</hi> to complaine the
neglect of strangers, who
were so cruell to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
In the publicke
danger, every man threw
the care of his safetie on
his Prince, yet tax'd his
want of providence;
grumbled against his smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
impositions; and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
supply when instructed
in their perills: no man
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55555:51"/>
conceiving himselfe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed
to support the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Empire, though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to be over-whelm'd
by it. If declaration were
made of <hi>Turkish</hi> Forces
levied, it was presently sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a state bug-beare to
surprize the people with
unnecessary feares. If the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
took the field, the
Emperour was calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of underhand confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies.
If upon undeniable
appearence of invasion,
contribution for defence
was required; the over po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickes
whisper'd it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55555:52"/>
but a State-ambush
to seize unawares without
Legall Order, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Empire. Thus
when a Kingdomes sinnes
have procured an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
desolation by the just
sentence of the eternall
Iudge: the delinquent is
blinded by his vices, and
becomes his owne execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</p>
               <p>Already vvas <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
Master of one of ther ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the vvater paying
him tribute. For before
he layd siege to the Citie
he built such strengths
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55555:52"/>
upon the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphorus,</hi>
that the rich tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Caffa</hi> and other
Ports upon the <hi>Euxin</hi> sea
was interdixted. So that
the Empire acknowledg'd
a maime, the Merchant
disabled to furnish the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
with the former
customes. And the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Turke,</hi> grew wealthy
by frequent surprize of
such vessells, which to
their owne repentance
and ruine continued traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.
For what dangers
threatned by a remorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
enemie, and a more
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55555:53"/>
cruell sea can deterre the
covetous?</p>
               <p>The enemie drawing
neere the Citie, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in haste made levie of
what Forces hee could in
so short a time and so
great a danger. Sixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Graecians</hi> he prest, in
whom he hoped the sence
of liberty would quicken
the sence of honour: and
three thousand <hi>Venetians,
Genowayes,</hi> and other of
Europe he entertain'd; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choyce of <hi>Iustinianus</hi>
an adventurer of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
(who with two tall ships
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55555:53"/>
man'd with foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Souldiers, having
scowred the Seas by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
came to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</hi>
to be Generall of all
the Forces destin'd for the
last defence of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>And certainely while
the least probabilitie of
successe gave life to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
no man perform'd
more acts of great directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and admirable resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But when fortune
absolutely forsooke the
Citie; he forgot his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and gave proofe to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55555:54"/>
the World, that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
vetue can long
triumph over ruine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
by heaven miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
supported.</p>
               <p>For while there was
any sparke glowing of the
ancient Roman fire, with
which the Citie first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the glory of the East;
<hi>Iustinius</hi> made victory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
from the vast <hi>Turkish</hi>
multitude to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
strong onely in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that cause they
were to fight. So farre did
courage despise number,
that <hi>Mahomet</hi> enter'd into
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55555:54"/>
sober councell, whether
the attempt might not
end in losse: and the
chiefe <hi>Bassa</hi> perswaded
safetie in a retreate, by the
example of his great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genenitors.
But emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the inferiour <hi>Bassas</hi>
urged young <hi>Mahomet</hi> to
danger, to which the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of a proud nature
violently forced him. As
if heaven had forsooke the
defence of whatever place,
the lust of his pride had
desire to violate.</p>
               <p>And indeede such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
at that time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper'd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55555:55"/>
mischiefe that the
Earth appear'd aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
to his tyrannie. For
when the vast labour of
this seige threatned the
<hi>Turkes</hi> to expire in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Assailants:
the Haven keeping one
side of the Citie secure
from ruine, and open to
releefe, in regard a strong
chaine, and many great
shippesbarr'd the enemies
fleete all admittance. A
Christian, wittie to invent
highest treason against
that Majestie his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessision
obleig'd him
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55555:55"/>
to observe, instructed
the <hi>Turke</hi> upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
engines, by Land,
to conveigh his Navie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Port of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
Which passage opposite
both to Nature and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
extended first to the
terrour, then to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the poore defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.
Who perceiving
the Earth made Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the enemies ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to saile upon dry land;
became astonisht and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their courages to
the miracle of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
which triumpht o're
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55555:56"/>
the Elements.</p>
               <p>Yet in the hourely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of death, the
wretched inhabitants of
the Citie, omitted not the
trades of life: and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
readie even to make
prey of all their substance;
the Merchant busied his
thoughts in continuance
of his bargaines, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
the smallest
gaine: the builder rais'd
up his glorious piles, as if
not threatned to bee his
monument; and the rich
man reckon'd upon the
unnaturall generation of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55555:56"/>
his monies, as if no inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
theefe endanger'd the
principall. For though
the Emperour fearing so
fierce a warre from the
most formidable Prince
of the earth, labour'd to
make his peace with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by prayers and fasts,
and all those humble acts
to which ancient pietie
instructs us; yet no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
devotion could
expiate the vices of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencious
Citie, some fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeving it a point of
valour to dare, in so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a danger to be vicious:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55555:57"/>
As if there were a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize
so abject, as that
captivates the minde to
sinne.</p>
               <p>While any hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd,
the Emperour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to give his courage
over to despaire: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
the tradesman to
forsake unseasonable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to worke his owne
defence: who fullenly
made answere, that it was
to no purpose to fight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the walls, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to starve in his
house. And the Corne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
upon a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55555:57"/>
for want of bread,
brought their graine in to
the Emperour to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
indifferently among
the people, with so averse
a minde, as if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
it onely to supply
the enemie, when at his
entrance into the Towne,
they were to be enroul'd
his slaves. But the private
wealth of the inhabitants
was on no conditions to
be borrowed in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
cause, every man desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to admit the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
insolencies of a new
government; rather than
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55555:58"/>
to part with that treasure,
which they were shortly
for ever to forseite, and
which then well order'd
might have prevented so
famed a desolation. But
the Emperour at so sad a
necessitie, for got the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Religion, and
made bold with the
wealth of Churches, to
pay the Christian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
least it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated
to a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
abuse.</p>
               <p>But no endevours could
support an Empire ruin'd
by the battery of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerfull
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55555:58"/>
enemie, and
undermin'd by its owne
vices. For the <hi>Turke</hi> made
frequent breaches, and
gain'd even when repulst
with losse: for if the
slaughter of five <hi>Turkes</hi>
procured the death of one
Christian (considering the
inequalitie of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
yet had the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
justice to complaine.
For his men lost were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable;
whereas the
Infidell (as <hi>Cadmus</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled)
seem'd to have sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the dragons teeth upon
any repulse, new armed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55555:59"/>
men growing up out of
the earth in his defence.</p>
               <p>Frequent assaults on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
side brought the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to hope no honour but
in ruine: for to servive
it selfe and become the
seate of blasphemie; were
to resemble the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a soul in hell,
&amp; grow more miserable
than not to be: That sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
far more horrid
than to suffer the labourer
to plough up the rubbish
of the most envied Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But this happinesse
was denyed, a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55555:59"/>
in vice prepared
the way to the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
impietie, that ever
swayd the world. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
like a ship overcome
by tempests. yeelded at
length to a Sea of enemies
which enter'd through the
breaches, and suncke it
for ever. In one of which
<hi>Iustinianus</hi> having receiv'd
a wound, lost his spirit;
and by flight endeavour'd
a poore reprieve of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
life: for who that
was interess'd in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
could out-live that
siege and retaine his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:55555:60"/>
                  <hi>Constantine</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Helena,</hi> allied in name and
title, but not in fortune to
the first <hi>Constantine</hi>) in the
throng of those who yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the violence of the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Armie, perisht; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguisht
among eight
hundred, who pressing
for life became their owne
murderers. But the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
scrutinie of the <hi>Turke</hi>
and his owne ill fate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
him even the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of being unknown:
so that as his life was more
eminent his death had
greater ignominie. For
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55555:60"/>
having that day his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
habit on; it onely
serv'd to obrey'd his ruin,
and sequester him for
more scorne from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
His head they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sever'd from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to make a common
reproach of what had
beene so awfull in its dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.
And in the crueltie
of that mirth, all hope
and courage of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
perisht. The Citie
three dayes lay prostitute
to the licence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours:
who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to invent new mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55555:61"/>
to please their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
wantonnesse. And
well might they congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
the fortunes of their
victories; for never did so
much treasure become a
prey to so much rapine:
and never did such ancient
greatnesse fall to so low a
slavery; honour became a
contumely, former wealth
serv'd onely to aggravate
future poverty: and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
farre more cruell than

payment of that
portion <hi>Lewys</hi> design'd
him with his sister. Every
inferiour Lord likewise
had discontent enough to
warrant to his passions
the most unjust attempt.
For <hi>Lewys</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had
beene so ill a husband of
opinion, that the world
gave small reputation to
his carriage: and having
at his entrance to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

supplanted all
the Officers of the Crown,
and in their places planted
those whom his favour
had selected, the better
part of <hi>France,</hi> envied or
contemn'd his choyce.
For the ancient dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
by this remove were
weakned; and they who
subsisted high in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
imagin'd no death so
wretched as this privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Disgrace therefore
made them resolve on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
which since no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to buy with danger. For
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55555:64"/>
the Royall favour could
smile on no man, but
whom the whole world
beside disdain'd as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the least regard.
What misled the people
to tumult, was a pretence
to releeve the many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which lay hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
on the merchants
trade, and the labourers
sweat. But when the silly
vulgar by mutanie endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd

               <p>King <hi>Lewys</hi> perceiving
this storme with so much

the very morning of his

first to oppose it; and in
some small encounters
shewed himselfe no way
defective in courage:
however his much wit
with so much caution o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled
the motions of
his spirit, that posterity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55555:65"/>
hath brought his valour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
question. But being to
make head against so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a power, he found his
people as slow to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes
defence, as they
were rash to unlawfull
Armes. Every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
his interest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to subvert that edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of power, which hee
suspected to bee built on
tyrannie. Which perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all degrees of men to
runne into this warre,
though the hazard was of
the whole estate, for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the immunitie of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55555:65"/>
the least part of every

               <p>
                  <hi>Lewys</hi> finding this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
so universall, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into distrust of his
owne forces: fearing
them, who had the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
tye of Dutie, to have
the weakest tye of Love.
And where affection
Armes not the Souldier,
how unsafe is the greatest
Generall, in the best or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Armie? For dis-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Commander
disorders suddenly the

poorely he betrayes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55555:66"/>
who hopes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his designes by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?
<hi>Lewys</hi> therefore flies
from his Native subjects
to <hi>Auxiliaries;</hi> and to teach
<hi>France</hi> obedience, brings
in Forces from <hi>Italy.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Millain</hi> liberally
concurres to this Service,
sending five hundred men
at Armes and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
foote under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Galeas</hi> his sonne.
And with this power he
presents his advice, <hi>That
he should yeeld to any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to divide his enemies, and
be carefull still to preserve his
men.</hi>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:55555:66"/>
This Councell was of
more service to <hi>Lewys</hi> his
affaires, than all the Armies
he could have levied in his
Dutchy. For by this hee
kept his Majestie entire,
and refer'd nothing to the
uncertainetie of fortune.
He spared the effusion of
his subjects blood: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his people were not in
danger by their losses to
hate that Soveraigne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

the former part of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was a stronger bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
against the enemies
designe, than all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55555:67"/>
of that age could
make. For to divide their
Forces was to destroy
them, and to bring them
into jealousie of each other
was to make each the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
executioner: By
which hee was secure at
the enemies cost and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
to worke his owne
triumph. Then for yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to conditions, it was
safer in <hi>Lewys</hi> to descend
one steppe beneath Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
command, than to
be enforc't to fall downe
all the staires. And having
both wit and courage hee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55555:67"/>
could not doubt but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
would present him
with a meane to recover,
if not to transcend his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
height.</p>
               <p>Varietie of chances
brings soone both Armies
to desire to remit nothing
to chance, and the warre
having made both losers,
peace was equally sought.
And though want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls
extreamely affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the <hi>Burgonion</hi> Armie;
yet did <hi>Lewys</hi> not dare to
take the advantage: the
rage of hunger being
sometime an animation
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55555:68"/>
though for the most it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages.
<hi>Lewys</hi> therefore
having had no great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
at the hazard of war;
desired to change his game
and try how he could play
his cards in peace: where
the cunning gamester is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
at a long sitting to be
the winner. And therefore
upon the first overture en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines
the treatie, which
suddainely tooke effect;
No demand of the Princes
receiving the least deniall.
But at the conclusion of
this peace, what was at
first pretended, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55555:68"/>
mention'd: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom hope of ease of
taxes had engaged to this
warre, being no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
For they were
the same wretched vessell
still, whom every tempest
moves to danger, but no
calme ever secures from
wracke.</p>
               <p>To his brother he grants
the Dutchy of <hi>Normandie,</hi>
a proportion beyond his
very hopes. To <hi>Charles</hi>
Earle of <hi>Charolois</hi> hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
all the Townes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Some.</hi> To the Duke
of <hi>Brittaine</hi> hee confirmes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55555:69"/>
the Countie of <hi>Mountfort,</hi>
with promise of money to
defray the charges of his
enmitie. On the Count S.
<hi>Pol</hi> for having beene the
great engine in moving
these disorders, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
the Office of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable.
To the Duke of <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi>
he promiseth men and
mony for the recovery of
his Kingdome of <hi>Naples;</hi>
so desirous he was at any
rate to buy his absence.
To the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi>
he gives assurance for the
portion due to him in
marriage with his sister.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55555:69"/>
And to every great man
who had beene in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
hee contributes
largely: since the event of
warre might have beene
uncertaine to make asure
bargaine by this Treatie
of peace.</p>
               <p>Thus at <hi>Lewys</hi> his cost,
every discontented Lord
attain'd his aime, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpht
in the fortune of
his designe. And so farre
was this agreement the
ambition of both parties,
that when the Earle of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolois</hi>
allured by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of <hi>Lewys</hi> his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55555:70"/>
Language, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
into his power, and
the <hi>Burgonion</hi> Armie gave
their Generall lost, <hi>Lewys</hi>
return'd him backe with
all the ceremonie of love;
disdaining an advantage
that might suffer the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of trechery.</p>
               <p>Actions of so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
a vertue strangely
conduce to the fortune of
a Prince: for they create
him high in reputation;
which keepes Soveraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
entire; and beget con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to his after procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
which whether
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55555:70"/>
just or unjust are by that
successefull. For as to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
men faith is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
so to the polliticke
the practise of it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
For how can any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
prove fortunate,
when the contriver is held
in distrust? Pyrates and
Politicians, as common
enemies to mankinde, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the selfe-same
jealousie: no man embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his fortunes with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but whom desper ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
forceth, or libertie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</p>
               <p>This accord changed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55555:71"/>
the face of <hi>France;</hi> the
brow smooth with joy
and acclamations, which
had bin wrinckled with so
many troubled thoughts.
Every man retreates to his
private entertainements:
and discor'd no longer ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
them, they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their businesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to particular interest.
<hi>Charolois</hi> returnes home,
&amp; findes employment for
those passions the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
never want. He takes
possession of the townes
assign'd him, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
in recovery of a
small Country, whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55555:71"/>
pride, the world
wanted extent to limit.
Yet did he carry still a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
eye over his great
enemie, knowing that
mighty spirits over-ruled
by ill fortune, disdaine that
humility they are forc't to.
And though conveniency
or necessitie bend them
down to low conditions;
it seldome obleigeth the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science longer than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
restraines the power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewys</hi> was not well
pleased with debasing
Majestie to the irregular
requests of them, who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55555:72"/>
ought not to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
their Prince. And
since to oppose them all
was unsafe, it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to destroy one by
one: that the revenge
might bee more secure
and lesse observ'd. For
those wounds are most
mortall that bleede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
and waters which
raise least noyse have the
greatest depth: The shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of Princes actions
sounding loudest to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
judgements: but where
the understanding hath
the chiefest agitation, the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55555:72"/>
greatest attempts proceed
with least disturbance.</p>
               <p>His resolution was
therefore to begin his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
with him, who
was neerest to his person;
those contents being scarce
heard which are spoken a
farre off: but the least
whisper pierceth, when
the voyce, approacheth
too neere the eare.</p>
               <p>The late Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi>
afflicted him most,
in regard nature tyed his
memory to a continuall
torment, that preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55555:73"/>
had prevail'd. For
those disgraces obrey'd us
most, which wee suffer
where we have good title
to claime respect. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
brothers the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is so little, that the
sence of honour growes
too tender: which makes
the least touch peirce the
very quicke. <hi>Lewys</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
compell'd him to an
exchange of <hi>Normandie</hi> for
<hi>Gaien;</hi> either by remove,
to prevent his growth in
Faction, or by shifting
him from one command
to another: in fine to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55555:73"/>
leave him none.</p>
               <p>But this Art was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
discover'd; and the
divided re-unite: bringing
<hi>Lewys</hi> into the same feare
and danger. Which with
much dissimulation hee
prevents: And by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
<hi>Charolois</hi> and
<hi>Brittaine</hi> he gaines liberty
to oppresse underhand
his brother. Which was
with lesse difficultie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
at; in regard <hi>Charles</hi>
now made Duke of <hi>Guien,</hi>
was of an easie spirit, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to master an evill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but fearefull to effect
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55555:74"/>
it with hazard. Moreover
he naturally abhor'd war,
either in Religion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
and the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of that time was
troubled: Men onely safe
who feared no danger',
and such Princes onely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of peace, who were
not frighted at war. Then
which was his ruine, any
probable conditions of
safety, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
confederacie with
turbulent unquiet men.
And who can hope from
others participation of
danger, who never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55555:74"/>
friendship but for
necessitie? Or who will
adhere to his fortunes
who deserts himselfe; and
no longer loves a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
than hee is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?</p>
               <p>This inconstancie in the
Duke of <hi>Guien</hi> layd him
open to King <hi>Lewys;</hi> who
finding that his brothers
life quicken'd so many
disorders in <hi>France,</hi> gave
way (if History be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
in censure) that hee
should dye. But nature
yeelded little hope to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the businesse, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55555:75"/>
therefore of the
present troubles was to
be sought from Art: and
so well was the plot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
that he sicken'd and
dyed for the quiet of the
Kingdome; for his death
broke all those intellegen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had beene held so long
in <hi>France:</hi> and the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Princes began to
thinke on a new way of
greatnesse, not by distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
their Neighbours
Kingdome but by quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their owne subjects.
A greatnesse not destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to their enemie, but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55555:75"/>
effective to themselves:
Which creates a triumph
more glorious because
more innocent. For pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
doth never shine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded,
which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by darke designes,
or obscure dishonest

to tread the beaten

superiour to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

resolv'd to leave nothing
in his age: least that gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
power loathing infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
and wrinckles,
might have distasted him
and forgot her flattery.
But his courage did rise
yet higher, and vanquisht
death it selfe: Death that
great Tyrant which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornes
its darke Pallace
with the spoyle of Kings,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55555:76"/>
and devests the Proud of
all the gaudie circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

left him now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer:
three parts of the
world had seene the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees
of his fortune, and
all had submitted but
death. To which since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
he was doom'd to
pay the common debt; yet
he contrived it so, that it
should be small losse to
him, who had nothing
now remaining but his
body, and that weakned
by time and sicknesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:55555:77"/>
To <hi>Brussells</hi> hee sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
all the Nobilitie of
the seventeene Provinces,
and solemnely cancell'd
that sacred obligation
they owed him as their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne.
To his sonne
<hi>Phillip,</hi> to that purpose
sent for out of <hi>England,</hi> he
gave those Countries and
their homage. Tis true,
he wept, but they were
teares of wonder; his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
not onely astonishing
that great assembly but
even himselfe: the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was so new, it forc't
him to an extraordinary
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55555:77"/>
expression, with which his
courage never had beene
acquainted. For Noblest
spirits in such an extasie
weepe as fast, as weaker
soules out of foeminine
softnesse.</p>
               <p>Two moneths after he
had made this essay upon
his vertue, hee gave perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the great worke,
and to his sonne made
transaction of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over the rest of his
Kingdomes, Provinces,
and Islands, both in this
and the new world. Which
was with greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55555:78"/>
of Princes, as the
businesse was of larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and more value. For
to this Troegi-Comedie
came spectators from all
the world, in regard the
Scaene was so new, and
the Actors the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of that age, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as Noble as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever gloried in. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was left him now
but the Empire, which
soone after hee renounced
sending to his brother
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
the Imperiall Crown
and Scepter, by the hands
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55555:78"/>
of <hi>William,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orenge.</hi>
Who though he appear'd
unwilling to this Office,
loath to see his Prince bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
thus alive; yet with
small scruple he afterward
rent from his Soveraigne
King <hi>Phillip</hi> a great part
of the Low Countries,
and indangered them all.
Thus with a complement
of regret the Subject of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
appeares in just things
troubled to obey: who
can dispence with all duty
when his owne ambition
is concern'd; and justifie
rebellion with pretence of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55555:79"/>
lawfull liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> having nothing
left him now, but what
lives yet, the memory of
his many victories; retired
to private lodgings till the
wind serv'd faire to waite
on him into <hi>Spaine.</hi> And
soone he found in his first
solitude it was but his sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
had made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
so mighty: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now nothing but
himselfe, he tooke justly
his owne height, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
he was but man. The
swarme of those Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyes
who had quickned
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55555:79"/>
in the heate of favour; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
no more, now his
aspect though more cleere
wanted the former vitall
warmth. The wonder past,
every man forsooke him
who had left his glory;
and as honour or profit
directed them, began to
beate new pathes. For
what truth had in vaine
heretofore labour'd to
perswade, now hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged:
when hee so
suddenly perceiv'd, that
the supreamest vertue, not
made awfull by authority,
can never keepe it selfe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55555:80"/>
high in regard, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the applause of men.
And though his sonne
King <hi>Phillip</hi> let fall words
on the Anniversary of
this resignation which
seem'd to taxe his Father
to have as soone repented
as done this glorious Act
of vertue; yet who can
beleeve in so constant a
minde so poore a frailtie?
Perhaps he was a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at the change: and
the Sonne who was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd
on that Empire, his
Father had resign'd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
the wonder to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55555:80"/>
Nor can we but
imagine that <hi>Charles</hi> was
somewhat astonisht at
the steepe descent hee had
on the suddaine made
from so high a precipice:
though it was with a farre
other passion, then tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
them who are
throwne headlong down
by death or fortune.</p>
               <p>When hee landed in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> he kist the earth,
whether he had brought
his owne to Sepulture:
and made his lippes doe
pennance for some few
trespasses his youth was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55555:81"/>
guilty of. He acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it the common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in that homage: and
confest how high soever
we are in growth, and
however wide our bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
spread themselves;
our roote is still in the
earth, till age, the Axe, or
some, violent tempest
plucke us up: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
envious time
takes away even the Print
that ere wee florisht
there</p>
               <p>At <hi>Burgos,</hi> where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the suddaine pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of some monies for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55555:81"/>
discharge of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
hee exprest a just
disdaine, perceiving the
Officers slow to serve not
him but his necessitie.
And his title was honest
to that passion: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
cannot bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
by a mercy lesse than
heavenly, and he was yet
apparrell'd with his earth.
Of all the immence reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of so many wealthy
Kingdomes, hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to his owne use, but
one hundred thousand
Crownes annually, for
that small time hee was to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55555:82"/>
out-live his greatnesse.
And this was not payd
but with trouble: for the
living grudged to allow
any tribute to the dead,
among whom <hi>Charles</hi> was
to be numbred when hee
ceas'd to Raigne. But this
ill nature of the world
serv'd him to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for it comforted him
that he had forsooke all
commerce with that
which servilely obey'd
him onely, when as a
Master, hee heretofore
commanded it.</p>
               <p>This hasten'd his finall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55555:82"/>
retirement to a religious
house of the order of S.
<hi>Ierome;</hi> which was seated
in a most wholesome ayre,
that he might not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
seeme to desire to
dye, vvhen hee had given
over to command: And in
this his valour out-did all
former example; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
resignation of so large
an Empire, he could pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
studdie the Arts to
live, and contract his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
to so narrovv a
roome; vvho had made
nine journies into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;</hi>
sixe into <hi>Spaine,</hi> seven
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55555:83"/>
into <hi>Italy,</hi> foure into
<hi>France,</hi> ten into the Lovv-Countries,
tvvo into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and as many into <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick.</hi>
But vvhen hee fixt
here, his ambition out-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
in tvvo yeares, all
the labour of fiftie: for
his thoughts disdaining
to measure earth or Sea,
vvhich <hi>Geographie</hi> can give
account of; made hourely
their ascent beyond the
fancie of <hi>Astrologie.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the humble onely

rackes till they acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:55555:83"/>
Enter'd into this soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he felt a vvarre vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, of more terrour
than that vvith vvhich hee
had avved the World. For
novv hee vvas to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
where no confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Prince came to his
assistance, no subjects ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
their lives with their

revolted, and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

him above his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells.</p>
               <p>Yet had hee still in his
minde a soft eccho of the
former noyse of warre:
those houres he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from heaven, to solace
himselfe on earth, were
recreated with martiall
sports. Which was either
to make a mockery of his
heretofore most serious
stratagems, and all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
of the warlike: or
else to exercise his time in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55555:85"/>
the <hi>Mathematickes,</hi> which
had much enamor'd him
from his youth. For <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellus
Turrianus,</hi> a great
Master in that knowledge,
did usually delight him
with miracles of studie,
making little armed men
muster themselves upon
the Table, and Artificially
move according to the
Discipline of warre:which
was done so beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that the superiour
of the house, nothing
reade in the Mysteries of
that Art, suspected it for
witch-craft. Neither was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55555:86"/>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe unapt to
worke the little wheeles
of watches, and to make
a clocke up, which as it
strooke did warne him
what vanitie it was, to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
on the succeding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And now this great Sun
grew neere his night. But
desirous to out-live his
funeralls hee obtain'd to
see them solemniz'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death. A sad cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie,
to bee a mourner
to himselfe; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how short a pompe
waites on the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55555:86"/>
to the grave. The herse
was rais'd furnisht with
all the vanity of hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which told the
world, over how many
wide Kingdomes his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
had intended: and to
what a streit lodging it
was now shruncke up.
The Mourners assisted,
and perhaps with as
deepe a sorrow, as would
have pierc't them, had his
griefe beene serious:
while hee with a sober
mirth beheld the last
Scaene of all his glory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonated;
and found what
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55555:87"/>
an empty honour Princes
labour for in the sweate
and hazard of all their
victories. For what a no
comfort to the ashes of the
conquerour is the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of his life: since
onely Christian vertue
maintaines trafficke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
earth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>But death disdain'd to
bee made a sport to the
greatest spirit of that age:
for this odde pastime
soone became serious, and
he found he was to dye in
earnest. VVhich hee per
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55555:87"/>
form'd with the like
cheerefull looke; for there
vvas neither honour that
endeared nor beautie that
enamor'd him to the
vvorld: and this two
yeares silence had given
him a taste of heaven. He
therefore without despute
parted with that little of
the earth, he had reserved,
and which in this retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he had punisht, till
it grew subordinate to the
soule. And though he had
quitted all interest to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
yet would not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
let him dye without
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55555:88"/>
his comet. For as he sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kn'd
a new star appear'd:
which gain'd in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as hee declin'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
death, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
its glory on the
Cloyster vanisht as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired:
the poore comet
unable longer to shine,
when this greater starre
was darkned, from whom
it derived its luster.</p>
