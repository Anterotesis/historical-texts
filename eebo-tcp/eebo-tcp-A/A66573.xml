            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Nor am I angry with thee, for doing as other people do,—no,—I had rather have thee comport thy self to every mans hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:—With old men, severe; with young, jocund; with the humoursome, morose; with women, galliard; with thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, pleasant; and with a niggardly Rascal, more sordid than himself; at least, appear so;—And so would I have thee treat this fellow.</p>

                     <p>Truly you have hit upon one of the main points,—and part of the reason why my Master made you privy to it;—for as on one hand, we must take in some Sharers to lessen the charge, so on t'other, it behoves us to consider how many we may admit, for fear of diminishing the profits.</p>

                     <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
                     <p>By much:—But the business is now on foot, and must not stand still for fear of spoyling; and therefore we must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of present money; because, you know, some fees must be scatter'd among Servants and Clerks, and some other will go to making of Tryals,—things will not come without charge.</p>

                     <p>One Son Sir, and that's all:—I have often ask'd him why he toiles himself to leave so great an estate, when the tenth part of what he has alreadie would serve my Young Master, and to spare.</p>

                  <p>Then truly Sir I find it founded upon Nature,—The Sun the Moon, the Stars, are sparing of their light, and do not alwaies shine; The Earth is barren in some places, that it may be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in others—And the Sea, has its ebbs and neaps, as well as flowings and Spring tides;—And in a Word, from the beginning 'twas ever so.</p>

                  <p>Nor is this all; It has been the general practice of all times—The golden age, to save charges, were clad in skinnes, drank Water, eat Acorns, and to shew their innocence, wip'd their noses on their sleeves:—The Philosophers, they were spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring—The <hi>Brachmans,</hi> went naked,—<hi>Diogenes</hi> liv'd in a Tub—<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> on Carrets and Cabbage;—<hi>Plato</hi> wonder'd, a man could eat two meals a day;—And <hi>Epicurus</hi> (whatever

we think of him) was as great a Prince with a tost in the drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Pan, as a fat Citizen with his shoulder of mutton and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon:—The Stoicks, were abstenious to a miracle, and if ever they exceeded, 'twas never at their own charge; Nor have they walkt alone, The learned tread hard after 'um; for either (like the ancient <hi>Druids)</hi> they commit nothing to writing, or if they do, 'tis so close and <hi>aenigmatical,</hi> that no body can pick any thing out of 't:—But I burden you.</p>

               <l>PLAYS, are but Morals, and the Antients,</l>
               <l>That first wrapt Truth in Tales, had their intents.</l>
               <l>Full well they knew, nothing discover'd Vice,</l>
               <l>Like its own Picture—So we hope of this:</l>
               <l>How ill <hi>Suckdrie</hi> appears! How odly those,</l>
               <l>That grasp at Shadows, and the Substance lose!</l>
               <l>Take you the Moral right—and say—The Stage</l>
               <l>Then does its Work, when it reforms the Age.</l>
