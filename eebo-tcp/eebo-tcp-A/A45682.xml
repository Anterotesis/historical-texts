            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Animadversions upon the late suddain Tempest,
which happened at Oxford on the Thirty First
day of May last past.</head>
            <p>THose Accidents which are least expected, are
either most dreadful, or most admirable: That
which is common is contemned; and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
makes men disgust the most Noble, because Usual,
works of God. The Occurrence of <hi>unexpected</hi> Casuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
breed Terrour; of <hi>unfrequent</hi> Wonder: <hi>This</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
the Ears: <hi>That</hi> overwhelms the Mind. Here then
I have a Subject will exercise the faculties of both Soul
and Sense; If you have a mind to hear what former
Ages have been seldome acquainted with, if to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what later times may justly deprecate; I shall
faithfully publish the Relation, and seriously examine
the Events, of a late Accident, which may respond to
both your desires. 'Tis pleasant to scann the variety
of Natures operations, but grievous to pry into <hi>her</hi>
Cryptick Machinations. The <hi>Tempest</hi> was amazing <hi>in
facto,</hi> but will be terrible <hi>in futuro;</hi> 'twas repentine and
violent, but will be significant and notable: But to
the business.</p>
            <p>Upon the 31 of <hi>May</hi> last. The Morning was calm,
serene, and clear, at Ten of the Clock an uncouth and
intense Heat of the Sun seem'd to scourge the moistned
Plains, as if He would have redeem'd in a moment the
continued Bathings They had been so long plung'd into,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49621:3"/>
by the quick and penetrating stroaks of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> redoubled
Beams. This continued till about a quarter of an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Noon; when presently a steddy and soft Wind see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd
to dislodge from his Back,<note place="margin">South-VVest, or South-west by South.</note> and hoord up several
Clouds and Vapors not far from our <hi>Zenith;</hi> Having
obser'vd this, I forthwith erected a Scheme, and beheld
the Position of the Heavens; from which I had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
learnt the impending Event, but immediately the
presaged <hi>Storm</hi> came out of hand to attest the veracity of
my judments.</p>
            <p>A miraculous, dismal, and hideous <hi>Storm</hi> followed:
First, a <hi>Cataegis,</hi> or rushing murmur was <hi>heard</hi> in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Regions, which anon was <hi>felt</hi> in the lower: A
huge, blustering, and boisterous Wind descended with
such vehemence and irresistable force, that it proved
inimical to antient Trees and anti<expan>

                  <ex>que</ex>
               </expan> Edifices; was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
if not destructive, to Way-faring Men, and
out-laying Cattle; 'twas thick, and black, and with
such violence reflected upon the Ter<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ous Globe,
that thereby it wheeled, and contorted it self into such
windings, that it hoised up, and as it were absorbed,
the more subtile, light, pulveriz'd and dry particles of
the Terrestrial bodies, which had been divided and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
by the preceding Ardour of the Sun's scorching
beames; these opacous particles were so gross and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and so variously tossed in our Atmosphere, they deny<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
Us our Meridian Lustre of the Sun; for thse beams
the upper Clouds transmitted, They terminated: So
that without a contradiction, we might have asserted a
Solar Eclipse, at two Signs Elongation of the Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Whereas other Subitaneous and <hi>Erratick</hi> Winds
(as they call them) are usually distinguished into three
<hi>Species,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arist <hi>Meteor.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>Typhon, Prester</hi> and <hi>Ecnephias;</hi> This <hi>Thyel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
or <hi>Storm</hi> is reducible to none, but includes them all;
The first blast was like the <hi>Ecnephiae,</hi> which are the effect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49621:3"/>
of distracted and shattered <hi>Airy</hi> Clouds; <hi>Typhon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Fumigation of the clashing Vapors; and
<hi>Prester</hi> is a Whirlewind intermixt with Fire, which were
all visible in the time of this <hi>Storm's</hi> continuance. And
the concomitant <hi>Thunder</hi> was no less astonishing, then
the described Wind: for besides the frightful Claps at
every Eruption, the Lightening was deadly, ruinous,
and powerful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Fulgur quick and Crispisulcant, and
appeared several times to compose and distort its self to
the Form and similitude of an <hi>Oxe</hi>'s Horn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwhiles
to the likeness of the Pyramidical flame of a burning
Torch, or indeed not much unlike the <hi>Spiritual Cloven
Tongues:</hi> This Coruscation comprehended those three
<hi>Kinds</hi> of ominous and pernicious <hi>Sceptoe</hi>'s: viz.<note place="margin">Arist. Met.</note> The
<hi>Psoloes,</hi> fuliginous; killing and destroying the tender
Herbs: <hi>Arges,</hi> rapid; blasting and smutting the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Fruits: and <hi>Elicias,</hi> morbiferous; and lineally
compos'd according to the forementioned Figures.
Lastly, the <hi>Rain</hi> was thick, strong, and ponderous; its
fall caus'd the tender <hi>Scions</hi> as it were reverence it, and
bow to <hi>its</hi> presence; several of the Drops were exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the full Breadth of a Six-penny-piece, which also
followed one another so closely that They seemed one
continued Spout or Stream; so that in less then half a
quarter of an hour, these pouring <hi>Cataracts</hi> raised the
water in a round and uniform Vessel of about 4 foot <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amiter,</hi>
near two Foot higher then before, without the
asistance of any other interfluent Rivulet, or commixing
water. <hi>Hesiod</hi> in his <hi>Theogonia</hi> decyphers a fictitious
<hi>Tempest ad amussim,</hi> with all the expressive Terms that
Horrour and Amazement can invent: But Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in a plain Dress; such in Reality was <hi>This,</hi> as I
have here described it; whose more immediate and
direful effects, are sadly evident in several Instances, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49621:4"/>
in the Subversion of Bridges, the Discussion of Walls,
and Demolition of Houses; the Despoliation of some
Trees of their Boughs, and others of their Fruits, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radication
of newly sown Seeds, the Exsiccation of those
more deeply rooted, and a general either Deprivation or
depravation of the <hi>Radical</hi> and vivificating moisture of
all Trees, Herbs, Fruits and Plants: what the <hi>Wind</hi> left,
the <hi>Rain</hi> beat down; and what <hi>That</hi> spared, the <hi>Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
struck: these are Tokens too evident.</p>
            <p>Again, twas easy by a sleight Animadversion to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Malitiousness of this <hi>Tempest,</hi> even from
sensitive perceptions: You might have smell'd the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
in their Descent, abounding (and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
subjacent Bodies) with Stench and Corruption:
You might have beheld an unusual Proreption of
<hi>Animalcles</hi> out of the Bowels of the Earth, hunting and
searching about for Food, as sensible of some convenient
Aliment, which they commonly extract out of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
matter: You might have tasted a vitious juice or
moisture adhereing to the leaves of Vegetables, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
incorporated therein, and remaining a sure
Ground for the Generation and Nourishment of Insects,
Caterpillars &amp;c. When the Vivific Energy of the Sun
shall more powerfully work upon Them.</p>
            <p>Now because such Events, with the vulgar, are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
sealed <hi>immediato Dei vel Daemonis Digito,</hi> with the
immediate Finger of God or the Devil, I shall essay to
demonstrate this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> to be the meer Result of
Secundary Causes, and to salve it from the common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of such like Contingencies, and the plain
Operation of Physical Causes.</p>
            <p>For consider: I suppose the <hi>Integral</hi> parts of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
Bodies, as the mixt Bodies of Earth, Water &amp;c,
to be minute, slender, sleight, and slippery, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49621:4"/>
as these parts are mingled and intertexed one
with another. The Body is constituted <hi>Fluid</hi> or <hi>Solid</hi>
&amp;c: But I conceive, the <hi>Fluid</hi> Bodies are composed of
<hi>Oblong, Solid</hi> Bodies of <hi>variously figurated,</hi> Particles; Now
these Parts or Particles being Themselves compounded
(according to the Corpuscularian Philosophers) of
Self-moving Atoms, are either continual <hi>Movents</hi> or
feasible <hi>Moveables:</hi> However, tis certain that by the
diversly qualified Irradiations of aspected Planets, and
chiefly of the two Luminaries, these Minute Particles are
actuated or put in Motion; by which Motion or Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
They are caused to ascend Upwards, without any
inclination of their own; <hi>Because They find no other place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cartesius <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor.</hi>
               </note>
To or <hi>By which they may more easily continuate their Motion,</hi>
for their Natural <hi>Downwards</hi> is obstructed by the Earth;
Just as the Dust being trampled upon, and put in Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the prancing Feet of Coursers, assays <hi>Vpwards,</hi>
although it have much more of an Internal Principle to
retard such Motion. Those which are called <hi>Vapours</hi>
are the parts of Fluid and more light Bodies, wherefore
their Ascent is easily soluble; But the <hi>Exhalations,</hi>
which are parts of Solid and more gross Bodies, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to be wheedled <hi>Vpwards,</hi> being complicated in the
Embraces of Ascendant <hi>Vapours.</hi> These <hi>Vapours</hi> then,
being, as I said, agitated by the <hi>Influence</hi> of Celestial
Bodies, are yet more forcibly struck and moved by the
Intense Sun beams, as is manifest by Their then more
frequent and apparent Ascent: And altho they be
Oblong, yet in Their Ascension seem Globular, because
of their ready and quick circumgiration, whereby They
impel one another; till at length this Motion begin by
litle and litle to languish and decay, when once, above
the Atmosphere, they lose the Sun's reflex beams; and
so at last, by the cold of the <hi>middle Region,</hi> cohere and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49621:5"/>
stipate more close together; yet not altogether desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Motion, but retaining a Self-inflecting Activity,
effectual to the conglomerating and reducing Them
unto mutual Amplexes; whereby, together with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Winds assistant to the Unition and Conjunction of
their Vagabond parts, They concresce into <hi>Clouds.</hi>
Whence tis evident, there are these causes prerequir'd
to the Generation of Clouds, <hi>viz.</hi> The Superlunary
<hi>Influence</hi> to exhale <hi>Vapours;</hi> gentle <hi>Winds</hi> to conjoyn
Them; and sufficient <hi>Frigidity</hi> to congeal Them: which
must all be duly contempered; and which never so
joyntly and proportionally concur, as in the <hi>Spring,</hi> and
hence proceeds the frequent Alteration of Weather in
that Season.</p>
            <p>But because I said, that <hi>Exhalations</hi> were carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft
by their Adhesion to <hi>Vapours;</hi> 'tis to be noted how
they are separed in the <hi>Superiour Regions;</hi> for We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that some Clouds are wholly Airy, others Watry,
others Fiery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which manifestly denotes That <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations</hi>
and <hi>Vapours</hi> are sometimes separated: Which
will appear if we consider their <hi>Gravity</hi> or <hi>Levity;</hi> for
'tis plain that oft times the <hi>Gravity</hi> of <hi>Exhalations</hi> may
stop their Course, and stay <hi>them</hi> behind, while the
<hi>Light Vapours</hi> ascend higher; or sometimes <hi>They</hi> may
be left alone, while That impells Downwards the more
<hi>Volatile Vapours</hi> from them, which is not effectual to
the moving of <hi>Them;</hi> or lastly They may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by the constant Agitation of the Winds, like
<hi>Butter from Milk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now therefore these Airy, Fiery, and Watry Clouds
have large <hi>Superficies</hi>'s considering their Matter, as Sense
can testifie; and therefore are suffulted by the Air's
Resistance, lest they should descend, even against their
own Inclinations: but by the supervening Heat, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49621:5"/>
perhaps other Qualities of Celestial bodies, some (or all)
of their Particles are Liquefacted, or otherwise prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and thereby unite the rest together more closely
and compactly, and consequently become more Heavy
(for ponderosity proceeds from the smallness or Paucity
of Pores) till at length their own weight press and force
them downwards; being adjuted sometime by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
of the superiour, sometime by a Recess of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Air; through which they are strained, and as it were
sifted, so that accordingly as <hi>That</hi> is more laxe or presst,
the <hi>Rain</hi> or <hi>Wind</hi> are greater or less; or as <hi>They</hi> connect
with <hi>Analogus Vapours</hi> or <hi>Exhalations</hi> occurring in their
Descent.</p>
            <p>Thus you have seen in brief, the Manner of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
and Cohereing of <hi>Vapours,</hi> the Impending and
Descending of <hi>Clouds.</hi> All this happened to this <hi>Storm</hi> by
a <hi>signal</hi> and <hi>suddain</hi> Concurrence; twas <hi>Signal,</hi> because
<hi>Boisterous; Suddain,</hi> because <hi>Vnobserved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preceeding Serenity, Clearness and Emptiness
of our Air, was the Reason, why the brisk, quick,
and stated <hi>Southern Winds</hi> disburthened themselves here
so fast of their Clouds (collected, exhaled and concreted
in Forraign Countries) because of that Resistance was
in the stuffed Air (circumscribing this pure Air of
ours) less capable of admitting such grossly-coherent
Clouds, being cloyed with such like before: or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
several opposite Winds blowing at the same time
from opposite <hi>Plages</hi> (as has not been seldome observed)
might terminate in <hi>Ours,</hi> and so Impell hither, dislodge
themselves, and pile up, in our <hi>Vertex,</hi> several Clouds
of different Contextures and Composures: and hence
the <hi>Storm</hi> was made up of the Extreams of <hi>Wind, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and <hi>Rain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst these Clouds being thus comping'd and
penn'd up (on the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> by their proper
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49621:6"/>
Winds, on the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>North</hi> by the Closeness of the
Air) the Celestial Powers bred intestine broils, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
Strivings, whereupon Each meditated their
<hi>Exit</hi> downwards, through the Lower Regions of the
Air, being less Stipated, and more yeilding, then the
other Circumambient: And This with the more Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosity,
because of the more agitated (not rarified*) Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,<note place="margin">As the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks.</hi> assert.</note>
conspiring all to a Motion <hi>Deorsum,</hi> both by
Natural Tendency, and Influential Impression; and
with Difficulty overcoming obvious <hi>Remora</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>So, the <hi>Whirl-wind</hi> was caused when an Aerial and
Superiour Cloud was dilated, (that is when his litle,
long Particles put on a brisk and circular Motion, which
required more Room then when they were almost
quiet and still) by Superlunary Agents, and forcing his
way through some narrow chink of an Inferiour Cloud,
where it found least resistance, descended as it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
and from the <hi>Zenith;</hi> The manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be rarely exhibited in an <hi>Eolipile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Thunder</hi> was generated by a Tabulated and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
Order of <hi>Oblong</hi> Clouds, the <hi>Superiours</hi> of Which,
being forcibly condensed by Celestial Beams, and by
that Condensation gravitated, and by that Gravity vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
detruded upon those subjected Clouds, caused
a mighty Sound by their Impinging and Atrition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
which rebounded in the Atmosphere; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Exhalations were partly inflammable (such
are the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Metalls,</hi> the <hi>Effluvia's</hi> of <hi>Sulphur, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senick,
Nitre, Ammoniack, Bitumen, Mercury, Camphire,
Vitriol, Antimony</hi> and such like, abounding in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the Earth and emissed by Subterraneous Fires)
therefore, I say, by this Elision and Attrition of the
Clouds, Fire or Flame was accended; which Flame has
us<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lly those Effects, which are consequent to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49621:6"/>
of the Exhalations or Vapours, whereof the Cloud
is composed. The forementioned Variety of the Shapes
of this Flame or Coruscation, I conjecture, to have born
some <hi>Analogy,</hi> with their respective parts of the <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
striking, and clashing Cloud.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rain</hi> was generated by the hasty Resolution of
an <hi>Inferiour</hi> Cloud, whose ponderous Ingredients pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
its Descent; The largeness of the Drops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
partly from the other Vapours which coupled
with them in their <hi>Rode</hi> to the Earth; but chiefly from
the compactness of the Cloud, which may be said ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have been broken in peices, then resolved into
parts: or perhaps, what is very probable, one watry
Cloud fell upon another; so that in joynt Forces both
mutually conspired to a Descent, and the drops of th'
one, mixt with those of th' other.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the ready Cessation of this <hi>Storm</hi> was caused
by the few, but forcible, stroaks of the <hi>Superiour</hi> upon
the <hi>Inferiour</hi> Clouds, which presently either totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
or dissipated Them.</p>
            <p>Here suffer me to take a short digression, and make a
parallel. We had a great, <hi>mighty, rushing Wind</hi> a few
days before, the Apostles on the very day of, the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost;</hi>
That was <hi>Defluxus Caeli,</hi> This <hi>Exhalatio Terrae;</hi>
That really came down from Heaven, This apparently;
That filled only one place, This especially one; That
happened where the Apostles and Disciples were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, This where God's Ministers, Christ's
Disciples are chiefly resident; That when men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Nations were dwelling at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Forreign</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours.</note> This when
<hi>men</hi> of different Countries were commorating in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
That brought Cloven Tongues, This their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude;
Those represented (with the Prophet) the
<hi>Tongues, the best Member we have,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 108. 1.</note> These (with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49621:7"/>
               <hi>the worst Member we have;</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 3. 6.</note> That filled the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
Hearts with the Holy Ghost, This the Peoples
Hearts with Holy Thoughts; That caused Amazement,
This Terrour; That was a certain Seal of his first come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Flesh, This may be a probable Sign of his
second comeing in Glory; That was a Token of the
plentiful Harvest of the Gospel of Christ, This of the
scarce Crop of the Fruits of the Ground: The Summ of
all is; That as the <hi>Spiritual Tempest</hi> was God's Ordinance
and Method to prepare men for the Reception of the
Holy Ghost, So this <hi>Natural one</hi> to awaken them to the
Work of Repentance.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to trace out, and solve the
<hi>unexpectedness</hi> of this <hi>Tempest;</hi> In all which I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to that <hi>self-moving and subtile matter,</hi> which the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians</hi>
so much dote upon; but allow the Celestial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
to be the <hi>Principle Efficient,</hi> and <hi>Primary Movent</hi>
in all such <hi>Accidents.</hi> For the <hi>Position</hi> of the <hi>Heavens</hi>
did evidently manifest this Tempestuous Weather; and
twas only the promising <hi>Sudum,</hi> made it unaccountable
to the Vulgar, and the precedent Serenity of the upper
Regions in our <hi>Zenith;</hi> which was permitted until the
more effectual and continued darting of the Stellar
beams upon the suddainly-coagulated Mass of Vapours;
which after due, prepared, and sufficient operations,
dissolv'd, dishevel'd and hurried <hi>Them</hi> downwards;
And the more forcibly, because the more perpendicular
Rayes of the Planets produced this so repentine Effect.</p>
            <p>We find <hi>Mars, Sol</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> were pofited in <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
where they had all some <hi>Essential Dignity</hi> just with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Cusp of the tenth house in the <hi>South South West</hi>
Plage of Heaven, whence all this <hi>Storm</hi> arose; and we
had all the rest of the Planets in or about <hi>medium Caeli</hi>
in such an Hubbub and confused manner, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49621:7"/>
but some notable Effect should quickly follow;
Observe the Congruity of this <hi>Position</hi> with the <hi>Storm,</hi>
which seems to have been govern'd by the <hi>Influences</hi> of
the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Houses: The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Tempest</hi> was <hi>Wind,</hi> wherefore in the Ninth
House we had the two Planets hot and dry by Nature,
together with Ambiguous <hi>Mercury,</hi> in an Airy Sign:
The middle was part <hi>Thunder,</hi> but most <hi>Rain,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the precise Tenth House we had a moist Planet
in a Watry Sign; The end was most <hi>Thunder</hi> and part
<hi>Rain,</hi> so in, and upon the Cusp, of the Eleventh House
were the Planets (some of an hot and dry, others of a
moist Nature) in a Fiery Sign; So that in all things
the <hi>Storm</hi> was consonant to the <hi>Triplicities</hi> then possess'd
by the Planets.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Storm</hi> was rare, so its Effects, or rather
Events, will be no less admirable: The <hi>Summer,</hi> I judge,
will be pestered with many Showers, and abundance of
disturbing Southerly Winds; Expect Diseases more
rife; an universal Scarcity of wholesome, but Plenty of
Noxious Fruits. Autumn will abound with <hi>Rain</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual,
and <hi>Sickness</hi> Epidemical; a Soultry, Dark, Cloudy
and Unwholsome Season; and such unconstant Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Husbandman will find it difficult to make
the profit recompense his Labour this year: And to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
empty Husks will be as great a Loss to him, as
Grievance to the whole Nation. The Fields will be
either scorched by interfering Ardour, or drowned by
continual Moisture.</p>
            <p>These are my Sentiments upon this unusual Accident;
which seem to be more Ratified, by the preventional
Comet, and postventional Conjunction; of the <hi>One</hi> I
have already spoken, of the <hi>Other</hi> I intend to treat.</p>
            <p>Search the <hi>Annals,</hi> and you may find what has been
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49621:8"/>
the usual Consequents of such like <hi>Tempests.</hi> Such an
one happened in the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Raph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Holins.</note> whereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a <hi>Dearth,</hi> an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and a <hi>Comet.</hi> So in the
<hi>Fifteenth of</hi> Richard 2. <hi>March</hi> 5. <hi>a suddain and terrible
Tempest arose, with the violence whereof much hurt was
done, after this ensued great Mortality by Pestilence, so that
much Youths died every where, in Cities and Towns in passing
great Numbers, herewith followed a great Dearth of Corn,
so that a Bushel of Wheat in some places was sold at Thirteen-pence,
which in those dayes was an exceeding great price:</hi>
So in the <hi>Sixteenth of the same,</hi> were several such <hi>Tempests,</hi>
whereby the <hi>Corn</hi> was <hi>spoiled,</hi> a <hi>Plague</hi> followed in <hi>Essex</hi>
and a <hi>Dearth</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> And in the <hi>Fifth of Q. Mary</hi>
was a signal <hi>Tempest</hi> of <hi>Wind,</hi> which Our's equall'd in
violence not in continuance, and thereupon followed a
great <hi>Mortality</hi> in the next <hi>Harvest,</hi> by <hi>Quartanes</hi> and
other <hi>Epidemical Rotts.</hi> But more Instancies would be
as unnecessary as tedious.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the <hi>Flagellum Dei,</hi> to scourge the
People's pride by blasting their Felicity: This is the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Wrath</hi> of God, to bring down their high minds by
lopping of the <hi>Staff</hi> of their Bodies: But oh what <hi>Energy,</hi>
what <hi>prevalency</hi> might a sincere <hi>Ninivitical</hi> Humiliation
have against the <hi>Powers</hi> of Heaven! How might it wrest
and extort Mercy from God, and avert these impending
<hi>Catastrophies!</hi> which that you may all speedily set upon,
is the hearty Desire, and earnest Prayer of</p>
