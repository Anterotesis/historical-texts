            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo yeres are fully complete and expired, since my booke of Motiues came abroad, and was in your hands. In it I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to subscribe, if either any one among you, or other Papist in Europe whosoeuer, could effectually confute the same. Your owne Papists here at home, greatly wonder at your silence in that behalfe: Some (God be thanked for it) are wholy and soundly reformed: Othersome are inforced so to doubt of your doctrine, as they know not in the worlde what to say or thinke thereof: Othersome either seduced by your sinister report, or else to saue your credite, if it would be, affirme very desperately, that you haue answered my Motiues already: and all generally both thinke and say, that yee will shortly answere them, if there be any trueth on your side. One whole yeere I haue expected your putatiue answere, as who had then, and still haue, a most feruent desire, speedily to reply vpon the same. Now, since mine expectation is in that point frustrate: in this second yeere I haue addressed my selfe, to giue you a further prouocation. In this Booke I haue not concealed any thing, that I knew or could possibly say for you. I haue not dissembled the mightiest obiections that can be made in your defence, neither haue I passed slenderly ouer them, but confuted them so pithily and so exactly, as if any of you, or of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren abroad, shall be able to yeelde a sufficient answere in your defence, I promise vnfainedly to subscribe vnto his doctrine. Remember therfore what the Orator saith: to wit, that to erre standeth with mans infirmitie: but to perseuere in errour, is proper to fooles alone. If you can deuise, how and in what sort to answer me: all wise men both say and thinke, that ye will doe it vndoubtedly. If you know not how to defend your cause, because the trueth preuaileth so mightily: then shew your selues to be wise men by embracing the trueth willingly, and not to be fooles, by striuing against the same wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Haue the feare of God before your eies: pray that your hearts may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with the true knowledge of his sacred word; and let not the shame of the world keep you backe, from the publike confession of the known truth. Peruse my Booke seriously, ponder my discourse deepely, contemne nothing wilfully, examine all my reasons sincerely: and that done, giue your indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent censures accordinglie. If you finde Poperie confuted effectuallie, then yeelde to the trueth, and giue God the glorie: if you thinke I faile in prouing my intended purpose; then vse your wittes and your pennes, as well for my confutation, as for the credit of your cause, and the expectation of your seely brethren, who shortly will renounce all Poperie, if ye with speede doe not defend the same.</p>

Now it is manifest, that he begate them not all three in the 70. yeere of his age, as saint Austen well obserued; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he begate some of them in his riper yeres. Abram ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not borne, till Terah was 130. yeres olde. For Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah was 205. yeeres old at his death in Charran Gen. 11. ve. 32. at which time Abraham was 75. yeeres of age Genes. 12. verse 4. which thing saint Steuen confirmeth in these wordes;<note place="margin">

Lo, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of Moses in the booke of Genesis, Abraham was but 75. yeeres old when he went out of Charran; and by the report of saint Steuen in the acts of the apostles, he came not out of Charran vntil his fathers death. So then hee could not be more then 75. yeres old when his father was 205. yeres of age; and consequently he was not the eldest sonne of Terah, begotten in the 70. yeere of his age; but his yonger sonne, borne when hee was 130. yeres old, and so we must haue 60. yeres more in this second age then the Chronographers commonly do allow.

This age of Ioseph is thus made manifest; he was 17. yeres of age when he was sold, Gen. 37. verse 2. he was 30. yeeres olde when hee became gouernour of Egypt, Genes. 41. vers. 40, 41, 46. to which adde the seuen yeeres of plentie, and three yeeres of famine Genes. 41.42, and 45. at which time Leui came into Egypt with his father, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 40. yeeres will be compleate.</p>
                        <p>I note secondly, that if we graunt Leui to haue beene 100.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yeeres olde before hee begate Caath, and affirme the same of Caath and Amram; (which thing surpasseth the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Ge. 17. v. 17. and therefore neede it not be granted;) we must for al that come short, and neither find the abode of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in Egypt to be 430. neither yet 400. yeeres in all.</p>
                        <p>I note thirdly, that if we grant Caath, Amram, and Moses,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to haue beene begotten in a competent age; we shall easily finde the number of 215. yeres, which <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Marianus Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> haue put downe.</p>

                        <p>Iochebed was the owne daughter of Leui, and the naturall mother of Moses, for so we reade in the 26. chapter of the booke of Numbers, and in the sixt chapter of the booke of Exodus: and yet if we grant Leui to haue bin 120. yeres old when he begat Iochebed; and Iochebed to haue bin 100. yeres old at the birth


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1621:10"/>
of Moses, (both which are impossible by the course of nature,) and if we adde thereunto eightie yeares, the full age of Moses, at the departure out of Egypt, yet will all this be no more but bare 300. yeres: so then, we are short of the supputation menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Genesis by one ful hundred yeres; and of the reckoning specified in Exodus, by an hundred and thirtie yeares. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vndoubted meaning of those scriptures must needes be as I haue already shewed.</p>

Let vs therefore assigne 85. yeeres, to Leui, when hee begate Iochebed; 50. yeeres to Iochebed when she bare Moses; and 80. yeres to Moses when he brought them out of Egypt (which is as much as can be granted by the course of nature) and wee shall find the iust number of 215. yeeres: and so the supputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this third age is consonant.</p>

I proue it thus: Amaziah reigned 29. yeares, 2. King. 14. verse 2. and he beganne his reigne in the second yeare of Ioash king of Israel, and liued 15. yeares after him, 2.

                        <p>I answere, that hee beganne to reigne when hee was eight yeares old, and reigned tenne yeares with his father: and after


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1621:13"/>
the death of his father he raigned three moneths and ten daies, which was in the nineteenth yeare of his age, and so euery text of holy Writ is cleare.</p>
                        <p>This my answer is confirmed by the expresse wordes of holie scripture, 2. King. 25. verse 8. where it is saide, that Nebuzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adan chiefe steward to the king of Babel came in the nineteenth yeare of the kings raigne, to make hauocke of the citie, and to carry Sedechias into captiuitie: for Iechonias was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the eight yeere of the king of Babel, 2.

                        <p>For the manifestation of this difficultie, we must obserue that Ierusalem was thrise taken by the Babylonians; to wit, in the daies of Ioachim, Iechonias, and Sedechias. 4. King. ca. 24. &amp; 25. By reason whereof some reckon the beginning of the captiuitie from Ioachim, some from Ieconias, &amp; other some, as the Hebrewes doe generally, from the 11. yeare of king Sedechias.

                     <p>The prophets of God, bicause they would neither discorage the Iewes with threatnings, nor make them carelesse by the sweetnesse of Gods promises, sought throughout their books to set before their eies, the two principall partes of the law; to wit, the promise of saluation, and the doctrine of good life. For the first part, they direct the Iewes, and in them all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to the true Messias Christ Iesus, by whome onely they shal haue true deliuerance: for the second part, they vse threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and menaces to bring them from their vices. For this is the chiefe scope of all the prophets, either by Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to allure them to be godly; or else by threatnings of his iudgements, to feare them from sinne and wickednesse. And albeit that the whole lawe containe these two points, yet the prophets note particularly, as well the time of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the manner of the same.</p>

                     <p>Noah had three sonnes, Sem, Cham, and Iaphet. Sem with his children, inhabited that part of the world which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the east. For of his sonne Aram came the Syrians; of Assur, the Assyrians; of Arphaxad, the Chaldeans; of Ela the Persians.</p>

                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1621:29"/>Cham inhabited that part of the world, which is toward the south: for of Canaan came the Cananites; of Mizraim, the Egyptians; of Chus or Cush, the Ethiopians; of Saba the Arabians: and Chanaan is now called Iewrie.</p>
                     <p>Iapheth inhabited the west and north parts, and had manie sonnes; to wit, Gomer, Magog, Madai, Iauan, Tubal, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sech, and Tyrus.

                     <p>The tradition of the Hebrews is, that Iapheth was the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne of Noah, borne in the 500. yeere of his age; Cham or Ham his second sonne, borne in the 501. yeere of his age; Sem his third and yongest sonne, borne in the 502. yeere of his age. Which tradition is very probable, though not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether certaine and vndoubted; for Sem is said to be but 100 yeares olde, 2. yeeres after the floud, Genes. 11. verse 10. yet is Sem named first in the scripture, because the historie of the church is continued in his line.</p>

that God spake to Abraham when he was in Chaldea his natiue countrey, from whence hee went with his father to Haran, where he abode by reason of his fathers infirmitie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his death.

Therefore it cannot be, that Chaldea was his countrey. I answere, that Chaldea was his country, and that his countrey was indifferently called, either Mesopotamia, or Chaldea. Which I prooue by two reasons. First, because <hi>Plinius lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap</hi> 26. saith, that Chaldea is a citie in Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia. Secondly, because S. Steuen, Acts 7. verse 4. confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the same: neither doth any graue writer denie, but that Mesopotamia ioyneth to Chaldea; and so Chaldea being in the confines of Mesopotamia, may not vnfitly bee taken for the same.</p>

                        <p>It is said in the 11. of Genesis, that when Abraham went from Vr of the Chaldees, he dwelt in Haran: but in the 7. of the Acts it is said, that when he went out of Chaldea, he dwelt in Charran; so it seemeth, that either holy Moses, or S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen must vtter an vntruth. I answere, that that word which Moses in Genesis calleth Charran, is also called Charran by S.

The reason hereof is this, because the first letter of that worde in Hebrew (<gap reason="foreign">

                        <head>The fourth difficultie.</head>
                        <p>This is a great difficultie, and worthie to be well obserued. The doubt standeth thus. Moses saith, Genes. 11. verse 26. that Terah begat Abraham when he was 70. yeeres olde. In the same place he saith, that Terah died when he was 205. yeeres old: in the twelfth of Genesis hee saith, that Abraham was 75. yeeres old, when he departed out of Haran or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran; for all is one (as is already saide:) so that by this recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we must want 60. yeares of Terahs age: for albeit the scripture say, that Terah liued 205. yeeres; yet by the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation already made, we cannot finde more then 145. yeeres. I answer first, that this difficultie hath troubled many learned men. Some thinke, that God would conceale the 60. yeeres, that so the end of the world might be kept secret from vs. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thinke that Abraham stayed those 60. yeeres, with his father at Charran. I answere secondly, that Terah was 105 yeeres olde, when he begat Abraham. Neither is holy writ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, to this my answere. For although it say, that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah was 70. yeeres old when he begat Abraham, Nachor, and Haran; yet doth it not deny him to haue beene more, but doth connotate the lesse by the more, by the vsuall figure synechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che; very frequent in the holy scriptures.

verse 1. It is said that the Ismaelites bought and sold Ioseph: but in the 37. of Genesis, verse 36. it is said, that the Madia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites sold him into Egypt. I answere, that Moses speaketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently of the Madianites and Ismaelites, vsing them both for one and the same people.</p>
                        <p>Ioseph was blessed of God, and all thinges prospered vnder his handes. Which when Potiphar saw, he made him ruler of his house, and put al that he had in his hand. Yet by the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dealing of Potiphars wife, he was cast in prison. Gene. 39. verse 2.3.20.</p>
                        <p>Ioseph expounded Pharaoh his dreames, for which cause he was deliuered out of prison, highly honoured of the king, and made the chiefe gouernour of the land of Egypt. Gen. 41. ver. 25.43.</p>
                        <p>Ioseph was a figure of our Sauiour Christ, liuely declared by S. Austen. For as Iosephes brethren when they saw him, consulted to put him to death; euen so the Iewes when they saw Christ, tooke counsell him to crucifie. Iosephes brethren tooke from him his motly coat, and the Iewes took from Christ his corporall coate. Ioseph spoiled of his coate, went downe into the pit; and Christ spoiled of his body, descended into hell. Ioseph comming out of the pit, was bought of the Egyptians; and Christ arising from the dead, was bought of the Gentiles by faith. Ioseph was sold for 30. pence, by the counsell of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah his brother: and Christ was solde for 30. pence, by the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie of Iudas his Apostle.

                        <p>Vpon the Rechabites abstinence from wine, the papistes of latter daies haue falsly grounded their superstitious fastes.

I therefore say first, that the whole scope of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is nothing else in the storie of the Rechabites, but by their example to confound the disobedient Iewes. For the Recha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites kept strictly the commandementes of Ionadab, euen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares after he was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Iewes would not obey the euerliuing God, Iere. 35. v. 14. I say secondly, that Ionadab <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is not commended for his strict charge, but his children for their ready obedience.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1621:35"/>
their commandementes are agreeable to Gods holy lawes. So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> saith the Apostle, Ephes. 6. verse 1. I say fourthly, that their abstinence from wine was a ciuill obseruance, not any religious worship. And I prooue it by two reasons; first, because they were not onely prohibited to drinke wine, but also to till the ground, to plant Vineyardes, and to build or haue houses. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because not only themselues, but their wiues also, their sonnes, and their daughters, had the selfe same charge; who yet liued almost three hundred yeares, after the charge was giuen. Who all by popish collection, should haue bin Monkes and Nunnes; which to affirme is very absurd, euen in their own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> maner of proceeding. I say fiftly, that Ionadabs charge was not giuen for merite or religion, but for a meere ciuill respect: to wit, to acquaint his posteritie with an austere kinde of life, that after when God should punishe the world for their sinnes; they might beare it more patiently, &amp; with more facility wander from place to place.

I say thirdly, (except man;) because God made the other thinges for man, but not one man for another, Gen. 9. verse 3.5. The proposition is thus proued. Christ reproouing the Pharisies, for their fond opinions in superstitious obseruance of externall ceremonies, (which he termed the traditions of men;) willed al the multitude to hearken vnto him, and to vnderstand, that whatsoeuer was without man, could not defile him when it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into him, Matt. 15. verse 11. Mar. 7. ver. 15. I knowe and am perswaded through the Lord Iesus, (saith the Apostle) that there is nothing vncleane of it selfe (or by nature:) but to him that iudgeth it to be vncleane. Rom. 14. verse 14. Saint

Peter was long in doubt, concerning this proposition. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was, because some meates were made vncleane by the olde law.

And there came a voice to him, bidding him kill and eate. Yet Peter durst not eate, but answered, that hee neuer ate any polluted thing. And the voice spake the second time, willing him not to repute the thinges polluted, which God had purified. Thus Peter did, and thus he erred at that time. And euen so doe many silly soules this day, who make lesse scruple to rap out great othes, horrible blasphemies, and slaunderous speeches against their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; then they doe in eating a peece of cheese, or an egge in Lent: and yet is the one directly against the law of God, the other onely against the tyrannicall constitution of the pope.</p>

The forme of which fast, is abstinence: the matter is meate, drinke, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer bringeth corporall oblectation; the efficient cause is faith and repentance for our sinnes; the end is to appease Gods wrath, and either to procure deliuerance from our miseries or some mitigation thereof.</p>
                        <p>For which cause fasting in the Scriptures, is continually ioyned with praier: and being vsed as is said, God doth accept it for the merites of Christ Iesus, not for anie worthinesse in it selfe.</p>

                        <p>To fast rightly and christianly, is to absteine from al meates, all drinkes, and from all corporall pleasures, vntill the end of the fast; and to bestowe the whole time in praying, in lamenting our sinnes, and in hearing the worde of God, especially godly sermons.

                        <head>The fourth proposition.</head>
                        <p>Popish choice of meates in their late inuented fastes, is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and intollerable. I say first, (popish choice) because to put merite or religion in abstaining from one meate more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the peculiar badge of papistes; or at least common to them with the Eucratites, with the Tatians, with the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; with the Manichies, or like heretiques. I prooue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle saith plainly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</note> that all thinges are pure to the pure; but the papistes and other olde heretiques tell vs, that certaine meates, at certaine times, as in Lent, in the imber dayes, and Fridaies, are vnpure, and polluted; yea so vnpure, that they pollute all the eaters thereof,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>verse</hi> 4.</note> and make them guiltie of eternal death. Yet the Apostle auoucheth boldly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that euery creature of God is good, and that nothing ought to be refused, if it bee receiued with thankesgiuing. In the first verse of the same chapter, he telleth vs, that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times some shall depart from the faith, and giue heede to the doctrine of diuels. In the third verse he sheweth what doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of deuils he meaneth: To wit, prohibition to abstaine from meates, which God hath created to bee receiued with giuing of thankes. Out of which wordes, I note first; that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is impure at anie time, which is appointed for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the nourishment of man. I note secondly, that no meate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ought to bee refused in Lent, or at other times, if it be


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1621:37"/>
receiued with thankesgiuing. I note thirdly, that prohibition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from certaine meates was not in the apostles time, but inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by heretiques of latter daies. I note fourthly, that such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is of the diuell. I say secondly (late inuented fastes,) because Spiridion, who was not only a bishop, but also a man so holy, that he wrought myracles, and was in his life time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a Saint: did not refuse to eate flesh in the time of Lent, and that in his owne house;<note place="margin">

                           </note> yea; he did not only eate fleshe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but withall he intreated a stranger that lodged with him, to doe the same. And when the straunger refused to eate fleshe with him: saying, that hee was a christian, and so prohibited to eate flesh at that time: S.

Thus did the blessed bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and man of God, renowmed for his rare gift of working miracles. Whom the pope would burne for an hereticke with fire and fagot, if he were this day liuing in Rome, and woulde not retract his opinion. For first, hee eate fleshe himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to popish doctrine. Secondly, he vrged the stranger to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the same. Thirdly, he auouched his fact to be the part of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Fourthly, he signified y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to make conscience in choice of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> meates, was the badge of an infidell. Which fourth obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> I gather out of the word (rather.) Fiftly, the fact of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion prooueth, that to make choice of meates was deemed superstitious, not onely in the Apostles time, but many hundred yeares after their departure hence. I say thirdly (wicked and intollerable) first, because popishe choise of meates taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way christian libertie, and maketh christian slaues to mans tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. For to the pure all thinges are pure, by the libertie of Christes gospel.<note place="margin">

                        <p>Albeit a certaine kinde of fast (nowe in our Englishe tongue called Lent) was of old obserued before Easter: yet is that fast neither warranted by the Scriptures, neither commaunded by the apostles; neither vniformly practised in the primitiue church; but left indifferent to bee vsed, as it seemeth good to euerie one. I say, first (called in English, Lent:) because in the learned tongues and of al writers, it is termed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fast of <hi>40.</hi> daies. Why it shuld be so called, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people &amp; latter papists giue this reason; because forsooth, Christ fasted fortie dayes: but that this their wise reason so supposed, is most absurd and too too chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish; I will conuince by manifest demonstrations. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if Christes fast were a paterne of our Lent, then shoulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we aswell forbeare fish as flesh, which no papist will be bound vnto. Secondly, by that reason and rule, we should neither eat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nor drinke by the space of fortie daies. Thirdly, by that law, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ought to eate flesh vpon maundy Thursday;<note place="margin">

                           </note> vnlesse they will say, that the Paschall lambe was no flesh indeede, but a fish of the Sea. Fourthly, because Christ fasted not at that time of the


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1621:38"/>
yeare, in which the papistes keepe their Lent. Adde hereunto, that the said number of forty daies fast, was euer too too varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">

                           </note> as all approoued ecclesiasticall histories make relation.

That is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope added foure daies in the beginning, (which they commonly call clensing daies,) to supply the want. And yet haue they not the number, as they wishe.

                           </note>I say secondly (not warranted by the Scriptures) because neither the old nor the newe Testament maketh any mention thereof.

                        <p>I say thirdly, (not vniformely obserued in the primitiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> church,) First, because as is said, some obserue one maner, some another; some keepe mo weeks, some fewer.

Againe, because ecclesiasticall histories do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> testifie the same.

Yea, they keepe a better reckoning howe Lent passeth, and when they may fall to flesh againe; then euer they did of and for their sinnes: so that on Easter day hee seemeth the best sped, that first in the morning can get an egge: saue that <hi>adulti</hi> must that day first receiue, and then followeth as is said.

Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> because the nourishment of fishe is colde and moist, and so verie disproportionable to the Spring time. Thirdly, because concoction is then verie strong, as well for the ambient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> restraint, termed <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> as by reason of long sleepe; and therefore since much meate is necessary, our popish

Lent fast must perforce be preiudiciall. But some will say: your selues this day command to eate fish in Lent. I say first, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our lawes commaund that abstinence for the common-wealth sake, and not for merite or religion. I say secondly, that our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lawes doe tollerate euery one, to eate flesh in such measure, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is expedient for the health of his body. I say thirdly, that our lawes prohibite onely flesh: but popishe lawes charge all men vnder paine of mortall sinne, euen the poorest soules of all, that neither haue fish, nor money to prouide fish, to forbeare egges, cheese, butter, milke: Which how wicked and tyrannicall a law it is, who seeth not? for the seely soules must either eate such meates, or starue for want of food. Such popishe hypocritical fastes, Gods prophet reprooueth most bitterly; Is this the fast (saith the Prophet) that I haue chosen? that a man shoulde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his soule for a day; and bow downe his head as a bull rush, and lie downe in sackcloth and ashes? Wilt thou call this a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, or an acceptable day to the Lord? it is no fast, saith the Prophet; It is a fast saith the Pope; it is abhominable, saith the prophet; it is meritorious, saith the Pope. To fast truely, saith God by his Prophet, is to deale thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poore that wander into thy house; when thou seest the naked, that thou couer him, and hide not thy selfe from thine owne flesh. <hi>Esaiae. cap. <hi>58.</hi> ver. <hi>5.7</hi>

                        <p>Popish fastes are not fit meanes for their pretended end; to wit, mortification.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1621:41"/>
in their holy Lent, howsoeuer they bragge or boast thereof. The reason hereof is euident, because all papistes vsually dine at noone; that is, three houres at the least, before the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the councill. I say at the least, because they vse to anticipate noone, some more, some lesse. For better explication whereof, wee must obserue two thinges; the one concerning noone; the other concerning the euening praier. I say therefore that by the ninth houre, the councell with all antiquitie, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth three of the clocke at afternoone: for in the time of the Apostles and long after them, the day was deuided into twelue houres; which day was againe distributed into foure Vigils, whereof euery Vigil contained three houres: so that their ninth houre was with vs, three of the clocke in the after noone. Now for the obscuring of this euident confutation of the popish sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed fasting; the papistes of latter dayes haue deuised this miserable shift, a fit inuention of their newly hatched Romishe religion.</p>
                        <p>The Pope forsooth hath dispenced with his greedy religious godlesse people, (who will needes be thought deuout fathers, albeit they fast not one day in the whole yeare;) that they may huddle vp their vespertine houres, or euening praier, at anie time before twelue of the clocke, and then at their pleasures, to eate, drinke, and make good cheere. And (if it please your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships) this done; with full panches to beginne their disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued disholy fast againe.</p>

                     <p>Some men are verie rich in lands, goods, and possessions, which they enioy either by their patrimonie, or by dissent of blood, which riche men are sodenlie afflicted with pouertie, when oftentimes the cause is not knowne to any neighbour: but as the prouerbe saith, after great getters come great spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and how is aboundance of riches so soone gone? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it falleth out commonly, for a iust punishment of sinne. Some rich men get their riches by vsurie, some by deceitfull dealing, some by extortion, some by bribes and gifts for furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring euill causes, some by niggardly and miserly locking vp in chests and coffers, that which ought to haue beene bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the reliefe of their poore neighbours. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are abhominable in Gods sight, God punisheth the same diuersly, sometime in the getters themselues, (though that chance but seldome) and commonly in their successors: so as it may be truely saide, euill gotten goods seldome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper to the third generation. For some successors to those greedy vnconscionable getters, spend their goods lasciuiously, some by carding and gamning, some by foolish bargaining, some by prodigalitie, some by flatterie, some by credulitie, and some by other meanes: yet few or none were euer impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, for bestowing their goods charitably vpon the poore, for as Gods prophet wisely saith, from his youth vp till his olde age, hee neuer saw the righteous man forsaken, nor his seede begging bread. Psal. 37, 25. but in these our dayes wee are so wedded to worldly riches, that we will rather bestow twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pounds vpon our owne inordinate pleasures, then twentie

It therefore behoueth al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people, that haue regard to their saluation, first neuer to set their affections vpon worldly goods inordinately: secondly, to get their riches honestly and truely: thirdly, to dispense their riches liberally and chearefully, to all their needy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

                     <p>All writers agree in these two points. First, that weeks in the ninth chapter of Daniel, are not taken for common weekes, but for weekes of yeares, euen as we finde in Leuiticus, cap. 25. verse 8. where it is thus written: <hi>Thou shalt number seuen Sabbothes of yeeres vnto thee, euen seuen times seuen yeare: and the space of the seuen Sabbothes of yeares will be vnto thee nine and fortie yeares.</hi> Secondly, that the 70. weekes make seuentie times seuen, according to the phrase of Leuiticus, and so the iust number must be 49. yeares. In this point the very Rabbins of the Iewes doe agree with our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian interpreters and historiographers. And necessitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe enforceth vs to admit this glosse and exposition of the weekes: because otherwise the assertion of the angel of God notified to vs by the Prophet Daniel, shoulde be absurd and vtterly swaruing from the trueth.</p>

                     <p>That <hi>70.</hi> weekes doe neither signifie weekes, as a weeke importeth seuen daies; neither yet <hi>70.</hi> weekes only, as weekes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be taken for yeares; I prooue sundry waies: First, because an

angel needed not to haue been sent from heauen to instruct Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, if the <hi>70.</hi> weekes had no mysticall nor secret meaning far aboue the common and literall signification of the wordes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because the vision which Daniel had, and which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> came to expound, conteined the duration of the second and third monarchies (as appeareth in the eight of Daniel.) Which farre exceedeth both the number of <hi>70.</hi> weekes and <hi>70</hi> yeares. Thirdly, because Gods mercie doth seuen fold exceed his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which mercy he promiseth to his people, who were <hi>70.</hi> yeares in captiuitie; and that it shalbe accomplished in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of the true Messias Christ Iesus: By whom and through whom, wickednesse shall be finished, sinnes sealed vp, iniquitie reconciled, and our righteousnesse purchased euerlastingly. Fourthly, because no other interpretation of the <hi>70.</hi> weeks, can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> possibly accord the wordes of Daniel. Fiftly, because albeit <hi>S. Hierome, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullianus, Africanus,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and others, doe muche dissent in determining the beginning of the <hi>70.</hi> weekes; that is, in what yeare of what king we must beginne the supputation; yet doe they all iumpe in the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>70.</hi> weeks, as who al do constantly write that they connotate, <hi>490.</hi> yeares. Sixtly, because the supputation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie writer, bringeth vs to Christ,<note place="margin">

                     <p>That this opinion of <hi>Affricanus</hi> is grounded in the true meaning of the prophecie of Daniel, I will prooue by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> important reasons.

Thirdly, because no other opinion doth either iumpe with the death of Christ, or with the computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the monarchies.

                     <p>For the exact vnderstanding, howe 475. yeeres after the course of the sunne do make 490. yeeres after the course of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> moone; wee must obserue first, that the Hebrews did reckon the yere after the course of the moone, and so it was with them accomplished, in twelue lunarie moneths.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We must obserue secondly, that the Romanes also did rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the yeere after the course of the moone, vntill the dayes of Iulius Cesar that famous emperour; who by the aduise of the skilfull Astronomer Sosigenes, about 45. yeres before Christs sacred incarnation, ordained the yeere to be reckoned and kept, according to the course of the sunne.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We must obserue thirdly, that as that circle is called the yere of the sunne, in which the sunne doth accomplish it course, and consisteth of three hundred, threescore and fiue dayes, with some odde houres and minutes. And againe, as that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is called the yeere of the moone, in which the moone doeth accomplish her course, as she doth almost euery fourth weeke: so was that circle called the yeere of Saturnus, of Iupiter, of Mercurie, and of the rest of the planets, which they accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by returning to the same point; some within two yeres of the sunne, as Mars; some within twelue yeeres, as Iupiter; some within 30. yeeres, as Saturnus; and so in the remnant.</p>

By reason of which supputation, their yeeres lunarie are shorter then ours this day in Europe, by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eleuen dayes, with certaine odde houres, and minutes. And to haue some proportion with the course of the sunne, they vse to make embolismes and intercalation of one moneth euery third yeere, which moneth containeth three and thirtie dayes.<note place="margin">

                  <p>WHen the children of Israel were come againe out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, they, and all such as had forsaken heathenish ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ioyned themselues vnto them, kept the feast of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread seauen dayes with ioy. And after the temple was finished in the sixt yeere of Darius, the Priests, Leuites, and residue of the children of the captiuitie, kept the dedication thereof, Esdr. 6.16, 22. Concerning which festiuall dayes and the like, because many are superstitious, and some very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, it shall not be impertinent, in this place to set downe a briefe discourse thereof.</p>

                     <p>Of sabbaoths, one is legall, an other spirituall, the third celestiall. The spirituall sabbaoth is a ceasing from sinne, and is peculiar to the godly and regenerate: for with it dissolute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and carnally affected persons (such as Sardanapalus was) can haue no fellowship at all: albeit they professe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine externall obseruance of the ceremoniall sabbaoth, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no little therein. For as the apostle saith, Rom. 8.13. they


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1621:59"/>
that liue after the flesh must die, but they that mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the spirit, shal liue. This sabbaoth is not tied to any certain time or daies, but ought to be kept euery day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie intermission: for we must euer beleeue, euer hope, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loue, euer bring foorth the fruites of the spirit. Otherwise there should be no proportion, betweene the spirituall sabaoth, and the spirituall man.</p>

                     <p>The celestiall sabbaoth is it, in which wee shall rest both in body and soule, from the labours and vexations of this present mortalitie. Yet in this life we may labor in the body, although the mind regenerate do sabbatize vnto the Lord. For the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall sabaoth doth not so prohibite the regenerate from corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall labours, but that they may in due season exercise the same, for their own honest sustentation and of others. Yea, the minds euen of the godly, albeit they sabbatize in the Lord, yet are they oft afflicted, now w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tentations, now with errours, with tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, now with anguishes, with charitable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passions ouer their brethren. These are the imperfections of this present life, which the spirituall sabaoth cannot take away, but the celestiall sabbath in the heauenly Ierusalem, will vtterly make an ende thereof. For in that sabbath there shall be no place, to anie labours, errours, tentations, or miseries whatsoeuer. For the vision beatificall will wipe away all teares from our face. This is the pure and perfect sabbath, not of the bodie onely as the legall (whereof I am to speake by and by) nor of the mind only, as the spirituall, but of soule and body both together; which sabbaoth was shadowed in the olde law, begunne in the new lawe, and shall be accomplished in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where we shall celebrate the sabbaoth of all sabbaoths, world without end.</p>

                        </note> that our most gratious soueraigne Queene Elizabeth, and al her faithfull subiects, are flatte heretiques.

                        <p>I answere, that the Apostle exclaimeth not against euerie difference of dayes simply: but against that sole and onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which is obserued with opinion of necessitie or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. After which manner our christian sabboth or sunday is not obserued. For first, in the old testament, the old sabboth was a figure of things to be accomplished by Christ, yet in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> new testament, the new sabboth hath not that signification, but is onely obserued for decencie and comely order sake: without which the ministerie of the word either cannot be at all, or at least not so conueniently. Secondly, the Iewes obserued their sabboth of the seauenth day, as a part of Gods diuine worship,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> neither was it lawfull for them to change and alter the same: but we christians (who abhorre Iudaisme indeede,) keepe our sabboth day, not as a part of Gods worship, but for ciuill order sake, not with opinion of necessitie, but with such christian free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as we confesse it may be changed into another day. And because this libertie granted to the Christian church, is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vnderstood of many, whereof some be otherwise well learned, I purpose in God to proue the same effectually. First,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the holy scriptures: secondly, by the iudgement of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thirdly, by the latter writers. Touching the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> my first reason shall be affirmatiue, my second shall bee negatiue: the affirmatiue is this, whatsoeuer is abolished, doth not binde vs christians: but the lawe of Moses is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: therefore it doth not bind vs. The argument is in forme. The proposition is euident, because an obligation cancelled is not of force. And the assumption wherein resteth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie if there be any at all,<note place="margin">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1621:63"/>
and is become a flat ceremony of the Iewish law. For, this strict point (<hi>tempori obligari,</hi> to be tied to determined time) is that only circumstance or ceremonie, wherein the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish sabbaoth differeth from ours. Which point, I hope, wil shortly be more euident. My negatiue reson is this; No text of holy scripture, either in the olde or new testament can be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which commandeth to keep our christian sabbaoth, eyther vpon the first day, or vpon any other determinate day; therfore it remaineth in the libertie of the church to change that day, as the circumstances of times, places, &amp; persons shal require. The consequence is good, and so the consequent ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: for whatsoeuer is not commanded by the holy scriptures, but appointed by the law of man; all that may be altered euen by the law of man. The antecedent I prooue sundry wayes; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, because the places of scripture cited for this purpose, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do nor can prooue any such thing. For the Apostle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1. Cor. 16.2.</hi>
                           </note> willes only that collections be made for the poore when the congregation is assembled on some sabboth day. But he neither commandeth christians, to obserue the first day after the sabbaoth; neyther yet doth he affirme, that christians then kept their assemblies vpon that day. Yea, the learned and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous writer maister <hi>Caluin</hi> denieth flatly, that <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> doth either signifie the first day of the sabaoths, or the sunday. He opposeth himselfe against the patrones of that opinion, and saith flatly that the apostles did at that time keepe the Iewish sabbaoth.<note place="margin">

But saint <hi>Iohn</hi> neither saith, that christians must obserue that day for their sabbaoth, neyther yet that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles kept the same.<note place="margin">

Yea <hi>Erasmus</hi> auoucheth that the christian Penticost was not yet ordayned. And therefore doeth he by Penticost in that place vnderstand saint <hi>Paules</hi> abode at Ephesus to be <hi>50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> dayes. <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Martir</hi> vnderstand the Iewish penticost properly, bicause the christian penticost was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not yet appointed. I proue it secondly, bicause if the determina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the christian sabaoth had bin set downe in the scripturs, and appointed by the apostles; then would there not haue beene


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1621:63"/>
such controuersie about that matter, as was in the est and west Churches long after the Apostles time, which thing I haue shewed at large in my booke of Motiues. Thirdly, if it were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> granted, which can neuer be proued, that the Apostles then kept the sabboth vpon the first day, yet would it not follow, that christians must of necessitie this day obserue the same: which I will make good by sundry important reasons. First, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our sauiour Christ, in the verie institution of the sacrament of his body and bloud, did minister the same after supper, and yet are not wee tied to that practise, but do it before dinner. Now since the practise of Christ himselfe, doth not make a law to be kept of necessity; much lesse can the practise of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples impose such a law vppon vs. Therefore if it be graunted, that the Apostles kept their sabboth vpon the first of the weeke, as this day wee obserue, and that very laudably, yet may wee for our christian liberty, alter the day and keep it vpon another. Secondly, because Christ celebrated the holy communion of his body and bloud, in sweete and vnleauened bread;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Exod. 12. ver. 19.</hi>

Thirdly, because the Apostles and the whole church in their time,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act. 15. v. 6.20.</hi>

If answere be made, that this decree was not a perpetuall law, I replie directly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vide Socrat. 5. cap. 21.</hi>
                           </note> that much lesse doeth their practise binde the church for euer, to a strict ceremonie of the Iewes. Fourthly, because wee may iustly bee accused of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> superstition, wherewith the Apostle charged the Colossians and Galatians:<note place="margin">

My second proofe is this, <hi>Socrates</hi> a famous writer, who liued aboue <hi>1150.</hi> yeares sithence, hath these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words: <hi>Mens namque fuit Apostolorum, non de diebus sancire festiuitatum sed conuersationem rectam &amp; dei praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re culturam: mihi ergo videtur,</hi>

                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1621:64"/>For the meaning of the Apostles was not to make lawes for keeping holidaies, but to preach the word of God, and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. I therefore thinke, that as many other things grew to a custome in diuerse countries, so did also the keeping of Easter; because none of the apostles made any lawe for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> same. Out of whose wordes I do note first, that the scope of Christs apostles was this, to preach the word of God, not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> appoint holidays. Secondly, that the keeping of Easter (which is our sabbaoth) was after the custome of the countrey.

                     <p>Seleucus the sonne of Gryphus king of Syria warred against Cyzicenus the sonne of Antiochus Sedetes, whom after hee had taken him, hee put to death. By and by mortall wars arose between the brethren. Wherwith the Syrians were so grieued, and so annoyed with the ciuill warres; that they knew no other fitter meanes to redeeme their vexation, then to yeeld vp the kingdome to Tygranes the king of Armenia. Which Tygranes enioyed Syria vntill such time as hee

was ouercome of Pompeius, who deliuered Syria vp to the Romaines. This kingdome of Syria continued about 240. yeares, and was deliuered into the handes of the Romaines 17. yeares after Iulius Cesar was first Emperour of Rome.</p>

                     <p>Seleucus Callimcus, the sonne of Antiochus, hadde two sonnes; to wit, Seleucus surnamed Ceraunus, and Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Magnus. Seleucus Ceraunus liued but three yeres, and then left y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom to his brother Antiochus Magnus. Which Antiochus made warre against Ptolemeus Philopator the king of Egypt and his sonne Epiphanes, by meanes whereof the Iewes and church of God, was in continuall affliction. This Antiochus had the repulse in his first attempt; yet after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Ptolemeus, (who before his death commended his sonne to the protection of the Romaines,) he returned with a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into Egypt. By this occasion, long warres were betweene the Romaines and Antiochus. Hanniball and many Regions in Greece, ioyned themselues to Antiochus. Neuerthelesse hee was so often discomfited in battaile, that he was enforced to seek for conditions of peace. And besides this, hee was glad to send his sonne Epiphanes to Rome for an hostage. In the end, when he went about the sacking of the rich Temple of Belus in Syria, the multitude of the Citizens slewe him and all his guard.</p>
                     <p>The Iewes (saith <hi>Carion</hi>) liued in great peace, from the time of Alexander to Antiochus Magnus. But when warres beganne betweene the Assyrians and Egytians, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes being seated in the middes, were oppressed on both sides. At length (saith <hi>Iosephus</hi>) Antiochus was victor, and brought the Iewes vnder his subiection. But so soone as Philopator was dead, his sonne Ptolomeus Epiphanes sent a mightie armie into Syria; vnder the conduction of Scopa: who recouered cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Cities in Syria, and a good part of Iudea. Yet within a short space after, Antiochus skirmishing with Scopa, neere to Iordan, had the vpper hand, and tooke the cities againe from Scopa. Then the Iewes yeelded them selues to Antiochus, receiued his armie voluntarily within the walles, and affoorded

him large helpe against the garrisons of the said Scopa. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of which fauour, Antiochus dealt very fauourably with them: gaue them rich giftes, and graunted them libertie to call home againe, all the Iewes that were in dispersion.</p>

                     <p>Antiochus Epiphanes was hostage at Rome, where he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Example of the Romaines, flatterie, deceite, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad qualities, to accommodate himselfe to the time and maners of men. Hee was famous not for his vertues, but for his naughtie dealing. He was called (as some write) for his dissolute life, not <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> but <hi>Epimanes</hi>; that is, not noble, but madde. He beganne his reigne about 134. yeares after the death of Alexander; at which time his brother Seleucus ceased by death to reigne in Syria. At the same time Ptolemeus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes dyed in Egypt, leauing behinde him to young sonnes, Philometor and Physcon. Ptolemeus hadde these sonnes with his wife the queene Cleopatra, who was sister to Antiochus. Vnder this pretence Antiochus went into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and by faire speeches got the regiment, during the nonage of Philometor the yong prince. And when hee had contriued all thinges so, as he might take the kingdome vpon him at his pleasure, hee went to Hierusalem at the intreaty of Iason, who sought ambitiouslie to be made the high priest by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement: euen as popes of late yeares are made at Rome, as hereafter shalbe prooued. Where (as writeth <hi>Iosephus,</hi>) so soone as hee came, the gates were opened to him by men of his owne faction. Which vsurped dominion, hee exercised cruellie and sacrilegiously; neither sparing the goods nor the liues of those that willingly opened the gates vnto him.</p>

For though the highest and supreme power, authoritie, and dominion be in euerie monarchie, so as no other power, no not independent, is able to ouerrule or preuaile against the same; yet were there euer powers independent ouer and besides the said monarchies, not subiect to the iurisdiction thereof. In the time of the monarchie of the Babylonians or Assyrians,

worthie kings (though of lesse might and authoritie) raigned in Egypt, in Israel, in Greece, and else where. In the time of the Persian monarchie, the Macedonians and the Romaines had their authoritie; so likewise when the Greekes and Romaines hadde the monarchicall and imperiall seate with them, other kings had their seueral dominions, albeit very small in respect.</p>

Learned men of all nations had concourse vnto him, whome he euer receiued honourably, and rewarded them bountifully: he sought diligently the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of all nations, arts, and religions, and he perceiued that the Iewes were most ancient, and that no certaintie touching the creation of the worlde could be founde any where, but in their histories and among them. Wherefore hee desired of the Iewes that their scriptures might bee translated into the Greeke tongue, and that they woulde sende him <hi>72.</hi> of their best learned men, for that end and purpose.

                     </note> that the daily sacrifice should cease, and Gods trueth be troden vnder foote. And that the sinnes of the Iewes, were the cause of such horrible afflictions. Yet for the solace of Gods children (whom he neuer forsaketh finally) the time of the desolation is appointed and pronounced, in these obscure words: Vnto the euening and morning, two thousand and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth; then shall the sanctuarie be cleansed.</p>
                  <p>Sundrie (as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> witnesseth) trouble themselues miserably, about the exposition of this place. Some for, <hi>2300</hi> read <hi>2200,</hi> least sixe yeares and three monethes abound. Other some vnderstand the place of Antichrist, and that this shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie complete in him, which was spoken typically of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus. And this childish imagination, doe our late Iesuites and other papistes imitate: whose fantasticall interpretation was confuted by S. <hi>Hierome</hi> before they were borne.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Essenes were distinguished from other people, by their vsuall precise kind of abstinence, where and with whome soeuer they did conuerse: but our Iesuits are so farre from that, that if you meet them in the common inne vpon the friday at Douer, or other place of arriuall on what day soeuer; yea, though it be good fryday, they wil eate flesh with you for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,<note place="margin">

Iesuites as they professe to be. Thirdly, the Essenes were louers of peace; but our Iesuits are fosterers of rebellion; the Essenes sought quietnes, but our Iesuits stirre vp sedition in euerie countrey. Fourthly, the Essenes delt faithfully with all men, but our Iesuits deale vnfaithfully and glorie in the same. Their constant doctrine is, (marke wel my words,) that one may say and sweare cleane contrarie to his minde, so these three points concurre. First, if the iudge or magistrate before whom he sweareth, be not a competent iudge or lawfull magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; such a one is not in England by their opinion, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists onely excepted. Secondly, if the matter bee not an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their faith. Thirdly, if they dissemble to redeeme their vexation or trouble: and this kinde of dealing is with them, a godly politike equiuocation.<note place="margin">

                     </note> This rotten foundation once laide, they make many sandie buildings thereupon: for they will both say and sweare to their neighbours, iudges, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, here in England, that they haue not said masse, bin in such places, reconciled such persons, beene in such company, and so foorth, when for all that they haue daily practised the same; yet they perswade themselues, that all this may lawfully be done. The like execrable and plaine diabolicall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation they vse, when to auoid the danger imminent, they are content with their lippes to acknowledge our most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous soueraigne for their Queene, but in their hearts thinke the flat contrarie. Which thing is euident, by the detestable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of their pope Pius, whereof I haue spoken at large, in the preface of my Motiues. For in that deuillish curse proceeding fro the master deuil himselfe, her most excellent M. is not called the true and lawfull Queene, but the pretensed Queene of England; which their dissimulation, is the flat he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie of the Helchesits. Fiftly, the Essenes taught to yeelde faithfull seruice and obedience to all magistrates, specially to princes: but our Iesuites stirre vp their Popes to sowe sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to make warres against Princes, to excommunicate them, and to dispossesse them of their royall scepters. Sixtly, the Essenes professed humilitie as well in deede as in worde: but our Iesuites professe nothing lesse indeede, though they desire to be so reputed. This is to be proued many wayes, for

first, whereas euery secte of their Religion, the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, the Franciscans, the Carthusians, the Carmelites, the Capuchenes, and the rest, hath some one cardinall for their protector; the late hatched Iesuites being rumors to all the rest, cannot be content to submit themselues to any cardinall; for which their hautie mindes, they are iustly despised of them all. Againe, for a shew of humilitie, their professed fathers so termed, will haue no possessions: yet they labour closely tooth and naile, to get large possessions to the Seminaries, to their penitentiaries, readers, students, and nouices; of whome all, and their liuings, they are to dispose at their pleasures. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, albeit cardinalles be next to the pope, and aboue all, but the pope; and albeit also that our Allen was made cardinall by their procurement, that so he might aduance them at the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of England, which they thought certaine by their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike intended inuasion; yet were, and are they so hie minded, that such Iesuites, as they odly send into this realme, must haue greater priuileges then any that he can procure, although there be neuer so great oddes in the persons: yea, the Iesuits do this day so rule in this realme among the papists, as they may rather seeme Cardinalles or Popes, then humble friers professing pouerty. For they place and displace the rest of the Seminaries, at their good pleasures.

                  <p>Nero was adopted into the empire by Claudius, who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his mother Agrippina. He was so blodthirstie and cruel, that he caused his owne mother, his wife, his brother, and his deare friend Seneca, to be murthered cruelly.</p>

This seemeth incredible, but holy writ reporteth no lesse, as I haue prooued in the first book, and the eight chapter of the former part.

                  <p>Christs passion began not onely in his taking and deliuerie vnto death, but euen from the verie instant of his conception, and continued vntill hee yeelded vp the ghost. For as <hi>Ludol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> writes learnedly, when Christ, as God foresaw in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wisedome, the cruell and bitter torments, which hee was to suffer infallibly, hee coulde not but naturally sorrow for the same: as which were throughout all his body, throughout all the members of his body, and throughout all the inferior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his soule.

the prints of the nailes, whipping and oft scourging, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his blessed bodie. What he sustained in his works, cannot easily be expressed by the tongue of man. For they reuiled his diuine preaching, his most sacred conuersation, his miraculous operation. He was led as a lambe to be slaughtered, and as a theefe to be hanged; yet neither did he shew any impatience, nor sought any reuenge, albeit hee could haue caused a legion of Angels, to haue attended him at his only word: he was bound as a theefe, accused as a theefe, condemned as a theefe, he was crowned with a crowne of thornes among theeues, as if hee had beene the master theefe of all theeues; the iudge was iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the King was derided, the Lord of all lords was turmoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                  <p>CHrist was led out of the walles of the earthly Ierusalem, into Golgotha, a foule place of dead mens carkases, so to declare vncleannesse indeede, not of himselfe who was most holy, most pure, most innocent, but of vs most wretched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whose sins he willingly tooke vpon him, to the ende that

                     <p>For the exact explication of this graue obiection, wee must diligently obserue three things. First, that the Iewes deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as well the night as the day, into foure equall parts.

Thirdly, that the names of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure houres were these, the first, the third, the sixt, and the ninth, so that all the morning to nine of the clocke with vs, was called the first houre with them: from nine to twelue, the third houre; from twelue to three the sixt houre;<note place="margin">

to night, the ninth houre. I therefore answere to the obiection, that S. Iohn and saint Marke do well agree; neither is the one dissonant to the other: for when S. Marke saith, that Christ was crucified the third houre, he meaneth in the end thereof, which was about noone, or almost the sixt houre, as S. Iohn declareth it: for euerie one of their houres contained three of our houres as is alreadie said. And euery day with them, both began and ended at sixe of the clocke with vs. Where I note by the way, that these houres are sometimes dilated, &amp; made foure threes,<note place="margin">

                        </note> that the ternarie number doth not determine the apparitions in themselues, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of dayes and times in which they were made, for al ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions made in one &amp; the same day are reputed &amp; named one</p>

                     <head>The answere.</head>
                     <p>I answere, that God cannot by his absolute power, make Christes body to be in diuers places at once: not because there is any defect in God, who is omnipotent; but because contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is implied in the thing which should be done. Which point I haue prooued euidently, in the <hi>12.</hi> preamble of my Booke of Motiues. For the reasons there alleadged are effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, if they be applied to this purpose. In like maner I say, that two bodies cannot be in one place at once; because to haue parts without parts and to occupie place, is of the formall and intrinsecall conceit of euery organicall and quantitatiue bodie, such as Christes true body is. Whereupon S. <hi>Augustine</hi> said truely and learnedly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>August. ad Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum. Epist. 57.</hi>
                        </note> that if occupation or spaces of places be taken away from bodies, they shall lose their essence, and be no bodies at all. So then, the entrance of Christ into the house when the doors were shut, and also his comming out of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, when the stone was vnrolled away; neither doth nor can prooue, that two bodies were in one place at once, but that the doore and the stone gaue place for the time to Christes mightie power; like as the red Sea gaue place to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and they passed through the middest thereof. And as S. <hi>Peters</hi> chaines gaue place to his handes;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod. 14. ver. 21. Psal. 136. ver. 13. and 14. Act. 12. v. 7.10.</hi>
                        </note> and as the Iron gate opened to him of it owne accord. Furthermore, if Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die can be in ten thousand places at once, as the papistes impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently auouch; it must also follow, that it may be in infinite pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once, which is the heresie of the <hi>Vbiquitaries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For after this maner did S. <hi>Hierome</hi> reason against Iohn the Bishop of Hierusalem, when hee laboured to prooue that our bodies may liue without meate after the resurrection.<note place="margin">

This Manes dispersed his poyson, in very large circuits: First in Arabia, after that in Africa. This here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie increased so mightily, as it coulde not be quenched, by the space of two hundred yeares: this was the fundamentall ground of their false and hereticall doctrine, that there are two Gods, the one good, and the other bad, and yet both to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. This doctrine seemed plausible to mans reason, at the first publishing thereof: for since God is good of his owne nature, and yet euill aboundeth in the worlde, it seemeth to followe necessarily, that as there is a good God, so there must also bee a peculiar euill God, equall to the good God in power and eternitie.</p>

                  <p>The secret subtiltie, wherwith Arrius fought to deceiue the godly and most christian Emperor, was this: Arrius wrote his execrable opinion of Christ, in a peece of paper kept close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder his arme holes: that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Nestorius his heresie consisted in this, that since the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed virgin was a woman, God could not be borne of her, and consequently she ought not to be called the mother of God. For although he neither denied in Christ, the deitie nor the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, yet did hee place two persons in Christ together with the two natures: and consequently he denied the wonderful hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticall vnion, which our christian faith acknowledgeth.</p>
                  <p>Arrius held, that Christ was only man, wholly voide of the nature and person of God: but Nestorius helde, that Christ had both the nature and person of God, as also both the nature and the person of man: which last was the formalitie of his heresie, and therefore ought well to be obserued of the reader.

Secondly, we know &amp; they know, that the Lords supper in the Romish church is ministred vnder one kind contrary to Christs institution, yet neither we nor they can tel, when, where, and by whom, that execrable custom first began. Thirdly, we know &amp; they know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> priuat masse hath bin long practised in the church of Rome; yet can we neither tell, when, where, nor by whom it first began. But this we are assured of, that it is repugnant to Christs institution, wholy dissonant from apostolicall doctrine, and vtterly condemned by all approued antiquitie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we know &amp; they know, that their reformed Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans (now commonly called Capuchens) can tell right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that their other dissolute Franciscans haue swarued fro their ancient order, albeit they can neither tell, when, where, nor by whom, that dissolution first began: but they proue it <hi>àposteriori,</hi> by their ancient rules manifestly. And euen so doe we proue by the holy scriptures, (the true touchstone of all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie) that the papists haue swarued from apostolicall doctrine, albeit we could not (as yet we can) assigne the time, place, and persons; when, where, &amp; by whom such antichristian alteration began.</p>

I say secondly, that albeit the visible church cannot want <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> materiall succession; yet cannot that succession, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, yeelde anie sound argument of true faith and religion. In regard hereof, your owne doctor <hi>Nicolaus de Lyra,</hi> after he hath told vs that many Popes haue swarued from the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, and become flat apostataes, concludeth in these wordes,<note place="margin">

Thirdly, our bishops are made in such forme and order, as they haue euer beene accustomed, a few popish, superstitious, and beggerlie ceremonies omitted, which of late yeeres had crept into the church; that is to say, be free election of the Chapiter, by consecration of the archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and other his associates, &amp; by the admission of the prince.</p>

But thereupon will it not follow I assure you, that the true church of God was with you and not with vs: for no more can be inferred vpon your reason, but that there remained a certaine externall face, of the visible church still with you, that is to say, a mingled materiall succession of place and persons, without the formall Euangelicall succession of trueth and doctrine.</p>

                  <p>The reason hereof is this, because God promised to giue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies pastors to his visible church: but he neuer promised this, to put the truth alwaies in their mouthes.

                  <head>The answere.</head>
                  <p>I say first, that albeit Gods wil be one as himselfe is one, willing by his owne essence and by one eternall and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act, whatsoeuer he willeth; yet is his will said to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> aswel of the holy fathers, as of the schooledoctors.

I say secondly, that though Gods will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent and will of good pleasure, bee euer accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vndoubtedly; yet is his will antecedent and will of signe, oftentimes neglected and left vndone.

                     </note> but they would not haue it so. Thirdly, God would haue all men to be saued, as Paul beareth witnesse; and yet we know by the holy gospel, that the greater part shalbe damned.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>I say thirdly, that Gods will mentioned in S. Paule, and now obiected against my resolution; is only <hi>voluntas signi</hi> (his will of signe:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Voluntas signi non beneplaciti.</hi>
                     </note>) and not <hi>voluntas beneplaciti</hi> (his will of good pleasure:) and therefore it can neuer be effectually concluded out of this text, (which hitherto hath euer been reputed the strong bulwarke of poperie, and either dissembled or lightly passed ouer by the grauest writers;) that the pastors of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church alwaies teach the trueth, and neuer swarue from the same. Thus more plainly for the simple and ignorant sort. When the apostle saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ephes. 4. v. 14.</hi>
                     </note> that God placed pastors and doctors in the church, that the people be not carried away with false doctrine; he neither meaneth that the pastors shall alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly teach the trueth, nor that the people shall alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly embrace the truth. I proue it, because the apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth indefinitely and indifferently, of all teachers and of al hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, of al shepheardes and of all sheepe, neither excepting one nor other; and yet both ye know and we know, that many prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers preach false doctrine,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Marke this well for Christes sake.</hi>
                     </note> and that many hearers embrace the same. Whereupon it followeth necessarily, that if the Apostle meant as ye woulde haue him to meane; then Christes intent and purpose shoulde be frustrate indeede, which yet is it that your selues impugne. The apostle therfore meaneth only this, to declare <hi>voluntate signi,</hi> what he would haue his shepheards and sheepe to doe; albeit <hi>voluntate beneplaciti,</hi> the same be not euer accomplished.</p>
                  <p>This my explication of S. Paules meaning, is confirmed not only by the holy Scripture, but also by the expresse testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of renowmed popish writers. Touching the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; First, it is euident, that God would haue al men saued, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> so saith the apostle: <hi>Deus vult omnes homines saluos fieri.</hi>

And it skilleth not if one say, that a councel cannot erre, because Christ praied for his church, that it should not faile. For I say, that although a general councel represent the whole vniuersall church, yet in trueth there is not truely the vniuersall Church,<note place="margin">

                     </note> but representatiuely. For the vniuersall church consisteth, of the collection of all the faithful. Whereupon all the faithfull in the world, make this church vniuersall, wherof Christ himself is the head. The pope is the vicar of Christ, but not truely the head of the church, as noteth the glosse vpon the Clementines; which saith notably, that when the pope is dead, the Church


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1621:108"/>
wanteth not an head, and this is that Church which cannot erre. Whereupon it is possible, that the true faith of Christ might remaine in one alone, and so it may truely be said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faith faileth not in the church. Christ before his passion praied for Peter, that his faith should not faile; therefore the church is not said to faile, neither to erre, so long as the true faith abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in one onely.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Out of these wordes I note first, that by the opinion of the great Papist Panormitan, a meere lay mans iudgement euen in matters of faith, ought to be accepted and receiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the popes constitution; if the lay man bring better reasons out of the scriptures,<note place="margin">

Which saying doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse is the foundation of the doctrine, this day established in the church of England, &amp; in all other reformed churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. Neither doe we craue more of the papistes, then their owne doctors will affoord vs. I note secondly, that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> councell may erre, because it is not the catholike or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall church indeed.</p>
                  <p>I note thirdly, that that church which cannot erre, is not the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> visible companie of pastors and doctors, but the inuisible socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all the faithfull in the worlde. Where by (inuisible) I meane not, that any of the elect is inuisible in his corporal consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, but that the vniuersall congregation of the faithfull as vniuersall, is inuisible: that is to say, that no one mortall man seeth or knoweth all true beleeuers in the church.

                  <p>I aske thee (O Pope Luci) of what church thou vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest that, which thou tellest vs in this place: to wit, that the church cannot erre. For if thou vnderstandest it of the Pope himselfe, it is verie certaine that the Pope may erre.

Out of these words of Pope Lucius I note first, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when the Pope affirmeth that the church cannot erre, then his own deere and faithful interpreter answereth roundly, that that priuiledge is not granted to the Pope, but to the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the faithfull.

I therefore conclude with S. Paul, S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome, Anselmus, Syluester, Panormitanus,</hi> the Popes owne canon-law, and popish interpreters vpon the same, that the congregation of the faithfull, is the piller and ground of truth, and that church which cannot erre.</p>

which are or shall be to the worlds end, and this Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sheweth by two reasons:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because not onely the Apostles, but others together with them, should be his witnesses in Hierusalem and Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria; albeit Christ spoke that of them, touching the bearing witnesse of him; as he spoke this to them, concerning his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual presence. And therefore as hee spoke the other to all the faithful, so did he also this: that is, promised his inuisible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, not onely to the Apostles or pastors of the church, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all the faithful in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because Christ spoke that to his Apostles as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining onely to them, which for al that did nothing at al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them: as if he had saide; it is not a good reason to denie Christs presence to the whole church, because hee vttered the words onely to the Apostles. For since hee spoke that to the Apostles which pertained nothing to them but onely to others; much more might he speake that to them, which belonged to them with others.</p>

                  <p>Al this I proue by two euident demonstrations: first because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christ himself doth so expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d himself, in these words folowing


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1621:111"/>
He shal teach you all things, and bring all things to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance which I haue told you: which saying must bee wel noted,<note place="margin">

                     </note> because the latter words are a plaine declaration of the former; as if Christ had said: all things which the holy ghost shall teach the apostles after my departure,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, because the best learned popish doctors, do holde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the same opinion. For <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> hath these words: <hi>Nec vllas in fide nouas reuelationes ecclesia habet</hi>:<note place="margin">

For first the truth enforceth you to grant (as I haue proued in my Motiues) that your Pope may holde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> false opinions in matters of faith, either sitting in his chaire, or walking in his garden, or looking about him in his <hi>Bel-vidê<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> or riding on his white palfrey, or lying in his bed waking, or at the table eating, or while he giueth pardons and Iubilees. Secondly, that hee may vtter the same errour and false faith,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> secretly to his friends. Thirdly, that he may publish the same in his Extrauagants, Epistles, and printed bookes. Which <hi>3.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> grants sufficiently ouerthrow your popes supposed priuilege, if nothing else could be said against the same.<note place="margin">

                     </note> Concerning Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters faith, it is certaine, that Christ prayed as well for al the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect as for Peter, and directed his words not to Peter, as to one priuat man, but as to one representing the whole church: and consequently, whatsoeuer Christ said or did touching Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters faith, must perforce bee vnderstoode of the faith of the whole church; which, as is proued, shall neuer faile indeede. This being once made good, your mightie obiection (wherin ye glorie much,) wil bee of no force at all. My first reason is contained in Christs owne words, which are these:<note place="margin">

In which words it is cleare, that Christ praieth onely for Peter, but for al his disciples as wel as for him; and he sheweth the equitie of his petition, by sundrie reasons. First <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> because hee prayeth for Gods friends. Secondly, because he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prayeth for Gods elect. Thirdly, because of the vnspeakeable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vnion, betweene his father and himselfe. Fourthly, because he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is glorified in them, &amp; so is his father also.

                  <head>The second Proposition.</head>
                  <p>Marriage was lawfull for all priests and other ministers of the church, during all the time of the olde Testament. This proposition is cleere, to all such as diligently reuolue the holie Bibles; neither doe I know any learned papist, that by worde or writing denyeth the same. For the holie prophet Ieremie was the son of Helkiah,<note place="margin">

                     </note> who was one of the priests that were at Anathoth. Hophni and Phinehas were the sonnes of Heli the priest, Sephora was the daughter of Iethro the priest of Midian: and Saint Iohn Baptist was the sonne of Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the priest, to whome the angell of God was sent to bring him glad tidings. The tidings were these, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife should beare him a sonne,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc. 1. vers. 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19.</hi>
                     </note> albeit she was barren, and well stricken in age. And he receiued the message while he was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in prayer, and in burning of incense at the right side of the al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>are. Whereby it clearely appeareth, how acceptable the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> marriage of priests was then in Gods sight. For first, Saint Iohn was a very holie man, and the precursor of our Sauiour Christ. Secondly, Zacharias and Elizabeth his wife were


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1621:114"/>
both iust, and walked in Gods commaundements without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe. Thirdly, the angell of God was sent to Zacharias, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> tell him that his wife should conceiue and beare him a sonne.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Fourthly, this message was brought him euen then, when he executed his priestly function. All which circumstances well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> obserued, do proue vndoubtedly, that the marriages of priests are honourable in Gods sight.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="proposition">
                  <head>The third Proposition.</head>
                  <p>Marriage is lawfull for priests and other ministers of the church, euen now in the time of the new testament. Where by the word (priests) I vnderstand all such as are admitted to preach Gods worde, and to administer the holy sacraments. This proposition may be prooued, by many waightie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reasons. First, because no text in the new Testament can be alleadged, which debarreth the ministers thereof from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the benefite of marriage graunted in the olde. If any Papist will say that there is some such text in the new testament, let him shew that text, and wee will beleeue him. In the meane season, hee must pardon vs, if wee giue not credite to his words.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because the apostle prooueth in two seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that all priests may be married. Where, what I meane by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> priests, is already shewed. The first place is that reason which Saint Paule maketh to Timothie, and is contained in these wordes: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, A Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop therefore must be vnreproueable, the husband of one wife.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1. Tim. 3. vers 2.</hi>
                     </note> This text of holy scripture (if it be throughly marked) doeth plainely conuince, that it is lawfull for a Bishop to marry. Let vs therefore exactly examine the true meaning and sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>The Papists to maintaine their diabolicall doctrine of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, would rack this text to those wiues, which bishops had before they were admitted to ecclesiasticall function,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A shameful wresting of the holy scripture.</hi>
                     </note> but that is a forced and violent exposition, contrary to the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the apostle. For Saint Paule among other vertues conuenient for a Bishoppe, requireth this for one, that hee bee not coupled to more wiues then one at once. Nneither is


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1621:115"/>
it possible to imagine any other true sense, of this present text. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For first, it is not of necessitie, that a bishop haue a wife; and yet doth the Apostle say, that hee must be the husband of one wife. For both they and wee agree in this, that one may be a lawfull bishop, and yet liue vnmarried.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, the apostle speaketh in the present tence (must be the wife:) and not, (must haue been the wife) so that the glosse of the papistes must needes be false, who expound the wordes, of the time already past.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Apostles wordes must needes be verified, of mariage in some sense. But first, it cannot be meant of mariage already past, because the verbe is of the time present. Again, it cannot be meant of the necessitie of marriage, because a Bishop may lawfully liue vnmarried.<note place="margin">

                     </note> Therefore thirdly, this must needes be the true meaning thereof: to wit, that a bishop may marry if he list, but yet not haue many wiues at one and the same time, as the Iewes and the Gentiles had. And to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position doe accord not only S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi> but also their owne deere Cardinall Caietane.</p>

marriage; declaring that it is faultlesse, and a thing so pretious, as a man may with it be promoted to the holy functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a bishop. Thus saith S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> whose wordes are so plaine and pithie, as no papist is able to wrest and writhe them to serue his turne. For first,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>S.

Which argument were vaine and friuolous, if <hi>Saint Chrysostome</hi> should speake of a Bishops marriage, while he was a meere lay man. For hereupon would it follow necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that tyrannie, persecution, adultery, and murder, should be honourable, aswell as honest wedlocke. I prooue it,<note place="margin">

Thirdly, as tyrannie is a great sin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lbeit once a tyrant may afterward become an apostle: and as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> adultery and murder be greeuous crimes, although once an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer and once a murderer may afterward bee an holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; euen so doubtlesse, marriage may be an vnlawfull thing; albeit once a married man, may afterward be an holy bishop.

                     </note> hee foorthwith giueth euident markes of the mysterie of iniquitie, which is maintained in the false church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, in whose synagogue the highest points of religion are the prohibition of marriage and of meates. And who seeth not this day, this to bee the state of the church of Rome? as in which church they are specially, and in a manner onely reputed religious, who obey the prohibition of marriage and also of meates.</p>
                  <p>And it will not helpe the Papistes to say, as their woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manner is; that they neither prohibite marriage gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nor as an vnlawfull thing. For first, saint <hi>Paul</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not generally of marriage, but of the precise marriage of Bishoppes, Priests, and Deacons. This doe I prooue, because so soone as hee had declared the duetie of Bishoppes, Priestes, and Deacons, with their wiues and children; by and by in the beginning of the next chapter, hee addeth; that in the latter dayes marriage shall bee prohibited, by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the deuill.

If therefore Lay men be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to abstaine, that they may be heard when they pray, how much more ought a Priest alwaie to be readie in the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of cleanelinesse, lest either hee offer sacrifice, or bee constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to baptize? who if hee be pulluted with carnall concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, what shall hee doe? shall hee bee excused? With what conscience doth hee thinke to bee heard? when it is saide, all things are cleane to the cleane, but to the polluted and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles nothing is cleane. Wherefore I exhort, admonish, and require, that this rebuke bee taken away, which euen the Gentils may iustly reproue: for they that are in the flesh, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not please God.</p>

                  <p>Whether therefore he be priest, deacon, or subdeacon, it is cleare, that such as are within the aforenamed orders, may lawfully haue the vse of matrimonie.</p>
                  <p>Out of these words of <hi>Gratianus,</hi> who was a papist, and a great fauourer of the pope; I inferre against the doctrine of the pope, that priestes, Deacons, and Subdeacons, may not onely bee married, but euen while they be married, haue the vse of holie wedlocke, which is a point doubtlesse, verie well woorthie the obseruation.

                  <p>I prooue it secondly, because Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who liued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> aboue three hundred yeeres after <hi>Pelagius,</hi> was so farre from disquieting married priests,<note place="margin">

For to the vowe which they call annexed, they are no more bound in the weast church then in the east. And yet all of the east church are free, as you haue heard in the sixt proposition.

For by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which is in the solemne vow, the person vowing is not inabled to another state, either by the law diuine, or law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; because Deacons, and Subdeacons deliuer vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to God, by the solemne vow of chastitie and obedience; and for all that, the pope often dispenseth with them, as <hi>Soto</hi> graunteth.</p>

S. Paul willed the promise of single life, because they could not both serue the church and their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; but the pope requireth the vow of single life, thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> pharisaically to merit heauen. S.

promise was that, which these widowes made when they were married, to wit, that they would be louing, diligent, carefull, &amp; obedient to their husbands; and aboue all the rest, keep their coniugall faith. The third faith was that, which these widowes made to the bishop &amp; the whole church; to wit, that they would execute their deaconship honestly &amp; faithfully, &amp; constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer therein to the end. The yonger widowes waxing wanton against Christ, did not only breake their last promise, forsaking the ministery of the church: but their first and most holy promis made in baptisme, while they departing from the purity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest life and religion, consecrated themselues to paganisme and infidelitie, and so purchased to themselues Gods wrath &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation.<note place="margin">

For this is euident by the words of the <hi>15.</hi> verse of the <hi>5.</hi> chapter, from whence the obiection is taken: where the apostle saith, that some widowes are already turned back (from Christ their guide, to whom they had dedicated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in baptisme, &amp; folowed) after satan. It wil not serue the papists to say after their wonted maner, that marriage breaketh not our promise made in baptisme.<note place="margin">

                        </note> For albeit the faith of baptisme be not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by marrying absolutely and simply, yet is it indeede broken by marrieng against Christ; that is, by marrying in such maner, as they renounce christianitie.

                     <p>I say fiftly, that these words (for when they shall wax wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton against Christ, they wil marry) do euidently proue, that S.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Paul meaneth the promise made in baptisme: and I desire the gentle reader to marke my discourse attentiuely: for this obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the bulwarke, to defend this article of poperie.</p>
                     <p>I therefore note first, that these foure things are really distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in S.

For in being wanton against Christ, they brake their first faith made in baptisme, that is, they perfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med not that obedience they promised in baptisme; &amp; in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that obedience they deserued eternal death; and so they had damnation, bicause they were wanton against Christ. S.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I say sixtly, that saint Paul is so far from condemning mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in the yonger widowes after their promise or vow which the papists would most willingly father vpon him, as he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to marry, euen after such their promise or vowe. I prooue it, (note wel what I say) because so soone as hee hath willed the yonger widowes to marry in the <hi>14.</hi> verse; foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in the <hi>15.</hi> verse, he yeeldeth the reason of that his aduise, to wit, because certaine are already turned backe after Satan. Now, in the <hi>15.</hi> verse he must needs speake of such widowes,


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1621:129"/>
as were receiued into the ministerie of the church; because none could be turned backe from that, to which they neuer were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: he therfore speaketh likewise of the betrothed widows, in the next verse before; which I make euident three wayes; first, because otherwise his illation in the <hi>15.</hi> verse, shoulde be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> foolish &amp; friuolous; foolish, because it could haue no connexion with the <hi>14.</hi> verse; friuolous, for that it could not conclude his purpose: secondly, because he had already in the <hi>11.</hi> verse char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the bishop Timothy, not to receiue any widow vnder the age of <hi>60.</hi> yeeres. This conclusion therefore being made touching the widowes not yet admitted, he goeth forward and giueth his aduise, for the yonger widowes then receiued of the church: as if he had saide; for as much as some of the yonger sort haue alreadie beene wanton and followed sathan, and there is also danger in the rest: I decree, that hereafter none vnder <hi>60.</hi> yeares be receiued; and I exhort the yonger alreadie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and desirous to marrie, to betake themselues to holie wedlocke, to bring forth children, to be housewiues, and so to giue no occasion to the aduersarie to speake euill. Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> because otherwise Saint Paul should equiuocate verie grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in one and the selfe same reason: giuing one signification to the same word in the premisses, &amp; an other in the consecution.

I say secondly, that S.

                     </note> whose wordes he alledgeth in the next canon. Secondly, that since marriage is of force after orders in a deacon, it is so also in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, priestes, and the rest. The reason is euident, because the vow is of the same force in all: neither can or will any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned papist say the contrary.</p>
                  <p>I say fiftly, that it skilleth not much what many councels say; as I haue prooued at large in my booke of Motiues: yet here I adde one decree out of one of their councels, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the controuersie manifest.

selues from marriage al the daies of our life: and I wil proue the same, by the best approued popish doctours, and by the doctrine established in the Romish church, and that because the replie containeth such matters as is no lesse intricate then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I therefore say first, that it is a verie wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly act, for a man to expose himselfe to sinne. Thus much is granted, by the vniforme consent of all learned Papists: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all the Summists agree in this, that those arts which can seldome or neuer be vsed without sin, are altogether vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Gregorie surnamed the Great, as hee was vertuous and learned, so was he the bishop of Rome, and for that respect, of great account among the Papists; though he were no papist in deede, as now a daies papists are so knowne and called: thus doth he write:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sunt enim pleraque negotia, quae sine peccatis exhiberi aut vix aut nullatenus possunt:</hi>

                     <hi>quae ergo ad peccatum implicant, ad haec necesse est vt post conuersionem animus non recurrat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there be sundrie arts, which can hardly or not at all bee practised without sinne: therefore after our conuersion wee may not haue recourse to such, as anie way draw vs to sinne. Nowe let vs applie this to the matter in hand, for it is most certaine that he exposeth himselfe to sinne, that bindeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe neuer to vse the remedie against sinne: for example, if a man should vow, that hee would neuer vse the helpe of surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or phisicke, that man shoulde doubtlesse expose himselfe to the perill of death: none but senselesse bodies, will or can this denie: So in our case of single life, because God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted matrimonie for a remedie against sinne, so saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to auoide fornication, let euerie one haue his wife, and let euerie woman haue her husband.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I say secondly, that it is a great sinne, to debarre and stop the course of naturall propension: yea this is a thing so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,<note place="margin">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1621:134"/>
before sinne in the state of innocencie, and so hee that maketh a perpetuall vow of chastitie feeling in himselfe this propension, committeth a greeuous sinne.</p>
                  <p>I say thirdly, that it is a damnable sinne to tempt God, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is written in Gods booke,<note place="margin">

This exposition is so agreeable to the text as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> willingly admitteth the same. Nowe let vs applie it to the matter in hande. He that refuseth ordinarie meanes, and so committeth himselfe to perill, tempts God grieuously, as both the popish glosse and <hi>Aquinas</hi> grant; but the ordinarie meanes to auoide fornication is marriage saith the Apostle:<note place="margin">

I say first the vow annexed, because the priests <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> do not formally vow single life, but the Pope hath annexed it to their orders by his wicked decree. I say secondly, the vowe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> imposed, because the priestes indeede woulde willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their libertie stil.

                  <p>Whereas our whole life is diuided into these two kindes, to wit, into matrimonie and single life, (whereof the one as it is more excellent and diuine, so is it also of greater labour &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the other more base and vile, but subiect to lesse danger) (Gorgonia) eschewing the discommodities of either state, hath chosen and gathered into one, what commoditie soeuer was in both, that is, the sublimitie of the one and the securitie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She was chaste and nothing proud, tempering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of single life with marriage, and shewing in very deede, that neither of the twaine is such of it owne nature, as can eyther ioyne vs wholy to God, or to the worlde, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw vs wholy from God or from the world. So verily as the


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1621:137"/>
one ought of it owne nature be auoided, and the other to bee required: but that it is the minde that doth rightly moderate both marriage and virginitie, and that either of them must bee by reason composed of the artificer as certaine vnwrought stuffe, &amp; so be made a vertue. These are the words of this great clarke and holy father, in which he hath learnedly described the natures and properties, both of marriage &amp; virginitie; which I haue alleaged at large, because they are worthy of our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and doe exactly explaine this intricate and important matter. Out of them therefore I note first, that as virginitie is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> more excellent one way, so is it more dangerous another way, and so all things considered, there is no preeminence in either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the twaine, at least not in virginitie. I note secondly, that as matrimonie is more secure and free from perill, so may it also include al the good that is in virginitie. For as S. Gregorie saith, Gorgonia being a married woman, ioyned the sublimitie &amp; most excellent part of virginitie, with the securitie of hir chast wedlocke. I note thirdly, that by S. Gregories discourse, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is to be preferred before virginitie. For al the good parts of virginitie may be included in chast wedlocke, not so the good parts of wedlocke in virginitie, that is, virginity is euer subiect to perill, from which wedlocke abideth free. I adde hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that the world may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued without virginity, although wedlocke be necessarie for the same. I note fourthly, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of it owne nature, can neither ioyne vs to God, nor withdraw vs from God, but is as marriage in that respect. I note fiftly, that neither wedlock nor yet virginity is a virtue of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it selfe, but a peece of vnwrought stuffe, which then becommeth a vertue, when it is perfectly laboured by the worker: and consequently, that virginitie hath no such perfection and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite as our papists doe ascribe vnto it.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>It followeth secondly vppon the foure obseruations, that if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> virginitie were a better good as it is considered in it selfe, (the contrarie whereof is proued) yet woulde it not follow that it were a better good,<note place="margin">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1621:137"/>

                  <p>It followeth thirdly, that such a vowe cannot be of a better good, because it is not of faith.

If they answere that they know God will giue them the gift for asking; I replie, that so to say is great presumption: For Christ himselfe saith, that all cannot liue single, but they onely to whom it is giuen:<note place="margin">

                  <p>I say eightly, that a lawfull and godly vowe must bee of such things as are in our owne power, &amp; that otherwise it is of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> no force at all. For this cause, the vowes that children made were of no force in the law of Moses, so long as they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gouernment of their parents.

And yet is it euident, that Chastitie is not in the power of man, for so Christ himself hath taught vs. And it is a friuolous euasion to say, that by prayer it may be obtained.

                  <p>For thou saiest, that our Lord hath honoured the glorie of continencie with the freedome of election, saying; He that can take, let him take; as if this were taken not by Gods gift, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> free will of man, &amp; thou concealest that which Christ said before, al men doe not receiue this word, but they to whom it is giuen.

Thus saith S. <hi>Austen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of these wordes I gather first, that <hi>Iulianus</hi> held this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> opinion, that euery one might liue a chaste single life, at his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> pleasure.

                  <p>But our papists in great furie exclaime bitterly against vs &amp; say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God denieth vs nothing, that is necessary for our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which I willingly admit, telling them withall, that we may attaine eternall saluation, aswell by marriage as by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life.<note place="margin">

                  <p>I say ninthly, that vowes which are not voluntary and free from all coaction, are not only wicked, but of no force at all. So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> write the best popish doctors, <hi>Aquinas, Lombardus,</hi>

And who knoweth not that Romish priestes, moonkes and others of that irreligious crew, doe yeeld to the perpetuall vow of single life by coaction, and <hi>reluctante conscientia?</hi> it is manifest doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in all such as want the supernaturall gift. For since they can neither freely be admitted to the ecclesiasticall ministerie, nor yet professed in the monasterie, and so enioy the expected commodities thereof: at length they condescend by popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, to admit the vowe of single life. For howsoeuer God shal bestowe his gift of continent single life, it is decreed before hand, that the yonger brothers of the house of Farnesus, &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna, Vrsinus, and such like, shalbe cardinals bound to single life. So is it commonly intended by gentle men, otherwise ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and of good worship, that their yonger sonnes shalbe the parsons of such and such fat liuings, wherof themselues are the patrones; although they be as vnfit for the popish annexed vow, as euer was Sardanapalus that effeminate wanton.</p>
                  <p>I say tenthly, that al vowes are wicked and vnlawful which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> are either of things indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or of vnlawful things, or against any commandement.

absteine from wedlocke, let him so doe; but he that cannot, let him marry a wife, because that is expedient for his saluation. S, Paul doth so interpret Christ, in other wordes equiualent.

Thirdly, virginitie vowed as a worke of supererogation, of merite, and perfection, is a wicked and superstitious thing, and yet is this the popishe maner of vowing the same: for thus writeth <hi>Viguerius,</hi> their learned professor of diuinitie and <hi>Dominican</hi> frier.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Pope Hildebrand togither with the Bishoppes of Italie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in frequent Synodes, that after the ordinaunces of olde canons, priestes shoulde not haue wiues; and that suche as had wiues, shoulde either put them awaie, or bee depriued of their liuinges; and that none shoulde be admitted to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of priesthoode, but hee that woulde professe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual

vow of single life. Against this decree the whole faction of the clergy stormed wonderfully, exclaming that Hildebrand was mad &amp; a flat heretike, as who had forgotten the words of the Lord, who saith that all cannot liue continent, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, hee that cannot abstaine, let him marrie; for it is better to marrie, then to be burnt; and would violently compel men to liue like angels; and while hee denied the accustomed course of nature, gaue libertie to fornication and vncleannesse. Out of which wordes I note first, that this Lambertus was a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Monke, and a great patron of poperie, which I proue by two reasons; first, for that hee tearmed it a faction, to withstand Pope Hildebrands wicked decree. Again, because he affirmeth the late prohibition of priests marriage, to bee according to the old canons, which canons for al that, were not before the daies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the late Pope Syricius, as I haue proued. I note secondly, that since this Lambert was a great and zealous papist, all must needs be of good credit, that he saith against the papists, and popish doctrine. I note thirdly, that priests were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in Germanie, aboue one thousand seuentie yeeres after Christ, that is, till the time of this wicked Hildebrand. I note <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fourthly, that it was so strange a thing in those dayes to speake against the mariage of priests in Germanie, that they reputed Pope Hildebrand a madde man and an heretique, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the same. And yet such is the fondnesse and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the common sorte this daye, that they deeme them mad men and heretikes, who speake in defence thereof. I note <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> fiftly, that all the learned in Germanie proued the Pope an heretike, by the flatte testimonie of Christ and his Apostle. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> note sixtly, that by the verdict of all the learned in Germanie, that great and goodly country, Pope Hildebrand did not only enforce them violently against their auncient custome, but withall did open the window to al filthie liuing. Priests were also married in our owne countrey of England, till the late dayes of the saide Pope Hildebrand, if wee will beleeue our owne English Chronicles.</p>

Out of which wordes of Panormitan, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>(who was their canonist, their Abbot, their archbishop, their cardinall,) I note first, that the prohibition of marriage in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priestes, is neither of the substance of the ministerie nor by the law of God, but onely enforced by the law of man.

Though our latter papists to hide their shame if it could be, do violently interpret him of the pain. I note fourthly, that this good father <hi>Maliface</hi> brought again the Iewish ceremonial law.

perforce, that he neither speaketh of popish pardoning.</p>
                  <p>I say thirdly, that the pardoning whereof S.

This much I prooue out of saint Paules owne words, which are these; It is sufficient to the same man, that he was rebuked of many; so now contrariwise ye ought rather to forgiue him and comfort him, lest he should be swallowed vp with ouermuch heauines. Wherefore I pray you, that ye would confirme your loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. After this graue and godly exhortation, he adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth these words; To whom ye forgiue any thing, I forgiue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: as if hee had saide; if yee be content to receiue him into the church againe, I am therewith well pleased. For he yeeldeth two reasons why the church of Corinth ought to pardon the excommunicate person: the one is, for that hee seemed to haue giuen sufficient signes of his vnfained repentance: the other is, lest too much rigour of correction should bring him to despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For which cause S. Paul requesteth them to declare the consent of the whole congregation, that hee was taken againe for a brother and pardoned for his offence. So then S.

For albeit <hi>Syluester</hi> seemeth here to ascribe the originall of some kind of pardoning to Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie yet doth he onely tel that by heare-say; and besides that, Gregorie either gaue no pardons in deede, (which is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) or at the most, he pardoned after saint Paules manner, some part of seuerity inioyned by the church.</p>
                  <p>I note fourthly, that the chiefest ground vppon which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> pardoning is built, is the bare and naked commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the pope. For whatsoeuer the church saith (that is to say the pope) that must be beleeued, because forsooth the pope cannot erre: but yet that he both may erre, and hath alreadie erred <hi>de facto</hi>; I haue prooued aboundantly in my Booke of Motiues, where the gentle Reader shall finde the opinions of other popish doctors, most fit for this end and purpose.

                  <p>I say first, that in processe of time when sinne increased, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the people waxed slow in accomplishing ecclesiasticall satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inioyned; redemptions, and commutations succeeded in the place thereof, and canonicall discipline began to decay, as their owne <hi>Burchardus</hi> writeth, about the yeere of Christ <hi>1020.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say secondly, that by little, and little after such redemptions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> &amp; commutations, superstitious opinions were instilled into the minds of the vulgar people, as that the fulfilling of the multe inioined by the church, was necessarie for saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the iust iudgement of God; that god required much more satisfaction then was so inioyned, and that for the same they must either satisfie in this life, or afterward in purgatorie, if they were not pardoned by the pope.</p>

                  <head>The answer.</head>
                  <p>I say first that no saint did or can suffer so much as is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for his sinnes. And I prooue it euidently, because the best learned papists graunt freely and truely, that euery mortall sin hath in it infinite deformitie, as which is an auersion from God of infinite maiestie, and consequently that God requireth infinite satisfaction for the same: yet so it is that pure man is vncapable of euery infinit action (for otherwise he should be an other God;) and consequently, mans actions of which no one among all can be infinite, can not yeeld condigne compensation for one only mortall sin: and yet is euery sin mortall indeed, as I haue prooued in my Motiues, euen by popish doctrine. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vse the eight article of Dissention in the second Booke of the said Motiues, and thou shalt see euidently, that not only <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Durand, Baius, Roffensis,</hi> and <hi>Almayn</hi> (who al were renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med papists) but euen the common schooles of late dayes doe holde the same opinion.</p>
                  <p>I say secondly, that God hath alreadie rewarded euerie saint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in heauen, (as he will also in time rewarde euerie saint nowe on earth) f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I say thirdly, that the want whereof the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> apostle speaketh, is not in the proper passion of Christ, which was of infinite vertue, of infinite worthinesse, of infinite digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; yea, of such force and efficacie, as the least drop of his most pretious bloud (being the bloud both of God and man, by reason of hypostaticall vnion,) was sufficient for the sinnes of the whole world, and of ten thousand thousand worldes mo, if so many had been.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I say fourthly, that God in his eternall decree appointed a certaine measure of afflictions, which not onely Christ shoulde suffer in his owne naturall bodie, but also which his mystical body should suffer the congregation of the faithfull, before the full accomplishment of their glory. Which thing is very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the answere made to the holy martyrs concerning their complaintes presented before the maiestie of God.

                  <p>I fulfill saith he, those thinges that want. To whom doe they want? in my flesh. For in Christes flesh which the virgine bore, no passion at all wanted, but all passions were fulfilled in it; neuerthelesse some part of his passions yet remaineth in my flesh, which I dayly suffer for his vniuersall body which is the church. For if I should leaue off from instructing the faithful, I might be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these persecutions of Infidels.

                  <p>Out of this graue, vertuous, and learned commentarie, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> note first, that Christes passion was most absolute and perfect in it selfe.</p>
                  <p>I note secondly, that some passions of Christ yet remained,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which S. Paule ought to suffer in his flesh.

                     </note> To which preaching of the gospel these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were annexed, as the complement of Christes passions: not of his passions in himselfe, but in the church his mysticall body. For as hee suffered once for all in himselfe, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world, so doth he still suffer daily in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. For he hath appointed his elect to suffer much tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before they shall possesse eternall rest. Notwithstanding that the glory which we expect doth a thousand fold surmount the miserie of our afflictions. First therefore, since the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of Gods saints be reputed Christes owne passions: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> since S. Paule was appointed when, where, and how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> long he should preach the Gospel: Thirdly, since S. Paule, when he wrote to the Colossians, had not preached the gospel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> so simply and so largely as he was appointed: Fourthly, since he coulde not possibly preach the gospel, but perforce hee must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> suffer persecution for the same: Fiftly, since the taske of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching was inioyned him, for the benefite of the church, which is Christes mysticall body: I conclude, that when S. Paule said he in his flesh supplied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wants of Christes passions for his body the church; he meant nothing els thereby, but that he suffered affliction while hee preached the gospel, as God had appointed for the good of his church.

                  <p>I say first, that saint <hi>Austen</hi> confesseth flatly (as you haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> heard) that the blessed virgin was vndoubtedly conceiued in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sin. I say secondly, that originall sin is of infinite defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie (as is already proued;) and consequently, that the blessed virgin being polluted therewith, was neuer able to yeeld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne compensation for the same, howe great soeuer her holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was afterward: the reason is afore yeelded, for that the infinit malice of sin, surmounteth the value of the finite actions of all creatures. And if she were not able to satisfie for her own sinnes, much lesse had shee any surplussage of satisfaction left, which may serue to binde vp the popes pardons, for the sins of others. I say thirdly, that albeit S. Austen would not for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> honor of our Sauior, as he saith, call the blessed virgin into que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stion touching sin; yet doth he not affirm her to haue bin void of

For then did he properly &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly triumph ouer death, when he rose againe from death, who was deliuered to death for our sins, (saith Saint Paul) and is risen againe for our iustification: And the verie words of the text next following in the Actes,<note place="margin">

                     </note> he may tell that tale to wise men, and repute himselfe a foole for his paines. For first, as S. <hi>Austen</hi> (vpon whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie he only buildeth) affirmeth that the apostle speaketh of him that dieth impenitent; so doth the same S. <hi>Austen</hi> auouch, that he doth iniury to a martyr, that praieth for a martyr, which is a receiued axiome with the papists: and consequently, when he inferreth out of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> that we must pray for them that die penitent; he concludeth against S. <hi>Austen,</hi> that wee must pray for most constant martyrs, and so commit a manifest iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

I say secondly, that S. Iohn exhorteth to pray for penitent sinners here on earth, but

not for the dead.

                  <p>Albeit a christian man neuer pray to the saints departed, yet doth he not sinne therein. I prooue it, because euery sinne is a transgression of Gods law or commandement; but God hath made no law, nor giuen any commandement to pray to saints: <hi>Ergo</hi> not to pray to them is no sin at all.

                     </note> and the names of my fathers, Abraham, and Isaac.</p>
                  <p>To which I answere thus; First, this vocation or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was not any precept from God, but the meere fact of Iacob or Israel: who as hee was holy, so was he a man, and might haue erred herein as man. Secondly, the hebrew text is thus; Let my name be named in them, that is, let them bee called my children by adoption, or let them bee surnamed after me.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The grandfather Iacob made Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs children his by adoption.</hi>
                     </note> For it was the custome both of the Hebrewes and of the Greekes, to expresse the surname of euery one by the name of the father; as <hi>Aristoteles</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nicomachus, Zenophon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Gryllus, Cambyses</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Thirdly, the whole course of holy scripture, doth yeelde this interpretation of Iacobs wordes. In the olde testament it was a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch for a woman to beare no children, (though nowe with the Papists they be reputed holy, that will rashly vow neuer to marry;) for which respect, the small remnant of men left after the execution of Gods iustice in the destruction of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, inforced women contrary to womanly shamefastnesse, to seek vnto men, and to offer themselues to very base conditions, to the end they would be their husbands and so take away their reproch. Which thing the prophet Ieremy vttereth in these wordes; In that day seuen women shall take hold of one man, saying; We will eate our owne bread, and weare our owne garments,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esa. 4.1.</hi>
                     </note> onely let vs be called by thy name, and take away our reproch. Thus writeth Gods holy prophet, whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with the due circumstances thereof, if the christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wil exactly ponder, he shall behold as clearely as the glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring beames of the sunne, the most impudent and sophisticall dealing of the papists. For though the words aswell in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine as in the Hebrew be all one and the very same, yet are the papists ashamed (I am well assured) to inferre or proue inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, by this latter place. That which I say is euident, because these women desired nothing else of the man, but that he would be their husband, and that they might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his wiues, and so put away their reproch. This interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is plainely touched in the expresse wordes of the text;


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1621:162"/>
when the women desired the man to take their reproch away, by letting his name be called vppon them: for which end they promised not only to eate their owne bread, but also to weare their owne clothes, that so they be no way burdenous to him. And yet as our Iesuite Bellarmine and other papists woulde haue it vnderstood in Genesis, the text must yeeld this sense: Wee will eate our owne bread, and weare our own garments, and desire onely that wee may inuocate thy name, and make our prayers to thee when thou art dead. Which sense is most absurd, as euerie childe may perceiue: for first if this had beene the meaning of the women, in vaine had they made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eating their owne bread, and wearing their owne garments, as which coulde neither profite nor disprofite the man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, these women knew not whether the man should be a saued soule in heauen, or a damned spirit in hel, and therefore would they neuer make such a request to him. Thirdly praying to him being dead, could not take away their reproch on earth. Fourthly, the man might suruiue and liue after them all, and so their desire was in vaine, Fiftly,<note place="margin">

                  <p>In sundry places of the Scripture the selfe same phrase is found, which can not possibly yeelde any other sense: and therefore most impudent are the papists, who blush not to father their praying to Saints, vpon this fact of Iacob.

                  <p>I say first, that although we grant both angels and saints in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> heauen to pray for the liuing on earth, (as they doe indeede in some cases for some respects,) yet doth it not follow that wee must inuocate and pray to them, as shortly shall bee proued. I say secondly, that there is not the same reason in the saints and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> angels; for the charge and defence of the church in this life, is committed vnto the angels. Besides this, the angell in Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie praieth onely for the particular calamities of Iuda, which were apparant aswell to men as to angels. I say thirdly, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Baruch speaketh of the prayers of the Israelites that were yet liuing, but as dead for their manifold sins I say fourthly, that the booke of Machabees is not canonical, as I haue proued in my Motiues at large.

I say fiftly, that the 24. Elders wherof S. Iohn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> speaketh, do represent the church militant heere on earth, and consequently, the prayers there mentioned, are of the liuing on earth, not of the Saints raigning in heauen: which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation must needes be sound and authenticall, because the holy ghost doth confirme the same in the tenth verse following.<note place="margin">

                     </note> that in the time of S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> (who liued more then 370. yeres after Christ,) it was reputed great superstition and flat paganisme to adore any Saint or angel in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> heauen; much more to adore men yet liuing on earth; and most of all to adore woode, stones, and sencelesse things. I note se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that religious honour or worship is due to God alone; and that neither saintes nor images, nor the mother of God, is capable thereof. I note thirdly, that to thinke that Saintes or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Angels may be adored, is an old damnable error, receiued from the gentiles, wherewith some of the vulgar and common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were deceiued, euen in the daies of <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> I note fourthly, that by the iudgement of this holy, learned, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> father, to teach vs to adore saints religiously (for ciuilly I graunt it may be done,) is to induce vs to erre with Eue.</p>

But if he had been a Romish Iesuite, hee woulde neuer haue stumbled at any such thing. Whether therefore we interprete the word (footestoole) by the literall Hebrew phrase, or with S. Austen and S.

                  <p>I note thirdly, that Gods word was little regarded euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in Saint <hi>Austens</hi> time, and that superstition in steede thereof raigned euerie where; and therefore no maruell if so much Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish trumperie, did after Saint <hi>Austens</hi> time abound in their visible church.</p>

                  <p>Popish inuocation, adoration, visitation, translation, eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, asportation, and reseruation, is superstitious, blasphemous, and idololatrical. This conclusion is euidently proued, by that which is already said of the inuocation and adoration of saints. For if no religious worship nor adoration can be giuen to the liuing saints, as is already proued; much lesse may that which is contained in this conclusion, be yeelded to the dead bodies &amp; reliques of the same. And doubtlesse the faithlesse Gentiles haue not committed more grosse and palpable idolatrie in ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their idols, then our late Papists in adoring their relikes. For first, when the relique which they terme (<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ultus sanctus</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is eleuated as solemnly as their bread-god in the masse, though not ouer the priests head, but publiquely in both his hands; the people of Rome are taught to crie aloude; <hi>misericordi, miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordi,</hi> mercie, mercie, for our sinnes. Which, as euerie child <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> knoweth, is the proper inuocation of God himselfe. Againe, they doe ascribe so much Religion in handling, and in tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the tabernacles or coffers, wherein the reliques are put, that the lay people may scarcely touch them with their bare handes, or yet the priestes eleuate the same, vnlesse they first adore them vpon their knees, and in their surplesses with stoles about their neckes. Thirdly, they thinke, that if their beades <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> do but once touch those coffers, they receiue a great holinesse from thence. Fourthly, they think that to come on pilgrimage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to Rome especially, is a great parte of satisfaction for their sinnes. Fiftly, they thinke it a farre greater holines to pray <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in one place, then in another; greater at one altar then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; more blessed in one church then in an other; and that it is the next step to heauen, to say masse, or cause masse to be said, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> at the church of the blessed virgin in Lauretto. Sixtly, they

Neither can the cause thereof be ascribed either to nature, or to destinie, or to fortune, because humane actions are variable, and with the intention of the doer. Therefore the best course that can be taken with him that denieth mans freewill after the fall of Adam, is this; to wit, to beate him like a stockfish, vntill he confesse those that beate him to haue free will, either still to beate him, or to cease from beating.

                     </note> This conclusion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth three thinges; First, that Gods righteousnesse is that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> iustice which we present for our iustification.

Thirdly, that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and take hold vpon it, by faith only; and so we haue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> explication, howe sole faith doth iustifie.

                     </note> he hath wherin to reioyce, but not with God. For what saith the Scripture? Abraham beleeued God, and it was counted to him for righteousnesse. Thus saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Out of which wordes I note first, that workes did not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Abraham before God. I note secondly, that that iustice by which man standeth cleere before God, is only imputatiue, and not really inherent in himselfe. Which imputatiue iustice, the Apostle doth often inculcate in this chapter, the fourth to the Romaines. I note thirdly, that faith is counted our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Which the apostle expresseth more liuely in the fift verse; But to him that worketh not (saith hee) but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The same apostle after a long discourse, to prooue that a man is iustified by faith onely,<note place="margin">

                     </note> in another place addeth these words; We therfore think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man is iustified by faith, without the workes of the law. Loe, the holy apostle, after a long dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is implied in the worde (therefore,) concludeth, that we are iustified by faith without works. As if he had said; sole faith, only faith, or faith without works doth iustifie, albeit the papistes cannot, or will not it see. This whole processe is confirmed, by the vniforme testimonies of the auncient fathers, who all ascribe our iustification to sole faith.</p>

                  <head>The 6. conclusion.</head>
                  <p>The good works of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regenerate, do neither merite grace in this life, nor glory in the world to come. This conclusion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a graund and mightie article in popishe doctrine, but I will prooue it by strong and irrefragable reasons.</p>
                  <p>S. Paul writeth to the Romaines, in these wordes; the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this present time are not worthy of the glory,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The first reason. Rom. 8.18.</hi>
                     </note> which shalbe shewed vnto vs. The workes of the regenerate (saith S. Paul, as ye see) are not worthy of heauen. They cannot therefore (say I) merite heauen, because (as the papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues doe graunt) to merite heauen, and to be worthy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is all one; the difference is onely in wordes, not in sense.</p>
                  <p>The papists perceiuing the force of this argument, vse this seely euasion:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A friuolous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the Papists.</hi>
                     </note> although (say they) the actions of man be not worthie of heauen, neither merite grace, as they proceed from mans free-will; yet are they worthie of heauen and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as they proceede from the holy ghost. But this is a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, childish, and miserable shift, onely inuented by the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of Satan, to seduce simple soules. For first, our workes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are only ours, as they proceed of, and from our selues. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the holy ghost and man worke both one and the same work, that which the holy Ghost doth, can no more be deemed mans act, then that which man doth, can be deemed Gods act; &amp; yet so it is, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which man doth cannot be deemed Gods; <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither that which God doth, can be deemed mans. The assumption, wherein resteth the difficultie if there be any at all, is manifest by mans sinfull actions. For the most cruell act that can be imagined, is not done without the concourse of the holy ghost, as all learned papistes doe, and must confesse. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse mans sinfull actes are so farre from being Gods actes, as the deformities and irregularities thereof be onely mans, and neuer Gods; and yet doth God concurre more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to those wicked acts, in that he is the principall agent of the real and positiue entities thereof, then man doth or can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to any act of Gods, that is, to any good act himselfe doth. Note well, for God is the creator of the diuell, as he is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but not as hee is such an aungell: and euen so is God the

I prooue it, because S. Paule could not performe this precept, as <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi> truely and learnedly obserued: and yet concerning actuall consent, S.

                     </note> as spoken in the person of all saints, If we say we haue no sin we deceiue our selues, and the truth is not in vs, when for al that; the same apostle saith, He that is borne of God, sinneth not, because his seed abideth in him, and he cannot sinne because he is of God. Therfore both are true, because no man is without sinne, for that no man is without the law of sinne, (that is, concupiscence) and he that is borne of God sinneth not, bicause he sinneth not by the law of his mind, that is, by charitie, which is Gods seede; for charitie couereth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the multitude of sinnes. Out of these words I note first, that concupiscence moueth rebellion against the spirit, in the holyest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> man vpon earth. I note secondly, that this rebellion of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, is sinne in euerie one, because S. Iohn speaketh of sinne indeede, whose words saint Ambrose applieth heere to concupiscence. I note thirdly, that hee speaketh of originall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> concupiscence, because he speaketh of that concupiscence, which is in the saints, that is, in those that are borne of God. I note fourthly, that the faithfull sinne not, because charitie couereth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their sins. So then S. <hi>Austen</hi> meaneth as S.

And all other holy doctors, considering after the same manner the naturall valure only of good words, and perceiuing that it is exceeding farre distant from the valure and iust estimation of eternall life, sayd wisely, that our works are not meritorious nor worthie of eternall life. Yet for the couenant and promise made with vs, the good works of man with the help of Gods grace, are worthy of eternall life, and equall with it; which for all that, that promise of God which is frequent in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures set aside, were altogether vnworthie of so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Thus sayth our Popish Bishoppe and holy Frier, who though he bestirre himselfe more then a little, to establish the condigne merite of works, yet doth he in his owne kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, vtterly confute and confound himselfe. For first, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> graunteth that not onely <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> but all the rest of the holy Fathers with him, affyrme good workes neyther to be meritorious, nor worthy of eternall life. Agayne, he graunteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that workes considered in their naturall kinde, are vnworthie of eternall life. Thirdly, he graunteth that good works euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as they proceede of grace and assistance of the holy Ghost, are for all that vnworthy of eternall life, if Gods promise and free acceptation be set apart. Which three poynts doubtlesse are all that we desire to be graunted, concerning the doctrine of good works. And so, (though the Papists neuer cease to impeach, accuse, slaunder, and condemne vs in this behalfe) yet do we defend nothing heerein, but that which their owne best Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and printed bookes doe teach vs; yea, euen such bookes as are dedicate to the Popes holinesse himselfe. The conceites which this Bishop alledgeth to make good his intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, are childish and too too friuolous.

And our Bishop vnwittingly confuteth himselfe (of such force is the trueth,) when he graunteth that good works done in grace are vnworthy of heauen, if Gods promise be set apart. For if they merite <hi>ex condigno,</hi> as he auoucheth; then doubtlesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, couenant, and mercie, is altogither needlesse. Secondly, where the bishop fleeth to distributiue iustice, so to establishe the merite of workes; I answere, that both the fathers and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes are against him,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I say first, that S. Luke reprooueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extortions of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies, &amp; exhorteth them to works of charitie. As if he had said; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not vnwashed handes make you eate vncleanly, but your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked extortions. Vse therefore charitie, and giue almes to the poore, and then your soules shalbe cleane, though the platter be vnwashed. This sense is gathered out of the verses aforegoing.</p>
                  <p>I say secondly, that almesdeedes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other good works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of faith, do neither merite nor iustifie as is prooued; but yet they are testimonies before men, that wee be iustified by faith through the merites of Christ Iesus. For which respect, iustification is often ascribed vnto them; as to the effects therof. I say thirdly, that the fathers in many places doe speake of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> temporal remission, which often is graunted for almes deeds and the like.</p>

First, because God is glorified therein. Therefore saith Christ; let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your father which is in heauen. Secondly, because by good workes we shew our gratitude &amp; loue towards God. Therfore saith Christ; If ye loue me, keep my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements.

                  <p>Although good workes doe neither merite grace in this life, nor glorie in the life to come, as which are imperfect, polluted with sinne, and in rigour of iustice worthy of condemnation, as is alreadie prooued; yet because God hath decreed in his eternal counsel to bring vs to heauen by them, as by ordinary meanes and right fruites of a sound christian faith; they may in a godly sense be termed, The secundary instrumentall cause of eternall life; but in no sense the cause of mans iustification. <hi>Explico:</hi> I say (of mans iustification,) because the latter can neuer be the cause of the former; and consequently good workes following our iustification as the immediate fruites thereof, can by no meanes possible be the cause of the same. In regard whereof S. Austen as in many other thinges,<note place="margin">

And because the multitude of christian people is increased wherin are conteined old men, &amp; yong men, and litle ones, whereof some are not of so great discretion, to vse due warines about the vse of this sacrament: therefore there is a good prouiso made in some churches, that the lay people shall not receiue the bloud, but onely the priest.

                  <p>The popishe oblation of Christes naturall bodie in their masse, by which they ascribe remission of sins to the quicke and the dead, is blasphemous and iniurious to Christes holy passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I prooue it first, because the apostle saith, that we are sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the oblation of the body of Iesus Christ once. For if it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be true that S. Paule saith, that it is but once offered;<note place="margin">

                  <p>I proue it secondly, because the apostle saith, that Christ hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with one oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made perfect for euer, them that are sanctified.

                     </note> nor often itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same. Therefore the popish oblation of Christ to his father in their masse is blasphemous against Christ, as which maketh his oblation vpon the crosse vnperfect, and insuffcicient for our sinnes.

                  <p>I proue it ninthly, because if the sacrifice of the masse, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> the self same sacrifice of the crosse, but vnbloudy, as the papists dreame: then shoulde their masse sacrifice be of infinite valure, which yet no papist dareth auouch. This reason doth confound the papists, &amp; therfore I wil proue effectually euerie part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. First, that it is the same sacrifice which Christ offered on the crosse, all papists grant being enforced with S. Paules words when he saith: With one oblation he made perfit for euer, those that are sanctified. Secondly, that it is not of infinite valure, our Iesuite graunteth in these wordes;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now I prooue the consequution of my proposition, which is the third thing remaining; wherein resteth all the difficultie, if there be any at all. First therefore the sacrifice supposed to be in the masse, is the naturall body and bloud of the son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For otherwise it could not be the same, that was offered vpon the crosse. Againe, he that is supposed to offer the sacrifice dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the masse, is Christ himselfe the sonne of God. Who (as the papistes teach blasphemously) held in his hands at his last supper, that selfe same body that was borne of the virgine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and suffered the next day after. And yet if the valure of the sacrifice of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse be finite, then doubtlesse that sacrifice can not be the sonne of God: for he is of infinite power, of infinite glorie, of infinite maiestie, of infinite valure. Yea, whosoeuer denieth Christes body &amp; bloud, subsisting in the person of God by hypostaticall vnion, to be of infinite valure; hee is become a flat Arrian, beleeuing Christ to bee pure man, and not God. And consequently, howsoeuer the papistes thinke or speake of their masse, yet in making it a sacrifice they are blasphemous: and that must needs followe, though it were freelie graunted them, that Christes body were present really in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>I prooue it tenthly, because our Iesuite cannot denie, but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a reall destruction is necessarily required,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I say first, that it were a vaine contention to striue for the name, so we could agree in the thing. For as it is not material if we call the ministers of the new testament (priests,) so wee vnderstand rightly the thing it selfe; so is it not of importance, if we tearme the sacrament of Christs body and bloud, (either the Lords supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Eucharist, or the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, or the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, or the blessed sacrament, or the masse) if we vnderstand rightly, the thing signified by the same. For all these words (I know) are rightly vsed, by the ancient, holy &amp; learned fathers. Where I note this by the way, that whether the word Masse be latin or hebrew, or what it doth properly signifie, the papists cannot yet agree among themselues. I say secondly, that the fathers indeede doe often call the Eucharist (Christs body and bloud, the sacrifice of the mediator; the vnbloudy sacrifice, and whatsoeuer else is due to the sacrifice of the crosse,) neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, they haue alwaies a godly sense and meaning in such kind of appollations; that is to say, they ascribe such names to the Eucharist, not because it is properly the selfe same thing that the word importeth; but for that it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament, the signe, &amp; the memorial thereof; or else bicause it is spiritually the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of laude and thanksgiuing; for the proofe hereof, it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to call to minde, that sacraments in the scripture haue the names of those things, whereof they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>The fourth proofe.</hi>
                     </note>My fourth proofe is grounded in the vniforme consent of the ancient doctours of the church. For first, <hi>S. Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> hath these words: <hi>Nam ipse quoque homo, &amp; vinum benedixit, cum dixit: accipite, bibite, hoc est sanguis meus, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis vitis: verbum quod pro multis effunditur in remissionem peccatorum, sanctum laetitiae fluentum allegorice significat. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur: quod autem vinum esset quod benedictum est, ostendit rursus dicens discipulis: non bibam ex fructu vitis huius, donec bibero ipsum vobiscum in regno patris mei.</hi> For our Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also man blessed wine, when he saide: Take, drinke, this is my blood, the blood of the vine: the word, which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes, doth signifie allegorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the holie riuer of gladnesse. And that it was wine which is blessed, he sheweth againe when he saith thus to his disciples: I wil not drinke of the fruit of this vine, vntil I drinke it with you in the kingdome of my father. Out of these words of this holy and ancient father (who liued aboue one thousand, three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hundred, and eightie yeeres ago) I note first, that that which Christ called his bloud at his supper, was naturally wine, though his bloud sacramentally: for it was <hi>sanguis vitis,</hi> such bloud as the vine doth affoord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I note secondly, that these words (which is shed for many) are allegoricall, that is, they sound one thing in bare wordes, and signifie another thing indeede: as if hee had saide: The wine or liquor in the cup is not shed indeede for many, but is a sacrament or figure of Christs naturall bloud, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede shed for our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>I note thirdly, that these words of Christ (I wil not drinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the fruite of the vine) were spoken after the consecration of the wine, and are to be vnderstoode litterally: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that that which the Apostles dranke, was naturall wine, &amp; not naturall bloud.

And this answere will solue a thousand captious cauilles, which the Papists vse to make. I note secondly, that such as is our vnion by eating this bread, such is the eating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thereof. And consequently, since euery child knoweth that we are but mystically vnited, as we are the mysticall members of one body: it followeth that we do but mystically eate Christs bodie. And S. Hilaries reason maketh it plaine, when hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth (because the father is in him, and he in vs) for neither doth the father dwell in him corporally (who is corpslesse,) neither corporally in vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath these words: <hi>Qui est è terra panis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> percipi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He would (I say) haue reiected the name of bread, and not haue kept it still. I note secondly, that Christ is not present corporally in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, because his naturall bodie is but one thing; which yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> should be the whole eucharist, if it were present, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists grossely dreame.

But after hee had deliuered the mysterie, I will not drinke saith hee, of this fruite of the vine, vntill that day, when I shall drinke it newe with you in the kingdome of my father. And hee saith, of the fruit of the vine, which doubtlesse bringeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> forth wine and not water. Out of these words I note first, that the Eucharist is but a symbole, signe or figure of Christs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> body.

                  <p>Seuenthly, S. <hi>Theodoret</hi> hath these words: <hi>Neque enim signa <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> mystica post sanctificatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recedunt à sua natura.</hi>

                     <hi>Manent enim in priore substantia, &amp; figura, &amp; forma, &amp; videri, &amp; tangi possunt sicut &amp; prius.</hi> The mysticall signes after the sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depart not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their nature: but they abide in their former substance, and figure, and forme, and may be seen and touched, euen as before. Out of these most golden wordes of this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and learned father, I note first, that hee writeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst certaine heretickes, who held that Christes body was chaunged into his deitie after his ascension. And they prooued it, because as the bread and wine after consecration, were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the body and bloud of Christ: euen so was his body changed into his deitie after his ascension. This note is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> set downe in the wordes aforegoing. I note secondly, that S. <hi>Theodoret</hi> confuteth the heretickes, euen by their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For the mysticall signes (saith hee) remaine still in their former substance and nature, euen after the sanctification ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As if he had said: ye lay not a good foundation, your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall is false, ye take that as graunted, which is flatly denied. For although the creatures of bread and wine be sanctified by Gods word, and accidentally changed into the mysticall signes of his body and bloud; yet doe they still retaine their former na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and substance, yet doe they still remaine, truely bread and truely wine. I note thirdly, that though the bread and wine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> haue gotten by sanctification, a new diuine qualitie; yet haue they lost nothing that they had before: for they haue the same nature, the same substance, the same figure, the same forme: they may be seene, tasted, and touched, euen as they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.


<pb n="449" facs="tcp:1621:235"/>
All the papistes in Europe cannot answere this reason. For <hi>Theodoret</hi> prooueth against the heretickes, that as bread and wine are as truly bread and truely wine after consecration, as they were before consecration; euen so is Christes body as truely a body now after his ascension,<note place="margin">

                     </note> as it was afore heere on earth.

                  <p>Secondly, hee telleth vs that Christ is ascended, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> therfore his bodie cannot be eaten with the bit of mouth, as the papistes teach blasphemously.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he saith that the soule is neuer in greater bondage, then when shee grossely and carnally taketh the figures and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> signes for the thinges signified by the same.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he telleth vs, that since the signes of thinges be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> vsually termed by the names of the things signified, our Lord doubted not to say (This is my bodie) when hee gaue but the signe of his bodie.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, hee saith that the bread which the other Disciples <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> receiued, was our Lord, yet that which Iudas receiued was but the bread of the Lord.

                  <p>Sixtly, he telleth vs, that albeit wee cannot reache with our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> handes, to Christes body which is nowe in heauen: yet may we by faith take hold vpon the same. Which is the flat doctrine, that the church of England this day teacheth of the eucharist.

And that as he is present in his god-head till that time, so is hee absent in his manhood. For (saith S. <hi>Austen,</hi>) touching the presence of his fleshe, hee was but a fewe daies on earth.

Sed &amp; nos ipsi corpus eius effecti, sacramento &amp; re sacramenti capiti nostro connectimur, &amp; vnimur singuli alter alterius membra, ministerium dilectionis pro inuicem exhiben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, communicamus charitate, participamus sollicitudine, eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem cibum manducantes, &amp; eundem potum bibentes, qui depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra spiritali profluit &amp; emanat, qui cibus &amp; potus est dominus noster Iesus Christus.</hi> So often as we doe these things, we doe not whet our teeth to eate, but we breake and diuide the sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified bread with a sincere faith, while wee distinguish and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate what is diuine and what humane; and also ioyning the same things separated together, confesse one God and man. Our selues also being made his body, are knit to our head by the sacrament and vertue thereof, and are vnited particularly one an others members, exhibiting the ministerie of loue one for another; we communicate in charitie, we participate in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, we eate the same meate and drinke the same drinke, which floweth and runneth out of the spiritual rocke, which meate and drinke is our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Out of these wordes I note first, that Christ is truely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the eucharist, but yet after a spiritual sort, and not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I note secondly, that we are vnited to Christ spiritually by meanes of the sacrament, but not corporally. For as wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Christ in the sacrament, so are wee vnited to Christ i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I note thirdly, that after sanctification it is bread still as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,


<pb n="461" facs="tcp:1621:241"/>
and is broken and deuided: none of which can agree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede with Christs corporall presence.</p>
                  <p>I note fourthly, that we eate not Christ with mouth and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> tooth, but with a true christian faith.</p>
                  <p>I note fiftly, that the true and sincere faith, by which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> must eate the Eucharist, is to distinguish in Christ the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie from the diuinitie, and to ioyne the same againe, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing one Christ to be true God and true man.</p>
                  <p>I note sixtly, that as we eate Christ in the Sacrament, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> are we made one anothers members: which can not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vnderstoode, then in a mysticall maner.</p>
                  <p>I note seuenthly, that our sacramentall meate and drinke is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> spirituall, which floweth out from the spirituall rocke Christ Iesus. For if the rocke be spirituall whereof we drinke, then doubtles the drinke it selfe can not be corporall, because as all Philosophers graunt, and as right reason prescribeth, <hi>qualis causa talis effectus,</hi> the effect is of like condition with the cause: neither can a corporall cause bring foorth a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall effect, nor a spirituall cause a corporall effect: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariseth a great question among the Schoolemen, how hell fire can be materiall, since a body can haue no action into a spirit.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I say secondly, that neither S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> nor yet S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> affirmeth, Christes fleshe to be present otherwise then I graunt. Touching S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> hee hath these wordes a little before; <hi>Nos verè sub mysterio carnem corporis sui sumimus, &amp; per hoc vnum erimus.</hi> Wee truely receiue the flesh of his body, (yet not really or corporally, but) in a mysterie, and by this wee shalbe one. Loe, though we receiue Christes flesh truely, as I graunt; yet is it in a mysterie, not carnally or corporally, as the papistes hold. Againe, S. <hi>Hilary</hi> saith, we are made one by it; and yet is it cleere, that our vnitie is no other then mysticall: the papistes agree thereunto, it cannot be denied.</p>
                  <p>I say thirdly, that to eate a thing really, is not to keepe it a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> while in our mouth vnconsumed, and then to put it out againe, as euery childe can discerne; and yet is this your carnall and reall eating of Christes body, ye can it not denie. For yee say, that his body is hidden vnder the accidentes of bread, and is only so long in your mouthes, as the accidents be vnconsumed and not eaten vp. That done, Christ is by and by gone from you. His body so loatheth your bellies; that it wil by no means come in them, or tarrie longer with you, then the accidentes do remaine. And when it is freed from those accidentes, neither doth any see it come out, neither can your selues tell whither it is gone. But the priest by speaking foure wordes, can bring it againe into his fist with a becke. Now I would learne of some skilfull papist, to what end so manie miracles are feined in your consecration. Is it to possesse Christes bodie? But alas, it is no sooner come then gone againe. Is it that Christ may dwell with you? but alas, he wil not stay. Is it because you are deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his presence. Alas it seemeth not; for then the ordinary meane were this, to keep your accidents long vndigested.

For if thou were incorporall, hee would haue giuen thee incorporall giftes barely, (and not hidden;) but because thy soule is coupled with thy body, intelligible thinges are giuen thee in things sensible. Oh how many now a daies say? I woulde see his forme &amp; shape, I would see his garmentes, I woulde see his shooes. Thou therefore seest him, thou touchest him, thou eatest him. Thou desirest to see his garments, but he hath giuen himselfe to thee; not that thou maiest see him onelie, but also that thou maiest touch him, and haue him within thee. These are the wordes of this auncient father and learned writer: which I haue cited at large (though they be somewhat tedious,) because they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to confound the papistes, euen in this argument which they

                  <p>I therfore note first, that all giftes giuen vs by Christ in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sacramentes, are spirituall and to be receiued by faith.</p>
                  <p>I note secondly, that though the thinges giuen vs bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yet are they giuen in such things as be sensible: and the reason hereof is, because our selues are sensible.</p>
                  <p>I note thirdly, that as the gift in baptisme is incorporall, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> spirituall, euen so is the gift in the Eucharist.</p>
                  <p>I note fourthly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is so present, as he is seen, touched, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and possessed: but the papistes neither can see him, nor touche him, in their fondly conceiued reall presence.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> therefore speaking of that kinde of presence, by which Christ is seene and touched; must needes vnderstand that spirituall kinde of presence, which we defend according to the Scriptures.</p>

But that they this did in generall termes, and not in popish maner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I prooue it by two reasons. First, because popish auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was not yet inuented, but after Christes resurrection, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as all papistes graunt.

For first, they confessed their sinnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> verbally, as they burnt their bookes really; but of absolution S.

So the faithfull at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of zeale confessed their notorious deedes, but not all their particular sinnes, Nay, they only confessed how Satan had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, and for that end they burnt their bookes.

The end of the lawe was, that Gods goodnesse shoulde be publickly approoued, and that the party clensed should giue a signe of gratitude.

Which thing I weene, the wiser sort of papists will neuer graunt. Yet the end of this loosing was not to establishe popishe absolution, but to make the miracle manifest to the incredulous Iewes. I prooue it by these wordes next afore going: I knowe that thou hearest me alwaies, but because of the people that stand by, I said it; that they may beleeue, that thou hast sent me.

Out of these words I note first, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the ancient church appointed priests ouer the penitents, onely for this end and purpose; that they might giue them counsell how to make satisfaction according to the canons, which them selues did not vnderstand.

                     </note> that <hi>Nectarius</hi> the B. of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, vtterly abolished the law made for confession, &amp; that to auoide the great vices, which ensued thereupon.

                     </note> &amp; the confusion of al papists: <hi>Ipse autem Imperator repraesentat totum populu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> christianum, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in eum translata sit iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictio &amp; potestas vniuersi orbis: loco ipsoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoc ergo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> But the emperour representeth al christian people, because the iurisdiction and power of all the world is imposed vpon him. Therefore in steede of the people, the Emperor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth councels; and for this purpose is it, that the calling of councels was euer done by the emperor, as is alreadie said; but afterward it was reserued to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Out of these words I note first, that the testimonie of this <hi>Panormitaine</hi> must needes be forcible against the papists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was their owne popish Abbot, their Canonist, their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> archbishop, their Cardinal. I note secondly, that the Emperor hath the chiefest iurisdiction ouer all the christian world, euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ouer the Pope of Rome. I note thirdly, that in respect of his vniuersall and supreme iurisdiction, hee hath authoritie to call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> councels. I note fourthly, that in the primitiue church al coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were called, by the authoritie of the Emperour. I note <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> fiftly, that in processe of time, the Emperour of Rome yeelded vp his authorittie of calling councels, to his bishop of Rome: by which grant and the like, the Pope at length abused all the world.</p>
                  <p>The veritie and infallibilitie of this conclusion is so manifest and irrefragable, that the Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot denie the same. And therefore he is enforced to excuse the Popes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from councels, because he could not sit aboue the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: his words are alleaged in my booke of Motiues. By this testimonie, the Popes humilitie doth sufficiently appeare; and for affinitie sake, I will adioyne the testimonie of an other Monke, for his tyrannie.</p>
