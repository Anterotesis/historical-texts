            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> directed to the Lievtenant of the Tower, before any Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had been exhibited againſt him.</p>
            <p>That whilſt he was there detained, a Bill was exhibited and found againſt him;
whereupon he was immediately carryed to the Kings Bench, and there arraigned in
this ſurprize: He deſired a Copy of the Indictment, Leave to make his Exceptions,
or to put in a Special Plea, and Council to fr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me it, but all was denyed: He then
offer'd a Special Plea, ready engroſt, which was then alſo rejected, without reading,
being threatned, <hi>That if he did not immediately plead Not Guilty, a Judgment of High
Treaſon ſhould be entred:</hi> He was forc't, contrary to Law (as he ſuppoſeth) to come
to a general Iſſue, in pleading, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the 21th he was brought to his Tryal, and the Indictment being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
and confuſed, ſo that neither he, nor any of his Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that heard it, could
fully comprehend the ſcope of it, he was utterly unprovided of all the Helps that the
Law alloweth unto every man for his Defence, whereupon he again deſired a Copy,
and produced an Authentick Copy of the Statute <hi>Eaw.</hi> 3. whereby it is enacted, <hi>That
every man ſhall have a Copy of any Record that toucheth him in any manner, as well that which
falls againſt the Kings, as any other Perſon;</hi> but could have neither a Copy of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
nor that the Statute ſhould be read.</p>
            <p>The Jury by which he was to be tryed, was not (as he is informed ſummoned by
the Bailiffs of the ſeveral Hundreds, in the uſual and legal manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Names were

ſought his Ruin, whereby he loſt the Benefit allowed by rhe Law, of making his
Exceptions, and was forced to admit of mechanick perſons, utterly unable to judge
of ſuch a matter, as was to be brought before them.</p>

of his Teſtimony, being guilty of many Crimes which he did not pretend
your Petitioner had any knowledge of; and having no other hope of a Pardon, but by
