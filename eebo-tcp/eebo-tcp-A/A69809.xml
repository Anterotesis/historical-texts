            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IF Men Writ only for their Contemporaries, very Cautious ſhou'd I be of undertaking here the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Viſcount de Turenne's</hi> Life, ſeeing all I can ſay of him will in no wiſe come near the <hi>Idea</hi> left Us of him, in his Great Actions: In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect when I ſhall have urg'd many inſtances of his Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Prudence, Courage, and all the Other Virtues he in a Soveraign Degree poſſeſs'd, have I not reaſon to fear that this will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weaken than augment the Opinion we have of Him? For tho' a Book may ſeem ſufficient to acquaint us with the Vices and Virtues of a Man, yet We have ſeen ſuch Great things of this Prince both for Manners, and for Actions, as require a man's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been an Eye-Witneſs of 'em, to have an Idea of him proportionable to the Truth. But as we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit the Pleaſure of hearing ſuch Perſons as have been Dear to Us made the Subject of the Diſcourſe, I hope this Work far from Diſpleaſing, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to all ſuch as ſhall peruſe it; Very willing will they be to be re-minded of a Prince, for whom they had, as I may ſay, a kind of Adoration; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57147:5"/>
whoſe Death they could not refrain Solemnizing with their tears, tho' attended with ſuch Glorious Circumſtances. As for thoſe that come after us, I alſo hope this Piece will afford them a Delightfull Entertainment; For if they are pleas'd in Reading the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> and Other the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captains of Antiquity, whoſe Virtues were tarniſh'd with many Vices; with much more Reaſon muſt they needs take ſome ſatisfaction in Reading the Life of a Prince, who having been no leſs Wiſe or Expert than thoſe Great men in the Trade of War, was Exempt from all their Imperfections. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I hope, ſomething more will be found than Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Life of ſo virtuous a Perſonage; and that it will raiſe both Admiration and Emulation: And if it be true, that manners are commonly faſhion'd after the example of the Company People uſually frequent, may we not believe that Reading another ſort of converſation, is capable of producing the ſame effect. I will add to all theſe Conſiderations that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd me to enter upon this work; the Deſire I had to hand down truth to Poſterity, a Virtue not much known to the greater part of our modern Hiſtorians, who ſuffer themſelves to be led on by their Intereſt or their Paſſions.</p>
            <p>All mankind are Unanimous in This, that Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Birth is a Preſent of Fortune; nay I have not yet met with any Perſon, but reckons it to give a Great Luſtre to virtue. We value indeed Virtuous Perſons in whatever Rank it has pleaſed God to place them, but 'tis Clear we rate thoſe much higher that are equally Virtuous, &amp; born with the Advantage of Extraction: 'Tis a luſtre that dazzels all men, and for which, let People talk what they will, Every man has Naturally a reſpect. <hi>Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne,</hi> whoſe Life I now undertake to Write, was born at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57147:5"/>
               <hi>Sedan</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1611. of Parents whoſe Birth was not only Eminent, but ev'n recommendable among Sovereigns. He was the Son of <hi>Henry de la Tour D'Auvergne</hi> and of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw:</hi> Theſe two Houſes are ſo blaz'd throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> nay, and i'th Other Parts of the World, that it wou'd be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in me to Enlarge much upon their Grandeur. That of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> has giv'n an Emperour to <hi>Germany,</hi> and continu'd his Poſterity in Severall Branches equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Illuſtrious, and particularly in that of the Princes of <hi>Orange.</hi> That of <hi>La Tour D'Auvergne</hi> has poſſeſt the County of <hi>Boulogne</hi> and ſeverall other Lands in Sovereignty; and for a top of Greatneſs matcht one of it's Daughters to a Majeſty of <hi>France.</hi> Not but there are thoſe who are of Opinion that this Ancient Houſe of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and that of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> are very Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; Nay, and I have heard it affirm'd by the preſent Duke of <hi>Elboeuf,</hi> tho' he had marry'd a Daughter of this Family, and that his Intereſt led him to take that Part: But it is not for me to decide theſe ſorts of things, and tho' I were better informed than I am, I ſhould circumſcribe my relation to what is commonly ſaid upon this Point. I ſhall leave then to others to judge of the Caſe as they think fit, and content my ſelf to ſay, that it is however a moſt Illuſtrious Houſe; Conſider we it either as iſſu'd from the Counts of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> or from a Houſe of <hi>Limoſin,</hi> from whence ſome derive it's Original: Such as are of this ſentiment, affirm it's Name to be <hi>La Tour,</hi> of which there are many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſetled in the Kingdom, and that they have thereto added the name <hi>D'Auvergne. Mrs de Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernet, de Montauban &amp; de la Chartre</hi> are of that Houſe, and ſome of 'em have told me the Houſe of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and theirs to be one and the ſame thing.

as Relations of <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon,</hi> who hold'ſt not only an Eminent rank in <hi>France,</hi> but are likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable in <hi>Germany,</hi> on the ſcore of the Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances they have there with ſeveral Princes. As for the reſt, the Principality of <hi>Sedan</hi> had not been long in this Houſe, when the <hi>Viſcount de Turenne</hi> came into the World: His Father was oblig'd for it to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> Who had match'd him to the Heireſs. But we may aſſure it to be in acknowledgement for the Services he had receiv'd from him. For during the Civil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> he brought him ſundry Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſpar'd neither his Eſtate nor Perſon to help him to Subdue his Enemies. For this Reaſon did <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth prefer him before many Others, when the Marrying that Princeſs was the point in Agitation, and it's believ'd he did it too that he might not remit her Territories into the hands of a Perſon leſs affectionate to him than this Lord: For as they border with <hi>France</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Germany,</hi> it was that Great Kings Intereſt to be carefull on whom he beſtow'd the Heireſs. But be it as it will, the new Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> on his very Wedding night endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to acquit himſelf of that Obligation; for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Brides Bed, he put on his Armour, and went and Surpriz'd the City of <hi>Stenay,</hi> which acquired him Great Reputation. Nevertheleſs tho' <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> Eſteem'd him dayly more and more, yet he did not long entertain him with the ſame favour, which I ſhall attribute to what I am going to relate. This Great King was obliged to turn <hi>Catholique,</hi> ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the troubles of his Kingdom; and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> a Proteſtant, not being of a humour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Maſters Example, he became ſuſpected to the King for the kindneſs born him by thoſe of his Religion. The Jealouſy conceiv'd by the King on this Occaſion was ſo Great, that the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57147:6"/>
found himſelf oblig'd to withdraw into <hi>Germany,</hi> from whence he Writ to the King, and procur'd other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Divers Princes his Relations. The King ſent to him to return and truſt in his Royall Word; but he was loath to obey; as knowing he had Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Court, who endeavour'd to render him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearable for Sundry Complaints made by People of the Religion in great pow'r at that time. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over accus'd he was of having endeavour'd to draw into the Kingdom the Army of <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> a famous General, who without being in any Bodies Pay had found the Secret to keep on foot an Army of thirty thouſand men, and make himſelf feared by all <hi>Europe.</hi> At length time having appeas'd all things, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> went to kiſſe the Kings hand, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Sedan,</hi> where his main Care was to educate his Children ſutably to their Condition.</p>
            <p>God having given him, as I have already ſayd, the <hi>Viſcount de Turenne,</hi> whoſe Life I here delineate; he was brought up in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, to which his Mother ſhew'd her ſelf as zealous as his Father. As ſoon as he was come to an age ripe for Inſtruction, he had Maſters given him accordingly, ſome appointed to teach him the Exercizes befitting a Perſon of his Quality; &amp; 'tis inconceivable how eaſily he learnt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; which ſufficiently Teſtify'd the Vivacity of his Wit. Nevertheleſs, as ſome things he apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more willingly to than others, his Inclination lay for thoſe that concern'd Arms; For as for Sciences he ſet himſelf ſlightly to them, or, as I may ſay, for faſhions ſake, which ſometimes put <hi>Monſieur de Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> out of humour, becauſe he would have render'd him accompliſht in all things. When he had attain'd fifteen years of Age, <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon</hi> reſolv'd to ſend him into <hi>Holland,</hi> at that time the School of War for all Perſons of Quality, and where
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57147:7"/>
was already his Eldeſt Brother. For the States after having brought <hi>Spain</hi> to demand a Truce, ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the point of renewing Hoſtilities for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining their freedom. He gave him Letters for Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Brother in Law, the Greateſt Captain of his Age, and the Perſon to whom the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> are moſt endebted for their Eſtabliſhment. For tho' they began to caſt off the <hi>Spaniards</hi> yoak under <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that they acquir'd their freedom under the Government of <hi>Frederick Henry,</hi> We may ſay that without <hi>Maurice</hi> they would have found it difficult to compaſs their Deſigns. This Prince being the Perſon, who began not only to reſtore Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in Armies, but likewiſe put in Practice a world of things till then unknown by Judges. He had the Love of his Souldiers beyond Imagination, was fear'd by his Enemies, and eſteem'd by all his Neighbours; Worthy in ſhort of Commanding the Greateſt States, but happy in having been only the Head of a riſing Commonwealth, ſince ſo many Great events can only be imputed to his virtue.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Viſcount de Turenne</hi> had had Order at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Sedan</hi> to apply himſelf to all that Prince ſhould do as to a Perfect Model. But no need was there of this Command to inſpire him with what it became him to do; He only look'd upon him with Admiration; and in the Deſire he had to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one day a great Captain, he obſerv'd to his leaſt actions; and tho' ſo young, was not wanting to note his Conduct and Prudence. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> beginning to perceive in him an admirable Genius for War, was very willing to Cultivate it, and wou'd not ſuffer him to ſerve in the Cavalry, as did <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon</hi> his Eldeſt Brother: <hi>Monſieur de Turenne</hi> found no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to obey him, for he had already a kindneſs for the foot, and never while he liv'd bely'd that Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57147:7"/>
He was wont to ſay, that the foot made War and the Horſe look'd on, which he meant as to Sieges, where the Horſe for the moſt part have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> wou'd have him, for all his being his Nephew, begin the Trade like Others, that is to ſay, carry a Musket; for that he might have an Army ever well diſciplin'd, he ſuffer'd not a man of what ever Quality to become an Officer, without having firſt learnt how to Obey; for which reaſon he commonly ſaid, that the trade of War had ſome affinity with the Conqueſt of a Beautifull Woman, that the one was only learnt foot by foot, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not obtain'd without much trouble.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Viſcount de Turenne</hi> having already the Wit to judge in due manner of all things, went not only willingly about what his Unkle deſired of him, but as much out of inclination to pleaſe him, he reſolv'd to do the Duty of a Common Souldier. He perform'd the Guards of fatigue as well as the Guards of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and thoſe who till then had Exempted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from thoſe offices, out of Shame to ſee their lazyneſs tacitly reprov'd by a young Prince and the nephew of their General, enter'd inſenſibly into a practiſe of their Duty: yet they wou'd not imitate him ſo far as in the pains he took when the Army was on the March, when he never quitted his Ranks. But his Uncle fearing he might heat himſelf, Check'd him for raſhly Expoſing his health, ſo that he determin'd to do like others. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Order Extreamly pleas'd all the Younger Brothers, who ſaw themſelves under the Neceſſity of doing like the Viſcount, or of being Expos'd to the Cenſure of the Officers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance to the Contempt of the Souldiers; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it partly in this Conſideration, that Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had this Complaiſance, for in the Exactneſs he had for matters relating to the Military Service,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57147:8"/>
he muſt have had powerfull Reaſon to oblige him to Slacken. However the Viſcount de <hi>Turenne</hi> that he might give Example to Others, choſe the Rear of his Batallion, and tho' the Officers deſired him to place himſelf with them, he ever declin'd ſo doing with Excuſes, ſaying, there ought to be ſome Difference between the Officers and Soulders. This Occaſion'd Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> to make an Ordinance, by which the Officers were no longer to put themſelves at the head of their Batallions; and all knowing the Viſcount de <hi>Turenne</hi> to be the Occaſion of this Decree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that ſince he was capable in ſo Green an Age, to obſerve the Diſcipline with ſuch Exactneſs, much another thing wou'd it be when with years he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd more Knowledge.</p>
            <p>He did not long enjoy the happineſs of ſerving under Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi> This Prince out of a Paſſion for Glory, having undertaken to relieve <hi>Breda,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had beſeig'd, dy'd of Grief for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bin able to Effect his Deſign. The States, after having render'd all imaginable Honours to his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Elected in his <hi>Room,</hi> for the Command of their Armies, Prince <hi>Henry Frederick</hi> his Brother, who had the ſame Goodneſs and tenderneſs for the Viſcount de <hi>Turenne,</hi> as had had the General Deceas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. Yet his Birth and Merit requiring his being diſtinguiſht from others, Prince <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> gave him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Foot. If he had been a good Souldier, he was ſtill a better Captain. He did not do like many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality now a-days, who rely upon their Lieutenants for the Care and Management of their Companies. He did not think himſelf ſufficient for its thorough Improvement and well-being; as Young as he was he ſhew'd himſelf ſevere towards his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when ſeverity was requiſite: but ſaving in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters regarding the Service, he Sympathiz'd their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57147:8"/>
and ſufferings; and it was not only with the Mouth, the general Mode of theſe times, but his Purſe was ever open to the Unhappy; and he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether they were of his own company or of another's, when they needed his Aſſiſtance. This put him often under the want of Money; but he told thoſe who remonſtrated it to him, that he ſhould at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine his Liberalities to his own Company; that Money was much better employ'd this way than in Play, in Luxury, or Debauchery, for which reaſon he did not Game, or at leaſt, he playd ſo ſmall a matter, as was not capable of rendring him uneaſy. Nor was he alſo at great expence in Cloaths, and if ſometimes he lay under an Obligation to put on the Garb of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Quality, he did it without affectation, and without deriving a vanity from thoſe ſort of things, as are indeed only ſuperfluous. He ſaid, a man ſhou'd never be Pompous and Magnificent, with other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than the Profit and Livelyhood of Poor People; that finery was more troubleſome than gratefull, and neatneſs ſufficient; that a man of Quality was ſufficiently diſtinguiſh'd of himſelf, without ſtill aiming to be conſpicuous by Gew-gaws and Trifles; that we ſhou'd leave to Women the ſeeking after Trappings and Ornaments: but that a man born for Great Matters ſhould ſlight thoſe that ſavour'd of Effeminacy.</p>
            <p>This amaz'd the world to ſee ſo much Prudence and Wiſdom in a Perſon of his Age, and none that knew him, but paſt in his favour an advantageous judgment of the future. For beſides this, he was of a ſtrong and robuſt Conſtitution, tho' none of the Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, nor Beſt made; but ſeen to deſpiſe the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and rigours of the ſeaſon, never complaining of heat or Cold, ever ſenſible of the fatigues of Others, but never ſpeaking of his own, as if he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57147:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for himſelf only. The <hi>French</hi> Officers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably numerous in the States Army, admiring this young Prince, whoſe Grandeur of Courage ſhin'd in all things, writ his Circumſtances into their own Country, and ſaid, if he liv'd the Age of man, he cou'd not fail of one day trumping up his Fame. This made ſeverall Perſons of Quality write to him obligingly upon this Subject, and among Others <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who after the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> was return'd to <hi>France</hi> with his Wife; for whoſe ſake he had fled into Forreign Countries: for this Great King being of an Amorous complexion, cou'd not ſee that Princeſs without being ſtrongly toucht and Charmed with her Merit: and this had Created ſo great a Jealouſy in the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> that he caus'd his Wife to pack up, &amp; carry'd her to <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> In the mean while the Mareſchal <hi>D'Ancre</hi> poſſeſſing the Queen Mother's favour, had caus'd him to be confin'd ſhortly after his Return, and tho' this Mareſchal was ſome time after kill'd upon the Bridge of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> by Command from the Court, yet this Prince was not releas'd out of Priſon, 'till other great Changes had happen'd in the State.</p>
            <p>But to return to my Subject, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having Written to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> as I have newly ſaid, the Viſcount made him ſo modeſt an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that this Prince, his Relation, had him ſtill in the more eſteem: In the mean while ſome days after an occaſion ſerv'd to ſhew his Courage, and this was the taking of <hi>Klundert</hi> and <hi>Willemſtadt,</hi> which Prince <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> caus'd to be attack'd. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf in that Occaſion, not only as might be expected from a young Prince for whom the World had a peculiar value; but ſeeing his Souldiers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themſelves to be hurry'd on ſo inconſiderately by their Courage, that they broke their Ranks, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57147:9"/>
march'd in Diſorder, he ſtaid the hotteſt, and by his Wiſdom prevented the Enemies from advantaging themſelves of their Imprudence. After this he fought and underwent as much of the Peril and Drudgery of the Aſſault as the meaneſt Souldier, and having torn up a Paliſade with his own hand, he made a Paſſage for Others to advance much farther. The Enemies after a vigorous Defence, were at length compell'd to abandon their R trenchments and betake themſelves to their heels. The victorious Souldier committed great Diſorders in thoſe two Places; and tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Inhabitants by their own fault ſeem'd to have incurred that Calamity, for they had taken up Arms with the Garriſon, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> cou'd not ſee ſo much blood ſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving tokens of his Good Diſpoſition. Being come into <hi>Gertruidemberg</hi> in the head of his Company, a Woman perceiving more reſpect paid him than to the other Captains, made her addreſſes to him for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt a Souldier, who after having plunder'd her Houſe of All, wou'd needs into the Bargain violate her Daughter, a Girle of about Fifteen Years old. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> told her at firſt that ſhe muſt addreſs her ſelf to the Commander of the Regiment, meaning thereby to expreſs the Obedience that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bound to pay to their Superiours: but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Caſe to be urgent, he haſten'd into her Houſe, where having ſound the Souldier ſtriving to commit violence upon her Daughter, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a Poſture to diſarm him. The Souldier, being found in the very Action, judging he was loſt, reſolv'd to ſell his Life Dearly, and drew his Sword in his own Defence; but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> without conſidering his Deſperateneſs, which render'd him much ſtronger than ordinary, attack'd him ſo briskly, that he puſh'd him up to the very wall, but others
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57147:10"/>
coming in help'd him to take him. Put he was into the hands of Juſtice, and found to be related to a number of Worthy Perſons who came to intercede for him. Thus was the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> dayly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd to grant him, as I may ſay, his Pardon; for tho' he was not the Party to be addreſs'd to for that purpoſe, yet they had recourſe to him, as knowing him to be in the Generals favour, beſides his being concern'd in the Principal Offence: for 'twas a terrible Crime in a Souldier to have dar'd to draw his Sword againſt a Captain; not only ſo, but the Nephew too of him who Commanded the Army. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> without being wrought upon by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, told thoſe who ſpoke in this man's behalf, that as for what he had done againſt him, he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave him, nay and wou'd employ his Offices to procure his Pardon, but that God forbid he ſhou'd beg for a man's Life, who having Power in his hand, wou'd uſe it not only to content his Avarice, but alſo his Brutality. Wherefore he left to the Council of War to judge him as they pleas'd, and the Council having Sentenc'd him to have his hand Cut off, and to be hang'd, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> exerted the effect of his Promiſes, for knowing they cut off his hand only for what he had done againſt him, he ſo importun'd Prince <hi>Frederick Henry,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the repugnance he had to grant a Pardon of that nature, he cou'd not refuſe him what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. After this the Souldiers Relations, who had hitherto found Prince <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> inexorable, threw themſelves at his feet to implore that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Pardon might be abſolute; and this Prince who had done a violence to his humour in granting a thing contrary to the rigour of Diſcipline, found it more eaſy to grant another, tho' God in it was more offended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57147:10"/>In the mean while matter was preparing in <hi>France</hi> for his acquiring more Glory. The Peace between <hi>Spain</hi> and Us, was dayly upon the point of being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and whatever inclination the Queen Mother had for it's Continuance, things hourly occurr'd which made it preſum'd the two Crowns wou'd not be long without coming to a Rupture. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſeiz'd on the <hi>Valteline</hi> ſome time ſince, and All <hi>Italy</hi> being by this means menac'd with falling under their Power, had recourſe to the King as the only Prince capable of freeing them from ſervitude. The Kings Inclination diſpos'd him to march to the ſuccours of thoſe who reclaim'd his Protection, but being Suſceptible of all the Impreſſions People were minded to give him, a Moments Converſation with the Queen-Mother, or the Miniſters, ſome of whom were Wedded to the Intereſts of that Princeſs, Others to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> quaſht his Nobleſt Deſigns. <hi>Villeroy</hi> eſpecially was ſuſpected of obſtructing the effect of his Reſolutions, and the Imputation he had had, during the League, of being a Partizan of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſtill corroborated the Opinion People entertain'd, that he would not be Sorry if that Nation ſubdued <hi>Italy.</hi> However his Death having made better hopes to be conceived by thoſe who deſired the Crown of <hi>France</hi> ſhould Embrace <hi>Italy</hi>'s Defence, they Expected this Event from <hi>Puiſieux,</hi> then entring into favour, and whom the King had declared Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Room of <hi>Villeroy.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Beginnings were anſwerable to the hopes People had Conceived: <hi>Puiſieux</hi> in the King's name aſſured all the Princes who had Intereſt in the thing, that they ſhould be powerfully and ſpeedily aſſiſted. The Mareſchal <hi>de Baſſompiere</hi> was diſpatcht into <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> to take Meaſures with the <hi>Cantons,</hi> who were in like manner threatened with the loſs of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57147:11"/>
Liberty. But when People were juſt upon the point of ſeeing great things Midwiv'd, the Money of <hi>Spain</hi> cool'd <hi>Puiſieux</hi>'s Zeal, and under the Pretext of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Hughonots,</hi> he made the King let fall the Deſign he had of relieving <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> then in great favour with the King, and who without ever having been in War, was all of a Suddain become Conſtable, by having had the trick to ingratiate himſelf with his Majeſty by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral ſorts of Birds to fly, promoted this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which he might have hinder'd by his Credit. But being very willing not to Embroil himſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Queen-Mother, with whom already he ſtood not in over-good terms, by reaſon of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Mareſchal <hi>d'Ancre,</hi> of which he was the Principal Cauſe; for he it was Whiſper'd the King, that this Mareſchal was more in a Certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe's favour than ſuted with her Honour, and as the King had already admitted ſome ſuſpicion from certain occurrences, the Duke found little Difficulty to obtain Orders to Kill him. In Effect their Intrigue was become ſo much the Publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that nothing was more Common than the hearing it talk'd of, and the Count <hi>de Lude</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd on that account; for this Lord, who to the Prejudice of his fortune, lov'd to fluſh a Wittyciſme, when Occaſion ſerv'd, had one day anſwer'd a Lady, who ſaid, ſhe was going to fetch, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs's <note n="*" place="margin">Voile in French is Vail and Sail.</note> Vail, <hi>there's no need of a Sail for a Frigat that rides at Anchor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Preparations were made for the War againſt the <hi>Hughonots</hi> out of whoſe hands the Court was minded to wreſt the Places they had demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Security. Four Armies were brought on foot, one of which was deſign'd againſt the Places in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Rochel,</hi> another againſt the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57147:11"/>
               <hi>Hughenots</hi> of <hi>Berry,</hi> another againſt thoſe of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and the King in Perſon March'd againſt St. <hi>Jean d'Angel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> with the moſt Powerfull. This War was quickly terminated, the King Subdued all the Places he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, with more eaſe than he durſt have hoped, for Diviſion reigned in the Party, where the very heads were the Firſt that Betray'd 'em: For under Colour of giving all contentment, they took Care of a great many Places that cou'd do 'em no Good, and left Others that were Strong and Deſenſible wholly unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the mean while the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> not liſten'd to while the War continu'd, nicking the advantage of this Peace, brought the affairs of the <hi>Valteline</hi> again into conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having accus'd <hi>Puisjeux,</hi> either of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or of Male-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the King's Service, he was expell'd the Court, and Chancellour <hi>de Sillery</hi> his Father involv'd in his Downfall. The Chancellour's Brother was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe recall'd from <hi>Rome,</hi> being there in Quality of Ambaſſadour, on the Pretence he had exceeded his Inſtructions, inſomuch that the Count <hi>de Bethunes</hi> was ſent in his ſtead, for the Pope began to underſtand the Affair of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and neceſſary was it to have about him a man in whom Confidence might be put.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57147:12"/>
All this, as I have ſaid, made the world conclude that a War was drawing on with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for they, far from liſtening to any Reſtitution, built Forts in ſeveral places to ſecure their Conqueſts; Beſides this, they endeavour'd to gain over <hi>England,</hi> or at leaſt to amuſe it with ſome Hopes, that ſo it might not beard and thwart their Ambition. For this purpoſe they had propos'd the Marriage of their <hi>Infanta</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Heir Apparent of the Crown, and the Pourtraict of that Princeſs flattering the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, being ſeconded with plauſible offers and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, invited this Prince to undertake a journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> which Court was in reality no wiſe inclin'd to conclude this Allyance; for that Crown aſpiring to the Univerſal Monarchy, and thinking to attain it by affecting a zealous ſteddyneſs to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> was far from cloſing-up this Match, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd it from day to day under various Pretences. At length the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> finding the Pageantry of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proceedings, and the inſincerity and trifling of their Conduct towards him, return'd thence Extreamly Piqu'd againſt that Nation, and reſolv'd when occaſion ſerv'd, to make 'em feel his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de la Vieuville,</hi> ſucceeding into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the <hi>French</hi> Court after <hi>Puiſieux</hi>'s Diſgrace, and willing to avail himſelf of this Diſcontent to do his Countrey ſervice, propos'd then the Marriage of that Prince with a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and the thing having been approved of by all the Parties concern'd, the Allyance was quickly concluded on with a War againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> For beſides what I have newly inſtanc'd, <hi>England</hi> was Wonderfully Edg'd againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that had ſtript the Elector of <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> of his Dominions, and Vow'd his Ruine, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accepted the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to the Prejudice
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57147:12"/>
of it's Intereſts. Nevertheleſs this Allyance which muſt have produc'd a good effect between the two Nations, only ſerv'd to alienate their minds by the Intereſt of the two Miniſters; for the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> being come into <hi>France</hi> in Quality of Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour Extraordinary, fell in Love with a Lady of the firſt rank, whom <hi>Richelieu</hi> loving alſo, became jealous, and made uſe of the credit he began to have with the King to mortify the Duke; ſo as inſtead of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together to the Ruine of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> their thoughts were wholly taken up how to ruine one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their animoſity drew-on in a little time that of the two Nations.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> coming ſuddainly after to the Crown, was not wanting to Arm powerfully by Sea to Execute his firſt Intentions. But <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who had a great Aſcendant at the Court of <hi>England,</hi> not only refus'd him the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which the <hi>French</hi> were bound to ſupply him with by the Treaty, but likewiſe prevail'd with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to forbid that Duke Entrance into the Kingdom, whither his Maſter meant to ſend him in Quality of Embaſſadour. And the pretext for all this was a pretended ill treatment to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and her Domeſticks, part of whom for their Inſolencies were ſent back into <hi>France,</hi> and the others diſturb'd in the exerciſe of their Religion.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Feud between thoſe two Miniſters, ſome Reaſons were there of Policy, which induc'd <hi>Richelieu</hi> to act in this manner, for his being in favour had Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him a conſiderable number of Enemies, among whom was the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> with moſt of the Princes of the Blood. Thus he fear'd that if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a War againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> they wou'd have the more means to harm him: joyn'd to this, that the Queen Mother, tho' much declin'd in her Credit,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57147:13"/>
never ceas'd threatning to ruine him, if he was ſo hardy as to undertake it againſt her Conſent. Theſe Conjunctures having brought prejudice to the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the King of <hi>England,</hi> his Fleet return'd into Port, after having been notably endamag'd by foul weather.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> being incenc'd at <hi>France's</hi> Breach of Promiſe, and having reſolv'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd, was ſtill excited by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who joyn'd to the Reſentment of the King his Maſter, his own Private Piques. The occaſion was quickly offer'd. The <hi>Hughenots</hi> having found after the Peace they had newly concluded, that it had been only made to divide and ſet them at odds, threw themſelves into his Arms, and having implored his Protection, he promis'd it, tho' not ſo much for their ſakes as his own.</p>
            <p>This Tranſaction was not ſo ſecretly manag'd, but that <hi>Richelieu,</hi> a Miniſter that ſpar'd no Coſts for Intelligence, had intimation of it from ſeveral parts; but tho' this gave him ſome Alarum, yet was it nothing in Compariſon of the Diſquiet things put him under that were brewing in the Kingdom. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> to prevent their medling in Forreign matters, endeavour'd to find 'em work at Home. And knowing the bent of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s temper, who turn'd and Weather-cock'd it, as I may ſay, with all winds, they had prepar'd him for ſtrange Novelties. This Prince being look'd on as Preſumtive-Heir of the Crown, for that his Brother had no Children, nay, and without hopes of having any, wanted not Creatures to in-blow him with ill Counſel; for ſome out of the Spleen they bore the New Miniſter, and others in hopes of a better fortune, had a furious grudging for a Change. The Queen her ſelf had a deep hand in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57147:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Intrigue, for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadour having poſſeſs'd her ſhe ſhou'd be ſuddenly repudiated, on the ſcore of her Sterility, ſhe bent her thoughts to ruine <hi>Richelieu,</hi> whom ſhe look'd upon as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Counſel. The Queen Mother out of the ſame Paſſion of removing him from Affairs, ſtill augmented her Daughter in Law's Suſpicions, ſo as ſhe was inclin'd to baulk no means as might prevent this Misfortune. The Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> Prince of the Blood, eſpous'd the Intereſts of the two Queens with <hi>Meſſieurs de Vendôme,</hi> and many other Perſons of the firſt Quality at Court, and their Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to Marry the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Queen Regnant's Siſter; that in Caſe the King came to dye, ſhe might remain in <hi>France</hi> with Honour, without being oblig'd to return into <hi>Spain,</hi> as a Perſon unhappy and a Fugitive. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had another Deſign, he lov'd the Queen, and wou'd have been well Content his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been Dead or put into a Convent, that he might be in a capacity to ſatisfy his Paſſion. But the Mareſchal <hi>D'Ornano,</hi> who had been his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſtill retain'd a great Authority over his Mind, jumpt in neither of their Projects; He was enamour'd of the Princeſs of <hi>Condé,</hi> and to ingratiate himſelf the better with her, he had promis'd her, his Maſter ſhould never Marry any other than the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs her Daughter, ſince marry'd to <hi>Mr. de Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> This Obſtacle retarded the Queen's Deſign. But <hi>Madam de Chevreuſe,</hi> their Confident, occaſion'd another ſturdy Impediment. For being in love with <hi>Chalais</hi> Maſter of the Queen's Wardrobe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told all to him in Private, he went and told it again to the King, and alarm'd him to that Degree, that his Majeſty wou'd have had forthwith confin'd, his Mother, Wife, and Brother, with all thoſe engag'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57147:14"/>
in their Intrigue. <hi>Richelieu</hi> had all the pain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Moderate his Paſſion: But having remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, that if he wou'd ſecure his Reveng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> like treatment, and perhaps a Worſe, for neither the King nor <hi>Richelieu</hi> lov'd him, and perchance might have made ſure of him againſt the future by ſome fatal Reſolution. The Queen was Ill treated both by the King and <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who meant by this means to be reveng'd for her ſlights to him, &amp; had Chang'd his Love into Hate. <hi>Meſſieurs de Vendôme</hi> were releas'd ſome time after out of Priſon, but the Mareſchal <hi>D'Ornano</hi> dy'd in't, not without ſuſpition of having been poyſon'd.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans's</hi> Chaſtiſement was to be match'd out of hand to the Courts mind, and he marry'd <hi>Mademoiſelle de Montpenſier</hi> a Princeſs of the Blood, and extremely Rich. Nevertheleſs he wou'd more willingly have Embrac'd a forraign Allyance out of the Deſign he had of raiſing a Commotion: But what made him deſire it, being a Reaſon not to grant it, he was under an obligation to Conform to the Will of the King his Brother, who promis'd in conſideration of this Complyance to forget all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Paſſages. The Queen Mother having been at firſt deſirous for another Allyance, ſhew'd herſelf in the ſequel paſſionate for this: But the moſt ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, attributed it to her Policy, which did not allow her to declare her Reall Sentiments, So as that the World did this notwithſtanding entertain the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this ſtill the more incens'd her againſt <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> to whom ſhe before bore ſufficient ill will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe gradually as he made Progreſſes in the Kings
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57147:14"/>
Favour, he endeavour'd to drive her thence.</p>
            <p>All that I have now ſaid; did not however hinder this Miniſter from making a Treaty with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naird,</hi> for tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his thoughts were wholly upon the Grandeur of the Kingdom, he was ſtill retain'd by the fear of the Queen Mother, who ever threaten'd him if he came to an Open Rupture with that Crown. But underhand he neglected Nothing that might tend to Create it troubles. He ſent Money into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and endeavour'd to Engage the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> to make head againſt the Greatneſs of that Houſe, the <hi>German</hi> Branch of which was become ſo formidable to Other Princes, that it had nothing left to do but taking of <hi>Straelſundt,</hi> for the reducing them into an abſolute Slavery. The Duke of <hi>Mantoua's</hi> Death, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd alſo very ſeaſonably to furniſh him with new Deſigns of Greatneſs.

And indeed the Marquis <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles</hi> had orders to draw together the Troups that were upon the frontiere, and Conduct them to the ſuccours of <hi>Cazal,</hi> which the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> being aſſiſted with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troups had allready beſieged: But the Duke of <hi>Savoye</hi> having oppos'd the Paſſage of our Forces, the Army diſperſt of it ſelf for want of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57147:15"/>
Proviſions, or rather thro' the Intrigues of the Queen Mother, who had gain'd the Principal Commander, to draw upon <hi>Richelieu</hi> this Check and Affront: This Diſgrace was rewarded by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being baulk'd of their expected Succeſſes; for they being call'd by the <hi>Hughenots</hi> of <hi>Rochel</hi> to free their Town from it's Blockade, made a Deſcent into the Iſle of <hi>Rhe:</hi> But having neglected out of too much Confidence to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Fort <hi>de la Pree, Thoiras</hi> made ſuch a Brave Defence, as gave time to <hi>Canaples</hi> to come to his Succours with Eight hundred men, and afterwards to <hi>Schomberg</hi> with a Greater Number; So that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> leaving their Canon behind, retir'd in ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order to their Ships: This happy Succeſs haſten'd the Deſign of the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> for the Execution of which, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> promis'd Men and Ships, tho' the Conformity of Religion ſeem'd rather, that they ſhould have undertaken the Defence than the Ruine of that City: But other Conſiderations having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd over this, they perform'd their Promiſes. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> deſpis'd at firſt this Enterprize, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Kings Forces, But when they ſaw that the Cardinal Caus'd a Dyke to be made in the Sea to diveſt 'em of all hopes of Succours, they joyn'd Joaks and Mockeries to Contempt, imagining this Work wou'd only turn to his Confuſion. And indeed 'twas as a Dream to many People, to ſee 'em aim at Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing ſo furious an Element: But when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Work advanc'd, they began to change that great Confidence into a fear, which did not however bereave 'em of the Courage to ſtand upon their Defence: On the Contrary the more they ſaw the Danger was preſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more things they did to remove it: they call'd in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their Aſſiſtance: Who Fitted out a brave Fleet under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> But ſtill not finding the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57147:15"/>
Occaſion to wreek his Revenge on the Cardinal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he was infinitely enrag'd, he return'd to <hi>England,</hi> after having been worſted in two or three Encounters. The King of <hi>England</hi> ſtill perſevering in his Good intentions for the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven order for repairing the Fleet, and putting out new Ships to Sea, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain nominated for that Expedition: But was aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated at home upon the point of his Departure, which occaſion'd the King to name another in his ſtead. This latter was not more Proſperous than the Lord of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> for after having in vain attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give Succours to the Beſeiged, and been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd, he return'd in like manner into <hi>England,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to their own Defence. At length after they had made the utmoſt efforts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, even to eating the vileſt things for want of victuals, they Surrender'd the City, which held out from the 10. of <hi>September</hi> 1627. to the 29 of <hi>October</hi> 1628.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Rcohelle,</hi> look'd upon as an Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Place, not only Surpriz'd Strangers, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe moſt of thoſe of the Nation, who in the Broiles and Confuſions the State had been in for near a Century, had ever found their Sanctuary in that Town againſt the Royall Authority. And indeed it was reckon'd as the Center of Rebellion, and this is what moſt powerfully excited the King and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to undertake it's Reduction. Thus amidſt the Publick Rejoycings, which the Court order'd to be made for that happy Succeſs, tokens were ſeen in Peoples faces which bely'd Appearances: But the King without otherwiſe minding what they harbour'd in their Boſomes, receiv'd indifferently from Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and from the <hi>French,</hi> Congratulations upon that Great Event. Among thoſe however who plaid
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57147:16"/>
the Plain-Dealers, and ſpoke from the Bottom of their Hearts, were the Parties concern'd in the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> who were under a total Deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, unleſs a ſpeedy Remedy was apply'd: For the Emperours Troups were not only before <hi>Cazal,</hi> but alſo before <hi>Mantoua,</hi> around which Place they had ſeiz'd all the Conſiderable Poſts. For this Reaſon, When they made him the Complements upon his new Conqueſt, they deſir'd him to run in to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of <hi>Italy,</hi> certainly loſt without his Aid. The Queen Mother covertly oppos'd this Expedition, to which the King ſeem'd of himſelf inclin'd. But Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> to whoſe management the taking of <hi>Rochelle</hi> was indebted, Soaring to blaze his Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Forreigners, egg'd the King on in his Deſign. Thus the <hi>Italian</hi> Expedition having been reſolv'd on, notwithſtanding the Rigours of the Seaſon, and the obſtacles thwarting it, the King ſell to march with his Army, and the Rumour of his Coming being Spread far and near, long before his appearing Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the frontiers: His Adverſaries thoughts were wholly employ'd in barring him Entrance either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or by Force. The firſt means ſeeming more eaſy than the ſecond, The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having declar'd againſt the new Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> ſent his Son to meet the King, and encharg'd him with Sundry Propoſals; but not one of 'em being Satisfactory to the King or Cardinal, to whom the King referr'd all things, this Prince was oblig'd to get him back to his Father, and return with new Inſtructions. In the mean while the Paſs of <hi>Suſa</hi> was forc't: but while the King was preparing to make the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> repent the Reſiſtance he dar'd to make, his Son arriv'd, who in virtue of the Pow'r he had from him, ſubmitted to all the Conditions the Court of <hi>France</hi> thought fitting to impoſe. As ſoon as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57147:16"/>
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew of the Accommodation, they drew their Troups from before <hi>Cazal,</hi> for that otherwiſe the Land of <hi>Milan</hi> had remain'd Expos'd. The <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> did the like, and the King overjoy'd with having ſav'd the place, by the bare Rumour of his Fame, ſent <hi>Thoiras</hi> thither, without engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf farther.</p>
            <p>The King's journey into <hi>Italy</hi> had been the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in all Courts long afore it's being underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for we were very willing to ſhew thereby to Our Allies, that in the hurry of Domeſtick Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions we were not wanting to take care of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Affairs. The news of it came to the ears of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> ſtill in <hi>Holland,</hi> as well as to the ears of many Others, and being enflam'd with a deſire to ſignalize himſelf in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he thence took occaſion to deſire his return into <hi>France.</hi> But Prince <hi>Henry Frederick</hi> wou'd in no wiſe grant it, alleadging the War of the <hi>Hughe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> not to be yet terminated, and perhaps wou'd be again renew'd in a very little while; that thus it was not juſtice to go draw his Sword againſt his Brothers, who had ever had ſo much regard for their Family; that it became him to follow his Fathers example, who retir'd and ſtaid at his own home, as ſoon as he ſaw the Miniſtry ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> upon infringing the Edicts, under whoſe Faith thoſe of their Communion had thought themſelves in ſafety. His Mother wrote to him to the ſame purpoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject, and as he was all Obedience to her, <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being Dead at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> in the Year 1623, he was far from inſiſting any longer upon that journey. Nevertheleſs he was in no wiſe content to remain any longer in <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Climate and the Demeanour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not in the leaſt ſute his humour, he ſaid, they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57147:17"/>
in <hi>France</hi> breath'd a more pure and Temperate air; and to expreſs the averſion he had for thoſe who took Tobacco, he ſometimes maintain'd out of a kind of Raillery, it to be the ſmoak that came out of the Pipes which rendred the air ſo thick and heavy: yet knowing it to be a thing the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cou'd not be without, he ſaid nothing to them when he found 'em funcking, but had not the ſame Complaiſance for others, but told 'em freely his Opinion. He had ſtill more averſion for Drunkards whom he cou'd in no wiſe endure. He ſaid, if Drunkenneſs was a Defect in all ſorts of Perſons, a much greater was it ſtill in a Martial man, who had not like others the times of Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Repoſe; that it became a Souldier to be ever ready for the firſt Command, which when Drunk he could not be. He never was the firſt to broach theſe ſort of Diſcourſes, for fear of being tax'd with the Arrogancy of rebuking others; but when once fluſh'd in Converſation, he cou'd not well refrain letting them ſlip without ſpeaking his Sentiments in the Caſe, for moſt of the Officers, without ſo much as Excepting the <hi>French,</hi> had ſuch a Propenſity to Debauchedneſs, that it ſeem'd to make part of their Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the occaſions of Signalizing himſelf were not very frequent in the Country he refided in, ſince his abode there, they had allmoſt ever been forc'd to play the Defenſive Part, and tho' they attempted ſeveral enterprizes, not one of them ſped: They fail'd in that of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where they had Correſpondence, and this young Courage became pawl'd, as I may ſay, to ſee that Fortune did not appear in favour of it's Party. Afraid he was, that <hi>Maurice,</hi> who had not been over-Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull a Year or two before his Death; had left
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57147:17"/>
his Brother the Heir of his Ill Fortune, as well as of his Eſtate; and like to thoſe Hunters who are not content unleſs they take the Game they have purſu'd, he wou'd have had all things tune in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort with his Expectation. Prince <hi>Henry Frederick</hi> blam'd him ſometimes for his Impatience, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it only departed from an exceſs of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he found not much to incurr his Cenſure and Rebuke: He only told him it, to be ſometimes needfull to moderate one's ſelf, and acquainting him with the Reaſons for all he did, he inſtructed him in what he had the moſt Paſſion to learn. In ſhort this Prince being deſirous to ſee ſome great Occaſion, remain'd not long without having ſatisfaction. <hi>Boiſleduc</hi> at the Extremity of <hi>Brabant,</hi> was, if a man may ſay it, a Thorn in the State's foot, of which they dayly found the ſmart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and being neceſſary to pull it out, the States gave order to Prince <hi>Henry Frederick,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſince his Brothers Death, to lay Siege to that Place. This Fortreſs is much ſtronger by it's Scituation then by Contrivances us'd for it's Fortification. 'Tis Scituated in the midſt of a Marſh, which ſeems to ſecure it from all Inſult, and no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches can be made to't, but on the ſide of the Gate of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> wherein two Forts have been rais'd in which conſiſt all it's Fortifications. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs theſe Fortifications ſeem ſufficient for the ſafeguard of the Place, for the Ground is ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as not to bear more than ten men afront, nay and out of this compell'd have they been to raiſe a Cauſſey for the conveniency of Waggons, for the Water is ſo deep both on the Right and Left, that without this Contrivance no means wou'd there be for their Paſſage. In this ſo difficult a place was it the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> made his Attack, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair

the inconveniences of Nature he employ'd all the ſtratagems of Art. Yet new Difficulties aroſe to thoſe allready in view; for eight hundred men of the Garriſon of <hi>Breda,</hi> got into the Town, in deſpite of thoſe that had planted themſelves upon the Avenues to hinder that Deſign: yet this did not diſcourage the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> but as he thence foreſaw new Difficulties, he demanded new Succours of the States, who ſent him a Reinforcement of ſix thouſand men. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity was a remarkable thing in the Beginnings and Proſecution of this Siege, for tho' he had been preſent at that of <hi>Grol,</hi> which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had taken the Year afore, that ſeem'd to him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of this. He admir'd the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs us'd to divert the Courſe of the Rivers, the Invention of Mines, that of Bombs, and all the reſt employ'd for the Deſtruction of his Enemy. But amid all this, far from being in the leaſt want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his function of his Charge of Captain; he was preſent at all the Attacks, nor more nor leſs than if he had been a Volunteer, and oblig'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to all ſorts of Perils. The <hi>Sieur de Vaſſignae</hi> his Governour being under a continual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet for his Life, made his Complaints to <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon,</hi> and to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himſelf, deſiring them to moderate the exceſs of his Courage: But <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon,</hi> whoſe humour delighted in thoſe ſort of things, was far from condemning an Action he approv'd: On the contrary, being the firſt to do like him, he ſtopp'd <hi>Vaſſignae's</hi> mouth, who after this cou'd not do otherwiſe than follow them whereever their Courage carry'd them to ſeek out Danger. But the greateſt riſque the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ran in all the time of this Siege, was in an occaſion created him by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57147:18"/>
being Engag'd in the purſuit of four or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men of the Garriſon of <hi>Breda,</hi> that aim'd at putting themſelves into the Town, receiv'd two ſhots in his Cloaths. The <hi>Sieur de Vaſſinae</hi> ſeeing him in the hotteſt of the Action and all cover'd with Fire, threw himſelf in with him, to do the beſt he could to bring him off, or at leaſt to interpoſe between him and Danger; but was not ſo happy as his Maſter, being ſomewhat dangerouſly wounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After the Enemys had made ſtill ſome further Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> drove them from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hedges, to which they had made their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, but ſtill flying to others, he was fain to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was he that firſt ſet foot to ground, and that had not the leaſt part in their Defeat. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to how great danger he had expos'd his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Diſſembl'd the joy he had upon this occaſion, by giving him an honourable Check, but withall cou'd not forbear telling his Principal Officers, that he was very much miſtaken if that Young Prince wou'd not one day come to Eclipſe the Glory of the Greateſt Captains. For he was noted to retain a cool temper in the hotteſt occaſions. He courted indeed the greateſt Perils, but did not expoſe himſelf hand over head; he weigh'd things before he undertook them, and in a green youth exerted the Conduct of a man of Fifty Years.</p>

to force his Camp, without expoſing himſelf to an evident Defeat, he took his way towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and having paſs'd without any Obſtacle that River, he thought to make him raiſe the Siege, by the fear he ſhou'd be under for the Places that were in the heart of the Country. In effect the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> was alarm'd at his March, and much more ſo when he heard he had paſs'd the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> taken <hi>Amers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> and made excurſions to the very Gates of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi> But while he made all the Provinces trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Governour of <hi>Emerick</hi> knowing he had led along with him, the better part of the Garriſon of <hi>Weſel,</hi> took that City by Scalade, and freed his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from their Apprehenſions. The Marquis of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen</hi> fearing to be coopt up between the Rivers, made a haſty retreat, but not without leaving a ſtrong ſuſpition of Correſpondence with the Prince of <hi>Orange. Boiſleduc</hi> having expected ſome Great matters from this Diverſion, ſeeing it ſelf Cloſely preſs'd, and without hopes of Succours, Surrender'd after a competent long Siege, and wherein the Parties on both ſides had Signaliz'd their Bravery.</p>
            <p>The Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> had now had a Breathing while, but were not as yet compos'd. Indeed the Siege of <hi>Cazal</hi> had been rais'd; but beſides that the Imperialiſts were ſtill around <hi>Mantoua,</hi> that Siege was juſt upon the point of being renew'd. <hi>Spinola,</hi> having acquired a great Reputation in <hi>Flanders,</hi> had quitted thoſe Provinces by the King his Maſters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and after having Embark'd with Numerous Troups without any Bodies taking Wind of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he came to land at <hi>Genoua</hi> in order to Execute the Enterprizes contriv'd againſt the Repoſe of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> who notwithſtanding the Remonſtrances of his Mother had a great Paſſion to Signalize himſelf in the Service of his own Country,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57147:19"/>
ſeeing that according to all imaginable appearances a furious War was upon the point of being kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, he lay perpetually repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, that more Honour was to be acquired in Serving a Great Monarch, than a Commonwealth not yet well ſettl'd. But <hi>Madam de Bouillon</hi> having been born in thoſe Provinces, Cover'd under the Cloak of Religion the Inclination ſhe had for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing him there: She durſt not however openly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſenſe of things ſo reaſonable; but to weaken them the beſt ſhe cou'd, ſhe gave him to underſtand, there was no Difference between the Service he did the King in another Country, and that he did him in his Own; that beſides the Allyance which this Prince had with the Commonwealth, he it was that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd it with neceſſaries for Carrying on the War; maintaining there actually a Body of ten thouſand Men, in the head of whom was a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> and that fighting as he did in thoſe Troups, 'twas fighting for the King, for whoſe Service he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much Paſſion; that beſides ſhe had the Comfort of knowing him with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who wou'd ever take more Care of him, than wou'd do another not ſo near related; that he muſt have patience, at leaſt, wait till the King deſir'd him; and that if he meant to enhance his Value, he muſt not Diſcover his Eagerneſs. But the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> knew the Thoughts it became him to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this Anſwer. For tho' Youth is ever very prone to flatter it ſelf, he did himſelf ſo much juſtice, as not to preſume ſo highly to his Advantage: He knew well enough that at his years he was only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for his Birth, but if that was an advantage in reſpect of ſome Perſons, it was not ſo much conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a Monarch that had ſo many greaterthan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that reckon'd it their Glory to do him Homage.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57147:20"/>
Thus through the Paſſion he had of making himſelf known to his Majeſty more particularly than he was, he ventur'd to write to him; but fearing <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon</hi> would oppoſe his Intention, and knowing his Governour wou'd never ſuffer him to do it, he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd the Bus'neſs from 'em Both, and gave his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Mareſchal <hi>De Chatillon</hi> then returning to Court. The Mareſchal <hi>DeChatillon</hi> having deliver'd it, without acquainting any other as he had promis'd the Viſcount, the King read it with Delight, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already heard advantageous things of this young Prince, he judg'd the Good they ſpoke of him: to be ſtill leſs than what might be Expected from him, Nevertheleſs for Reaſons to me unknown, he did not ſend for the Viſcount to him; for to Credit what I have heard affirm'd by certain People, namely, it to be on the Score of ſome Diſſatisfactions giv'n him by the late <hi>Monſieur De Bouillon,</hi> is a thing not meriting much belief. The King was a Prince of too good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bear a grudge ſo long in his heart. <hi>Monſieur De Bouillon</hi> had then been Seven years Dead, and cou'd be of nought elſe accus'd, than of having been too free with his Majeſty in favour of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Much more reaſon is there to believe <hi>Monſieur De Chatillon</hi> had ſerv'd him but by halves, and that at the ſame time when he preſented his Letter to the King, he repreſented to his Majeſty it's not being convenient to take him yet from a School, where he render'd himſelf capable of doing him one Day Great Services. This was <hi>Monſieur De Turenne</hi>'s thought: but as he was extremely reſerv'd and Prudent for his Age, he only unboſom'd his Mind to his greateſt Confidents, adding in Excuſe of <hi>Monſieur De Chatillon,</hi> that if he did ſo, he did it with a good Intention, that it was out of fear he might loſe his time in <hi>France,</hi> where there was more proſpect of a Civil than of a

Forreign War. In Reality, the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf to be led dayly away by Evil Councils, was ſtill upon the Point of giving ſome diſquiet to the King his Brother. His Wife was Dead in Child-Bed, and aim he did again to match himſelf with ſome Forreign Princeſs, to have thereby the more means to trouble the Kingdom. The Enemies of Cardinal <hi>deRichelieu</hi> taking it ill that he made them ſo little privy to his Affairs, put theſe thoughts in's head, &amp; People were dayly expecting that ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or other wou'd break out, iuſtead of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that they might promiſe to themſelves in the Flouriſhing Eſtate the Kingdom began to be in at that time. Tho' <hi>Monſieur de Turenne</hi> was vext to ſee his hopes miſcarry: Yet he comforted himſelf, for he thought after having done what lay in his Pow'r, he cou'd do no more; that he had gone a great way in making known his Zeal to the King, and that His Prince being inform'd of it, it was now for his Majeſty to Command his Return, when he judg'd it fitting. In the mean while the War that had been made in <hi>Flanders</hi> with much fury, the Campain afore cool'd thro' the <hi>Spaniards</hi> want of Forces, they having caus'd a great part of their Troups to march towards <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Infanta Iſabella Clara Eugenia,</hi> Governeſs of the Low-Countries, being afraid the <hi>Hollanders</hi> might make advantage of that occaſion, bethought her ſelf then to make ſeveral Propoſals of a Truce; and tho' the <hi>Hollanders</hi> knew on what Account theſe Overtures were made, the deſire they had to enjoy ſome Quiet after troubles of Eighty Years conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, caus'd 'em to ſuffer themſelves to be amuz'd. The Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> reſolving at any rate to croſs theſe Negotiations, ſent an Embaſſadour to the <hi>Hague,</hi> who by the help of Money, which he did not want, brought the States to change their Sentiments,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57147:21"/>
who inſtead of that Truce, Struck-up a new Allyance with the King. The Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> &amp; whoſe Intereſt led him to Create Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Us'd alſo on his part his utmoſt Pow'r to fruſtrate their Negotiations; but with all this, he had but a very ſlender Proſpect of recovering his Imaginary Royalty, or his Quality of Elector, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had ſtript him of, with it to inveſt the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> Dayly did he receive new Mortifications, and People far from acknowledging him as King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as he fain wou'd have been own'd, his near Relations deny'd him ſo much as the Quality he inherited by his Birth, and added to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages done him by his Enemies, Injuries to him ſtill more ſenſible. The Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> being come to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to adjuſt ſome Differences he had with the Republick, refus'd him the Upper-hand, and this provoking the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> ſuch things paſs'd between theſe two Princes, as would have tranſported 'em to Blows, had not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Prudently interpos'd. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> the <hi>Palatine</hi>'s near Kinſman, eſpouſing his Intereſts, undertook to demand ſatisfaction for this Affront, but cou'd not bring it about, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> wou'd not accept of a Duel. Two or three days paſs'd before this new Quarrel was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, and in the mean while ſo many Perſons throng'd to the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne</hi> to offer him their Service, as ſufficiently manifeſted the great value the world had for him. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was not ſorry for this Accident, for he was in the Intereſt of the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> but out of an unwillingneſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf, he oblig'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to make ſome Excuſes to the Duke of <hi>Newburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while matters of a much greater Conſequence occurr'd in <hi>France.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57147:21"/>
whoſe favour augmented more, and more notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the hatred of his Enemies, inclin'd the King to Succour Powerfully the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> upon the point of being oppreſs'd. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to divert this Blow, induc'd the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> with whom they kept Correſpondence, to retire into <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> where the Duke, a great lover of Novelties, afforded him a Retreat. Tho' ſuch a juncture was capable of laying by all other thoughts, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> who ſutably as Difficulties aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, perceiv'd his Courage to encreaſe, after having pacify'd the beſt he cou'd Domeſtick trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, procur'd from the King the Quality of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and with a Flouriſhing Army march'd away towards <hi>Savoy;</hi> For in the occaſion that then offer'd it ſelf, the firſt thing to be done was to ſee if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> wou'd keep to the late Treaty, and conformably to what had been reſolv'd on, joyn his Troups to thoſe of the King, or if he would take the Party of his Enemies. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> upon the firſt Propoſals made him of this matter, ſought out Evaſions and Pretexts to avoid declaring himſelf; one while excuſing the Emperour and <hi>Spaniards</hi> for what they had done, and another making ſemblance of blaming them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving thus to gain time. But the Cardinal as Crafty as He, not contenting himſelf with theſe put-offs, preſs'd him ſo hard to ſay what he would ſtick to, that he was at length oblig'd to promiſe Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Army, and to joyn Troups, in caſe the Peace then in Diſcourſe, prov'd difficult to conclude. But he no ſooner fancy'd he had diverted the Storm, but that forgetting his Promiſes, he not only deny'd Proviſions, but alſo kept upon the Borders of the Army, to take his advantages on't, if occaſion ſerv'd. The Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> finding there was no truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57147:22"/>
him, had a Deſign to ſurpriſe him at <hi>Rivoli,</hi> a Houſe of Pleaſure, whither he was gone to take the Diverſion of Hunting: but the Duke being advertiz'd of it, as it is believ'd, by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> had time to ſcape to <hi>Turin</hi> with the Prince his Son. The Cardinal having miſs'd his Aim, declar'd openly againſt him, and without any more ceremony laid all his Territories Waſt; and after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſhow as if he would beſiege <hi>Turin,</hi> he oblig'd him to put the better part of his Forces into that Town. But having made that feint, only the better to Compaſs his Deſigns upon <hi>Pignerol,</hi> he laid Siege to that Place, and took the Town in one Days time; Inſomuch that nothing now ſtood out but the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel. The Cittadel quickly follow'd the Town's Deſtiny, &amp; the Cardinal being become Maſter of it, he Employ'd his Troups in the Conqueſt of the Places that are in the Marquiſate of <hi>Saluces.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> who had Secret Intelligences with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> having demanded Succours of them in ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an Occaſion, they ſent him Troups and Money, and while he made head againſt the Cardinal, they laid Siege to <hi>Cazal. Spinola,</hi> Commanding their Troups as I have already ſaid, detach'd his Son, to attack <hi>Pont-deſture</hi> which <hi>Thoiras</hi> had Fortify'd, and made himſelf Maſter of it, allmoſt at the ſame time the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> found the means to Enter <hi>Mantoua,</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to them by Treachery. Of all the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> he had only <hi>Cazal</hi> left; nay, and that ſo ſhut-up by <hi>Spinola,</hi> that there was no likelihood of its being able to hold out long. The Garriſon wanted Proviſions, and no means could be contriv'd how to get any In. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity having induc'd the King to paſs himſelf into <hi>Italy,</hi> he put his Kingdom into the Beſt Order and Poſture he cou'd, and having left an Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57147:22"/>
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to defend the Campagne, he made his Reſentment fall upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to whoſe Infidelity he attributed all theſe Diſorders. Being entred his Countrey, he in a few days ſubdu'd all <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſaving <hi>Montmelian,</hi> at which he thought it not convenient to ſtop. Theſe good Succeſſes gave ſtill more Courage to the Garriſon of <hi>Cazal</hi> who defended themſelves with much Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and hoping to be quickly Releived, <hi>Thoiras</hi> found it no difficult matter to make 'em ſupport patiently, Famine, and other Inconveniences of a long Siege. In the mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſtartl'd at theſe Conqueſts, thinking to do much, by gaining of time, they amuz'd the King with ſome Ouver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Peace; and the King relying on them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Queen at <hi>Grenoble.</hi> But they no ſooner ſaw him at a Diſtance, but that they preſs'd <hi>Cazal</hi> more then ever; Inſomuch that it was reduc'd to Extremity. The King diſpatcht forthwith away the Mareſchal de <hi>Schomberg</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> to march into thoſe Parts; and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> meeting with the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> near <hi>Veillaine,</hi> deliver'd him Battle, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him. His Victory was follow'd with the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Veillaine, Salluces, Villa-Franca, Pontrallier,</hi> and with the Deſolation of <hi>Piemont. Turin</hi> ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Duke's tottering Fortune; but his Troups having been beaten in endeavouring to Defend the Paſſage of the <hi>Po,</hi> in all likelihood the Reſt of his Dominions were going to fall into his Enemies hands, if not hindred by two things; One, the Peſtilence, beginning to make Great Havock in Our Troups; Other, his Death, which brought a great Change; for his Son not ſucceeding to his Paſſions as he did to his Dominions, inſtead of reſolving upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the War, manifeſted ſo much inclination to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57147:23"/>
Peace, that he Peremptorily declar'd his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to remain Neuter. After this thinking that another Declaration wou'd ſtill advance this work, he promis'd to employ his Arms againſt that Party as ſhou'd refuſe to make Peace, ſo as this wrought a Truce to be made between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Us, by which <hi>Cazal</hi> was promis'd to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to them in a certain time, in caſe of Non-Relief, and they bound themſelves on their ſide to furniſh the Garriſon with victuals of which it had extreme need. All the Parties believ'd they had got by this Treaty, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> imagin'd they had been ſufficiently Cunning in having been able to hinder our Troups from paſſing on; Wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have ſav'd <hi>Cazal,</hi> by delivering it from Famine, and gaining time to relieve it. Be it as it will, <hi>Mazarine</hi> who had a hand in this Treaty, and came to the King as far as <hi>Grenoble</hi> on this Account, thereby acquir'd great Honour, and this Beginning of good fortune laid the foundation of his future Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. <hi>Spinola,</hi> having likewiſe been employ'd in this Treaty, did not gain the like Repute: On the contrary the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having complain'd of his eaſineſs in making this Ceſſation, they began to miſuſe him, and their ill treatment being ſo much the more ſenſible to him in that he had rendred them great Services, the grief of it Kill'd him. In the mean while as greater Preparations than ever were making on the one ſide, to Succour <hi>Cazal,</hi> on the other to Attack it, News came that <hi>Monſieur de Lion,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> the Cardinals Confident, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> on the King's behalf, had made a Treaty by which the Emperour was to give the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> the Inveſtiture of his Dominions. This Treaty in all Probability muſt make all the Parties concern'd lay down their Arms, but none being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57147:23"/>
becauſe it contain'd ſeveral matters which each ſide interpreted to it's Diſadvantage, this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Armies march'd. The Marquis <hi>de St. Croix</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Spinola</hi> in the Command of the Troups of <hi>Spain,</hi> and being already come before <hi>Cazal,</hi> kept cloſe and cover'd in his <hi>Lines,</hi> hoping the ſcituation of his Camp wou'd hinder us from paſſing the River of <hi>Gattola</hi> between him and Us: but knowing we had Croſs'd it, a terrour was ſpread among his Forces, and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> being there as a Sub-delegate of the Pope's Nuncio, taking that time to make New Propoſitions, Both Parties ceas'd Hoſtilities, 'till they had ſeen the Reſult of his Negotiation. Fortune, that had been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to him, did not abandon him in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for after ſundry goings and comings, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with both Parties not to proceed further. The Principal Conditions of this Treaty were, that we ſhould remit <hi>Cazal</hi> into the hands of an <hi>Italian</hi> Garriſon Subject to the Duke of <hi>Mantoua:</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caus'd ſome <hi>French</hi> to enter Diſguis'd into the Place, the Hoſtilities were juſt a going to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd, had not <hi>Mazarine</hi> interpos'd again. Nothing more now remain'd than the reſtoring to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the Places taken from his Father; but the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> being minded to retain <hi>Pignerol,</hi> the taking of which was his Atchievement, he wou'd never liſten to any ſuch-Propoſals as were contrary to what he intended.</p>
            <p>In the mean while new Troubles aroſe in <hi>France,</hi> and gradually as the Cardinals Repute encreaſed among Strangers, his Enemies endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe him in <hi>France.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who ſerv'd for an Implement to all the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, who were hewing at, and undermining the Cardinal's fortune, Vext that a Certain Perſon had
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57147:24"/>
been confin'd to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> took thence Occaſion to withdraw from Court, and went to <hi>Orleans.</hi> The King no ſooner knew of his Departure, but being Inform'd at the ſame time of the Correſpondence he had with Foreigners, he reſolv'd to prevent the Inconveniencies that might happen if he left the Kingdom; For which Reaſon he ſent Men after him to Seize on his Perſon, and went himſelf to Second thoſe Men in Caſe it Chanc'd to break forth into a Rebellion. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> knowing with what Deſign the King his Brother was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <hi>Paris,</hi> left <hi>Orleans,</hi> and fled into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where the Duke de <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> Governour of the Province had promis'd him a Retreat.

The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> of as Turbulent a Temper at leaſt as the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> receiv'd him with Open Arms, and to make ſure of him, gave him his Siſter <hi>Marguerite</hi> in Marriage, a Princeſs of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Beauty, but of ſomewhat an Odd ſort of Humour. The King ſuſpecting the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not only to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Queen-Mother provok'd a this Ill-treatment, only watcht to deceive their Vigilance, to make her Eſcape to <hi>Capelle,</hi> where ſhe had Intelligence with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> being her greateſt Enemy, and willing to have her far enough off, tho' he ow'd to her the Obligation of his fortune, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Guards to allow Her the Occaſion of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57147:24"/>
making her Eſcape: But himſelf Securing <hi>Capelle,</hi> that Princeſs found no Harbour there; ſo as not knowing where to put her Head, ſhe entred the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> where the Governeſs receiv'd her neither more nor leſs than if ſhe had been Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> was overjoy'd to ſee her in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, for after this the King cou'd no longer doubt of her holding correſpondence with them, and as he hated them mortally, his Averſion for his Mother became ſtill ſo much the Stronger. However ſtill more and more to heighten this Averſion of his, the Cardinal diſpatcht away ſeveral Courriers to deſire her to return, but as he Expected that the more ſhe ſaw her ſelf Courted, the more Stiff and Refractory ſhe wou'd be againſt all Complyance; the Courriers only brought back Refuſals, with arrogant Propoſitions, ſo as this fail'd not of producing the effect he expected. In the mean while all the Reſentment ſell upon the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The King having aſſembled a Powerfull Army put himſelf upon the March to go attack <hi>Nancy,</hi> while, on another ſide the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>de la Force</hi> laid Siege to <hi>Moyenvic. Moyenvic</hi> made no great Reſiſtance for a Place ſo ſtrong; but the King was not ſo Quick, as being willing to give the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> time to prevent his Anger. This Duke had foreſeen this Storm, and Endeavour'd to draw <hi>Madam de Bouillon</hi> into his Party, who in the Abſence of her Children had full Pow'r in <hi>Sedan,</hi> but this Princeſs in no wiſe minded to be concern'd in thoſe ſorts of Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had refus'd his Offers; ſo as that the Duke having no hopes left, ſave in Submiſſion, he came in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the King. After he had Excus'd himſelf in the buſineſs of the Duke of <hi>Orlean's</hi> Match, and promis'd to abandon him, there remain'd nothing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57147:25"/>
more than his giving of Sureties for his keeping his Word, and the King being contented with thoſe he offer'd him, he retreated with his Forces out of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> But the Duke forgetting his Promiſes, accordingly as he ſaw the King drawn farther off, he never troubled his head further about performing the Treaty, ſo that bating, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was gone to <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> there was not any Change in his Conduct. The King being well inform'd of his Deſigns, had hardly had time to refreſh himſelf, when he muſt think of going to Chaſtize him anew. But during theſe Occurrences, <hi>Madam de Bouillon</hi> had a Secret advice that he might poſſibly turn his Arms againſt her, upon his knowing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals made her by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> At the ſame time, ſhe ſent a Courrier to her Children to impart to them this News: But <hi>Mr. de Bouillon</hi> not thinking the Intimation did Challenge any Credit, left <hi>M. de Turenne</hi> the Liberty of going to reincourage her in this Occaſion. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> who deſired nothing more than to get near the Court, was far enough from making any longer ſtay in <hi>Holland,</hi> and after having taken his Leave of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his Friends, he departed for <hi>Sedan,</hi> where he was no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, than that he went to aſſure the King of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and of <hi>Madame</hi> his Mothers. The King receiv'd him very obligingly, and having declar'd to him, he never doubted of the fidelity of his Houſe, he ſent him back to <hi>Sedan,</hi> where the <hi>Mareſchal de la Force,</hi> ſince his Father-in-Law, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd ſome time after on the King's behalf, to Swear <hi>Madam de Bouillon</hi> in the Preſent Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and he who commanded in her ſons Abſence, to remain Loyal to him. An Act was drawn-up in due form, by which the Mareſchal oblig'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57147:25"/>
in the Kings Name to take their Houſe into His Protection. Which had been allready once done ſince the King came to the Crown, and once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the Reign of <hi>Henry the Great</hi> of happy Memory. In the mean while the King was Entred <hi>Lorrain,</hi> where after having taken <hi>Pont-a-Mouſſon, Barleduc,</hi> and <hi>St. Miel,</hi> he approach'd <hi>Nancy.</hi> The Duke, whoſe Forces were not capable of facing theſe of ſo Powerfull a King, fearing that with the Loſs of his Capital City, he might run the riſque of loſing his Dominions, Choſe to go in Perſon to the King, to whom he had allready ſent ſeveral times the Prince his Brother. The King receiv'd him very cooly, and the Cardinal whom he was alſo oblig'd to ſee in this Occaſion, made him yet, a worſe Entertainment; but this Prince pretending not to mind it, in his Preſent Circumſtances, entred into Negotiation with this Miniſter, and cou'd not free himſelf out of this Buſineſs, but by abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Propriety of <hi>Clermont,</hi> and Suffering Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be put into <hi>Stenay</hi> and <hi>Jametz.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being come into the Kings Army, as he had giv'n a thouſand Proofs of his Courage, he receiv'd from this Prince and his Miniſter all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Good Treatments; and the latter, a man well known in all things, finding him to be a perſon Excellently well qualify'd, was willing to oblige him to the Kings Service, and ſo procur'd him a Regiment of foot. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being highly Satisfy'd with the manner of his Reception at Court, long'd only for Occaſions to Signalize himſelf, that he might be able to give proofs of his Acknowledgement. In the mean while as the Eyes of all People, were upon his Merit, and that his Birth beſides render'd him Conſiderable, he was quickly courted by thoſe who aim'd at Embroiling
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57147:26"/>
the State as an Inſtrument capable of making them Succeed in their Deſign. But this Prince too much hated their Cabals, and their Rebellion, to ſuffer himſelf to be Seduced: He had over and above, ſo ſtrong an Averſion to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had a hand in all theſe Intrigues, that he was their moſt Mortal Enemy. He had been train'd-up in this Averſion by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after having ſuck'd it, as I may ſay, with his Milk, he had obſerv'd from the time he had any knowledge of things, the Perſecutions they had brought upon thoſe of his Religion: For they, it was, who to divert the King's Arms from off their own Territories had fomented the Wars made upon them; and Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had too much Wit to be ſo groſsly deceiv'd; yet conſidering the State of things at his entring upon his Miniſtry, he did not dare to interrupt them, out of fear of the Queen-Mother who would have it ſo; and leaſt it ſhou'd be ſaid, that he, who as a Biſhop had more ſtrict obligations to deſtroy the <hi>Hughenots,</hi> had ſav'd them, being ſo near their Ruine. Yet he let no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſcape of making known to the King the little Faith they ſhew'd in all things; and principally at the Siege of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> for after having promis'd to ſend Ships, they deſerr'd from day to day the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their Promiſes, and when they were at length oblig'd to do it, they arriv'd in ſo ill a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they were wholly unſerviceable.</p>
            <p>The Opinion which the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had of them was known to the Cardinal, and it pleas'd him infinitely; for whether it proceeded from the Zeal he had for his Religion, or from an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy natural to him, or the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was ſtill advantageous to the ſervice of the Crown. In the mean while a man may ſay that the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57147:26"/>
Hatred he bore them was rather founded upon the Knowledge he had of their Policy, than upon any Natural averſion, for he cou'd not endure that under the pretext of Religion, they ſhou'd ſeek to Cover the Invaſion the deſign'd to make upon all the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

However the Duke of <hi>Pomerania</hi> to prevent the ſeeming to have call'd him, appear'd in Arms upon the Frontier of his Territory; But after ſome ſlight Loſſes feigning to undergoe the Victour's Law, he deliver'd-up his Towns, and joyn'd himſelf to the King of <hi>Sueden.</hi> This irruption was uſher'd in by divers things that might well make the Emperour fear ſome Change in his then flouriſhing condition: For the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who ſeem'd moſt Wedded to his Fortune, had been the firſt to induce him to depoſe <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> a Famous Captain, by whoſe means he had atchiev'd all his Conqueſts. After this they had alſo conſtrain'd him to Diſarm, and <hi>Guſtavus</hi> his Army was made-up out of the Ruines of the Emperour's too, inſomuch that he had for Enemies thoſe who a little afore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57147:27"/>
were in his Pay, and fought under his Enſigns, but Enemies ſo much the more irreconciliable, that after having paſs'd, ſome Ten Years, others Fifteen, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Twenty, and ſome more in his Service, they had been Diſcarded for their Reward. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who had plaid him theſe unlucky turns, had likewiſe ſent ſecretly into <hi>France</hi> to hamper him in new troubles, and Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> having a great Soul, &amp; contriving how to render the Kingdom more flouriſhing, let not this occaſion ſlip without emproving it to Advantage: He had beſides Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and had aſſur'd him of a Hundred Thouſand Francs a Month to help him to make War. Nevertheleſs as he had a Wit that fore-ſaw things at a diſtance, inſtead of cauſing the King to ratify the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> of which I have ſpoken afore, he had brought ſo many Difficulties in it, that it had been reſtrain'd to the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo as that he had an open field to enter into War when he pleas'd. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> fill'd with Piety, was over-joy'd to ſee ſuch puiſſant Preparations to deſtroy the Enemies of his Religion, and cou'd not ſufficiently admire the Cardinals Conduct, who in the midſt of the thorny Affairs rais'd him in the Kingdom, had the faculty to provide againſt all with ſo much judgment. He deſired nothing more than to have his Regiment ſent that way, and this was the Cardinal's Deſign, of whom he had begg'd this favour with much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. But dayly was this Miniſter haunted with new troubles, and in the number of the Enemies that aroſe up againſt him, he cou'd not do all he wou'd, and was ſufficiently happy in doing one thing after another. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had the Queen Mother and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in their hands to thwart his Deſigns, excited them to cauſe their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57147:27"/>
to riſe, of whom they boaſted the having a great number at their arrival at <hi>Bruxells.</hi> The Queen Mother only breathing Revenge, wou'd have had the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> without more ado to enter the Kingdom in the head of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wou'd not proceed to a Declaration till they ſaw on what fund they were to make this Diverſion. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> on his ſide more irreſolute than ever, and weary of <hi>Bruxells,</hi> liſten'd to the Propoſition which the King his Brother caus'd privately to be ſent unto him: but as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew the byaſs of his mind, they took care he ſhou'd not give them the ſlip, and in the mean while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to fortify him in his firſt Deſigns. Yet the only Obſtacle that barr'd his Return to <hi>France,</hi> was his Marriage with the Princeſs of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which the King cou'd not reſolve to approve of, and which he on his ſide wou'd not break. Thus being Both wedded to their Sentiments, all hopes of Acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation were taken away, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> tamper'd with the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Languedoc</hi> to ſupport a Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> in the mean while, had not only been happy in the beginning of his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, but the Proſecution of it too, had been ſo Glorious to him, that he had Conquer'd whole Provinces in as little time, as it would have taken to paſs them over. After having Re-eſtabliſh'd the Dukes of <hi>Meklembourg</hi> in their Territories, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea from the Servitude of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> beaten four or five of their Armies, Subdu'd the Strongeſt Faſtneſſes of <hi>Germany,</hi> Spread Conſternation among his Enemies, and giv'n jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy to his Allyes, he advanc'd towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where he render'd himſelf Maſter of the City of <hi>Mayence.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> either jealous of his

Fame, or fearing perhaps he might Emprove the Occaſions offer'd him by Fortune to the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Friends as well as Enemies, knew not how to ſtop the Courſe of ſo many Conqueſts; for to declare openly againſt him, was a Dangerous Deſign, and beſides had been wanting fidelity to his Ally; and to ſuffer him to advance much farther, might allure him to the Conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> the Goodneſs of whoſe Soil, and the Deliciouſneſs of whoſe Climate being a Great Charm to a Conquerour. For the finding out a Medium to all this, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to prevail with the Eccleſiaſtique Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to depart from the Allyance they had with the Emperour, that ſo under the Pretext of Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> might be oblig'd to turn his Arms elſewhere. But the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> ſeeing Clearly into his Intentions, redoubl'd his Hoſtilitys before the Treaty cou'd be Concluded, and put thoſe Princes into ſo great a Deſpondency, that the Electour of <hi>Trier</hi> only threw himſelf into the Cardinals Arms. For a Token of the Dependancy he meant to have for him thenceforward, he put into our hands the fortreſs of <hi>Hermeſteim.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Army was Arriv'd to take Poſſeſſion of <hi>Coblentz,</hi> and other the Places of his Territories, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perceiving it to be a way to give the <hi>Suedes</hi> an Inlet into the Low-Countreys, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall'd Us, and Clapt a Garriſon into that Town. The Mareſchal <hi>D'Effiat,</hi> who was advanc'd, with Intention to Seize on't, but had trifled away much time about <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> from whence he pretended to be furniſh'd with Proviſions, having learnt this News, fell Sick of Grief, or perhaps by an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent meerly Natural; be it as it will, he Dying ſome days after, the Mareſchal <hi>d'Eſtree</hi> was ſent in his Room, who laid Siege to <hi>Trier.</hi> This
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57147:28"/>
Place more conſiderable for it's Scituation than it's Strength, made but a Sorry Reſiſtance: Yet the <hi>Viſcount de Turenne,</hi> then in the Army, Scap'd not running much Danger, having receiv'd a Bullet in his Armour. <hi>Coblentz,</hi> Clutch'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Surrendred in like manner to the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and they put it in our hands, Conformably to a Treaty we had newly made with them, by the Miniſtry of the Marquis de <hi>Breſſé,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Novelties took away all doubt of a War with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> joyn'd to this, that they had formally declar'd themſelves for the Queen Mother, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whom they had furniſhed with Troups. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having in that time beſieg'd <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> they were conſtrain'd to take them back and employ them on that ſide. <hi>Maſtricht</hi> was ſo important a place, that they reſolv'd to uſe their utmoſt efforts for it's conſervation: But their Forces not being ſufficient for ſo great a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they had recourſe to <hi>Papenheim,</hi> Commanding a flying Camp for the Emperour's Service. <hi>Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim</hi> after having paſs'd ſeveral Rivers, acroſs a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Dangers, came at length upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> where he was joyn'd by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> But having perceiv'd the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Camp to be ſo well fortify'd, that he wou'd have much the Diſadvantage in coming to Blows, he caus'd ſeveral Skirmiſhes to be made, ſo to draw him out of his Lines. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> reſolving to maintain his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, let him ſpend his flame, and reſted ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with oppoſing him with ſome ſmall Troup; of Horſe that riſqued nothing; So as <hi>Papenheim</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving he only loſt time, retir'd without making any further Attempt. Thus the City of <hi>Maſtricht</hi> fell into the States hands who conferr'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it on the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> This Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57147:29"/>
Succeſs did not paule the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in his ſiniſter Deſigns, but not being able to get from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Succours he expected, nor from the Dukes of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> he march'd away for <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> had caus'd all the Towns to riſe. In his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he endeavour'd to draw-in <hi>Dijon</hi> to his Party; but that Town refuſing ſo much as to receive his Letters, he reveng'd himſelf upon the Houſes in it's Neighbourhood, which were plunder'd by his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. In fine after having in vain endeavour'd to urge into an Inſurrection divers of thoſe Provinces, thro' which he directed his way, he came into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and was receiv'd by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> nor more nor leſs than if he had been the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For to attract the more people into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, it was requiſite to ſet up ſome vain Image of Royalty, to which thoſe People, as well as the reſt of the <hi>French,</hi> have a ſtrong Inclination. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſtill retain'd the Authority in his own hands, and this Prince only ſerv'd him for a Cloak to cover his Ambition. As ſoon as this Rebellion broke out, there's no deſcribing the ſenſible Affliction it gave the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> Beſides his being the Duke of <hi>Montmorency's</hi> Relation, he had for him a peculiar eſteem, and vex'd to ſee him fully ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble Actions by one ſo contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he equally apprehended both the Succeſs of his Enterprize and the Chaſtizement. The Criminal was Dear to him, but on another ſide his fault was Great, and requir'd the King's revenging his Authority, wounded by ſo Enormous an attempt; ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his great Concern for his Safety, he wou'd have Condemn'd him himſelf, had he been his Judge. In the mean while the King, ſtill in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> had detach'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57147:29"/>
ſuppreſs this Rebellion, and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> having notice of his being already entred <hi>Languedock</hi> with full Deſign to fight him, he went to meet him, ſo to Spare him half the way. A River was there between the two Armies, and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> having paſs'd it rather as a Volunteer than a General, his temerity was attended with a ſpeedy Repentance. Before his men cou'd come-in to his Aſſiſtance, dangerouſly was he wounded, but not loſing Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he pierc'd thro' to the laſt rank of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taillon of the Guards, and being only follow'd by a few of his men, among whom were the Count of <hi>Moret,</hi> the Kings Natural Brother, with the Counts of <hi>Rieux</hi> and <hi>de la Feuillade,</hi> he receiv'd ſeveral wounds more, and was at length taken fighting like a Lyon. As for thoſe three Counts, they were kill'd upon the ſpot, and their Deaths hindred them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing by the hand of an Executioner, as undoubtedly they cou'd not have avoided, for they were no leſs culpable than the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Count <hi>de la Feuillade,</hi> who had occaſion'd the Inſurrection of all the Nobleſs of <hi>Limoſin</hi> to Conduct 'em to the Succours of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans.</hi> If the Duke of <hi>Montmorency's</hi> Rebellion had ſenſibly griev'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment overwhelm'd him with Affliction; for he thence fore-ſaw fatal Conſequences; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally when he made Reflexion upon the jealouſy born him by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu:</hi> For out of the Deſire this Miniſter had of Promoting his Houſe, he endeavour'd to debaſe all others, and eſpecially thoſe that had been in Luſtre ſince the Eſtabliſhment of the Monarchy, and which would ever top his, whatever Settlement he might procure it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without Vouchſafing to hear thoſe who ſpoke in the Dukes Behalf, he referr'd all the Interceders to the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57147:30"/>
King, whom he had allready diſpos'd to ſeverity; and now the Man wont to be intermeddling in all, e'vn the leaſt things, was very willing to be thought not to intermeddle in the leaſt in this Occaſion, ſo to reject upon the Prince, the Spite that might be conceiv'd at his juſtice. This however did not hinder ſeveral Perſons from laying themſelves at the Kings feet to obtain this Dukes Pardon: but ſhewing himſelf inexorable, Judges were Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated, who ſentenc'd him to be beheaded. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> whom nothing cou'd divert from his duty, without conſidering it to be in no wiſe, making his Court to the Cardinal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd Mercy of the King for this Poor Lord: but the King having not Yielded to the Prayers of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> nor to thoſe of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> nor wou'd he hear his; ſo that the Sentence was Executed to the great Grief of all People. Thus dy'd <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Montmorency</hi> Peer and Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> at Thirty Seaven years of Age, a Lord of a Comely Perſonage, Brother in Law of the Firſt Prince of the Blood, and whoſe Houſe had poſſeſs'd the firſt Offices of the Crown, but ſtill more conſiderable by his Merit, then by that of his Anceſtors; In fine illuſtrious in all his Life, Excepting it's laſt Action.</p>
            <p>His Death did not appeaſe the troubles of the Kingdom, The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being Exaſperated at his Execution, ſo much the more that <hi>Bullion</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him his pardon from the King, withdrew anew into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> where he found the ſame Retreat, he had found ſome time afore. For the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> as faithleſs as Ever, deſired nothing better than to foment Broiles and Cumbuſtions, notwithſtanding the loſſes he had ſuffer'd, hoping that if fortune was once adverſe to the Cardinal, a time wou'd not only come for him to recover what he had loſt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57147:30"/>
but likewiſe to make ſome Other Conqueſts. But the King not thinking fit to give him time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for his Defence, departed immediately from <hi>Paris,</hi> and went and laid Seige to <hi>Nancy,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was in no wiſe minded to Stay his Coming. The Regiment of <hi>Turenne</hi> was at firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on this Expedition; but having receiv'd a Counter-order two Days after, this Prince, who had particularly pleas'd himſelf with the Expectation of ſignalizing himſelf in the Kings preſence, march'd away for <hi>Alſace,</hi> whither Troups were ſent againſt the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> there at that time with an Army of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In the mean while a Great Viciſcitude had happen'd in <hi>Germany.</hi> The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> after having reduc'd the Emperour to the bare Hereditary Provinces, forc'd the Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> out of his Capital City, and extended his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ev'n beyond his hopes. At laſt fortune grown weary of favouring him, had terminated ſo many gallant Actions by his Death. The Emperour ſeeing himſelf as low as he had ſeen himſelf Exalted a little while afore; attributing ſo great a Change, to the fault he Committed in having diveſted <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtein</hi> of the Command of his Armies, and being roſolv'd to reſtore it him, had Caus'd ſuch advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Conditions to be offer'd him, that a man might ſay he had with him ſhar'd the Empire; for <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestein</hi> had the Power of making Peace and Warr, of diſpoſing of Conqueſts, of the Booty, of Winter Quarters, and of all that Soveraigns are wont to reſerve to themſelves, for fear of giving too much Credit to their Generalls. <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> having thus on theſe Conditions taken the Command on him again, had no ſooner caus'd his Drum to be Beat, than that flocking there was from all ſides to liſt under him; for Martial Men knowing his Liberal humour,

and the Kindneſs he had for Souldiers, reckon'd it unworthy to diſſolve in repoſe, while that he, they look'd on as their father, ſhould Expoſe himſelf to hardſhips &amp; Dangers. Thus he had quickly brought on foot a New Army, compos'd of <hi>Veteran</hi> Officers, and <hi>Veteran</hi> Souldiers; and tho' the Imperial Court had great faith in him, yet could it not refrain being Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the Suddainneſs with which he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht ſo difficult a matter. Fortune that had ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd this Captain, till ſuch time as the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> had depos'd him out of Jealouſy, ſeem'd then to make him a Reparation for that Injury. For this Duke being diſtreſs'd by the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> diſpatcht to him divers Courriers, to intreat him, without remembring what was paſt, that he wou'd march to his Relief. But <hi>Wallaſtein</hi> being very glad to Mortify him, contented himſelf with giving him fair Promiſes, and marching ſometimes ſlowly, and ſometimes ſtopping on purpoſe at Paultry Borroughs, he had the pleaſure to ſee him reduc'd to ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that he was already become a Fugitive, and juſt upon the Point of Emploring his Enemies Mercy. Thinking it then Glorious to Succour this Unhappy Prince, he turn'd his Arms againſt <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> expecting the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> to abandon <hi>Bavaria</hi> to run to the Defence of that Place. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> joyn'd the Troups of <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving render'd themſelves ſtill the more formidable by this Means, the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> March'd againſt him, with Deſign to give him Battle. The two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being but a League and half diſtant from one another, <hi>Walleſtein</hi> retrench'd himſelf in his Camp, and the King of <hi>Sueden</hi>'s thoughts were only how to lure him thence to decide their Quarrel in one Day: But <hi>Walleſtein</hi> rather uſing the Skin then the Sword, ſtopp'd the fury of his Enemy; Inſomuch that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57147:32"/>
the Two Armies remain'd ſome days gazing upon one another: All Peoples Eyes were in the mean time turn'd upon theſe Two Great Generals, to ſee on which ſide fortune would declare her ſelf. But the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> thinking, that after ſo many Victories, it tended to his Prejudice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo long without any Performances, undertook to force his Camp, and gave the Orders Neceſſary for the Execution of that Deſign. The Firſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes were anſwerable to his hopes: The <hi>Bavari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whoſe Quarter he had attack'd, were forc'd after a Vigorous Defence. But juſt in the Nick when he thought he had won all, <hi>Walleſtein</hi> with his own Troups ran to Succour his Men, and not only re-eſtabliſh'd things by his Preſence, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made them Change face, ſo that the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> after having left three Thouſand Men on the Spot, was conſtrain'd to retreat. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> re-conquer'd his Dominions after this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and having put a Garriſon into <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> the Empire that had groan'd ſo long, began to breath again. In the mean while, <hi>Walleſtein</hi> being minded to be reveng'd on the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> one of the King of <hi>Sueden</hi>'s Principal Buttreſſes, entred his Territories, through which he Shot Terrour and Conſternation. The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> durſt not oppoſe this Torrent before he had encreas'd his Army with ſome Succours, brought him by his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants her &amp; there diſpers'd for divers Conqueſts: But when he ſaw himſelf ſtrong enough as not to be under any fear, he March'd againſt the Enemy, who had attack'd <hi>Leipſik,</hi> and was become Maſter of that Place before he cou'd get up to it's Relief.</p>
            <p>The Experience of the Commanders and the Valour of the Souldiers, render'd the two Armies allmoſt Equal; and as Both ſides were Cock-a-hoop
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57147:33"/>
to fight, they came to <hi>Blows</hi> near <hi>Lutzen,</hi> a little Village of ſmall renown before, but made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by ſo great a Battle. The Fight began at Break of Day, and the Beginnings were favourable to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who drove away the Enemies from Certain Ditches that Separated the two Armies, took Six of their Cannon, and turn'd 'em againſt 'em, which put 'em into Great diſorder. However the <hi>German</hi> Cavalry being come up, before the <hi>Suediſh</hi> could fill up their Ditches for their Paſſing, it drove away the Enemies in it's turn, retook four Canons, and ſeiz'd on the Poſts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry had Newly loſt. The <hi>Germans</hi> being now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fierce and haughty with this Succeſs, paſs'd then the Ditches, which hinder'd them from joyning the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and now no more Impediment intervening the Deſigns of either ſide, Both Parties fell in Pell-Mell with one another, Each demonſtrating a Great Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Victory. The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> being in the Right Wing of his Army, and his Preſence augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Courage of his Men, routed all that ſtood in Oppoſition: but being minded to go from One Wing to the Other to ſee how matters went, he encounter'd <hi>Picolomini,</hi> in the Mid'ſt of the Way with Eight hundred Cuiraſſiers who ſtopp'd him when he leaſt Expected it, for there was ſo great a fogg that day, that a Body ſaw not to a ten foot's Diſtance. The King endeavour'd to defeat this New Troup with the Regiment of <hi>Finlanders</hi> he was at the head of. But having by a Piſtol-ſhot been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Arm, which put him to great pain, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to be dreſs'd, &amp; in his Retreat receiv'd a Musket Bullet behind, which made him fall from off his Horſe; He was at the ſame time trod under the Horſes feet of thoſe who purſu'd him, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known by any Body; Inſomuch that his Men, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57147:33"/>
little inform'd of his Deſtiny, as the Enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the Combat with the ſame Reſolution, and finiſht the Victory he had rough-drawn. However the Duke of <hi>Weyman</hi> knew his Horſe that was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down, and had ſome Suſpicion of the truth. But being cautious of ſhowing it, they were all in an inconceivable joy for the Succeſs of that Day, when the King of <hi>Suedens</hi> Death Chang'd their Contentment into a Sadneſs beyond Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>This Battle laſted from Break of Day, till ten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Clock at Night, but not ſo furious as it had been in the day time, for the fogg having continu'd all the Day long augmented towards the Evening, Each being afraid of attacking his Companion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Enemy, and thus the <hi>German</hi> Infantry Scap'd, which otherwiſe it would have been Eaſy to have defeated. <hi>Papenheim</hi> was kill'd in fighting ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly. But not a Man diſtinguiſh'd himſelf more than <hi>Picolomini,</hi> who having ſeen all thoſe of his ſide abandon their Ranks, he with his Regiment only ſtood firm, tho' he had already receiv'd ſeveral Wounds. <hi>Walleſtein</hi> who valu'd virtue, and not wont to leave it without Reward, ſent him a Preſent of twenty thouſand Crowns, and gave him beſides the Praiſes due to his Merit.</p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had loſt many Men in this Battle, with ſome Captains of Renown, they thought they had gain'd much by the Death of him who had vow'd the ruine of the Empire, and had ſped ſo well in that Deſign. <hi>Walleſtein</hi> retreated to <hi>Leipſik,</hi> but not believing himſelf there in Safety, he paſs'd on into <hi>Bohemia</hi> where he labour'd to repair the wrecks of his Army. His flight having afforded the <hi>Suedes</hi> the means to diſperſe, for the Embracing the more Conqueſts, they render'd themſelves Maſters of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Conſiderable Poſts; and the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57147:34"/>
ſtill in their Allyance, had time to recover <hi>Leipſik.</hi> In the mean while the News of his Death being come into <hi>France,</hi> was receiv'd with more Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than would have been Expected, for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts began to Create a Jealouſy; for this Cauſe did the Cardinal de <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s Enemies publiſh that he had been kill'd by his Contrivance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and that he had poſted a Man on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Commit ſuch an Enormous Crime: but 'tis not juſt to give Credence to ſo high an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and coming from ſo ſuſpected a Place. In the mean while, the Emperour was not content with <hi>Walleſtein</hi>'s Retreat, who if he had been minded might have improv'd the advantages offer'd him by the Death of ſo conſiderable an Enemy, but as he had no inclination to have the War ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ended, he was fall'n into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> under the Pretence of driving thence ſome of the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Troups, committing Diſorders in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. This Conduct made the Emperour fear he had put the Command of his Armies into the hands of a Man that meant to abuſe the truſt; and this ſuſpicion having ſtrongly poſſeſt his mind, was ſtill augmented by the Enemies of <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> whom they ſaw Exalted above them, and in a poſture of wreaking his revenge whenever he went about it. The taking of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> who ſince the King of <hi>Sueden</hi>'s Death had obtain'd the Command of his Army; Exaſperated the Emperour the more againſt him, and having ſent him poſitive orders to march to the Succours of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who became thereby Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to great Diſtreſſes, it was the General Doubt whether he wou'd obey or not. And indeed, inſtead of Executing punctually what had been order'd him, He made his Troups return into <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57147:34"/>
nay, and Garriſon'd ſome of them in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> under Colour that the Enemies might come on that ſide. But the Inſolence of the Souldiers, to whom he gave full Licenſe, quickly render'd the Remedy more inſupportable than the Miſchief; Inſomuch that there began to be a General Murmuring againſt him. But he little minded all theſe Complaints, His Army might at his beck go to <hi>Vienna,</hi> nay, and the Emperour had fears inculcated into him, that this General had ſome Deſigns upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. As it is a Crime ſufficiently great in a Subject to give matter of Apprehenſion to a Sovereign, the Emperour vow'd his Deſtruction, joyn'd to this, that he had newly been inform'd that he had made a Secret Treaty with <hi>Arnheim,</hi> General of the Troups of <hi>Saxony,</hi> by which they had promis'd mutual Aſſiſtance to one another, to re-eſtabliſh the Son of the Electour <hi>Palatine,</hi> newly Dead of Grief for what had befall'n the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and at length to compel the Emperour to make a diſadvantageous Peace, and to Baniſh the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> out of all the Empire. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were his moſt powerfull Enemies, becauſe he had alſo agreed by the ſame Treaty, that they ſhould be driven out of <hi>Germany.</hi> Thus the Count of <hi>Ognate,</hi> their Embaſſadour to the Emperour, inſinuated into this Prince to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch <hi>Walleſtein</hi> at any Rate, and with the ſooneſt to Employ Steel, or Poyſon for that Purpoſe: The one ſeem'd difficult, as being paſſionately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by his Souldiers, and the other was no leſs ſo, being Equally cheriſh'd by his Servants, to whom he was ever moſt Benevolent. In the mean while, the Imperial Court had <hi>Galas</hi> and <hi>Picolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> then in the Army, ſifted, but they after having refus'd to take upon them this Crime, they offer'd however to Separate themſelves from him, and carry
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57147:35"/>
along with them part of the Troops, over whom they had a great Aſcendant. The thing was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted according to Promiſe, and <hi>Walleſtein</hi> fearing the being abandon'd by ſtill a greater Number, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to <hi>Egra,</hi> from whence he diſpatcht his Greateſt Confidents to the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> with Great Promiſes if he wou'd aſſiſt him: But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour haſt'ning to prevent his Deſpair, whoſe effects might be Extremely fatall, gain'd Count <hi>Leſley,</hi> Captain of his Guards, with Colonel <hi>Butler,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gordon;</hi> and theſe having invited <hi>Torſica</hi> &amp; <hi>Liſlo</hi> to Dinner, the one <hi>Walleſtein</hi>'s Brother in Law, and the Other his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friend, and who cou'd Both Oppoſe their Deſigns, they began the Scene with theſe, whom they Aſſaſſinated, after having pretented a Quarrel with them in drinking: From thence they went to <hi>Walleſtein</hi>'s Apartment, who upon the firſt noiſe ran to the Window to call for help: But his Guards in the Hall, having quickly been diſpatcht, and his Chamber Door broak open, he was kill'd with Hallebards, but not without having made a Brave Defence, and layd ſeveral dead at his feet. After this manner dy'd <hi>Albert Walleſtein,</hi> Who after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving render'd the Empire Flouriſhing, and been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd out of jealouſy, had had the Pleaſure to ſee his Enemies ſo confounded, that they were reduc'd to have recourſe to him; who ſav'd the Empire when juſt upon the point of falling, but having conceiv'd Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Deſigns, was at laſt treated as he merited. Though he was of Eminent Extraction, yet born to a very ſcanty Eſtate, but his Courage Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this Defect, he found means to acquire ſuch immenſe Riches that he ſeveral times brought Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on foot at his own Coſt, built Stately Palaces; in fine, Equall'd the Greateſt Princes, whether for the Number of Domeſticks, for the Sumptuouſneſs of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57147:35"/>
Movables, for the Delicacy of the Table, or for the Beauty of his Stable. The next day after his Death, Duke <hi>Albert Francis</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> whom the Duke of <hi>Weymer</hi> ſent to agree with him the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under which they were to make War upon the Emperour, was Seiz'd on without having had notice of what Occurr'd.</p>
            <p>Such Great Mutations cou'd not happen in the Empire without Occaſioning it new Loſſes. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> having had correſpondence with <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> and having the faculty to improve all things to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, imagining ſome time wou'd be ſpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour cou'd retrieve and ſettle his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he had ſo prevail'd with the Duke of <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> as that he had made him beſeige <hi>Briſac,</hi> while the <hi>Rhingrave</hi> with another Body of Troups had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Enſheim, Fribourg</hi> and <hi>Rhinfeld.</hi> Two Battails had alſo been fought againſt him, wherein he had had the Diſadvantage, the one againſt the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> near <hi>Tarn,</hi> the other at <hi>Lignitz</hi> againſt General <hi>Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> So many Great Succeſſes Courted the Attention of all the World, and at the ſame time the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But they ſtill waited to judge of the Event of Things by what ſhould happen at the Siege of <hi>Briſac,</hi> which was to open to us the Gates of <hi>Germany,</hi> and furniſh us with the means of joyning our ſelves to our Alleys. This only ſeem'd wanting to the Kings happyneſs, he having newly reduc'd the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to Reaſon, and conſtrain'd him to put his Metropolis into his hands, for he cou'd take no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſurance of a Prince who had fail'd him ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his word. In the mean while, tho' the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>De Turenne</hi> took as much Intereſt as any Body in the Succeſs of the Kings Arms, he cou'd not hear ſo many Great events diſcourſt of, without being affected with a ſtrong Emulation: It vext him to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57147:36"/>
remain a Spectatour of ſo many Great things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having more ſhare in them, and it ſeem'd to him as if all the Glory of 'em was reſerv'd for Others, while he himſelf was only an eye-witneſs of 'em: For which Reaſon after <hi>Alexanders</hi> example, whoſe Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he had, he was ſeen to ſhed tears ſeveral times at the recital of the Actions of ſo many Great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which the Age was full of: But as he admir'd not any one ſo much as the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> he wept and bewail'd him no leſs than if he had been his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; He ſaid it to be great Pity, for ſo Great a King to dye in the flour of his Age, but that he ſhou'd nevertheleſs be content to Live much leſs than He, to acquire a like Reputation. He caus'd all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Exploits to be related to him; and cry'd, ſo great a Man ought to be immortal. An Officer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly having told him, that he that had kill'd him, had done his Country a great kindneſs; and I (ſaid he) believe he has done it a great injury, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any other will fight with ſo much Courage for the Intereſt of the Religion. Theſe Words ſeem'd very fine to thoſe who took Notice in what ſence he had ſaid them, for by this they perceiv'd that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Religion before all things; yet he did not love to diſpute about it, for he knew that theſe ſort of Diſputes rather engender Diviſion, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite Peoples minds: He ſaid that People never brought the Neceſſary Diſpoſition for ſuch ſort of matters, that it was rather amidſt Wine and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, that points of Religion were canvaſt, than when they were faſting. Though he was very paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, as I may ſay, for the Memory of the Great <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> yet was he not wanting to bewail and Commiſerate <hi>Walleſtein's</hi> Deſtiny, whoſe Services he fancy'd merited a Better treatment. I do not doubt, ſaid he, but that he conceiv'd Criminal Deſigns
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57147:36"/>
againſt his Maſter, all his Actions are reputed as ſo many Crimes; and as things of this World may be diverſly interpreted, it is not to be wonder'd that if his have been explain'd in ill part. In reality ſome there are that aſſert he did not fall into Cabals, till after the Particular Knowlege he had, that his Ruine was reſolv'd on. Be it as it will, the Viſcount <hi>De Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> did not thus take his part, but thro' the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Diſpoſition, which did not ſuffer him to hear any Body ſpoke ill of, for as well for Others as for himſelf, he was enclin'd to judge favourably of all things. He ſaid, a Worthy Man, that is a man of ſome Extraction, and had been brought up by Virtuous Parents, had ever an inclination prone to Good, that true it is, Ambition, as well as ſeveral other Vices often Corrupted Manners, but that it muſt be granted that the Ambitious ever retain ſome ſhadow of Virtue, and that before they throw themſelves into the Precipice, they are hurry'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſeveral ill treatments. People generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to hear him diſcourſe in this manner, for tho' his Speech was not abſolutely free, what he ſaid was attended with more gracefullneſs in his Mouth, than in the Mouth of many others, gifted with a more eaſy utterance. And indeed they only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Sentiments without dwelling upon an Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Nature which ſerv'd only the more to Set of and Enhance his Merit; for he was ſo much the more Circumſpect in ſpeaking, and when he ſpoke they were as ſo many Sentences. I know not whether the kindneſs we have commonly for thoſe, who have ſome conformity of humour with us, made him eſteem thoſe who talk'd little like himſelf, or whether this Eſteem was naturall to him; but as much as he lov'd them, as much did he hate great Talkers: He ſaid it to be impoſſible for thoſe ſort
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57147:37"/>
of People to Obviate bolting frequent fooleries, and as there ſometimes aroſe Quarrels among the Officers from over-much babbling, he thence took occaſion to remonſtrate to Others, that they could not with too much Precaution abſtain from that infirmity: Yet he never addreſs'd his Speech to any one that could be ſuſpected of this Defect, but ſpoke indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently to all People: Nay, and ſometimes out of fear that ſome one of the Number might apply to himſelf what he ſaid, he diſcourſt with the Wiſeſt and moſt reſerv'd, as if it had been to him he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Diſcourſe. Yet he was very well content not to be allways applauded, for he was very willing to leave Each one at Liberty to ſpeak his Opinion. For this reaſon he ſaid commonly, that thoſe who held their peace, when they had ſomething good to ſay, were either Timerous, or Suſpected others did not love Truth; that a Prince was no more Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then another to his Sentiments, and that provided he had good reaſons giv'n, he wou'd be the firſt to own himſelf in the Wrong. This he found no harder to do then ſay, and he has been often ſeen to own ſome fault he had Committed, and known of, only by himſelf: But he delighted in declaring it, when it principally ſerv'd to Excuſe ſome one who had done the like, for at leaſt without perceiving a Perſon to be incorrigible, no better a Protectour was there than the Viſcount. As ſoon as the Officers of his Regiment knew him, it is not to be ſaid the eſteem they had for him, not one of 'em Chanc'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany without ſpeaking of him to his Advantage, and that he accounted himſelf happy in ſerving under ſo Virtuous a Prince. In the mean while, the whole Army perceiv'd the Improvements that were to be made in his Company, for an Officer of his Regiment was eaſily to be diſtinguiſht from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57147:37"/>
another; he had at leaſt the air of Wiſdome tho' he were not Wiſe, nor were they known to be Swearers, or Debaucht: If he cou'd not hinder them from frequenting Women, he hinder'd them at leaſt from aſperſing and ſpeaking ill of them, and order'd matters ſo, as that they might not make them their main Employ, he made them obſerve how much the Kings Service was incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with theirs. He himſelf was the firſt to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what he taught, for tho' he was Extreme Civil, yet was he an Enemy to Galantry, ſo far as to ſay, that the moſt Beautious Woman did not merit a Worthy Man's loſing one Months time with her. Yet he was not ever of this Opinion, and <hi>Madame la Marechale de Humieres</hi> made him Change his Sentiment, as we ſhall ſhew in the Series of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Sueden</hi>'s Death, tho' it had not yet brought any great Detriment to the Affairs of his Party, gave hopes, however, of great alterations to thoſe who were in the Emperours Intereſts, and in this Confidence he dayly gain'd new Creatures. In effect, the Principal Leaders among the <hi>Suedes</hi> were divided among themſelves, each having his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar aim, as having no longer a brave and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous King to enforce their Obedience. Not that the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> wanted any of the Qualities that are wont to attract Reſpect and give Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but beſides his not being born their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, many found fault that he had been preferr'd to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> whoſe Quality of Elector ſeem'd to merit ſome Preference. This Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was exaſperated at it, and ſince that time it's believ'd if the Emperour had made him ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Propoſals, he wou'd heartily have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd all the Engagements he had to his Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57147:38"/>
Be it as it will, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being flatter'd with ſuch fair, alluring hopes, thought now of nothing but of breaking his late Treaty; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as he had reaſon to fear leaſt his Infidelity might make him loſe the propriety of his Eſtates, which the King had already in his Power, he made a Demiſſion of them in favour of his Brother, a Cardinal, and who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ald aſide the Purple to inveſt himſelf with that Imaginary Title of Duke. The King, to whom his moſt Private Deſigns were known, far from approving of his Demiſſion, ſhew'd himſelf very much incens'd againſt him, and as he only required a Pretext to ſeize on the reſt of his Dominions, conſiſting barely in the Fortreſſes <hi>de Bitche</hi> and <hi>de la Mothe,</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> had Order to beſiege them both. The Army ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into two, out of Obedience to the Kings Commands, and while one part block'd-up <hi>la Mothe,</hi> the other perform'd the Siege of <hi>Bitche,</hi> which after a vigorous Defence was conſtrain'd to Capitulate. This place having bin thus reduc'd to the Kings Obedience, the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> march'd againſt <hi>la Mothe,</hi> then inveſted by divers Regiments, and among others by that of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> All that Art and Nature can aſſemble for the ſtrength of a place was found in this, Rocks, proof againſt Undermining, inacceſſible ways, marvellous Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works; and above all this, a Garriſon, whoſe fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had been try'd in ſundry occaſions. This was a fair field for the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who deſir'd nothing more than difficult and perillous occaſions: but the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> not ſuffering him to expoſe himſelf as often as he required, order'd him to march only in his Rank, adding, there wou'd be buſineſs for 'em all. And indeed the Approaches were not made without extreme Difficulty and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57147:38"/>
the Canon was forc't to be rais'd in Battery by force of Arms, and when it came to opening the Trenches, they met with Rocks that evermore compell'd 'em to ceaſe their Labour, and begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in another place. Beſides the Beſeiged ſeeing themſelves upon an eminence, and our Troups as in a kind of Abyſs, diſdain'd firing, and only made uſe of Flints, that were of a hideous bigneſs, and which ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d from top to Bottom, and made our Men open from the Right and Left to give them room, for nor more nor leſs than a torrent they over-turn'd all they met with, and when by chance they came to hit againſt a Rock, 'twas with ſo terrible a noiſe, that a body wou'd have ſaid all was going to periſh. A certain Monck, call'd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtache,</hi> the Governours Brother, being in the Place, was one of thoſe that tumbl'd down moſt, whether he was excited to a Vigorous Defence by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Intereſt, or that he had this in common with Monks of being ever more paſſionate than others: but having loſt Courage by his Brother's Death, who was kill'd upon a Baſtion, his ardour cool'd, and perhaps thro' the fear of a like Deſtiny, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd from a thing that was ſo little ſuitable with his Character. At length the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> making uſe of this occaſion to attack the Out-works, the Regiment of <hi>Tonneins</hi> Commanded by his Son march'd againſt the Enemies; but having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd with a conſiderable loſs, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> took his ſtead, and carry'd a Baſtion after a vigorous Defence. Moſt of the Officers that had not yet ſeen him fight, had their eyes turn'd upon him to ſee after what manner he wou'd behave himſelf in that Action: But tho' they had Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Bravery, they were no leſs at gaze to ſee with what cold Blood and Stayedneſs his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57147:39"/>
was ponder'd and regulated in the heat of the fray, for he had been ſeen all cover'd with fire give his Orders juſt the ſame as if he had been in a Camp or at a Review. The Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> who had already paſs'd a very advantageous judgement of his Virtue, wrote to the King after the Reduction of the Place, that this Prince had not a little contributed thereunto by his Valour, and on this account did he receive Complements from the Court, as well as from all the Army, All having already amoſt peculiar eſteem for his Perſon. The taking of the Baſtion having haſten'd that of the Place, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had now nothing more remaining of the Dominions once in his poſſeſſion, nay and his Brother had likewiſe loſt his freedom, inſtead of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as they had both expected, by this feign'd Demiſſion whereof we have ſpoken afore. In the mean while, having found the means to deceive the vigilance of his Guards, and diſguiſing himſelf in a Gardiners Weed, he made his eſcape into <hi>Italy,</hi> where inſtead of the Purple he ought to carry thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he conducted the Princeſs <hi>Claude,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorraine's</hi> Siſter, whom he had Marry'd, and who became the Companion of his Exile, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, almoſt at the ſame time ſhe became his Wife.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Affairs had had an ill turn, the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who after <hi>Walleſteins</hi> Death had taken the Command of the Armies, not thinking it beſeeming his Rank and Reputation to remain without Performances, had Courted all Occaſions to Signalize himſelf, and out of the Deſire he had to give Battle, he deſir'd the Cardinal <hi>Infant,</hi> Governour of the Low Countreys upon the Death of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> to joyn with him, when requir'd ſo to do. Theſe Princes being of the ſame Houſe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57147:39"/>
and their Intereſts the ſame, after having promis'd mutually Succouring one another, march'd one againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the other againſt <hi>Straub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinguen,</hi> which he Seiz'd on without any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done by the Adverſe Party to put an Obſtacle to his Deſign. This Conqueſt having render'd the Attacking of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> an Enterprize more eaſy, the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> march'd his Army thither, but doubting that the <hi>Suedes</hi> wou'd puſh harder for it's Relief than they had done at <hi>Straub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinguen,</hi> he made havock of all the Territories on their Way, and haſten'd to Fortify his Camp. The Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> perceiving the loſs of <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> would prove a great Blow to his Party, laid aſide all ſorts of Affairs for that, and being come into view of the King of <hi>Hungarys,</hi> they fought ſome ſlight Skirmiſhes, which decided nothing in favour of either ſide. Being drove away by Famine, he fancy'd that by making ſome Diverſion, the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> would be conſtrain'd to follow him, ſo much the more, as that the Town was ſtill in a Poſture of making great Oppoſition. But the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> conſidering there to be but little Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Yeilding the Victory and Raiſing the Siege, let him take <hi>Landzutz,</hi> where <hi>Aldringher</hi> who Commanded another Body for the Emperour, was Kill'd, in Endeavouring to Succour the Place: But the thing not having ſped him better than the time afore, this Town fell into the hands of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and it's loſs was follow'd with that of <hi>Donavert,</hi> and with ſome other Places of leſs importance. The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> being fluſht to greater things by thoſe he had already atchiev'd, joyn'd then the Cardinal <hi>Infant,</hi> and they both march'd againſt the City of <hi>Nortlinghen;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> after his Example joyn'd <hi>Horn,</hi> a fam'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57147:40"/>
Captain, who had learnt his Trade under the Great <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> and reſolv'd to fight them before the Siege was entirely form'd, and that the thing was not become more difficult: But the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſo much the more preſſing his Attacks, that he knew the Succours ready to come, was allready become Maſter of part of the Outworks, and endeavour'd to carry the Reſt. When oblig'd to give ſome Reſpite to the Beſieg'd, to provide for his own Defence; And in effect, the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> without giving the leaſt breathing to his Troups tho' weary'd with Marching Night and Day, was allready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to attack him, having Experienc'd in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Encounters, that daring and Precipitate Actions have often a more happy Succeſs than thoſe that are undertaken with much warineſs. Be it as it will, the Beginning of his Enterprize cou'd not be more Propitious; he not only forc'd the Lines, but having alſo pierc'd thro' the Enemies Bataillons, he ſhot ſuch a Conſternation among thoſe that were on the Guard of the Out-works, that they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd a Half-Moon, which he Won with the Peril of their Life. But what fear robb'd 'em of, fear was not long without reſtoring them, for thoſe who had the head of all, inſtead of entring the City, having amuz'd themſelves, either thro' their own Imprudence, or thro' the fault of thoſe who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them, to throw themſelves into that Half-Moon, they unawares ſet fire to ſome Barrels of Powder, which the Enemy had left there, and imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be a Mine, they fell of themſelves into ſuch a Conſternation, that now they thought of nothing but of ſeeking their ſafety in their Heels. Nothing did it avail the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> to do in this Occaſion, what cou'd be Expected from a Brave Man, and a Great Captain, fear was ſtronger than
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57147:40"/>
his example and Remonſtrances, and having not been able to ſtop one man, no not ſo much as the Officers, he thought it high time and meant to joyn <hi>Horn</hi> who was of another ſide, and ſo make their Retreat: But the Enemy had Seiz'd on a Wood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Both, which finiſh'd putting Diſorder and Confuſion among his Souldiers. After this they had not any Appearance of Martializ'd men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keeping or Order, or Rank the Cavalry fled away upon the Spurr, leaving the Infantry to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Conquerour; about ten thouſand of them were kill'd, Six thouſand taken Priſoners, and they loſt all their Artillery. The Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> had all the difficulty imaginable to ſcape himſelf, but fortune reſerving him for better things, having made him avoid all the Ambuſcades with which he was way-laid, he had recourſe to <hi>France,</hi> that ſo he might be able to ſett on foot again what was remaining of his Party. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> whoſe Genius lay in knowing how to derive Profit from the very things, by which the World Expected he muſt have found his Ruine, had the Addreſſe to procure for himſelf the Town of <hi>Philipsbourg;</hi> and the <hi>Suedes</hi> were Cautious of refuſing it him, it having newly been abandon'd by the Electour of <hi>Saxony.</hi> In the mean while, the Cardinal caus'd the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> to march with his Army into <hi>Germany.</hi> At this Mareſchals approach, the Enemies, who had Beſieg'd <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> rais'd the Siege, but renew'd it ſuddainly after, with much greater forces. During theſe Tranſactions a Bridge of Boats was laid at <hi>Manheim,</hi> o're which the Army having paſs'd, left there the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to Guard it: but he thinking them going directly to an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, importun'd ſo the Mareſchal, that he Poſted another there in his ſtead. The Enemies had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57147:41"/>
the Siege of <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> as I have already ſaid, nay, and nothing now held out but the Caſtle. Thus thinking they cou'd make their Ground good in the City, they Expected the Army without, and the Mareſchal after having put Succours into the Caſtle, turn'd his Arms againſt the City. Thus the Beſiegers found themſelves Beſieg'd, but not having any hopes of being reliev'd, they made uſe of the Bridge which they had kept to make their Retreat. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> expos'd himſelf in ſuch manner to theſe two Attacks, that the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> publickly rebuk'd him for it; but the Marquis <hi>de la Force</hi> his Son, being a Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> took his part againſt his father, and maintain'd there to have been no raſhneſs in all he had done.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was ſtill at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fed him with fine hopes, but they had ſo much to do on all ſides, that this Duke being hurry'd-on by his humour, and the Counſels of <hi>Puilaurens</hi> his favourite, whom the Cardinal had Seduc'd by his wonted Artifices, reconcil'd himſelf with the King, as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded they were not in a condition to perform their Promiſes to him. <hi>Puilaurens</hi> induc'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not to communicate his Deſign to the Queen-Mother: Yet the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſuſpecting her neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of his evaſion, ſhe exaſperated things ſo againſt the Cardinal to regain their Confidence, that he never forgave her while he liv'd: And on this ſcore was it that ſhe was oblig'd ſome time after, being as abandon'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to go ſpend her Life at <hi>Cologne,</hi> where deſtitute of bare conveniences, ſhe finiſht her Life in an Inn, ſhewing by her Example to what Calamities Fortune ſometimes deſtines thoſe ſhe has moſt favour'd. However the King's harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her in Compliance to his Miniſter, furniſh'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57147:41"/>
matter for talk to many People, who cou'd not apprehend that a Prince ſhould forget Nature, for a man he did not love. For in truth the King did not love the Cardinal, and what he did for him moſt commonly was only out of a kind of fear. But leaving apart things ſo forreign to return to my Subject, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſorely ſpighted at the Duke of <hi>Orleans's</hi> departure, and having no more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in the heart of the Kingdom, bent all their thoughts towards the Frontiers, where they ſurpriz'd the Cities of <hi>Trier,</hi> and <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> the latter by means of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce, the former by the ill order kept in the Guard of the Town. This was a ſenſible loſs to <hi>France,</hi> that after having paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the Inteſtine Troubles, expected rather to archieve new Conqueſts than to loſe thoſe it had already made. And indeed ſhe had but juſt renew'd her Allyance with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and thought her ſelf in ſo good a Poſture, as that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> muſt ſink under the effort of her Arms, when they were once joyn'd to that of the States, ſo as that ſhe had already made the Diviſion of her Provinces. In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this Treaty the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> who had the Mareſchal <hi>de Brezé,</hi> the Cardinals Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giv'n him for his Companion, lead an Army of forty thouſand men towards <hi>Maſtricht.</hi> His E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage and Artillery were anſwerable to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Combatants, for the Cardinal being a great lover of Glory, as well for his Relations as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wou'd not ſuffer there ſhou'd be any thing wanting in an Army, wherein he had ſo near a Kinſman for a General. To authorize ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Arming, the War which had hitherto been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, as I may ſay, in hugger-mugger, was declar'd by a Herauld ſent on purpoſe to <hi>Bruxelles.</hi> The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text us'd for Declaring it, was the Detention of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57147:42"/>
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Trier,</hi> who had been ſeiz'd on in his Capital City, when it was ſurpriz'd, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conducted into <hi>Germany,</hi> where he received ſcurvy uſage. But the Reaſon was for their ſo often endeavouring to debauch the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and for their ſtill endeavouring by the means of the Queen-Mother to make him commit the like faults again. All kinds of efforts were us'd in <hi>France</hi> to bring ſtill other Armies on foot, capable of ſuſtaining ſo great a Deſign, and at one and the ſame time five were reckon'd in the Field, which being all aſſembled wou'd have made up near a Hundred and Fifty Thouſand men. The ſtrongeſt of all however was that ſent into <hi>Holland;</hi> It had directed it's way, as I have already ſaid, towards <hi>Maſtricht:</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being minded to hinder it's joyning the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ventur'd with leſs Forces to diſpute with it the Paſſage. Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> was at their Head, and they had giv'n him the Command of their Army, after they had wrought him to a Miſunderſtanding with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> his Brother, who lay under an obligation of being in the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> ſince that Crown was in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Cazal.</hi> The deſire of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had occaſion'd his heartily receiving their offers, for he ſaw the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſickly and a dying, and was willing to get a ſupport to buoy him up againſt <hi>France,</hi> that wou'd not fail, in caſe of Accident, to take the part of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Kings Siſter, and for whom ev'n before the Death of her Husband, the Regency, and the Guardianſhip of her Children was deſign'd. This Prince was Perſonally brave, and willing to allow ſomething to Chance, he Encamp'd near <hi>Avem,</hi> where the Mareſchals <hi>de Chatillon</hi> and <hi>de Brezè</hi> were bound to paſs. Theſe Mareſchals upon the Notice they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57147:42"/>
had of his Deſigns, Drew-up their Army in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Array, and approaching him there happen'd a ſharp Conflict. Prince <hi>Thomas's</hi> valour held the Victory for ſome time in Ballance, notwithſtanding the number; but having been at length oblig'd to to give way after a vigorous Reſiſtance, the <hi>French</hi> Army paſs'd on, and joyn'd the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> The two Armies being thus joyn'd together made up near Seaventy Thouſand men, and it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believ'd that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having no Troups to oppoſe them, they wou'd quickly have taken the Principal Towns of the Low-Countries: But the Diviſion ariſing among the Heads, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy between the two Nations, all theſe Conqueſts were circumſcrib'd to the taking of <hi>Tellemont</hi> and ſome Boroughs. Laying Siege afterward to <hi>Louvain,</hi> there chanc'd a Famine in the <hi>French</hi> Leaguer, ſo as to conſtrain 'em to raiſe the Siege. The Retreat was not difficult by reaſon of the feebleneſs of the Enemies: but the want of Bread continuing ſtill more and more, by means of the <hi>Hollander's</hi> Infidelity, they being very willing to ruine our Army, it was quickly reduc'd into ſo piteous an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate that it became a Subject of Contempt and Laughter for all thoſe that ſaw it. Theſe miſerable remains not daring to undertake to force five or ſix thouſand men that had poſſeſs'd a Paſſage upon the Frontiere, were oblig'd to go and embark in <hi>Holland,</hi> and being at length arrived in <hi>France,</hi> it ſo whetted the Cardinal's Reſentment, that without particular Conſiderations, his whole contrivance wou'd have been how to be reveng'd for this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> advantaging themſelves of this Miſunderſtanding made themſelves Maſter of <hi>Sckinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-ſchons,</hi> while the Imperialiſts on another ſide made divers Conqueſts on the <hi>Suedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57147:43"/>However it ſeem'd as if Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> with all the Illuminations of his mind, had choſen an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable time to declare War, for on whatever ſide a man took his Proſpect, he ſaw matters in ſo bad a Poſture, that evil Conſequences were to be apprehended. Nevertheleſs as the Cardinal had the Courage not to ſuffer himſelf to be dejected, he contriv'd the remedying ſpeedily theſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and principally in what concern'd the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who ſaw themſelves in a great exigency, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what they had ſeen themſelves in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; for they had already loſt the City of <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> with ſeveral others, and the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had laid Siege to <hi>Mayence,</hi> a place of ſo great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to them, that the greateſt part of their Conqueſts depended on it. For the affording them a ſpeedy Succour, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> ſent order to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> Governour of <hi>Metz</hi> and of <hi>Pais Meſſin,</hi> to aſſemble with the utmoſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the Forces in his Government, and having encreas'd them with ſome Garriſons of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> he made him Head of that Army, conſiſting of eighteen thouſand men. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being his Relation and particular friend, was in this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, rather thro' this Cardinals Choice than that of the Court, for he requir'd him with great Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, meaning to teſtify thereby the Eſteem and kindneſs he had for him. The Court wou'd in no wiſe refuſe him a Boon of ſuch ſmall moment, Him whom it choſe to the Prejudice of ſo many great Lords for ſo conſiderable an employment, and which ſeem'd ſo little to become him; for it was a thing that afforded matter of Diſcourſe to many People, to ſee a Cardinal at the head of an Army that was to act in favour of Proteſtants, with whom it was to joyn according as the junctures requir'd it,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57147:43"/>
and all whoſe motions were to be follow'd very often to the prejudice of <hi>Catholiques.</hi> But this was a kind of Recompence for the Services <hi>Valette</hi> had render'd Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> whoſe Intereſts he had been ſeen to eſpouſe, in oppoſition to his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Family. This Army being aſſembled, march'd to the Succours of <hi>Mayence,</hi> then beſieg'd as I have ſaid afore, and having taken <hi>Binghen</hi> on it's way, it paſs'd the <hi>Rhine</hi> on a Bridge of Boats, which Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> had caus'd to be made. Upon the Tydings the Enemies had of his March, they made havock, whereever we were to paſs, but they no ſooner knew he had croſs'd the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but that they forthwith rais'd the Siege. The Army, in the mean while, being already much diſtreſs'd for want of Victuals, ſaw it ſelf ſtill in a greater neceſſity, for Proviſions it muſt put into <hi>Mayence</hi> that wanted them extreamly; this render'd Bread ſo ſcarce that a Pound was worth a Crown. In ſo great a Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſhew'd himſelf ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral towards the Souldiers, that after having giv'n all he had, he was forc'd to ſell his own Plate to ſupply his neceſſities. So Generous an Action coming to the knowledge of all the Army, and perceiving every particular Complemented him on this Account, he ſpread abroad a Rumour he had loſt his Mony at Play, and for this reaſon had been conſtrain'd to ſell his Plate: But the truth being ſuddenly known again by All, this ſtill the more augmented his Reputation, and the Amity every Individual had for him. The Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> joyn'd Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> but inſtead of this being of uſe to him, the Army being become the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, had ſo much the more Difficulty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. In the mean while the Enemies fancying they ſhou'd have eaſy work upon the People allready
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57147:44"/>
half Vanquiſh'd by Famine, came to attack the Bridge of <hi>Binghen</hi> which had been brought from <hi>Mayence,</hi> and after having thunder'd it with Canon, a keen Conflict was maintain'd between the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being retrench'd at the Head of the Bridge, after having repuls'd the Enemies in divers Aſſaults, ſeeing his men bent upon leaving their Retrenchments to puſh them, hinder'd them from ſo doing, and was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his Prudence; for there needed no more than the leaſt falſe ſtep and diſgrace to ruine the whole Army, and in the general Dejection, they were more diſpos'd for flight, than to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a Good Action. The Enemies having made ſome tentatives more but to no purpoſe, went and Beſieg'd <hi>Sarbrik</hi> ſo to cut off the Victuals that came from <hi>Metz</hi> a croſs a thouſand Difficulties; and this Siege not allowing the ſtaying any longer in a Country, where they already dy'd of hunger, their thoughts were wholly ſet upon a Retreat. Yet this was the Difficulty, for beſides it's being long and the Country Deſert, <hi>Galas</hi> was upon the Wing with an Army, that far from ſuffering any miſery had all things in abundance. But there being no other Courſe to take, they begun their March in the Dusk of the Evening, and having dodg'd <hi>Galas</hi> by a falſe March, he cou'd not overtake the Arriere-Guard until the Paſſage of the River <hi>Loutre,</hi> where it was ſomething worſted in a Skirmiſh. Having paſs'd that River almoſt as ſoon as we, tho' we had broken down the Bridges we had made with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diligence, he continu'd his Purſuit, ſo that the Army having again been conſtrain'd to make head at <hi>Waudrevanghes,</hi> it came to a hard Combat, but wherein the Horſe ſuffer'd morethan the foot; for while the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſuſtain'd the brunt of the Enemies on-ſet, the later
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57147:44"/>
paſs'd the <hi>Sarre,</hi> and Retreated to <hi>Metz.</hi> During ſo perillous a Retreat the famine dayly augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Souldiers were ſeen to ſtray at a diſtance from the Armies like deſperate wretches, without either minding Order or the worſt that cou'd happen. Thoſe who had Bread, durſt not Eat it in their Preſence leaſt they ſhou'd fall upon it, and if retain'd by Reſpect they devour'd it with their Eyes, and only render'd their famine thereby the more inſupportable. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one day invited ſome Officers to a halt, was all of a ſuddain ſurrounded with ſeverall Souldiers of Sundry Regiments, and not being able to ſee them without being toucht with Compaſſion, he diſtributed to one after another all that he had, Inſomuch that only he and thoſe he had invited of 'em all that had nothing, or at leaſt who had ſo ſmall a Matter, that it was not capable of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying them: He did alſo an Action in that March which acquir'd him the Love of the Souldiers, for having found one of them in a Corner of a Hedge, whom a Feavor and Miſery hinder'd, from being able to march with the Reſt, he alighted his Horſe, made the Souldier mount him, and having held him on 'till he had got to one of his Wagons, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Servants to take ſuch Care of him as that he might have a good Account of him. As nothing ſpreads faſter or is ſooner divulg'd among Troups, than the kindneſs and Civility of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and Eſpecially of the Principal Officers, the Army was quickly full of the Rumour of his fame; and for this Account, a Souldier who had Money gave his Captain Twenty Gold <hi>Lewiſſes</hi> to ſuffer him to go liſt himſelf under the Viſcount. This fellow who had ſerv'd a long while, and had a ſightly Preſence, preſenting himſelf to him, and being
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57147:45"/>
ask't how much he requir'd, Extremely Surpriz'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> when after he had told him he would have no Money, he on the contrary had giv'n a Sum to capacitate him to come into his Regiment. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> took inſtantly out his Purſe, and reſtoring him his Twenty Gold <hi>Lewiſſes,</hi> gave him alſo Twenty more, with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of remembring in time, and place the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he bore him. And indeed having found him upon Occaſion to be a very Brave Man, he advanc'd him in his Regiment, and wou'd ſtill have done more for him, if this Souldier had not been kill'd five or ſix years after.</p>
            <p>The Diſorder Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> was in, was not the only Misfortune we lay under. Beſides that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> by having ill taken his Meaſures, or according as ſome have believ'd by having been too Self-Interreſs'd, had rais'd the Siege of <hi>Dole,</hi> after having loſt a Part of his Army, <hi>Galas</hi> was enter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where he laid All in Fire and Blood. All went ſo ill upon the Frontier of <hi>Picardy,</hi> that the <hi>Pariſians</hi> fancy'd the Enemies to be already at their Gates, for after having taken <hi>la Capelle</hi> and <hi>le Catelet,</hi> not without ſome ſuſpicion that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours might have made a better Defence, if they had minded, they beſieg'd <hi>Corbie,</hi> in the heart of that Province, and from whence they might make inroads to the Metropolis of the Kingdom. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Succeſs of this Enterprize was known, they haſten'd to break down the Bridges on the River <hi>d'Oize,</hi> the only River that cou'd obſtruct their coming to <hi>Paris:</hi> But the Conſternation, before very great, was now augmented, when the <hi>Pariſians</hi> heard that this Place was fall'n into their hands, and that they were likewiſe become Maſters of the City of <hi>Roye.</hi> To remedy ſuch Cogent Diſorders the Ban
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57147:45"/>
and Arrieban was Conven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, and to appeaſe the Diſcontents of the Princes of the Blood, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd they were had in no Account, the Forces of the Kingdom were put into their hands. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> with an Army full of the Nobles, recover'd <hi>Roye</hi> and march'd againſt <hi>Corbie:</hi> but Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> being jealous of the honour he was going to gain by this Conqueſt, caus'd the King to remove thither, who accompliſht it's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. The Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> was not ſo happy in his Enterprizes, but nevertheleſs was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſerve uſefully; for after having been a little worſted near <hi>de la Fere,</hi> he prevented the Enemies that meant to beſiege `<hi>Doullens;</hi> Inſomuch that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put ſuccours, into that Place, he retired without doing any thing further. None but <hi>Galas</hi> now gave any trouble, he lay Encamp'd near <hi>Fontaines Francoiſe,</hi> from whence his Parties made remote Excurſions. <hi>Dijon</hi> with ſome Other Cities of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> had already contributed, and not one of 'em was there in a Condition to Suſtain a Siege; but good luck would have it that he having turn'd his Arms againſt <hi>St. Jean de Laone, Rantzan</hi> got into the Town, and his Valour affording Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> leiſure to aſſemble Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, he march'd againſt him with Deſign to give him Battle. <hi>Galas,</hi> having contrary Orders, rais'd the Siege without ſtaying his coming, Inſomuch that all this great Storm, which ſeem'd to threaten us with utter Deſtruction, was reduc'd to the loſs of ſome Cattle the Enemies had taken out of the open Field. True it is that they had ſtill a foot left in the Kingdom by the means of the Iſles <hi>Sainte Honorat</hi> and <hi>Sainte Marguerite,</hi> Surrendred to them by the Cowardize of the Governours; but being ſeparated from the reſt of <hi>France,</hi> and eaſy to be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57147:46"/>
remedy'd, no Diſquiet was entertain'd on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and bating the Charges neceſſary for their Recovery, they were not of Concern. And in effect the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> being enjoyn'd with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, accompliſht it with as little trouble as was expected, but with a little more Danger, for he found the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Shipt an Army to diſpute him his Paſſage, and he ſaw himſelf oblig'd to fight it, or to avoid ſo doing by taking a long Circuit. The ſucceſs having been favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, the reſt of the Expedition was alſo ſo. Inſomuch that he render'd the Realm Serene again, that had been in Danger by ſo many Unhappy Occaſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe troubles having been thus appeas'd, the King in his turn carry'd the War into different Provinces of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and was fortunate in certain places, and unfortunate in others. In the mean while the Services done him by the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> with the things ſaid to his Advantage, and which he himſelf acknowledg'd, obliging him to diſtinguiſh him, he made him a Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> and was not deceiv'd in this his Choice. The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> having this young Prince in his Army, ſetting forward for <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to make a Diverſion in favour of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> whoſe Affairs, far from being flouriſhing, were in a bad Poſture, beſieg'd <hi>Saverne</hi> in conjunction with the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> while the Imperialiſts attack'd <hi>Coblentz</hi> and <hi>Hermeſtein. Saverne</hi> was not ſo ſtrong a place, but there was a good Garriſon in it, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the taking of it the more Difficult. In the mean while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oblig'd to do more than ordinary to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy of the employment the King had giv'n him, expos'd himſelf extraordinarily in ſundry Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57147:46"/>
wherein we were ever repuls'd. At length he found the means to ſeize on the Upper Town, which cut off the Communication of the Lower Town with the Caſtle. Afterwards they rais'd their Attacks on the ſide of the Lower Town, which the Enemies ſtill defended with ſo much Valour, that before they cou'd be brought to Yield, they kill'd ſeveral Officers of note, nay and wounded the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> As his wound was but ſlight, he did not withdraw out of the Fight 'till the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were compell'd to demand Quarter, nay and wou'd needs render an Account to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of all that occurr'd in that occaſion afore he'd ſeek after Remedy. But as he fancy'd, either he might be accus'd of Oſtentation, or that they wou'd not give him a hearing if they perceiv'd his Wound, he wrapt his Arm up in his Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and as long as his Relation laſted, he knew ſo well how to keep all conceal'd, that they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing of the matter. Thus when the Generals were afterwards inform'd of his being wounded, they inquir'd how that came about, imagining it to have been ſince they had ſeen him. The Caſtle of <hi>Saverne</hi> ſurrendred quickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Two Towns, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> wound did not hinder him from being preſent in all occaſions where requir'd by the Duty of his Charge. However he was not abſolutely Cur'd when he laid aſide the ſcarf he had put on to ſuſtain his Arm, for he did not approve of the procedure of of thoſe, who to accquaint others they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Wound in a certain occaſion, make Parade, or of a Scarf or of a Plaiſter a long while after they are no longer needfull, as if ſuch contingencies render'd 'em the more worthy of Eſteem. He ſaid to this purpoſe, that a Coward was wounded as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57147:47"/>
ſoon as a Brave man; that thus it was a miſtake to think to derive a Vanity from a thing which was as common to thoſe that wanted heart as to thoſe that had Courage. Tho' his Wound was not conſiderable, as I have already ſaid, the whole Army not only expreſs'd their Concern for this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but alſo all the great perſonages in <hi>France,</hi> from whom he receiv'd Letters: But willing to undeceive them, he writ himſelf his Anſwers to them, thinking there to be no better means to let them ſee that the miſchance was not ſo bad as they might perhaps imagine. Some of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants having nevertheleſs told him it wou'd be for his Advantage not to undeceive ſo ſoon the Court, from whence he might hope for the more favours, he anſwer'd him, that he was not of a humour to deceive any body, and much leſs the King than any other.</p>
            <p>About this time, or a little afore, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> not being able to calm the Spleen he bore the Cardinal, was retir'd to <hi>Blois,</hi> and wanted not a Pretext to Palliate his Retreat. The Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> being puſht on with the ſame Spirit was likewiſe gone to <hi>Sedan,</hi> which made the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> fear that this might excite troubles in the Realm and in his Houſe, for <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon</hi> his Brother muſt neceſſarily have giv'n his Conſent to the Count of <hi>Soiſſon's</hi> fault; and as he did not doubt but that the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> wou'd be very glad to augment the Frontier with ſo fine a Place as <hi>Sedan,</hi> he lay under ſome apprehenſion the Cardinal wou'd lay hold on this occaſion to diveſt his Family of it. And indeed it is to be preſum'd, that this was ſufficiently this Miniſters Deſign. But as the Kingdom had been, as I may ſay, within two inches of it's Ruine, he was afraid leaſt that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57147:47"/>
as he was the Author of the War, he might be render'd reſponſible for the bad events that might happen, if after having introduc'd a Forreign he alſo introduc'd a Civil War. Wherefore this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration inclin'd him to handle things mildly, and having found the means to ſweeten the Duke of <hi>Orlean's</hi> Diſcontent, by making him hope the King wou'd conſent to his Marriage, only the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> had he now with whom to treat, but whoſe humour was more difficult to manage. This Prince, as all know, was only the laſt Prince of the Blood, but as he had Pretenſions to become the firſt, for he had had Proceſs againſt the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> hoping to cauſe him to be declar'd a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, by reaſon he came into the world, thirteen Months after his Father's Death, he carry'd it ſo high that many people thought him to be proud. However the ſource of his Diſcontent proceeded from his imagining his not having Juſtice done him; and tho' he had loſt his proceſs by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Parliament, that had judg'd in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a Reſult of Phyſicians; that the Princeſs of <hi>Condé's</hi> grief for her Husbands Death, might have retarded her Fruit, he treated this as a Trifle, and made Annually Proteſtations againſt this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> knowing that this Affair lay deep in his Heart, had a Propoſal made to him by <hi>Senneterre,</hi> the Intendant of his family, that if he wou'd Marry <hi>Madam de Combalet</hi> his Niece, he wou'd ſerve him with all his Credit: but this Prince refuſing to exalt himſelf by a baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this nature (for this Lady was ſaid to be one of the Cardinals comfortable Importances) was fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly angry with <hi>Senneterre</hi> for having taken upon him this Commiſſion, and having ratled him with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere language, nay, and as they ſay cuff'd him too,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57147:48"/>
he wou'd not ſee him any more. This ill uſage wrought his Fortune, for the Cardinal thinking himſelf oblig'd to take care of him, conferr'd on him Benefits, and procur'd him Honours which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he durſt not have hoped for. In ſine, his Son has puſht things ſtill further, and dy'd Duke, and Peer, and Mareſchal of <hi>France;</hi> So true is it that when Fortune once begins to look on us with a good eye, She's not weary afterwards of Conferring on us Favours. The Cardinal's Arrogance incens'd him, at the manner of the Count <hi>de Soiſſon's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Offers, but being retain'd by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations above-mention'd, he diſſembl'd his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and conſented he ſhould ſtay at <hi>Sedan,</hi> where to divert him from the thoughts he might have of embroiling the State, he engag'd him in ſome little Amours by the means of ſome of his Domeſticks that were his Penſioners. Being aſſur'd on that ſide, his thoughts ſoar'd only now at wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging War againſt Forreigners. For that purpoſe he deſir'd the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> to take a turn to <hi>Paris,</hi> that he might conferr with him; and they took together Meaſures for the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> yet without forgetting thoſe of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to make his greateſt efforts. The Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> being return'd ſatisfy'd with the Reception made him by the King and his Miniſter, aſſembled his Army, while that a part of our Troups, that had ſerv'd in <hi>Germany</hi> the year afore had orders to file upon the Frontier of <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> who had been alarm'd at the Count <hi>de Soiſſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Affair, and had an inconceiveable joy to ſee it had no ſequel, having been appointed to ſerve in thoſe Troups, went thither with the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who had the Command of them, but to whom they had giv'n the Duke of <hi>Candalle</hi> his Brother to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57147:48"/>
jointly with him. Beſides this, two Other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were there, One under the Conduct of the Marquis <hi>de la Meillaraye,</hi> Great Maſter of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, Cardinal <hi>Richelieus</hi> Nephew, the Other under the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon.</hi> This, to hinder the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of the <hi>Germains,</hi> advanc'd into <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> where it took <hi>Danvillers;</hi> the Other march'd on the Sea ſide, and pretended thro' ſome Correſpondence to make ſure of St. <hi>Omer,</hi> but the Traytors ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fail'd in their Word, it was not ſtrong enough to attack a Place of that Conſequence, and whoſe bare Approches were capable of making it receive ſome Affront; for this City is invironed with an Infinite Number of Forts that Defend it, and are not Eaſy to be Won. In the mean while, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Valette</hi> was entred <hi>Flanders</hi> at the Head of an Army of Eighteen Thouſand Men; and had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd <hi>Chateau-Cambreſis.</hi> Having taken it, he caus'd his Troups to march againſt <hi>Landrecies,</hi> a Small Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſtrong thro' it's Scituation and it's Out-works, ſo that not daring to undertake this Conqueſt with ſuch a Handfull of Men, he reſted Satisfy'd with inveſting it till ſuch time as he was joyn'd by <hi>Meilleraye.</hi> This Place was likewiſe Secur'd with a Good Garriſon, but put its Principal Confidence in the Succours it Expected from <hi>Germany,</hi> and to be brought it by <hi>Picolomini.</hi> As what was a Subject of hope for the Beſieged, was a Subject of fear for the Beſiegers, they haſten'd the Works and the Attacks, that ſo the Succours might not arrive in time. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> in whom the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> had a moſt peculiar Confidence, did not ſtir out of the Trench, ſave only to go give him an Account of Occurrences. But the Continual Rains hinder'd things from advancing as they deſired, beſides the frequent Sallies of the Beſieged incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57147:49"/>
the Labourers, and Occaſion'd ſometimes diſorder. Colonel <hi>Gaſſion,</hi> whoſe Reputation was already very Great in the Troups, having been wounded in the Neck in one of thoſe Sallies, ſeem'd to Paul the Souldiers Courage, who conſider'd him as a Man capable in caſe of a Battle to make the Victory turn on their ſide: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> did with Mildneſs remonſtrate to them their Duty, and inſenſibly put them again in the Right Way; He was in the Water with them up to the very Middle, and to animate them by his Example he was the firſt to labour, and the laſt to finiſh the labour; he told them that the Rain wou'd not laſt always, but that in the mean while they were not to loſe time, becauſe that the Enemies who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready but too much pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t up with preſumption, wou'd conceive at it the more Audatiouſneſs. At length, the Rains ceaſing, and the Works being advanc'd as much as the foul Wether wou'd allow of, the Place was Won, after the Governour had done all in his Power for a Brave Defence. From <hi>Landrecis</hi> Part of the Army march'd to <hi>Maubeuge</hi> under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Candalle,</hi> who had under him the Viſcount <hi>De Turenne.</hi> This Place having made a ſhew of Reſiſting, was quickly reduc'd by force, as well as that of <hi>Beaumont</hi> belonging to the Princes of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may.</hi> In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Candalle</hi> ſent the Viſcount <hi>De Turenne</hi> againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Sobre,</hi> Whoſe ſituation was advantageous, and where above Eight hundred Peaſants had taken refuge with their Goods. Theſe being inured to fire by the long Wars they had in their Country, March'd out againſt him, and he ſlighted at firſt this Occaſion as Unworthy of his Courage: But having obſerv'd their Countenance, and that they had Poſſeſs'd the Hedges from whence they fir'd briskly, he retain'd his Souldiers who wou'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57147:49"/>
have fall'n upon 'em without order, as People that did not deſerve the uſing ſo much Caution.

The Viſcount de <hi>Turenne</hi> had been an Intimate friend of Count <hi>de Buſſy Lamet,</hi> and was ſo ſenſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at his Death, as to render him almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all Conſolation. And indeed he was a man of extraordinary merit, and had but one ſtep to make to the being Mareſchal. But a Sudden Death having raviſh'd him from his Family and his Friends, he miſs'd that Honour, the greateſt a Gentleman can attain.</p>
            <p>While Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> was performing the things I have now mention'd, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with whom the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> was come to a Right Underſtanding, had Beſieg'd the City of <hi>Breda,</hi> and was ſtimulated to that Conqueſt by more then one Reaſon. For beſides the Glory that muſt thence redound to him, he fought for his own Patrimony. Yet as <hi>Spinola's</hi> ſtaying a long while before that Place, minded him that nothing was to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, he Fortify'd his Camp and Skreen'd it from Inſult. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo prepar'd to go Fight him; but fearing a Deſcent upon the Coaſts, by reaſon of ſome Ships that had appear'd at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> they loſt time, and when they came in view of the Enemy, they found him ſo well intrench'd that they durſt not proceed to an Engagement. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> making uſe of his Advantage preſs'd the Town, and his Conduct being no leſs than his Courage, he took it in Two Months time, whereas it's Conqueſt had coſt <hi>Spinola</hi> Nine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> expected Comfort for theſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Succeſſes in the taking of <hi>Leucate,</hi> which they thought near at hand.

This happy Succeſs procur'd him the <hi>Baton</hi> of Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal of <hi>France,</hi> and ſince was he call'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> by his Father's Name.</p>
            <p>All theſe Advantages were capable of giving much joy to the Court, if the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> had been as Succeſsfull in his Enterprizes, and if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe had not giv'n ſome Subject of Diſcontent: But the Duke <hi>de Rohan,</hi> who had made his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with the King, and had dexterouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeiz'd upon the <hi>Valteline,</hi> was newly drove thence by force; Inſomuch that all the Pretenſions that had been conceiv'd to the Land of <hi>Milan,</hi> vaniſh'd into Smoke. The Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> on his ſide having undertaken to Succour <hi>Hanaw,</hi> beſieg'd by the Imperialiſts, had been routed, and put to flight. As fortune was thus ballanc'd on Both ſides, the Pope fancy'd the Two Crowns would liſten the more willingly to a Peace, and he endeavour'd to mediate it by the Interpoſition of his <hi>Nuncio's.</hi> But he had to overcome the hatred of the two Miniſters, who out of the Averſion they bore one another, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their heads little as to the Miſchiefs vvith which they were preparing to moleſt all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57147:51"/>
Theſe two Men did all in the two Kingdoms, and the two Kings were only two Phantaſmes to amuſe the People with the Grandeur of their Names; The One, was introduc'd into the Miniſtry in Spight of his Maſter, and in ſpight of him maintain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that Station; the Other had been call'd to it by the Princes Inclination, after the Duke of <hi>Lerma's</hi> Diſgrace, a Man ſo hated as to have had his own very Son for his Enemy. They had both the Glory of their Countrey, in Recommendation, or rather, they only ſought to raiſe it upon the Ruines of each Other, for their Animoſity was the ſource of moſt of their Great Deſigns. Not but that the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> was a great man, but he gave himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to Revenge, ſo as to ruine one of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he would not have much Boggl'd to ruine all the People. Now he remembred it to be in the View of procuring his Deſtruction, that Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> vulgarly call'd <hi>Conde-Duke</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Spain,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſo often to Rebell, and contriv'd ſo many Caballs, and his Deſign was now to be reveng'd for theſe Tranſactions.

He wou'd not own <hi>Ferdinand's</hi> Son for King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and grounded his Oppoſition upon the Electour of <hi>Treves,</hi> having proteſted againſt his Election. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe time of the Occurrences, this Cavil oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd ſtill more Obſtacles, for then the thing in Agitation was no longer a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but an Emperour, whoſe Quality was diſputed. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> on it's ſide did not want Pretexts to cover the jealouſy it had againſt the Houſe of <hi>France,</hi> ſo as that all the Good Offices of the Pope, were without Effect. Thus the War that had allready made ſuch Waſte, and Havocks, Spread ſtill with more fury. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> induc'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57147:51"/>
Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> to return into <hi>Italy,</hi> that ſo his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might the more powerfully Excite his Creatures, and he fram'd in a little time ſo Dangerous a Party, that with the Succours of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he reduc'd the Dutches of <hi>Savoy</hi> to Extremity. This Princeſs was not as yet, very handy in the Government of her Dominions, ſhe juſt came from under the Check of a Husband, who never having had any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Us, had not giv'n her any Share in Affairs, imagining that being as ſhe was a <hi>French-woman,</hi> ſhe wou'd ever have much inclination for her Countrey. However he had been oblig'd for Reaſons I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deduc'd, to declare himſelf for us; but tho' he had joyn'd his Arms to Ours, his Captains had ſtill ſome Secret order rather to Spinn out in Length than to finiſh the War. Now the Dutches of <hi>Savoy</hi> having follow'd at firſt this Policy, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> was very willing to ſuffer her by little and little to be undermin'd, that to be freed out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe might blindly follow his Will; for this Reaſon inſtead of ſending her a Succour ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſcreening her, he caus'd at firſt only to paſs into that Countrey ſome troups of New Leavyes, that quickly for want of Diſcipline were totally diſpers'd. In the mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking advantage of the Conjuncture, reſolv'd to drive us out of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> where we had made ſome Conqueſts; but the Beginnings were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to them, that they were beaten in two Incounters, at the laſt of which <hi>Martin d'Arragon</hi> who commanded them had much ado to Eſcape. Yet as it was only a detatchment of the Army, they had quickly repaired this loſs, and thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Poſture to take their Revenge, they laid ſiege to <hi>Breme,</hi> wherein a Gentleman of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> call'd <hi>Montgaillard,</hi> commanded. The <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:57147:52"/>
had no ſooner been inform'd of what occurr'd, but that forgetting their Policy, they preſs'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> to give ſuccours, for ſo blear'd were they not, but that they foreſaw how after the taking of <hi>Breme,</hi> the <hi>Spainards</hi> would turn their Arms againct them. The Common Peril ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus reunited Peoples Minds, they joyn'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> notwithſtanding the Averſion they boar him, for they ſuſpected him of having poyſon'd their late Duke in an Entertainment, and what the more corroborated their Suſpicion, is, that moſt the Gueſts dy'd of ſome days after, or had like to have dy'd. Be it as it will, this having not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the Conjunction of the two Armies, they march'd to the Succour's of <hi>Breme,</hi> wherein they Endeavour'd to Enter ſome Men by the Po. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number of Barkes were ſitted out for this purpoſe, on Board of which they Shipt ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry with Ingeniers for whom they had Occaſion in the Place. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſſeſſing the Bancks of the River, and having provided them with Cannon, fir'd ſo furiouſly, that after having kill'd ſome Men, and ſunk two Barkes, the Reſt choſe to return. This Unfortunate Succeſs Startled the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> but not in ſuch manner as to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Enterprize.</p>
            <p>However having no other means, ſave to attack the Lines, Needs would he view 'em firſt of all; but as he advanc'd to that purpoſe, came a Cannon ſhot that kill'd him ſtone Dead, and Caſt a Great Conſternation into his Party. The Rumour of his Death being quickly Spread among the Enemies, they forthwith ſignify'd it to the Governour as a means to terrify him into a Surrender; but he did not ſeem ſo ſtartled, but that he Defended the Place ſome time longer with great Courage. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57147:52"/>
having yeilded ſooner than he ought, he was beheaded at <hi>Cazal,</hi> whither he had Permiſſion to retreat with his Garriſon.</p>
            <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi's</hi> Death occaſion'd much Diſorder in our Army, as well as in the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and before the Court could give New Orders, the whole Army disbanded for want of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Pay. In the mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after having ſetled their New Conqueſt, caus'd their Troupes to march, without our being able to gueſs at their Deſign, for <hi>Leganes</hi> who commanded them, had dayly Proteſtations made to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that the King his Maſter Deſign'd no Warr with her, and, that provided ſhe departed from that ſecret Intelligence ſhe was ſuſpected of with the <hi>French,</hi> ſhe might enjoy in Quiet her Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and the Guardianſhip of her Children. Theſe Aſſurances were Charming to a Woman little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in Affairs of Warr, and whoſe misfortune was to have her Country Scituated 'twixt the States of two Princes, who pretended both to give the Law: But finally ſhe in a ſhort time perceiv'd all theſe fine Words were only to amuſe her, for <hi>Leganes</hi> to the Prejudice of all his Promiſes approach'd <hi>Verceil,</hi> after having Sack'd all the places in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. As there had been much imprudence in her to liſten after this to any of his Propoſitions, She had recourſe to the King her Brother, of whom ſhe Earneſtly requeſted a Succour conformable to the Exigency of the preſent poſture of her Condition: But the concerns of Blood being a ſmall matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Princes in Compariſon of their Intereſt, they ty'd and hamper'd her ſo to purpoſe, that ſhe had now nothing left but the Name of Sovereign; under Colour of Preſerving <hi>Piemont</hi> for her, we Garriſon'd it's ſtrongeſt places, and from which the Capital
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57147:53"/>
only was exempt; but as all the reſt was nothing without our getting this into our Clutches, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſtruſts were injected into this Princeſs's mind, that dayly imagining her ſelf upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeiz'd, ſhe of her own accord was the firſt to demand, we wou'd introduce Troups into the Town. Yet it was to be fear'd the Inhabitants would ſhut up the Gates, if they had the hint of this Deſign. This made it thought convenient to manage the thing ſo Dextrouſly as that it cou'd not miſs. For this purpoſe Troups were order'd to draw up hard by under the pretence of a Review, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Perſons being gone out for ſight-ſake, it was eaſy to ſeize on the Town, by keeping in their hands thoſe who might make Reſiſtance. Every one was not content with this proceeding, and many now favour'd Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> that without this wou'd not have thought of him.</p>
            <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> having thus thrown her ſelf into the King her Brother's Arms, it was now his part to eſpouſe her Intereſts, being hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward become his own. In the mean while the great Affairs he had on all ſides hindering him from doing all he willingly wou'd, he cou'd only ſend her Eighteen Thouſand men under the Conduct of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de la Valette.</hi> And indeed we were very much perplex'd in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where we had with not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch conſideration under taken the Siege of St <hi>Omar</hi> under the Beard of a Powerful Army. But the Grudging we had to that Place, making us paſs over all things, Proviſion was made of Men and Mony. Yet cou'd we not hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from putting Succours into the Place, and this Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune having befall'n us twice, this ſo chill'd our Souldiers Courage, and fluſh'd that of our Enemies, that as much as ours dreaded fighting, ſo much
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57147:53"/>
theirs deſir'd it. The two Armies coming to Blows with Diſpoſitions ſo little favourable to Us, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was adverſe to Us. They forc'd our Lines, beat a Quarter, and at length having put a new Succours into the Town, they Compell'd us to raiſe the Siege. This Diſgrace was rewarded by taking <hi>du Catelet;</hi> but as it was a poor pittance in Compariſon of what we had miſs'd of taking, it prov'd no great Subject of Conſolation; add to this that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was oblig'd to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> where ſtrange things occurr'd. For this Prince deſigning to reinforce the Quarter, by which he knew the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were to come, thoſe that were there already took up Arms againſt thoſe that came to their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and thus ſo well-favour'd the Enemies Deſign, that they entred the Town without ſtriking a blow. It was neceſſary to look out in the mean time to what wou'd happen in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the War was wag'd with no leſs intent and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Certainly tho' we came by the Lee in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> Fortune made us a great Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in <hi>Alſace,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> did Wonders. This Prince having been beaten, as I have ſaid, the Year afore, in endeavouring to relieve <hi>Hanau,</hi> and undergone other more Diſgraces; for having pretended to retaliate upon <hi>Bezanſon</hi> where he had ſome Correſpondence, he had miſs'd his Aim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Place being well Garriſon'd made a brave De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and gave the Duke <hi>de Savilly</hi> and <hi>Jean de Wert</hi> time to run in to it's Succours. The Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> having with him the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and holding himſelf ſecur'd by the Preſence of ſo great a Captain,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57147:54"/>
did not ſtick to accept the Battaile, offer'd him by the Enemy; But fortune to make him the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Advantages ſhe was preparing him in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell, turn'd her back upon him ſtill, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> fighting with the ſame Courage he had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fought, receiv'd a Wound of which he dy'd in a few days after. He was doubtleſs a great man and had all the Parts of an Excellent Captain, but wou'd have ſeem'd much greater, if he had been in a State where the Prince had been of his Religion, or He of the Religion of his Prince; for this occaſion'd the Conferring on him only difficult Commands, and wherein was deſign'd rather this Ruin than his Fame. He liv'd with the Amity of the People of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Religion, to whom he render'd great ſervices, as well as the Duke of <hi>Soubize</hi> his Brother, but only carry'd along their Eſteem at his Death, being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of having abandon'd them for his Intereſts.</p>
            <p>After the loſs of this Battaile, the Enemys mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make advantage of their Victory, purſu'd <hi>Weymar</hi> who was retir'd towards <hi>Offembourg,</hi> and reduc'd him to the neceſſity of fighting a new Battail, or of ruining his Army by a new flight; the one ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more glorious than the Other, he recall'd the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of his men who ſeem'd ſtun'd, and having let 'em know the neceſſity there was of Conquering or of Dying, they unanimouſly demanded an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Enemy: He was too knowing to ſuffer their Courage to Cool, and having taken them at their word, at the very ſame moment, he began the Charge himſelf, and was the firſt that broak in up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Enemy. The Conflict was Sharp, and obſtinately fought on Both ſides, but <hi>Weymer</hi> performing Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with his Arms as well as with his Head, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd his men in ſuch manner that all the Reſiſtance the others cou'd make prov'd in vain.

               <hi>Savelly,</hi> after having ſeveral times been <hi>helter-ſkelter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Suedes,</hi> was forc'd to be take himſelf to flight, abandoning <hi>Jean de Wert</hi> who maintain'd his Ground ſtill a while; but ſeeing himſelf ſurrounded on all ſides, he layd down his Arms to ſave his Life. <hi>Weymar</hi> having repaired by ſo great victory the misfortunes that had befall'n him, return'd before <hi>Rhinfeld</hi> which Submitted to his Obedience; from thence after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reduc'd the Principall Citys of <hi>Alſace,</hi> he laid Siege to <hi>Briſac,</hi> which was as the Maſter-piece and Coronation of ſo many Great Actions. The Enemies rais'd ſeveral Armies and fought ſeveral Battails for the Relief of a Place ſo ſtrong and of ſuch great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: But <hi>Weymer</hi> receiving all Requiſits in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance from Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> ſo Efficaciouſly defeated their Endeavours, that after an Extreme long Siege, he accompliſh'd his Enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> wanted much of being in ſo good a Poſture, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was there with the Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> but very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd how in due manner to ſecond him in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Difficulties, ariſing Ev'ry Moment. As to military Concerns, they were of eaſy management, but the juncture requir'd a dayly diſſipating of factions, the reconciling the Dutcheſs with her Miniſters, the being ſollicitous for the fidelity of the Towns, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Governours, and above all a Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing th' Averſion they boar him in this Countrey, on the ſcore of his Religion: For the <hi>Italians</hi> that are e'en more ſuperſtitious than the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſaid, little cou'd be Expected from ſo ill match'd a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, that it was an unheard of thing to ſee a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal have for one of the Principall <hi>Officers</hi> of his Army, a Heretique, whoſe father wou'd have ſet <hi>France</hi> in a Combuſtion, ſo to have caus'd his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to have flouriſh'd in that Realm, and who had

been brought up in a City, which after the Example of <hi>Rochell</hi> ſerv'd for a Retreat to Rebells and Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and had in fine perform'd his Apprentiſhip in <hi>Holland,</hi> the very Center and Azylum of Hereſy. But if this Matter had anything Extraordinary, it lay rather in ſeeing a Cardinal uſing a Profeſſion ſo Extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique to his own, ſeeing him, I ſay, dayly beſmeering his hands in the Blood of an Infinite Number of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> without remorſe or any other Diſquiet than that giv'n him by an immoderate Ambition. Yet muſt the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> in<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re himſelf to the Manners and faſhions of the Countrey, not to ſay the follies, and by his Patience overcome ſo many obſtacles that all at once interfer'd our Deſigns. He durſt hardly make Profeſſion of his Religion, and if he had been leſs zelous, he wou'd have quickly come to have liv'd like an Atheiſt: but nothing being capable of making him fail in what he ow'd to God, he ſlited the hatred of thoſe who boar him ill Will, and perform'd his Duty. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> was not alltogether ſo prepoſſeſs'd as Others; but nevertheleſs did not refrain often tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that being ſo very worthy a Perſon, but one thing more cou'd there be deſired in him, namely the Change of Religion. He heard all this without ſuffering himſelf to be Seduc'd, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to flatteries as well as Perſecution. But ſo many other matters were then on foot, that theſe were only talkt of, as a man may ſay, for faſhions ſake. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> one day found a Note under his Napkin, by which he had Intimation that the Governour of <hi>Cazal,</hi> correſponded with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and that if not obviated, Evident Proofs of this his Intelligence wou'd be ſeen in a little while.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57147:55"/>
               <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> and having imparted the note to him, they were Both very much at a loſs, not knowing what to think on't; for on the one ſide they doubted it might be a forg'd advertiſement to decoy 'em into ſome falſe ſtep, and on the other it requir'd their baulking no Precautions. The Cardinal was of the firſt Opinion, but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> of the Second, and grounding his thoughts upon that, the Governors being in the Place on the behalf of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> he wou'd now no longer mind remaining Loyal, that Prince being lately Dead, and having left for his Heir only a young Child, incapable of Exerting his Reſentment for the faults committed againſt his Service. He added to theſe a World of Other reaſons, and having at length brought the Cardinal o'er to his Opinion, the reſult was to have him narrowly watcht, and that in the mean while a Rumour ſhould be gi'v'n out of a Deſign to viſit the Garriſons, that ſo he might not be Startl'd if they went by Chance to <hi>Cazal.</hi> Accordingly they began to go to ſome, and in the <hi>Interim</hi> intercepted Letters that left no Room to doubt of the Correſpondence. The matter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been thus averr'd, the Cardinal went to <hi>Cazal</hi> with the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and the Governour coming to pay them his Reſpects was Seiz'd, tho' they had diſcover'd his Actions to be wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantoua</hi>'s Orders. For this Princeſs having none of the Deepeſt Reach, and conſidering only the time preſent, and ſeeing <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> full of troubles and Caballs, had Entertain'd a Phancy ſhe ſhould better ſecure the fortune of her Grand-Son, by putting him under the Protection of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than by leaving him under Ours. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> could never Gueſs from whoſe hands the Note came, but imagin'd it to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57147:56"/>
be thro' the means of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> who had repented what ſhe had done, and wou'd have been very glad to have had another Prevented it's taking effect.</p>
            <p>Having thus quaſht this Conſpiracy, they had now no Other Diſquiet then of releiving <hi>Verceil,</hi> beſieg'd by <hi>Leganez</hi> with all his forces, and he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf cockſure of the Succeſs, for all that commonly contributes to the Defence of a Place was wanting in this Men, Money, Ammunitions, Proviſions, Ingeniers; and with great Probability might it have been ſaid theſe Omiſſions had been made on purpoſe to further the Enemie's Deſign. The Governour meerly by his own virtue made good theſe Defects in the Inſtances he gave of his Courage and Prudence, the ſituation of the Place having withall much obſtructed the works; for the River of <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ia,</hi> making ſeveral little Iſlands at a Musket-Shots Diſtance, occaſion'd the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation to be much larger, and the Lines more difficult to keep. Nevertheleſs <hi>Leganez</hi> having by his Patience accompliſht all, before Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette</hi> had been able to aſſemble forces Sufficient to give Battle, he fell to preſſing the Town, and reduc'd it to ſo great an Extremity, that it could not thence forward hold out long without a ſpeedy Succours. The Governour having found the means to make known it's Circumſtances to the Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> the Cardinal fell to March with twelve thouſand Men of his own Troups, and thoſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> to repair to its Relief. But Heav'n beginning to thwart his Enterprize by Continuall Rains, this ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atigated the Army, that when it was come in view of the Enemies Camp, it ſtood more in need of reſt than Labour. <hi>Leganez</hi> that it might not take any Repoſe, wou'd willingly have march'd with all his forces

to give Battle, if at the ſame time he cou'd have maintain'd his Lines; but having not Men ſufficient for Both, he detach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d his Cavalry to Skirmiſh, while the Infantry remain'd upon the Guard of his Poſts. The Weakneſs of the Garriſon hinder'd the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from being able to advantage himſelf of this Diverſion by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>allies, but animating his Men by the hopes of the Succours allready in ſight, nay and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready engag'd with th' Enemies, he made 'em reſolve upon a Vigorous Defence. Things being in this Poſture, it could not well be but that ſome little Skirmiſhes muſt paſs between the two Armies, but this not being deciſive, and on the contrary only the more and more wearying his Troups, and giving the Enemies time to proſecute their Works, the Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette</hi> reſolv'd to puſh once for all. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he divided his Army in two, but in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner however as to be able to Succour one another, and having committed one part to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to attack the Quarter of the <hi>Germans,</hi> he march'd with the Reſt againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him with much Courage, and ſo cool'd his heat, that this Attempt would have prov'd abortive, if the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had not on his ſide fought with more good Fortune. For having ſurpriz'd the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> by a brisk and Vigorous Charge, he made them buckle at the very firſt, then having broke them, Eight or Nine Hundred men paſs'd through, carrying with them Ammunitions and Proviſions. The Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> exaſperated at this Affront, reveng'd himſelf upon the <hi>Germans,</hi> whom he tax'd with Negligence and Cowardize, he caus'd ſome Companies of 'em to be Decimated, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels to be hang'd, as if they had held ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Us. For to Juſtify himſelf as to this Unhappy Event, he did all he could to have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57147:57"/>
it thought his Men wanted Fidelity, and that he cou'd not have been beaten without Treachery. This Succours gave ſome reſpite to the Beſieged, but did not wholly free 'em from Diſquiet, the Garriſon being become more Numerous, conſum'd more Victuals and Ammunition, and there coming to be a Want of all things a new, it was quickly reduc'd to the ſame Extremities it had been in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. However what had happen'd having render'd <hi>Leganez</hi> more Vigilant and the <hi>Germans</hi> more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> made divers other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts without Succeſs, which made him think it his Duty to beſiege ſome Town for the making a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but Cardinal <hi>Trivulce,</hi> Commanding another Army of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being advanc'd, he was afraid of Engaging in a Country where it wou'd not be in his Pow'r to have Proviſions when he pleas'd. Whereupon returning the ſame way he came, he Encampt again in view of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and after having obſerv'd their Leaguer on the ſide of the River, he fancy'd that if he cou'd drive them from an Iſland, he might the more eaſily relieve the Town. The Reſolution being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to attack them on that ſide, Skirmiſhes were begun in ſeveral places, for the better Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the True Deſign from the Enemies; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nevertheleſs ſuſpected the truth, they made a Battery of Six Canons upon the Shoar of the Iſland, which began to fire inceſſantly, and to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſome Diſorder. As this Enterprize cou'd be Succeſsfull only by ſurprize, Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> ſent a Counter-Order, and the Troups being retreated, he judg'd it convenient to retreat himſelf, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my beginning to ſuffer extremely for want of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals. The Governour having Spirited his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the hopes of Succours, after this found it a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57147:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
difficult task to prevail with them to do their Duty; Unwilling however to loſe the Honour he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by a Vigorous Reſiſtance, 'till that ſeeing his Out-works won, the Place ruin'd by the Canon, the Enemy lodg'd at the foot of the Walls, part of which was already fall'n down, and in ſhort deſtitute, of all hopes of Succours, he made an Honourable Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>The loſs of this Place created apprehenſions that it wou'd be follow'd with that of many others, but <hi>Leganez</hi> falling ſick during theſe Occurrences, the Members cou'd act no longer for want of a Head, and tho' the Command was transferr'd on another, the Reſt of the Campain was ſpent without any Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Performance on either ſide. However we were not wanting to be menac'd with a ſudden Change in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantoua</hi> being exaſperated for our having put to Death the Governour of <hi>Cazal</hi> her Subject, underhand Sollicited Succours from the Emperour and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and tho' the <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to her, that he had merited Death after what he had done, this ſhe did not own, neither durſt ſhe diſown it, for fear of veryfying the ſuſpition we harbour'd of her Conduct, for ſhe peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that he had done things by her Order, and tho' her Proceedings did Sufficiently aver it, ſhe wou'd needs be thought Innocent at the ſame time ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Reparation for the Death of a Criminal. In fine, her Reſentment went ſo far, that <hi>la Tour</hi> then at <hi>Mantoua,</hi> on the Kings behalf, was compell'd to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thence with his Majeſties Envoy: but to prevent her executing the ſiniſter Deſigns ſhe had againſt the Crown, we prevail'd with the <hi>Venetians</hi> to put a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon into <hi>Mantoua,</hi> hoping that out of the Concern they had for the Quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> they with all their Pow'r wou'd hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from getting that Town
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57147:58"/>
into their Poſſeſſion. We had ſtill another Remedy for the Affairs of that Country, but which came to us from a hand we durſt not have expected it, for it was from our very Enemies own ſelves, they becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous of one another, and thorough that Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were a long while without making any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And indeed Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Maurice</hi> his Brother being lately arriv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> and already in their Thoughts devouring the Succeſſion of their Nephew, cou'd not conſent to divide it with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not being wont to do ought without their hire, wou'd not Employ their Men and Money without deriving thence ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and Profit. This miſunderſtanding having laſted ſome time, they were a long while without ſtirring in the leaſt; But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> obſtinately perſevering in abating nothing of their Intereſts, in that they were perſuaded theſe Princes cou'd do nought without their Aid; at laſt Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Brother were oblig'd to Conſent to their retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Conqueſt, but what was ſpontaneouſly Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd, ſhould be for thoſe Princes without the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> having any Pretentions to it. This Agreement being ſign'd on both ſides to the great Diſadvantage of the Princes, who already by this means alienated their imaginary Dominions, they acted in concert, but not without having much jealouſy of one another. However to give ſome Colour to their Enterprizes that were odious to all Good People, they obtain'd a Decree from the Emperour, by which the Princes <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> were inſtituted Tutours of the young Duke their Nephew, and the late Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> Will was made void, by which he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated his Wife, for the Guardianſhip of his ſon, untill at Age of adminiſtring himſelf his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: But this Duke being of a weak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57147:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nay and ſickly too, his Unckles wou'd by no means have that he cou'd live, and were very willing to reap his Succeſſion before his Death. In the mean while as they had many Creatures, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> lay under diſmall Apprehenſions; ſhe was dayly abandon'd by thoſe ſhe had thought moſt truſty, and their Carriage making her have a Diffidence of all Others, ſhe knew not whom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in, nor to whom to communicate th' Affairs that offer'd: Nor had ſhe more confidence in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> who being an Adherent of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> a Miniſter fiill'd with Ambition, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow'd his Movements and paſſions; So as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf ſo univerſally forſaken, ſhe had recourſe to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> with whoſe Integrity and Prudence ſhe was well acquainted; But this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs having let him know the Suſpicion ſhe had of thoſe two Cardinals, he beſought her Royal Highneſs not to explain her mind further to him, becauſe that being th' one's friend, and bound to ſerve th' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as his King's firſt Miniſter, he cou'd not enter upon any Affair without their Participation. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> found this anſwer worthy of him, and not being ſo poſſeſs'd in her own favour, as to find any thing therein to blame, he ſhar'd but ſo much the more in her Eſteem. The firſt Object of Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Arms was <hi>Chivas,</hi> and this ſtill aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Dutcheſſes diffidence, for the Governour Suffer'd his truſt to be Surpriz'd, without taking order for it's Defence; but to cover the intelligence between the Prince and him, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> caus'd a Gate to be broken open by a Petard, and ſo got to be Maſter of the Town. In the mean while <hi>Dom Martin d'Arragon,</hi> one of the Principal Commanders of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> attack'd <hi>Cencio,</hi> but being minded to diſlodge the Enemies out of a large Neighbouring
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57147:59"/>
from whence they made Excurſions, he was kill'd with a Musket ſhot. The taking of <hi>Chivas</hi> renew'd the jealouſy between the Princes and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Each Party laying Claim to the Poſſeſſion of that Town, the Princes as pretending the Governour had of his own Accord put into their hands, th' Others grounding their Challenge upon the Petards having plaid, it ought to be deem'd as having been taken by force: But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gain'd their Cauſe, for that the Princes were not willing to inſiſt any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for fear of blaſting the honour of him that had Surrendred the Place to their Highneſſes. During theſe Tranſactions, Cardinal <hi>Maurice</hi> not being ſo fit for Arms, that he might not remain uſeleſs, made it his buſineſs to Create Caballs up and down the Countrey, and ſped better that way than he durſt have hoped, for the People began to diſlike the Dutcheſs, ſaying ſhe had call'd in the <hi>French</hi> rather to Eat them out of houſe and home, than to deſend them: And indeed the Army was not Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reſiſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Savoyard</hi> Princes, whoſe forces augmented daily, and Good fortune has this property, that it creates many friends; they ſided with that Party in whoſe behalf ſhe appear'd, without conſidering whether that Party had juſtice on its ſide. In ſo great an Extremity the Dutcheſs knew not what to do, and having no hopes of any relief ſave from <hi>France,</hi> ſhe diſpatcht ſeveral Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers to that Court, one while to the King, another to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to demand of them a Speedy Succours: but tho' the Couriers ever return'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd with fair Promiſes, the Affairs the Court was ply'd with from another ſide, hinder'd her from ſeeing ſo ſuddainly the effect of them. The Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> who had acquir'd ſuch Renown by the taking of <hi>Briſac,</hi> dy'd ſhortly after at Thirty Six
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57147:59"/>
years of Age, and left a Victorious Army, Nay, and <hi>Alſace</hi> too, his Conqueſt, for him that with moſt cunning cou'd get to head it. For not a Officer was in his Army capable of Supplying his Room, and Each One was more enclin'd to liſten to Propoſals, tending more to his particular Concern than the Publique Weal. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> a Perſon not wont to Sleep, when the Kings Service or his own Repute had the opportunity of being improv'd, was far from letting ſuch an Occaſion ſlip as this, and ſent at the ſame time to the Principal Officers of that Army, whom he dispos'd by his Money to receive ſuch an One for General as he ſhould be pleas'd to give them. In the Interim the late Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Palatine</hi>'s Son was ſecretly departed <hi>England</hi> on the ſame Deſign, Flattering himſelf that this Army wou'd ſo much the more willingly obey him, as being a Sworn Enemy of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> againſt whom it ſo long had fought: but Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> fearing he might diſturb his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had him ſtopt at <hi>Moulins,</hi> thro' which Place he had directed his Way, without the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Interceſſion, having the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency to obtain his Releaſe. Now this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereon much Money had been Expended, and for which ſtill more was Expended dayly, (For we were oblig'd to pay the Garriſons of <hi>Alſace</hi>) retarded the Succours of <hi>Italy;</hi> joyn'd to this that we had been defeated before <hi>Thionville,</hi> where the Marquis <hi>de Feuquieres</hi> commanding our Forces was taken Pris'ner. Wherefore this Army was again to be ſet on foot, the remains of which were in a bad Condition, but likewiſe to ſuſtain the repute of our Arms in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where we had more advantageous Succeſſes, for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> had taken <hi>Heſdin,</hi> and being
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57147:60"/>
a Favourite, the King had preſented him the <hi>Baton</hi> of Mareſchal of <hi>France</hi> upon the Breach, for the giving the greater Luſtre to his Actions. However that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> might not totatally deſpond, ſhe dayly ſuffering new loſſes, the Court reſolv'd to diſpatch to her <hi>Chavigni,</hi> the Cardinals Confident, enjoyn'd with fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: He cou'd not miſs of finding that Court under a great Affliction, for after the taking of <hi>Chivas,</hi> Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> had render'd himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Chieri, Montcallier, Juree, Verrue, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentin,</hi> and ſo many other Places, that this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was upon the point of being reduc'd to the ſingle Town of <hi>Turin.</hi> Nay, and what griev'd her moſt, was, that moſt places open'd their Gates of their own Accord, and manifeſted ſo much affection for the Princes, that it ſeem'd as if they had made great gains in Changing their Maſter. Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who had great Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies in <hi>Turin,</hi> judg'd it then convenient to draw near that place, and the Dutcheſs fearing he might take it by main force, diſpatch'd thence her Children, whom ſhe caus'd to be conducted into the Fortreſs of <hi>Montmelian.</hi> Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> having taken his Quarters in the <hi>Valentin,</hi> dayly expected in this City Reſolutions to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but the Dutcheſs having confided it's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> this General being ſeconded with the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> took ſuch good care that not a body durſt ſtirr. Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ſeeing things did not ſpeed according to his deſire, drew-off from near the Town, after having rejected Propoſals of Peace which the Dutcheſs ſent him by the Popes Nuncio. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo refus'd advantageous Offers made him by the King in caſe he wou'd divorce himſelf from the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57147:60"/>
               <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and having joyn'd the Marquis <hi>de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganez,</hi> who had recover'd his Health, he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Montcalve</hi> and <hi>Villeneuve d'Aſt,</hi> of the latter by Surprize, and of the former by force of Arms. <hi>Aſt</hi> was taken afterwards, or rather ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of it ſelf, the Magiſtrates going out to meet him with a Preſent of their Keys. The Governour made a ſhew as if he wou'd defend the Cittadel, but yielded without ſtaying 'till the Canon playd, which made the world believe that what he did was only to guild over his Treachery. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ſeiz'd the Cittadel, and the Princes the Town, conformably to their Treaty; which reviv'd the jealouſy of Both Parties, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition enough to clutch all, and the Princes on their ſide thinking all the Country ought to belong to them, were ſufficiently vex'd to ſee themſelves under an obligation of ſharing it with others. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> having ſpyes in all places, laid hold of ſo favourable a time to endeavour the ſetting them at odds; but they were at a loſs what courſe to take, knowing his Ambition, and fearing his deceiving them after having got of them what he pretended: What gave them ſtill the more apprehenſion was, that they knew he ſought to make them jealous of one another, and that while he made them Propoſals to Both in Common, he made others to Each in Particular, ſeeking only to ſow Diviſion in the Party. And indeed not prevailing in his Deſign of getting Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> over to his ſide, he had levell'd his Intrigues upon Cardinal <hi>Maurice,</hi> into whom he had endeavours us'd to inſinuate, that being as he was the Eldeſt, if any one, he ought to have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; that thus it became him not to Suffer his Brother to acquire all the Authority, while the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57147:61"/>
World conſider'd him only as a Man having a great Name, but fit for Nothing; that he muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if the young Duke ſhould chance to dye, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> would not put in for a part in the Succeſſion; that a Man us'd to Govern cou'd hardly fall again to truckle in Obedience; that, he already plaid the Maſter in his conferring of all Civil and Military Offices; and that, if matters were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his Eminency, 'twas when they were done, and rather to have his approbation of them, than to leave 'em at his Diſpoſal. In the mean while, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> was bid to make a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon what he did, that tho' he took the Pains, he would not reap the fruit; and that after all his Induſtry and Endeavours, he would find he had only ruin'd his Country to enrich the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and inveſt his Brother with the Wrecks of a ſtate appertaining to him by Birth-right; that it would be much more Glorious for him to undertake the Protection of his Nephew and the Dutcheſs his Siſter in Law, and that he would beſides find therein more advantage, that what cou'd be his meaning by augmenting the Pow'r of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he imagin'd they wou'd be content with their Dividend; that he was very far from the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the late Duke his father, who had ever held for a Generall Maxime, that a Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ought Equally to diſtruſt the two Crowns; that <hi>France</hi> had no other Deſign in this Warr than to hinder the Conqueſt of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that as it became his to be the ſame, he ought not (if well advis'd) any longer to deferr joyning his Armes to thoſe of that Crown. But he was ſo deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that he cou'd not ſo eaſily diſintangle himſelf from them, for aiming to keep him by indiſſoluble Bands, they had deſir'd before
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57147:61"/>
all things he ſhou'd ſend his Wife to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and fear'd they wou'd uſe her ill upon the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration they ſhou'd perceive in his Behaviour. Thus Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> not in the leaſt prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this Intrigue, the juncture requir'd his bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his thoughts upon Succouring the Dutcheſs, who was in Deſpair to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What made them ſtill the more deſirous to ſeparate from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was, that they cou'd not agree among themſelves how to employ the Army for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> aiming only at their own ends, after having open'd the paſſage of <hi>Montferrat</hi> by taking the Caſtle of <hi>Montcalve,</hi> harbour'd no other thoughts than thoſe of making themſelves Maſters of <hi>Cazal,</hi> which they conſider'd as a place capable of giving Law to <hi>Italy.</hi> Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> was very much puzzl'd, how with ſuch a handfull of men as his, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo many things at once, for <hi>Trin</hi> being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the Enemies without it's being in his Pow'r to prevent it, <hi>Cazal</hi> was in danger of being loſt, if the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> newly made Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General, had not brought thither a ſpeedy Succours. <hi>La Tour,</hi> Commanding in <hi>Mantoua,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd this place at the ſame time, and had it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence recommended to him, as being then deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a Governour by the Duke of <hi>Candalle's</hi> Death, who had had that Poſt after the Diſcovery of the Conſpiracy before mention'd. This Succours hinder'd the Enemies from laying Siege to't, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57147:62"/>
they block'd it up ſo cloſe that nothing more now cou'd enter this faſtneſs. Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> had writ ſeveral times to <hi>France</hi> for Succours, but as the Court deferr'd from day to day the ſending him any, he thought himſelf oblig'd to abandon ſundry places, and keep ſuch only as were of moſt Conſequence; by this means he form'd a ſmall Body, with which if he cou'd not keep the Field, at leaſt was he in a Condition to traverſe the Enemies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. At length the Court being importun'd by the Generals and the Dutcheſs, whoſe Afflictions dayly augmented, ſent the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> with a Reinforcement of Seaven Thouſand men. Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who with his little Army had not been wanting to recover <hi>Chieri<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> had not giv'n it ſome days reſt, when he march'd againſt the City of <hi>Aſt,</hi> wherein he had ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. The two Princes of <hi>Savoye</hi> were in that Town, and he thought they cou'd not ſcape him: but they having diſcover'd the Conſpiracy, had the Authors of it puniſh'd, and were upon their Guards. <hi>La Vallette</hi> being on the way inform'd of what occurr'd, ſhifted his Courſe and march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chivas</hi> which the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to Succour: but as he wou'd have been very willing to have effected that Deſign without coming to a Battle, he drew near <hi>Turin,</hi> expecting that the jealouſy this march of his wou'd occaſion in <hi>La Valette,</hi> to be capable of making him raiſe the Siege; he alſo hop'd that by Poſting himſelf between the City and him he ſhou'd cut off his Proviſions; but <hi>la Vallette</hi> had provided ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all events, that preſſing his attacques, he oblig'd <hi>Leganez</hi> to come to him, ſeeing that the Place was going to fall into his hands; there was ſome ſlight Skirmiſh between the two Armies, but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57147:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Leganes</hi> not having found it to his advantage had the grief of having loſt his time. However the Princes of <hi>Savoye</hi> improving the time our Arms were buſy'd, ſeiz'd on <hi>Villa-franca</hi> and <hi>Nice,</hi> thro' the fault of our Gallys, that being ſent thither for the Security of thoſe Places, were imprudently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy'd out to Sea by ſome Ships that had appear'd near the Coaſt. The Cittadel of <hi>Nice</hi> made ſome Reſiſtance, hoping to have Succours ſent it, but it gave not Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette</hi> time to come thither, and the Army was ſtill two days march diſtant when it ſurrendred. The Loſs of two ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Places extremely afflicted the Dutcheſs, who ſaw nothing on all ſides but ſubjects of Diſtruſt; for <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who was with her demanded of her in the King's name that ſhe wou'd put the reſt of her Dominions into his hands, urging for his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that as long as ſhe was Miſtreſs of them, the People out of the averſion they had for her, wou'd be ever making New Practiſes and Stirs, but when they knew that the King was ſo ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in them, the fear of his Power wou'd awe 'em into their Loyalty, that there was no other means to bring her Brothers in Law to their Duty, who wou'd think more than once how they continu'd their Hoſtilities, ſeeing they had not ſo much to do with her as with a Prince in a State to make 'em repent ſooner or later. Tho' theſe Reaſons, very farr from being capable of perſuading, had nothing but what might be baffl'd by one ſingle Word, yet the Dutcheſs not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Courſe to take in the Extremity ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was oblig'd to acquieſce in all we had a mind to; ſhe remitted the Citys of <hi>Queraſque,</hi> of <hi>Carmagnolle</hi> and of <hi>Savillan</hi> into Cardinal <hi>de la Valettes</hi> hands, and tho' her Miniſters did not adviſe her to this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57147:63"/>
Reſolution, ſhe cou'd give 'em no other anſwer but that having truſted us with her own Perſon, ſhe had nothing more to husband: However as we were far from being beloved in that Countrey, this ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd the averſion they had for her, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Turin</hi> ſeeking out for ſome other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, invited her Brothers in Law, promiſing 'em to deliver 'em up the Town. Yet as it was not in their Pow'r to Execute what they promis'd, by reaſon of the Exactneſs us'd in the Guard of all the Poſts, reſolv'd it was, that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould approach the Town with Petards and Scaling-Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and they ſhow'd him a Place by which he might hope to make himſelf Maſter of it the more eaſily. The matter having been projected with much Conduct, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> coming on the ſide of the Green Baſtion, there erected his Scaling-Ladders, and having caus'd his Men to mount without being diſcover'd, he made himſelf Maſter of the Place, without it's coſting him ſo much as one man: He forthwith broke open the Caſtle-Gate with a Petard, and the noiſe having awak'd ſome Souldiers, they ran half a-ſleep, but did but encreaſe the Victory by their Defeat. The Dutcheſs found all the pains imaginable to make her Eſcape into the Cittadel, whither Her Royal Highneſs withdrew allmoſt ſtark Naked, having ſo many other Affairs in her head that ſhe minded not her preſent State. The City was preſerv'd Sound and Entire by the Orders of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and it was as a Miracle that amid the Diſorder and Confuſion that the Darkneſs the more augmented, he cou'd hinder the Inhabitants from being Plunder'd. Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> had no ſooner learnt this vexatious News, than that he rais'd the ſiege of <hi>Cuni,</hi> whither he had bent his Courſe, after having in vain endeavour'd relieving the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57147:63"/>
of <hi>Nice,</hi> and being drawn near <hi>Turin,</hi> his thoughts were leſs poſſeſs'd with recovering it, than how to get the Dutcheſs thence, and give ſome Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to what ſtill held out. During theſe Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, <hi>Leganez</hi> having Notice of this great Succeſs, quitted all other Buſineſs to endeavour the reducing the Cittadel, but in an Interview between Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> and him, they had again ſome hard Words touching this new Conqueſt; for the Prince pretended that having been call'd by the Inhabitants, it belong'd to him, and <hi>Leganez</hi> that having been taken by Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lado, there was no queſtion of its falling to the King his Maſters Portion. Theſe Conteſts which had like to have proceeded very far, having giv'n ſome Breathing time, the Popes Nuncio propos'd a truce, and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> being enclin'd out of the fear he lay under, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wou'd render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Cittadel, ſome hopes there were that while the truce continu'd, we ſhould get this Prince wholly out of their hands. In the mean while, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had an Extraordinary Paſſion to leave this Countrey; and after having Writ about it to Court ſeveral times, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any anſwer, he reſolv'd to ſpeak of it himſelf to the King, then ſaid to be coming from <hi>France,</hi> to give the more heat to the Affairs of <hi>Italy;</hi> for tho' he had a ſtrong Paſſion to do the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> Service, the goodneſs of his Nature did not allow him to ſee the Condition ſhe was reduced to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſtruck with Grief, and without having a Deſign to remove from a Place where he continually had objects of Compaſſion before his Eyes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as nought but pitty inſpir'd him with theſe Sentiments, he promis'd the Dutcheſs who reproch'd him for meaning to abandon her, that he wou'd not harbour ſuch a thought in caſe ſhe had an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57147:64"/>
anſwerable to his Deſires. But imagining that all the Rumours which were ſpread about of the Kings coming, were only to prevent her falling into the utmoſt Deſpondency, and to hinder her from coming to an accommodation with her Brothers in Law, during which Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> endeavour'd to do her Affairs on another ſide.</p>
            <p>The Truce I have newly mention'd, was only for Six Weeks, and tho' this term was very ſhort to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect great matters thence, yet we improv'd it to advantage. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> conſidering at length, that the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> were to him of as much conſequence as thoſe of <hi>Flanders</hi> and of <hi>Germany,</hi> gave order that a part of the Troups which were deſign'd for <hi>Alſatia</hi> ſhou'd march that waywards. This Diverſion afforded the Emperour ſome Reſpite, he having allready loſt <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and was at a great plunge to oppoſe the <hi>Suedes,</hi> whoſe Affairs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Germany</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and under the Conduct of General <hi>Bannier,</hi> who had Succeeded him in the Command of the Armies. Nevertheleſs as he was in a ſtate to gain by this Diverſion, he highly complain'd againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſaying that for their own particular Intereſts they car'd not tho' he had loſt the Ancient Patrimony of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Now to appeaſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his Complaints, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent him ſome Money, with a promiſe of aiding him Suddainly with a potent Army. And indeed they began to make many Leavies in their territories; but they were no ſooner Compleat, but that their own Intereſts being dearer to them than thoſe of another, they deſign'd them for <hi>Flanders,</hi> whoſe Conqueſt the King had laid aſide, tho' he ſeem'd to apply his thoughts a little more than formerly to th' Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> Nevertheleſs as the paſſes were
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57147:64"/>
Stopp'd up, theſe New-rais'd forces were to be ſhipp'd to be tranſported into that Countrey: But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having as much Intereſt as we to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their landing, put forth at the ſame time to Sea under the Command of Admiral <hi>Tromp,</hi> which ſo Startled the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tho' much ſtronger in Men and Shipping, that they retir'd into the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Ports, with whom they had made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Treaty. Yet as the King of <hi>England</hi> was under no rupture with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they hop'd ſtill to find ſome favorable Occaſion to beat the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> But the King put forty Men of Warr out to ſea under Colour of Securing his Coaſts, and thoſe Ships being poſted between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and them, broak all their Meaſures. In the mean while a thick fogg ariſing, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by favour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who cover'd their Motions, attempted to paſs on to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> not perceiving it till a little late, cou'd not hinder ſome Ships from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Port; nevertheleſs the greateſt part having been cut off before they cou'd Joyn the reſt, were forc'd, to fly without the <hi>Engliſh</hi> making any ſhew of giving them Succours; for the King of <hi>England</hi> againſt whom the <hi>Hollanders</hi> wou'd have been reduc'd to declare Warr if he perſever'd thus in protecting their Enemies, wou'd not proceed openly to Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for fear of making his People ſtill more Malecontent, they having thro' <hi>Presbiterian</hi> Cant and Artifice been brought to degenerate much in their Loyalty to the Crown. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> retir'd again into his Ports, but ſeeing they ſpent and moulder'd away dayly more and more, without hopes of being able to induce the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to do more for them, they reſolv'd to return into <hi>Spain,</hi> as ſoon as they ſhou'd find the Occaſion.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57147:66"/>
one another, the King return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> to her own home. Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> dying during theſe Occurrences, he left the Army under Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Command, he having been made Lieutenant General, but laid the Cardinals Death ſo much to heart, that he could not reliſh the pleaſure he wou'd have had at another time, for his new Dignity. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> being return'd, conjur'd him a-new, but with Earneſt deſires that he wou'd not abandon her: but beſides it's not lying in his pow'r to do ſo without order, Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette</hi>'s Death did not allow him to deſire it, not that what he had done had been out of jealouſy, but becauſe it wou'd have ſeem'd he had refus'd to take upon him the Conduct of the Army, for that it was a troubleſome Province at that time, as conſiſting not of above ſix thouſand Men, but his Prudence ſupplying all, he put himſelf in a poſture of diſturbing the Enemies Deſigns, they pretending to avail themſelves of the Generals Death. However the Court had no ſooner notice of this Accident, than that it nominated the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> to ſupply the Room of Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> which it would not have done, as having ſufficient Confidence in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> if the Concerns of his family had not been in ſuch a ſtate as render'd him in ſome manner ſuſpected.

The Sanctuary which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the Baron <hi>du Bee,</hi> who were Malecontent with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> had found with him, ſtill augmented his ſuſpicions, and the Court fearing the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> might Eſpouſe his Intereſts to the prejudice of his Duty, it was very willing to tye his hands from doing ill, ſuppoſing him ſo inclin'd. In the mean while, the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was no ſooner nominated to go Command the Troups in <hi>Italy,</hi> but that he went away Poſt for the greater Expedition: He found the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had allready atchiev'd ſundry Exploits, and being very willing to Share in the honour that muſt thence redound to him, he went to the Army, the Command of which he took upon him. Tho' the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had ſome Occaſion not to be Satisfy'd with his Arrival, he paid him all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he ow'd to his General, joyn'd to this, that his Birth and Peculiar Merit challeng'd a decent demeanour to him.

As <hi>Leganez</hi> cou'd not be ignorant that they were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, from the Noiſe of Cannons and the Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys from the Muskets which he heard diſtinctly, made haſt to arrive at the River, and after having taken ſome Carriages that had not as yet had time to paſs, he caus'd the Bridge to be attack'd, which was defended with great Courage. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance cool'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> heat, and having known Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> allready to be Deſeated, they durſt not attempt to force the Bridge, for fear of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their Misfortune by ſome freſh Miſhap. However the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having caus'd his Troups to paſs the River, was follow'd ſo cloſely, as reduc'd him ſeveral times to face about; but the Enemies having perceiv'd by his looks there was no great matter to be got by him, left him to joyn the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> without uſing any further Impediment. This Succeſs being equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by Friends and Enemies, rais'd the Count <hi>de Harcout's</hi> fame to a high pitch, and tho' the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſeem'd to have little ſhare in it by reaſon th'other had the Command in Chief, yet was part of it nevertheleſs attributed to him: but this the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was ſo very far

               </hi> we durſt not keep the Field: however the jealouſy they had of one another hinder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d them from atchieving any conſiderable matter; and the Dutcheſs taking that time to make new Propoſals to her Brothers in Law, ſo as the world at length thought an accommodation muſt infallibly be brought about, conſidering the advantages Both Parties muſt thence derive; for Cardinal <hi>Maurice</hi> had the Dutcheſſes Eldeſt Daughter offer'd him for a Wife with a conſiderable Portion, and as he had his mind poſſeſs'd with an opinion that the Young Duke of <hi>Savoye</hi> cou'd not live, he thereby ſecur'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Succeſſion. On the other ſide they offer'd Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thomas</hi> to diſmember the Dutchy, and to inveſt him with the Sovereignty of ſome places. But theſe Princes began to become jealous of one another, thro' theſe Propoſals, which wou'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have fitted their turns, but diſpleas'd 'em in Common, out of the Paſſion each had to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to himſelf the Sovereign Pow'r; at laſt they began to harbour a Diffidence of one another; and <hi>Leganez</hi> not having 'till then been able to obtain their Conſent to his laying ſiege to <hi>Cazal,</hi> took ſo favourable a time to attack it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ever conſider'd that Conqueſt as the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant they could make in <hi>Italy:</hi> but fancying it cou'd not miſs falling into their hands, after the Count <hi>de Harcourts</hi> retreat and the Bickerings of thoſe two Brothers, they march'd thither with ſuch great Confidence, that they neglected taking a world of Precautions needfull to their Enterprize. But what made them believe it the more certain
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57147:68"/>
atchievement, is that the Garriſon was weak, and that <hi>La Tour</hi> the Commander of the place had reaſon to diſtruſt the Inhabitants, the moſt part of whom held Correſpondence with the Dutcheſs. Thus by minding affairs within doors, this Governour, as I may ſay, forgot affairs without doors, and gave <hi>Leganez</hi> time to make his approaches. <hi>Leganez</hi> ſeeing every thing contributing to his Succeſs, preſs'd on his point, and met with no other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments than the wonted inconveniencies of the Seaſon, not much advanc'd as yet. In the mean while he dayly expected the Tydings of <hi>Roſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano's</hi> being taken, having ſent thither a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by reaſon it might have obſtructed and Cut off Proviſions from going to his Army. <hi>Roſſignano</hi> was only a plain Caſtle, but tho' the Garriſon had not any hopes of Succours, yet it held out longer than expected, nay and beyond <hi>La Tour's</hi> hopes, <hi>La Tour</hi> took thence occaſion to Encourage his Men, and after having made ſure of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to him ſuſpected, he began to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the outworks oftner than he had done afore. His Preſence made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> find more Obſtacles, and beginning to fear the Siege might ſpin out into a Length, they work'd with great Care on the Lines of Circumvallation, on which they work'd afore only for faſhions ſake: but as it was not a work to be done in one day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſituation of the Places, the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> having drawn out the moſt Garriſons he poſſibly could, he march'd Day and Night, and came before it was finiſht. Whatever Confidence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might have had at firſt, they were nevertheleſs Surpriz'd; for tho' he had but Seav'n thouſand foot, with little leſs than four thouſand Horſe, they were Sufficient however to attack their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57147:68"/>
Quarters, that were remote from one another, and not equally intrench'd, they requir'd a great many men in ſuch Places where the Lines were not yet compleated, and thus unproviding moſt of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, theſe latter were under ſo great a Dread of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attack'd, that the preſence of our men was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Defeat them. All things being thus in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order &amp; Confuſion, it was eaſy for the Count <hi>de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cout</hi> to promiſe his men the victory, they being already ſufficiently animated by the ſight of the Enemies. The greateſt difficulty was how to get them near, for the rains had ſo Spoil'd the ways, eſpecially about the town, that it was no ſmall Difficulty to bring the Canon thither; Yet it was a neceſſity, becauſe if ours cou'd attain to make a Battery upon a little Mountain on this ſide the Lines, they might fire thence upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp, and incommode them Extremely. Count <hi>Harcourt</hi> having thereupon contriv'd all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Means to overcome that Difficulty with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that offer'd themſelves, at length the Army came in view of the Enemies, and ſeiz'd on ſome riſing Grounds within Canon-ſhot. They rais'd there a Battery at the ſame time, which fir'd into the very trench, ſo as that the Men there a Working, being beſides to be upon their Guard againſt the Beſieged, were under an Extreme Peril. <hi>Leganez</hi> knew not what to do to re-incourage his Men, whoſe fear was Extraordinary, ſeeing they were upon the Point of being defeated, for not a man cou'd ſtirr now out of the Lines to fight, being ſhut up ſo Cloſe, that before they cou'd have been drawn up in Battalia, the Enemies had fall'n upon them; Yet making a Virtue of Neceſſity, he re-inforc'd thoſe Quarters that were moſt Expos'd, and ſhew'd himſelf indeſatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the pains he took. He told his Men that if they cou'd reſiſt the firſt fury of the <hi>French,</hi> they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57147:69"/>
wou'd quickly retreat for want of Proviſions, and that after that the Place being in ſtill greater want than the Army, wou'd of it ſelf fall into their hands; that this was the means to finiſh the War of <hi>Italy</hi> all at once, which otherwiſe wou'd laſt a whole Age; that they wwre much more Numerous than the Enemies, and that tho' they ſeem'd remote from one another, he had nevertheleſs taken Care for their giving one another a mutuall Relief. But the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> without loſing time thus in uſeleſs words, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Germans</hi> made a little more reſiſtance, but ſeeing themſelves aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, they betook themſelves to their heels as well as Others, ſo as if they had been purſued, they'd have all been Cut in pieces. The Night coming on hinder'd the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> from purſuing his Victory, beſides he fancy'd he had done ſufficient in having reliev'd <hi>Cazal.</hi> However mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make advantage of the Conſternation the Enemies were in, he conceived a Deſign which ſome accuſed of temerity, tho' the Succeſs ſurpaſs'd his hopes; this was to beleaguer <hi>Turin</hi> in which Place were all the forces of the Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and where Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſhut up himſelf, for how, ſaid they, can we hope for any Succeſs from his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, he having but ten thouſand men, being oblig'd to a great Circumvallation, beſeiging a Place De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by a Prince, and where the Garriſon falls lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

ſhort of his forces, and who in a word has ſo utterly defeated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but that he ought to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their returning to beſeige him himſelf in his Camp. And indeed <hi>Leganez</hi> had no ſooner notice of his being before the Town, but that he comforted himſelf for the diſgrace that had newly befall'n him, as if he had been ſure of a very ſpeedy retaliation. Yet as he had experimented his Enemies Courage, he wou'd not be guilty of any neglect, and having ſtrengthned his Army with ſome Succours that came to him from the Land of <hi>Milan,</hi> he march'd in ſuch great Confidence of the victory, that he ſent word to Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> Suddenly to ſee the younger Brother <hi>la Perle</hi> paſs for that he cou'd no longer ſcape them. This name the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> had given him, for that he was the younger Brother of his Houſe, and that he wore a Perle in his Ear. But the great Actions he had already done with thoſe he ſince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, Occaſion'd his quickly having another name conferr'd on him, and that inſtead of calling him the younger Brother <hi>Perle,</hi> they call'd him the <hi>Perle of Younger Brothers.</hi> Being not ignorant of the Greatneſs of his Enterprize, and that it's accompliſhment muſt neceſſarily require a Conſiderable time, he neglected nothing on his ſide either as to fortifying his Camp, or depriving the Enemies of the means of injuring him, and of making a long reſiſtance. He diverted the Courſe of the River <hi>Doria</hi> on which were the Mills of the Town; but ſeeing that the Beſeiged brought it again into its wounted Bed, he caus'd a Battery to be rais'd againſt thoſe Mills, which were ſo ruin'd by the Canon, as made 'em unfit for any uſe. In the mean while to favour his Approaches, he made himſelf Maſter of the Bridge upon the <hi>Po</hi> by the Convent of the <hi>Capuchins</hi> and of the <hi>Valentine.</hi> But after having ſurmounted theſe Obſtacles, there aroſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57147:70"/>
a thouſand Others, the leaſt of which was capable of pauling his Courage, if he had had leſs than what he poſſeſst. He dayly ſuſtain'd the Sallyes of the Beſieg'd, and had bus'neſs ſufficient to repell them and mind his Lines, which <hi>Leganez</hi> threatned every moment to attack. The Viſcount <hi>De Turenne</hi> was a great help to him in all things, and he employ'd him more willingly than others, either that he had more Confidence in him, or that he knew him moſt Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Enterpriſe. <hi>Leganez</hi> in the mean while being come near with Eighteen thouſand Men, made a ſhow as if he meant to recover the Bridge, but after having attempted it in vain, he thought he ſhou'd do better to go paſs the River at <hi>Montcallier,</hi> from whence he might afterwards relieve the Town more eaſily. This Deſign was not ſo ſecret but that it came to the Knowledge of the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and of the General Officers, the moſt part of whom advis'd him to take ſo favourable a time to make his Retreat; for to what purpoſe, ſaid they to him, ſhou'd you perſevere any longer in a Deſign, wherein was nothing but ſhame to receive and blows to be got; that his Army was rather beſieged than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging; that Hunger kill'd equally Men and Horſes, and that the not embracing ſo propitious an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was deſigning it's Ruine. But this Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Courage above all difficulties, not ſuffering himſelf to be ſeduc'd by their Remonſtrances, ſent the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had ever been of his opinion, to burn the Bridge of <hi>Montcallier,</hi> that was only of Wood, and having now nothing to ſtruggle with but hunger, he ſhew'd his Souldiers by his own example that it became 'em to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a little, when the King's ſervice ſo requir'd it. He had now nothing but Herbs ſerv'd up to his Table, and his men ſeeing it wou'd ill
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57147:70"/>
become 'em to complain while he ſhar'd with 'em to the utmoſt inconveniences, liv'd likewiſe upon Herbs, and by degrees grew accuſtom'd to ſo inſipid a nouriſhment. <hi>Leganez,</hi> having found the Bridge of <hi>Montcallier</hi> burnt, turn'd back, leaving <hi>Carlo de la Gatta,</hi> one of his Principal Officers to repair it. This oblig'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to have an eye to what he meant to do, and ſtopping on the other ſide of the Water, there was no likelyhood but that there muſt be a Bruſh. During theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences <hi>Gatta</hi> diſcover'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ford</hi> a little higher, but durſt not undertake to paſs it in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> preſence, and choſe rather to make uſe of the Conveniency offer'd him by certain little Iſlands for the covering his Motions: Having ſeiz'd thoſe Iſles by main Might, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> wou'd have diſlodg'd him thence, but having been Wounded, his men were dis-heartned by this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being diſabled from Action, <hi>Gatta</hi> laid his Bridge by the means of theſe Iſlands, which ſerv'd him for ſhelter and a Retreat. The Bridge being made, <hi>Leganez</hi> caus'd his Army to paſs it, leſs with Deſign however of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than of diſtreſſing and ſhutting-up the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> in a narrower compaſs, he ſeeming to be reduc'd to the utmoſt extremities, for he had been forc'd to take Proviſions out of the Cittadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> and other the Places he held in the Neighbourhood, to ſupply the room of Herbs, of which he began to be in want. Wherefore it was <hi>Leganez</hi> his opinion to have him by Famine; but Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who ſuffer'd on his ſide, and thro' ſcarcity of Victuals fear'd loſing the affection born him by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Turin,</hi> was of a different ſentiment, and ſignify'd to him that without a ſpeedy Succours he wou'd proceed to an accommodation with his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57147:71"/>
Siſter in Law: Nay, he gave him but four days time, and <hi>Leganez</hi> knowing him to Entertain ſundry Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, and that he, perhaps, only ſought after ſome Pretexts to Change his Party, he reſolv'd both contrary to his own ſence, and to what reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, to attack the Count <hi>de Harcourt.</hi> This Prince being upon the point of dying of hunger, and had been allready advis'd rather to implore the Enemies Mercy, than ſee his Army Periſh, ſeeing his Deſtiny wou'd depend thenceforward on his Courage, found now Comfort after all his Sufferings; Yet he ſtood in great want of the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> whoſe Wound detain'd him in Bed, he view'd and Conſulted with the Other General Officers what was to be done, and gave them each their Poſts. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> unwilling to remain Idle while any thing was to be done, left his Bed, and was not one of thoſe from whom he deriv'd the leaſt Service. <hi>Leganez</hi> march'd in the mean while with all his Troups, and had agreed with Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> that while he attack'd the Lines on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ide, He ſhou'd make a Vigorous Sally on his; but Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> making a little too much haſte was repuls'd with ſome loſs, and this Succeſs having giv'n Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to our Troups, they receiv'd <hi>Leganez</hi> with ſo much Vigour, that if <hi>Carlo de la Gatta</hi> had not forc'd the Poſt <hi>de la Purpurato,</hi> which he attack'd, he would have been Ev'ry where beaten. But for prevention ſake they in the Camp had fell'd many Trees to ſtop the way to the Town, and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance having hamper'd <hi>la Gatta</hi> in ſome Perplexity, gave the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> time to Spur-on thither with part of his Horſe. <hi>La Gatta</hi> was roughly handled: But Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> having at length found the means to open to himſelf a Paſſage, came in to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and after having fought in Conjunction
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57147:71"/>
with him without being able to break our Horſe, they both retreated into the Town. <hi>Leganez</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sufficient to produce the raiſing of the Siege, order'd the Retreat to be ſounded, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſs'd the <hi>Po</hi> again, ſeiz'd on certain Hills and Riſing Grounds, from whence he ſaw not only into the Count <hi>de Harcourt's</hi> Camp, but alſo into the very Town. But things fell out quite contrary to his Expectations. For <hi>la Gatta</hi> and his Men having only ſerv'd to conſume the Proviſions in <hi>Turin,</hi> the inhabitants began to murmur againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> gave him once more to underſtand, that unleſs he found the means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him with an Other Succours he muſt Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render very Suddainly. <hi>Leganez</hi> having Experienc'd how difficult it was to force the Count <hi>de Harcourts</hi> Camp, knew not what to promiſe him, and from day to day deferr'd attacking it, hoping the ſame things which oblig'd Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> to make him thoſe Demands with ſo much Earneſtneſs, wou'd oblige the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> to raiſe the Siege. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having taking upon him to Conduct a Convoy to the Camp, having accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly brought it thither in Safety, his hopes van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh'd in ſuch manner as rend'red him well pleas'd with the Promiſes made him by a certain Ingenier, of Conveying meale to the Beſieged, by the means of ſome Mortar-pieces of his Invention, the tryall of which was made at the ſame time. And indeed they receiv'd ſome feeble Succours from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, but all the Mortar-pieces not producing the ſame effect, a great part of the Bullets where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were charg'd, fell into the Count <hi>de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courts</hi> Camp, thus he at the ſame time he admired, received Comfort from the Invention. <hi>Leganez</hi> not finding this turn to Account, rely'd no longer ſo

much upon theſe Mortar-pieces, for as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Accident had thence befall'n him, for as the Bullets contain'd Letters as well as Meal, the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> got thence intelligence, which it much concern'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.

The Count <hi>de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> having been in Continual Allarums from the beginning to the End of the Conflict, ſeeing it terminated without other diſadvantage, took Care to erect again New Forts, and provided them with more Men.

He obey'd notwithſtanding his Indiſpoſition: But the hardſhip he underwent for fifteen days together, with Continuall Rains, brought him ſo low as forc'd him to betake himſelf to his Bed at his Return. Yet his Illneſs was more tedious than dangerous, but troubled him however, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, for he fancy'd not that all muſt go ill without him, but that, in whatever Condition, he was bound to be preſent in all Occaſions, for which reaſon he wou'd have riſen ever and anon, and the Phyſicians forbidding it had been to no purpoſe, if the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> had not joyn'd his Commands to their Prohibitions. The Poor Patient ſaid, he was unhappy, he who had ever been in good health when he had had nothing to do, to be now Compell'd to lye in his Bed when his Honour was at ſtake. At each diſcharge of a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket he rais'd himſelf up, and ask't for his Cloaths, and tho' inform'd there was no Action, yet would he not believe it, till he had it confirm'd to him by ſome Perſon of Authority.</p>
            <p>The Convoy he had brought to the Camp was a mighty Succours to the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> for not only was it compos'd of the Proviſions neceſſary, but alſo of four thouſand Men, which were a great help to him to Line ſuch Poſts as were unprovided. Several Perſons of Quality came beſides from <hi>France,</hi> either to be preſent at a Siege that made allready ſo much Noiſe, or to pleaſe Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> then uneaſy about its upſhot: For beſides his having reaſon to be concern'd for't as Principal Miniſter,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57147:73"/>
he had Marry'd one of his Nieces to this Prince, and wou'd have been ſorry that after having acquir'd ſo much fame in <hi>Italy,</hi> for want of Succours he had miſs'd a Place that wou'd Cover him with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Honour. Theſe new Comers were dayly in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Tent, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſay the Enemies were to make a New Effort, he got up, ſay they what they wou'd, and repair'd to the Count <hi>de Harcourts.</hi> This General ran to Embrace him as ſoon as ever he came within his ken, but backt his Careſſes with obliging Reproaches, and feign wou'd have had him return'd to his Tent: but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> made him anſwer that his face was not to be minded, and that his Arm wou'd have Sufficient ſtrength when requir'd by the Kings and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> embrac'd him anew, and having not been able to perſuade him to a Compliance with his deſires, he ſent him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Charge. This Permiſſion which he gave him ſeem'd to be more healing to him than all the Remedies he cou'd have taken. His Countenance chang'd in a little time, and God having granted him the recovery of his Perfect health, he ſhow'd himſelf ſo vigilant in all things, that the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was afraid leaſt this might occaſion him a Relapſe. But the Siege was now to be of no long Continuance, for Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> having no more Victualls for ſo Numerous a Garriſion, and ſeeing no hopes of getting any by <hi>Leganez</hi> his procurement, who had made diverſe New Attacks without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he capitulated at laſt notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of that General, who had indeed ſome diſtreſſes in his Camp, but nothing comparable to thoſe they in the Town had ſo long Suffer'd. This Capitulation, in which <hi>Mazarin</hi> who had been
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57147:74"/>
ſent by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> on purpoſe into <hi>Italy,</hi> had a great ſhare, gave great Umbrages to <hi>Leganez.</hi> And indeed he knew this Miniſter had made Sundry Propoſitions to Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> nay, and that this Prince had giv'n 'em ſo farr a hearing, that he had promis'd to put himſelf under the Kings Protection with his Wife and Children, provided he might have left to him the Places he poſſeſs'd. They ſay too he had promis'd to joyn his forces with thoſe of the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> to wage Warr in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction upon the <hi>Spariards;</hi> but whether it be ſo or not, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that he cou'd not perform this Deſign, before he had got his Wife out of their Hands, who was at <hi>Madrid,</hi> as I ſay'd afore, he enter'd into New Engagements with them, and continu'd his Hoſtilities, as he formerly had done. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he made a Truce with his Siſter in Law, during Endeavours which were us'd to reduce him to his former ſentiments, by offering him ſtill greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages both for himſelf and for his Adherents: but he ſtill wav'd Complyance on the ſcore of his Wife, who was narrowly guarded in <hi>Spain</hi> as a ſure Pledge of his fidelity. And indeed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty got the Wind of theſe Negociations which we were not over-Exact in Concealing on our ſide, that ſo we might render him ſuſpected, fancy'd this to be the only means to keep him Cloſe to their Combination.</p>
            <p>The Succeſs of <hi>Turin,</hi> and the raiſing the Siege of <hi>Cazal,</hi> gave not only reputation to the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> but allſo to the Crown; which had been ſufficiently ſlighted 'till then in <hi>Italy,</hi> but ſeeing it to have the <hi>Alpes</hi> open by the means of <hi>Pignorol,</hi> and its Pow'r mightily augmented by the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Cazal,</hi> all Princes with Emulation courted its
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57147:74"/>
Protection, and the Amity of the firſt Miniſter, to whom they attributed ſo many proſperous Events. Yet this did not hinder his particular Enemies from declaring againſt him. I have before ſaid how that the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> was withdrawn to <hi>Sedan,</hi> with other Perſons of Conſideration, and there was br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>ng a Rebellion then, juſt upon the point of breaking-out. <hi>Mr de Bouillon</hi> had been tampering very far in theſe Practices, and beſides ſeveral Leavies he had made, he had allſo ſent to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who had promis'd him great Succours. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to whom part of his Dominions had been newly reſtored, combin'd allſo with theſe Malecontents, and they all prepar'd for War. As it was impoſſible but that this muſt be come to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Knowledg, he lay under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable Apprehenſion, and dayly Expected ſuch ſad news from all theſe things that he had not one Moments repoſe. At length the Deſign broak out by the Troups <hi>Lamboy</hi> put into the City of <hi>Sedan,</hi> and as this Town was under the Kings Protection, which <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon</hi> by this means renounc'd, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal having for a while conniv'd at Paſſages of this nature, ſeeing he cou'd no longer do it at leaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying Weakneſs, caus'd an Army to march under the Conduct of the Marſchal <hi>de Chatillon.</hi> The Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> to whom, as Prince of the Blood, the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> had deferr'd the Command, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his on his ſide, and being come in ſight of one another, they fought and the Battaile prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d fatal to Both Partys. For after the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely broaken the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> a certain Perſon calling out to him at ſome diſtance that the Enemies rally'd again, he lift up the vizor of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met with his Piſtol, either to take air or view the man that brought him this tydings; But the Piſtol

Thus I think it more fitting to credit thoſe then upon the Spot, than ſuch as ſpeak out of paſſion, or upon the teſtimony of Perſons at that time far remote. His Death did not Change the face of the Battle, but wrought a great Change in the affairs of his Party, whom this accident having plung'd into amazement or rather Conſternation, gave the Mareſchal <hi>de Chattillon</hi> time to bring his Army again on foot. The Cardinal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rid of ſo dangerous an Enemy ſent this Mareſchal more freſh Troups, and the Mareſchal drawing near <hi>Sedan</hi> after having giv'n out the report that the King himſelf was going to follow with another Army, the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> had recourſe to Supplications and Prayers, and obtain'd by this Marſchal, his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Interceſſion, a Pardon for all that had paſs'd. As for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> he was deveſted anew of his Dominions, and pitty'd by none, as ever occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning his own misfortune. The Cardinal after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo happily terminated this Affair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing himſelf above all, had a deſign to be reveng'd on the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> Whom he accus'd of having Clandeſtinely Conſpir'd his Ruine, and as he never wanted a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text when he meant to uſe one, he reſolv'd to revive the Buſineſs of <hi>Fontarabia</hi> and <hi>Dole,</hi> which had been diſcourſt to that Princes diſadvantage The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having an infinite deal of Wit, entertain'd ſome ſuſpition of what was in agitation, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the Coldneſs he had ſhew'd to a Propoſal
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57147:75"/>
that had been made him on this Cardinal's behalf touching a Match with his Eldeſt Son: But going one day to make him a viſit, he converted his ſuſpicions into Certainty, when he obſerv'd at his going away Guards had been ſet to ſecure him; he mounted up again immediately, and pretending he had forgot ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he return'd into the Cardinals Chamber with whom he diſcourſt of a marriage of his Son with his Niece. This Propoſition mollify'd the Cardinal, &amp; having at the very inſtant ſent orders to the Guards to withdraw, he reconducted the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to the very Door of his Antichamber, giving to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by this Civility which none receiv'd from him, that a great Change was wrought in his Mind.</p>
            <p>The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> whom his Brother's Concern had Extremely ruffl'd, being again at reſt thro' the Upſhot it had had, thought himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to make his Acknowledgements to the King, who had the goodneſs to declare it to have been in conſideration of him that he abated of his juſtice: He alſo wrote to the Cardinal upon this matter, and this Miniſter having a particular value for the Viſcount, and willing to Wedd him to his fortune, had him offer'd by the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his Kinſwomen: But this Prince having more Diſpoſition to a Single Life than to Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, wav'd the Match upon account of Difference of Religion, which appearing a valuable Reaſon to the Cardinal, this matter did not in the leaſt leſſen the regard he had for him.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> longing to take a turn into <hi>France</hi> to receive there the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes due to his Great Actions, left his Army under the Conduct of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> after having receiv'd leave from the Court. The Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> having not till now been Commander in Chief,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57147:76"/>
was not willing to loſe the occaſion offer'd to acquire Glory, but took the field though it was ſtill Winter, and having beleaguer'd <hi>Yvreé,</hi> he ſhut up that Place ſo Cloſe, that the Enemies believ'd it loſt without a ſpeedy Succour: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had laid his meaſures ſo well, that after they had approach'd his Lines, they durſt not undertake to offer Battaile. To make a Diverſion, they laid Siege to <hi>Chivas,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Viſcount <hi>de Turrenne</hi> was not much Concern'd, as hoping before they cou'd puſh on their Attacks, he ſhou'd have render'd himſelf Maſter of <hi>Yvreé,</hi> and be in a Condition to make 'em raiſe their Siege.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> being full of Ambition, and thinking that the Honour accruing to Others, tended to the Diminution of his, in lieu of ſtaying ſome time at Court he only ſhew'd himſelf there, and taking Poſt again, came before <hi>Yvree,</hi> when his Preſence was not in the leaſt Expected. He found all things in as good a poſture as he could wiſh, but pretending he had news of <hi>Chivas</hi> being Extremely preſs'd, he rais'd the Siege and march'd againſt the Enemies. Their Aim having been only to make a Diverſion, were far from ſtaying his Coming, &amp; were contented with making a Detachment of fifteen hundred men, which having joyn'd the Garriſon of <hi>Yvreé,</hi> came upon the Banks of the <hi>Loire</hi> to diſpute the paſſage. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had the Vanguard, ſeeing himſelf thus ſtopp'd, caus'd a Battery to be made of his Canon, and while he amus'd the Enemy in little Skirmiſhes, he ſought out a Ford where he caus'd a Thouſand Horſe to paſs; The Enemies ſeeing themſelves nabb'd before and behind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated at the ſame time: But before they had got under ſhelter, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> fell upon their Rear, which he put to ſome Diſorder. The Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> having thus paſs'd the River<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

without receiving any oppoſition, fram'd ſeveral Enterprizes, but not finding any one more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous than laying open for him the Paſſage of the Sea, he march'd to the little City of <hi>Ceva,</hi> fortify'd with a Cittadel. Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> made a ſhow as if he meant to relieve it, and advanc'd for that purpoſe to the very Banks of the River <hi>Tanaer;</hi> but having found the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> on the other ſide, turn'd back after ſome Canons had been diſcharg'd by both Partys: After the taking of <hi>Ceva,</hi> the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> led the Army againſt <hi>Coſny,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> not daring to venture giving Battle, fell upon <hi>Montferrat,</hi> where he ſack'd ſome Villages: From thence he attack'd <hi>Quieraſque,</hi> where while he loſt his time, the <hi>French</hi> preſs'd <hi>Coſny</hi> that made a vigorous Reſiſtance. Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> after having thus fail'd of <hi>Quieraſque,</hi> return'd before <hi>Chivas,</hi> but hearing <hi>Coſny</hi> began to capitulate, he rais'd the Siege for the Second time, and joyn'd the Cardinal <hi>Trivulee,</hi> who render'd himſelf maſter of the Caſtle of <hi>Moncalve.</hi> A Conqueſt of ſuch ſmal Concern was not capable of repairing ſo many loſſes, and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> complain'd bitterly againſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> Whom he accus'd of having abandon'd him, for they had drawn part of their forces out of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and with them the Marquis <hi>de Leganez,</hi> in whoſe Room they had ſent the Count <hi>Sirovela,</hi> a man more of the Cabinet than of expedition; But they cou'd not do otherwiſe by reaſon of the Inſurrection in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the moſt of whoſe Towns had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the <hi>French</hi> King's Protection. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de los-Velez</hi> had the Supreme Command of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Arms in that Province, and endeavour'd to reduce it to Obedience, one while by Mildneſs, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by main force. He had already brought the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Tortoſe</hi> to repent their fault, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

thoſe of <hi>Terragonna,</hi> among whom he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creatures, to follow their Example: but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppos'd his Intentions, he was reduc'd to joyn hoſtilities to his Perſuaſions, and by theſe means brought 'em to his Bow. This Conqueſt opening him the Way to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> he made a ſhow of attacking <hi>Montjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Magiſtrate made anſwer that the Place was in the <hi>French</hi> Kings Poſſeſſion, and that he muſt addreſs himſelf to his Officers: but as he had no hopes from that ſide, he retreated with all ſpeed, and the rather for that <hi>la Motte Houdancourt</hi> was then on the march to give him Battle. <hi>La Motte</hi> not having been able to overtake him, laid Siege to <hi>Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona,</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having found the means to put Succours into that place by Sea, he rais'd the Siege, and paſs'd on into the Kingdom of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> where he repair'd the Affront he had newly receiv'd by a world of conſiderable advantages. In the mean while Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> imagining he cou'd do nothing more advantageous for the Crown, than to foment the Rebellion in that Province, reſolv'd to make way for ſending Succours thither when he pleas'd, and <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> only being capable of putting an obſtacle to his Deſign, he ſent thither Forces under the Conduct of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who ſeiz'd on ſome Burroughs. Nevertheleſs they made a ſhift to block up <hi>Couilloure</hi> and <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the two only conſiderable Places in that Province; and nothing more then impeding the Paſſage of the <hi>Pyrenee's,</hi> he caus'd a conſiderable Body to march into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which ſettled <hi>Barcelona</hi> till then diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Marquis <hi>de los Velez.</hi> Having thus taken
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57147:77"/>
Care for thoſe parts, he us'd his utmoſt endeavours to ſet again on foot the Treaty that had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Princes of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and as they were diſſatisfy'd with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on whom fortune ſeem'd to have turn'd her Back, they accepted the laſt Propoſals that were made them, and joyn'd their forces to thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> ſo as that they became the friends of thoſe on whom they had made War, and made War on thoſe, whoſe friends they had been a little afore. However to conferr on Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> the more Honour, he had the Command of the Army. But Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> unwilling to do that wrong to the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> of making him Obey another, after having perform'd ſuch great Actions, he made him General of an Army in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and ſent the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> into <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> where was like to be the main Scene of the War. And indeed the King ſeeing the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> more a Politician than a General, was preparing to go thither himſelf in Perſon, and was to be follow'd by the Cardinal and the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meillerare,</hi> who notwithſtanding the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having ever been deſirous to fight in the Kings Preſence, was overjoy'd at his being Choſen to ſerve in his Army, and thinking he lay under an Obligation of making his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments for it to the Cardinal, of whom he had ſeveral times begg'd this favour; he mention'd it ſo handſomely to him, that this ſtill the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd the kindneſs that Miniſter had for him. In the mean while the rumour which ran of the Kings journey prov'd true, and the Viſcount <hi>de</hi>

               <hi>Turenne</hi> his having kiſs'd Majeſties Hand, this Prince took him aſide, and confirm'd to him by word of Mouth what he had Written to him ſeveral times, namely that he had much regard for him, and that on his account he had ſo ſoon forgot the Offence of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> not knowing what thanks and humilities to pay his Majeſty for his Grace and Bounty, and as the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had been newly nominated to go Command in <hi>Italy,</hi> under the Authority of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſo many favours at a time ſeem'd to incapacitate him of being ever able to acknowledge ſuch great obligations. He teſtify'd to the King the Sentiments he entertain'd, but the King Embracing him tenderly, told him, that he was too well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with him, that he had it from good hands, all poſſible Endeavours had been us'd to Embark him in the affair of the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> but that before he knew his anſwer, he had rightly judg'd he would do nothing contrary to his Duty. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> begg'd his Majeſty to believe he had never had that matter mention'd to him, but if they had he wou'd not have fail'd of informing his Majeſty: But the King taking him up ſhort, told him, that he ought to be content he was ſatisfy'd with his Conduct, and that as ſo near a Relation of his had been concern'd in that occaſion, he had been the firſt to excuſe him. In the Interim the Army aſſembl'd around <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and as we had not been able to hinder Proviſions from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into that place from <hi>Couilloure,</hi> which was continually ſupply'd by Sea, the <hi>French</hi> reſolv'd to attack <hi>Couilloure,</hi> and to ſhut up <hi>Perpignan</hi> ſo cloſe, as ſhould barr all Entrance and Conveyance into't for the future.

The Marquis of <hi>Montarre</hi> was in the Town with a ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and had built ſeveral Forts around to hinder the Approaches. The Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereupon judg'd convenient firſt of all to take in thoſe Forts, ſent thither the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who carry'd them by dint of Sword: but before he cou'd render himſelf Maſter of the Town, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing <hi>Perpignan</hi> loſt, unleſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd <hi>Couilloure</hi> they entred <hi>Cani</hi> with a Body of Horſe and Reformed Officers, while <hi>la Motte Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancourt</hi> who had an eye to their Motions took the Field on his ſide. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had their Deſign wou'd have declin'd fighting, but <hi>la Motte</hi> having overtaken them at a Paſs, made 'em face about againſt their wills, and after having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated their Rear, preſs'd 'em ſo cloſe that he forc'd 'em to a ſecond Engagement.

The King, whom this Army had giv'n ſome Diſquiet, was overjoy'd to ſee it ſo happily defeated, and as he had already receiv'd great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from <hi>la Motte,</hi> and that his laſt actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd others into his mind, he ſent him the Staff of Mareſchal of <hi>France.

Yet as the Marquis <hi>de Montarre</hi> had fulfill'd the Duty of a Good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and of a Brave Souldier, the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> wou'd not refuſe him the three days

The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being naturally fearfull, and dreading leaſt after the Cardinals Death his Relations and friends might take up Arms, he engag'd <hi>Cinqmars</hi> to ſend into <hi>Spain</hi> for Succours, ſo as while the King endeavour'd to ruine that Crown, his Brother did his utmoſt to uphold it.

The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> pretending from his Majeſty the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences newly confer'd on <hi>la Motte Houdancourt,</hi> ſaw himſelf far from them, as ſoon as he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Brothers Caſe, of whom they talk'd no leſs than of beheading. Thus inſtead of the hopes with which he was animated a little while afore, he found himſelf Seiz'd with fear, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every hour the News of his Brothers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Priſon. And indeed this Unhappy Prince, whom his Deſtiny had hurry'd into the Precipice,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57147:80"/>
having as it were a Secret fore-knowledge of what was like to befall him, harbour'd no Mirth for ſome time paſt; he was wont to be affable and Courteous to all People, but his Melancholly having wholly Chang'd him, Every one perceiv'd he ſhun'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and if the Duty of his Charge cou'd have permitted him to be all alone, he wou'd have taken the leaving him to himſelf as a very great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. As it was impoſſible but he muſt note himſelf this Change, he attributed it to ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes which came upon him from time to time, for having Embark'd himſelf in ſo dangerous an Affair: He conſider'd he had allready ſeveral Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that he Expos'd them to a ſtrange fortune, if what he had undertaken miſs'd of being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd; for to pretend to any favour from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, was a thing not to be thought of, he had had a thouſand troubles to appeaſe him the laſt time, and if the King had not been more indulgent than his Eminency, he wou'd never have obtain'd his Pardon. All theſe Conſiderations however held his Mind in ſuſpence, for on another ſide he made Reflexion, that he ſhould be ever Expos'd to his Caprices, and that as long as he ſtood poſſeſs'd of the Authority he had, there wou'd never be any ſafety for him. He ſtill remember'd a ſaying of his Uncle the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Namely, that he wou'd never be a Sovereign as long as he was oblig'd to remain under the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> which Crown was wont to appropriate to it ſelf the things it cou'd once lay hand to. He beſides remembred a thouſand grating Letters he had receiv'd from the King and his Miniſter, wherein both of 'em ſpoke to him with that Abſoluteneſs and Superiority, that they made no difference between his Character, and that of a Subject; he fancy'd at leaſt that if

he muſt depend on ſome body, he ought to derive more regard than he did from his Dependancy, and this he hop'd to Compaſs by humbling the Cardinal, and ſomething ſome Diviſion in the Kingdom.

The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had to do with the Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeſt man upon the Earth, but on his ſide he had wit enough to ſee at what he aim'd, ſo as he let him talk on without giving him any Interruption: But when he had done ſpeaking, he made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the King was too juſt in all his Actions for him to find fault with any thing his Majeſty did; that <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon</hi> was really Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but the King ſo good, that he hop'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

wou'd have regard to a poor Deſolate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whoſe Anceſtours had render'd ſome ſervices, and had the honour of being related to Princes that ſtill, actually ſerv'd the Crown; that it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Imprudence than a Premeditated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that his Brother was engag'd in this Intrigue, nay that he had heard it ſaid, that bating the Treaty of <hi>Spain</hi> the King was privy and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in all he had done; that he told him not this to Extenuate his fault, but to make him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that having offended his Eminency more than any Body, 'twas to him particularly they addreſs'd themſelves for the obtaining of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; that as to the Treaty of <hi>Spain,</hi> it wou'd not be found he had thereunto conſented; that <hi>Fontrai'lles</hi> had indeed declar'd him to be one of thoſe that were to ſerve for Lieutenant Generalls in the Duke of <hi>Orlean's</hi> Army, but had not ſaid he had ſent him to make propoſals on his part; that it was the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> who had done all things of his own Head, and to whom the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with forreigners ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. The Cardinal ſeeing the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> did not come to his Bow, thought fitting to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him, and askt how he wou'd reconcile what he ſaid with the Promiſe his Brother had made of delivering up his Town of <hi>Sedan</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> and his Partizans. But as the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was preparing his Reply, he interrupted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and told him, that this Place had made his Brother ſo often faulty; that it would ſtill ſerve him for an Inſtrument to Commit new Crimes; that the King cou'd never put any Confidence in him, or any Prince as long as they had ſuch a Town as that at their Diſpoſal; that it was the Sanctuary of Rebells, and ſurpaſs'd ev'n <hi>Rochelle,</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:57147:82"/>
that had only afforded a Retreat to thoſe of the Religion; but that as for <hi>Sedan,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> offer'd it indifferently to all manner of People, ſufficiently manifeſting by his Conduct that his thoughts were wholly bent upon embroiling the State. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> did not ſeem to underſtand his meaning, and being withdrawn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having obtain'd any thing in his Brother's behalf, he again preſented himſelf to the King to implore his Mercy; but the King with a ſtern and angry countenance turn'd his back upon him, after having told him, he wonder'd he durſt importune him upon ſuch an Account as that. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the Interim having ſent a Gentleman on that purpoſe to Court, had no other anſwer ſave obliging words in what related to himſelf, but as to what concern'd <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon</hi> he had for anſwer, the Court was very ſorry he could not have granted him what he demanded, and colour'd their Refuſal with the ſame Pretexts that had been ſo amply deduc'd to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> This Prince preſented himſelf dayly to the Cardinal, but this Miniſter ſeem'd to him more reſerv'd, nay and of more difficult acceſs, ſo as that he plainly ſaw the Court had ſet <hi>Sedan,</hi> as the rate of his Brother's Pardon. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> lay perdue, as I may ſay, as to this Affair; they had made a Thouſand plauſible tenders to <hi>Madam de Bouillon:</hi> But this Princeſs having nothing Dearer then the Life of her Husband, had been advis'd to reject them all, and to loſe rather her fortune than to ſee ſo Dear a Prince periſh. At length as ſhe waver'd between the love of her Husband and the love of her Children, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt did not ſuffer her to diveſt her ſelf of her Sovereignty, ſhe had notice that <hi>Cinqmars</hi> and <hi>de</hi>

The Cardinal, who had ever made him a very Civil Reception, was neither more or leſs Courteous at this offer, tho' Extremely acceptable to him. Yet being full of Diſſimulation, he made him anſwer that he knew not whether the King wou'd be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, as being extremely exaſperated againſt <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon;</hi> that in the fear of a refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal he was willing to tell him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as making Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being his Friend, that it became him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all ſorts of Recommendations in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and particularly that of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for whom the King had much regard. The Viſcount <hi>de Turrenne</hi> thought it ſtrange he ſhou'd now make a Difficulty, after the knowledge he had giv'n him of his Intentions; but as there was a Neceſſity of Submitting to the Law of the Conquerours, he was oblig'd to ſend the Second time into <hi>Holland,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> once more to make that ſtep. This Prince entertaining an Affection for the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> he having born Arms under him for ſeveral years together, and whom, as a man may ſay, he look'd on a his foſter-Son, having paſs'd o're all ſorts of Conſiderations in favour of ſo Dear a Perſon, and who, beſides, was his ſo near Relation, granted the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> what he demanded of him, and having ſent again a Gentleman into <hi>France,</hi> they wou'd fain make him believe it to be upon his Recommendation, rather than on any
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57147:83"/>
Other account, they granted the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> his pardon. But not a Man but believ'd the contrary, nay, and openly affirm'd <hi>Cinqmars</hi> to have been very unfortunate in not having had ſuch a Place as <hi>Sedan</hi> to redeem his Life.</p>
            <p>The matter being thus terminated with ſo much trouble, the World believ'd this to be capable of making the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> go ſerve in ſome Foreign Countrey: But this Prince ſeeing his family Extremely under the Hatches, on the Contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd his Zeal for the Crown, hoping in time to oblige the King to diſtinguiſh it. However, he had great Mortifications, for his Brother having loſt his Sovereignty, it ſeem'd as if his rank wou'd have been diſputed which he had acquir'd by his Birth: Such as gave him the hand before, pretended now to take Place of him, or at leaſt to be conſider'd as his Equals; Theſe Conteſts aroſe principally at Court, ſo as that he ſtaid there the leaſt he could, for at the Army the rank was regulated by the Charges, and he did not look on it as ſtrange to Obey a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> it ever having been the Practiſe. However, he found much had not yet been done for him, ſince Bodys apart had been giv'n to Perſons of neither more merit nor more Service. He above all wiſht to Command in <hi>Germany,</hi> where it ſeem'd to him War was better made than in any other Place whatever: But tho' the Court had born him ſome good will, yet what had newly befall'n him, muſt needs diſcard all his hopes. And indeed they were far from conſiding in him ſuch a Command as that, after ſo freſh a fault. Yet he deſir'd it that he might ſignalize his fidelity, and told his Friends, this to be the principal reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. As it cou'd not be but that he muſt have ſome Pique againſt the Cardinal, of whom he had
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57147:84"/>
not ſo kind an Opinion, but that he imputed to him the misfortune of his Houſe, it goar'd him to the very Heart to be oblig'd to remain under the Command of the Mareſchal <hi>de Meilleraye,</hi> who was another Cardinal to the Viſcount. He wonder'd that the King notwithſtanding the ſuſpicions he had againſt this Miniſter, left all his Armies under the Command of his Relations, as if there had been none in the Kingdom capable of that Employment, for the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> commanded one, as I have allready ſaid, the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> who had marry'd one of his near Kinſwomen another, and tho' he had behav'd himſelf ſo ill at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Honnecourt,</hi> as has been before obſerv'd, this did not prove ſufficient to deprive him of his Charge. But the point the moſt extraordinary in all this, is that the King himſelf knew that during his illneſs before <hi>Perpignan,</hi> all theſe Generalls had made Cabals in their Armies to maintain their Kinſman in the Miniſtry, ſo as by that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty might judge how faſt they were link'd to the Cardinal's Service, ſince to the prejudice of all Tyes and Duties, their whole Endeavours had been how to preſerve the Authority their family ſtood poſſeſs'd of. Not but that he did juſtice to Each ſutably to his Deſerts, he was the firſt to ſay that the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> had a great deal of Wit, that <hi>la Meilleraye</hi> underſtood ſieges to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> tho' None of the Moſt Conſummated of all Men in the Trade, had a Courage that render'd him recommendable above the Greateſt Captains. And indeed this Prince had ſtill done things in this Campagne, which had been very glorious, tho' not allways attended with a proſperous Succeſs. He Commanded in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as I have already ſaid, and had found it ſomewhat a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult

The truth is <hi>Melo</hi> had been faulty, being not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with to joyn the Imperiall Troupes that acted towards the <hi>Rhine.</hi> But this did not at all leſſen this Prince's Glory, who had ever Exerted the ſame ſteddyneſs, and who not being in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to venture a Battle, had done ſo much by his Addreſs that he ruin'd the Enemies Army, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd from it before the year Expir'd, all that it had been able to take during the Compagne. Thus we may ſay that this year was a moſt Glorious one to <hi>France,</hi> as having reduc'd the Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the Obedience they ow'd their Sovereign, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> preſerv'd <hi>Catalonia;</hi> diſſipated Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick troubles, carry'd it's Arms, into the very Kingdom of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and in fine augmented it's Reputation in <hi>Germany,</hi> without ſo many ſucceſſes, having been Clouded with any conſiderable loſs, unleſs that of the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammonts.</hi> But this Defeat was nothing in Compariſon of that of General <hi>Lamboy,</hi> to whom the Count <hi>de Guebriant,</hi> who began to render himſelf famous in <hi>Germany,</hi> had deliver'd Battle, after having render'd himſelf Maſter of <hi>Orlinghen,</hi> tho' he ſaw himſelf threatned on another ſide by General <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Battle threatned the <hi>Suedes</hi> with a total Defeat, for while their Right Wing fought with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall advantage, their Left having loſt Colonel <hi>Sclang</hi> that Commanded it, wwre ſo diſheartned that they wou'd have never rally'd, if Count <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſmark</hi> had not haſten'd up to them, and done perſonal Wonders. Having thus reſtor'd Courage to thoſe that had loſt it, he caus'd a Body of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to advance, who turn'd the Victory on his ſide, which ſeem'd as yet unwilling to declare it ſelf; The Arch-Duke with <hi>Picolomini</hi> betook themſelves to flight, and the Principall Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Army, ſome of whom however dy'd upon the Spott; all the Baggage was left to the <hi>Suedes</hi> with the Generalls Silver Service, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had enough to do to Eſcape in their own Perſons.

With this Exploit did they end the Campagne of 1642. But Seaſonable weather was no ſooner return'd then that they augmented their Conqueſts with the taking of <hi>Tornaw, Mellerſtald,</hi> and <hi>Melvick:</hi> Then they block'd-up <hi>Magdebourg</hi> and <hi>Oſtervic,</hi> and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd the City of <hi>Halberſtat;</hi> whoſe Garriſon they put to the Sword. <hi>Galas</hi> wou'd have ſtopp'd the Current of theſe Proſperities, but <hi>Oſtervic</hi> being the Cloſer ſhut up, this did not hinder it from falling alſo into their hands. In the mean while they fail'd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ſurprizing the Emperour himſelf as he was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57147:86"/>
coming to his Army, and if he had not turn'd out of his way, it had been a terrible augmentation to ſo many loſſes; but through a great happyneſs having avoided this Ambuſcade, he ſent his Troups againſt <hi>Olmutz,</hi> while theſe of the <hi>Suedes</hi> were Employ'd in taking of <hi>Demitz.</hi> The Army, we had in <hi>Germany,</hi> fought not with ſo much good luck, for it had been forc'd to detach a part to the Succours of the frontier of <hi>Champagne,</hi> then menac'd with an Army of five and twenty thouſand men Commanded by the Count <hi>de Fontaines,</hi> and the Enemies had ſtill another in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois</hi> which Employ'd the reſt of our forces. The Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> who had hitherto ſerv'd only as Volentier, but in whom was noted an Unparalell'd Courage, and a Conduct above his Age, was ſent againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the Duke of <hi>Angoule'me</hi> obſerv'd the other with a flying Camp. Neither the One nor Other had found Occaſion to do any great matter, but the Count <hi>de Fontaines</hi> having beleaguer'd <hi>Rocroy,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> march'd againſt him, and having giv'n him Battaile, he won ſo ſignal a Victory, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> cou'd not of a long while recover it. The Count <hi>de Fontaines</hi> was kill'd in that action, all his Infantry cut in Peices with part of the Horſe, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in ſuch Diſorder that much ado had it to ſcape. Then the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> without trifling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his time turn'd his Armes againſt the frontier of <hi>Germany,</hi> and having open'd himſelf a paſſage by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Thionville</hi> and <hi>Cirq,</hi> he march'd to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of the Mareſchal <hi>de Guebriant,</hi> then penn'd up between the Troups of <hi>Bavaria</hi> &amp; thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Enemies not daring to ſtay his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, he re-inforc'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Guebriant's</hi> Army, and this having enabl'd this Mareſchal to make Enterprizes, he beleaguer'd <hi>Rotwiel,</hi> where he was wounded with a faulcon Canon Bullet, whereof

His Death was follow'd with a ſad Event, the Army that had a Wonderfull Opinion of him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt all manner of Confidence after his Death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to <hi>Teutling,</hi> after having however taken <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiel,</hi> and ſuffer'd it ſelf to be Surpriz'd in it's Quarters by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who gave it a Total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat.</p>
            <p>In the mean while great Alterations occurr'd at Court, where Cardinal <hi>Richelicu</hi> dy'd the year laſt paſt, and the King on the fourteenth of <hi>May</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Nought but Cabals were then on foot, who ſhou'd have the Regency, and after the Example of the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> where the Unckles had ſided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Nephew, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was juſt ready to ſet the State in a Combuſtion. Not but that the King had ſettl'd all things before he dy'd; but none were pleas'd with his laſt Will, becauſe he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the Power of thoſe to whom he attributed ſome Authority. The Queen his Widdow, being vext that he had ty'd her hands, ſaid openly, that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours were rather appointed Her, than ſhe Elected the King her Son's Tutour, and with Deſign of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving His Will broken, ſhe was liberall of her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes now to One, then to Another, and Eſpecially to the Parliament that had much Power at that time. <hi>Mazarin</hi> who had render'd himſelf recommendable by ſeverall Services he had done in <hi>Italy,</hi> and had been made Cardinal at the late King's Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was in her Confidence, with the Biſhop of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vais.</hi> But this Biſhop being not a man of Sufficient ability to Support the Burden of Affairs, the Other Supplanted him quickly, and govern'd the Queen's mind at his Pleaſure. At length the Queen having found the means by her Addreſſe to Extend her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, thought her ſelf oblig'd to gain Creatures, and having a moſt peculiar Eſteem for the Viſcount

               <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſhe made him Marcſchal of <hi>France.</hi> This Prince return'd into <hi>Italy</hi> after his Brothers Buſineſs, and had ſo won the heart of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> that he undertook nothing without him; Inſomuch that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advis'd him to the Siege of <hi>Villeneuve d'Aſt,</hi> the Troupes had forthwith Order to march thither. This Town made but a ſorry Reſiſtance, after which they march'd againſt <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and havi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To decoy him on to this Deſign, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating to him the means, ſome Interval was left between the Quarters, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having ſlipt between, imagin'd they had gain'd a mighty point, but their Enemies fell immediately upon <hi>Trin</hi> then unfurniſh'd of men, and where accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all appearances they could meet with no great oppoſition. Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> finding himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd at the very beginning of the Siege, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the care of it to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who was wonderfully well ſeconded by the Count <hi>du Pleſſis.</hi> All the Out-works were won with much Vigour, and the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> deſpairing of being able to Succour it, march'd towards <hi>Aſt,</hi> and <hi>Nice,</hi> thinking that the jealouſly this wou'd give him, wou'd oblige him to raiſe the Siege. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having provided againſt that by ſending a Reinforcement to thoſe Garriſons, purſu'd battering the Town ſo briskly, that it Surrender'd upon Compoſition. This was the laſt Enterprize he was preſent at in <hi>Italy,</hi> for having been made Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal of <hi>France</hi> a little afore, and receiv'd the Staff, he left the Army under the Orders of the Count <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> whoſe Right it was to Command it.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Illneſs ſtill Continu'd, and though
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57147:87"/>
he remain'd in the Camp till the Town was taken, he had now left it for the better Convenience of his Cure. The Count <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> who was already very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the trade of War, meaning to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Seaſon, which allow'd him ſtill the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for ſome Enterprize, he ſat down before <hi>Ponteſture,</hi> and having batter'd it with twelve pieces of Canon, the Beſeiged Surrender'd it after having done all in their Power for a Stout Defence. Theſe Succeſſes were ſtill Seconded by Others, which we had in <hi>Catalonia</hi> by the valour and Conduct of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> which gave ſo much alarum to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he reſolv'd to go himſelf unto his Army: But his Catholique Majeſtie's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence having not been able to repair his Loſſes, His Councell thought it wou'd leſſen his Honour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there any longer, ſo as that he return'd to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> very little Satisfy'd with the pains he had taken. This Year was there allſo an Engagement ſought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fleets of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in which all the Advantages fell on our ſide. But notwithſtanding all theſe happy Events, We ſaw our ſelves dayly threatned with a ſtrange Revolution thro' the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Grandees, and the Audaciouſneſs of the Parliaments, that under Pretence of the Publique Good, made ſuch Continuall Uſurpations, as were no longer in the Power of the Queen Mother to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, for at leaſt without ſuffering her Son to fall under the ſame Deſtiny with the King of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> whom the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> Aim'd at Robbing of his Crown, as they at Length robb'd him of his Life, ſhe was timely to oppoſe all theſe Innovations that were odious to all Honeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <hi>Rhin,</hi> without a Head, without Arms, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other Reputation than that of being the wretched Remains of an Army, formerly the terrour of the whole Empire, for in truth theſe were the men, with whom the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> acquired ſo much Glory, and the Mareſchal <hi>de Guebriant</hi> had render'd himſelf ſo recommendable.

But to leave this point, the buſineſs now being to Supply a Place that had been poſſeſs'd by two ſuch great men, the Queen-Mother made choice of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to the Great Contentment of the Army, and of the Princes ally'd to the Crown, to moſt of whom he had the Honour of being related by his Mother's ſide. As ſoon as he had been nominated to that Employment, he repair'd immediately to the frontiere, where he found things in ſo bad a poſture, as required his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Conduct to reſtore them to any good eſtate: But as nothing ſeem'd to him impoſſible when the Kings Service was the point in agitation, he Surmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Obſtacles by his Cares and Patience, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all began to Change face: The greateſt Difficulty was to find Money to Cloath the Souldiers then ſtark naked, for thro' the Diſorder the Court was in at that time, it had been forc'd to beſtow its Liberalities on the ſeveral Parties, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Miſchief had incapacitated it ſelf from remedying what was moſt preſſing. Beſides Cardinal
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57147:88"/>
               <hi>Mazarin</hi> having got an Abſolute Aſcendant over the Queen, had laviſht the Moneys in the Treaſury to gain Creatures to himſelf, and ſhe was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd in his favour, that ſhe imagin'd it to be for the Intereſt of the State, tho' it was only for the private Intereſt of the Miniſter. Thus all theſe Diſorders having reduc'd the Army in <hi>Germany</hi> into the Pittious Eſtate I have newly Repreſented, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was oblig'd to borrow a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum upon his own Credit, and making alſo uſe of ſome Money which the Queen-Mother had made him a Preſent of before his Departure, he laid out both in Cloathing the Souldiers and in the Other Neceſſities of the Army. This once done, he caus'd it to paſs the <hi>Rhin,</hi> as believing that after what had happen'd the Year afore, it behov'd the Kings Reputation, and principally of his Minority, to re-incourage his Allyes, who ſeem'd ſtill all in a maze at the laſt Defeat. Now to make a powerfull Diverſion, the Queen-Mother wiſht that the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> would likewiſe repair to the frontier of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the whole Streſs of the War was like to be; not but that ſhe likewiſe meant to make ſome effort againſt <hi>Flanders,</hi> but ſhe cou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d in no wiſe decline promiſing the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Arms on that ſide, and he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preparing to take the Field at the head of an Army of Twenty Thouſand men. The Siege of <hi>Gravelines</hi> had been reſolv'd on at <hi>Paris,</hi> for which reaſon he directed his way thither after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving detach'd the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> to ſecure the Paſſage, and take in ſome Forts that might be ſome Obſtruction to his Enterprize, that of <hi>Gaiette</hi> was won firſt, and by that means did they cut off from the Enemies the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>St Omer,</hi> and procur'd that with the

Mareſchal <hi>de Gaſſion,</hi> who was hovering up and down with a flying Camp. Thoſe of <hi>Gravelines</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by this ſtep perceiv'd the Deſign to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd upon them, let open their Sluyces: But the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> having found the means to draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off the Water, inveſted the Place on all ſides, and had his Canon brought up with much Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, for the ground being thus ſoak'd, ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Horſes, and they were ſo tyr'd that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd twice the ordinary number.

the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> himſelf, prompted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance by theſe Examples, or perhaps allſo becauſe his Father was not over-Liberal, had not been ſo ſtrongly affected with Glory, to which nevertheleſs he was very ſenſible, as to be prevail'd with to be gone without that Miniſters having giv'n him wherewithall to ſupply to a Great Expence. Thus all the Treaſures were for theſe Three Princes, and as the Cardinals own affairs were not in over-good terms, and that he had as good an Appetite as Others, he on his ſide appropriated to himſelf all he could; Inſomuch that the finances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus unprofitably Squander'd away, recourſe was to be had to Edicts, which made the People Clamour, and render'd his Miniſtry Extremely Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Not a man of 'em beſides the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> who Neglecting his own Intereſts, only Study'd thoſe of the Crown, tho' the Conſideration he was in, might have made him hope as well as Others to have gain'd by the Weakneſs of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, for the Grandees after the Example of the Princes ſet their Services at a Price, and in Caſe the leaſt Neglected, they fell into Caballs, which made the Cardinal quickly recall them, with a grant of ſtill more than they had demanded. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> after having obtain'd what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd was departed for the Army, and having caus'd it to paſs the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> he joyn'd the Count <hi>de Marſin,</hi> who brought him a Conſiderable re-inforcement.

Being how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a thing for which there was no Remedy, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd with the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to ſee what courſe was thereupon to be taken, and Comforting one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in that it was neither of their faults, they went together to view the Enemies, who upon the rumour of the Duke <hi>d'Anguien's</hi> arrival were Encamp'd upon two Mountains, whoſe Acceſſe, though Difficult of itſelf, was render'd ſtill more ſo by ſeveral Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by the Trees they had fell'd to Embaraſſe the ways. But all theſe Empediments having rather Whetted than paul'd their Courage, the Duke <hi>d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi> ſent <hi>Marſin</hi> order, with whom he had left his Army, to bring it him with all Expedition. Hardly would he allow it a day or two's Reſt after ſo long a March, and as if he had been afraid the Enemies ſhou'd have ſcap'd him, he lead it himſelf on to the Battle, which was long and obſtinate on both ſides. The Enemies truſting in the ſtrength of their Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Scituation of their Camp, ſeem'd at firſt to make a mock of the efforts he made, but coming to perceive that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> after having made himſelf Maſter of a Wood which they had lin'd with Infantry, came to attack them thorough a Place not ſo difficult, they caus'd their Horſe to march, which Stop'd our foot that had paſs'd ſooner than our Cavalry, by reaſon the Wood was fill'd with trees and Ditches that hamper'd the ways. The night coming on hinder'd things from proceeding farther: The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſpent that time in paſſing the Cavalry, which he had drawn up in <hi>Batalia</hi> at Break of Day. But the Enemies making uſe of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Conceal their Rerreat, abandoned their Camp, without having had time to break their Baraques, or Carry away a thouſand Conveniences we found there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57147:91"/>
both for Men and Horſes. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuffer'd his Army there to reſt, after being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly tyr'd and harraſs'd with the Buſineſs of the day before, by reaſon of the Continuall Rains, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again at Break of day, with a reſolution to purſue the Enemies, who were retreated near to <hi>Fribourg.</hi> He found they had Choſen an Advantageons Poſt, which caus'd him to make a halt before he attack'd them. But as he was Squaring his Meaſures by the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> and ſome Other Officers Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Souldiers fell a Skirmiſhing, and had ſo far engag'd into a Battle, as wou'd have render'd it impoſſible to have avoided it, if the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> to hinder the Diſorder which began to appear among our men, had not plac'd himſelf at the head of the Regiment of <hi>Flex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The vigour wherewith he broke in among them made them return into their Retrenchments, out of which they came in hopes of an impending victory. Things being thus retriev'd as well as cou'd be deſir'd, the Reſolution was to attack them in their very Camp; But we found the Paſſes ſo well intrench'd, that after having fought on till night, Our men were oblig'd to leave them at Quiet. Yet was this of no long Duration, For the Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> who delighted in Bloud, and was not daunted at the loſs he had ſuffer'd in that Occaſion, thinking it a leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Glory, if after having proſper'd ſo well in the Beginning, he deſiſted for ſo ſmall a matter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd his Camp to <hi>Landeſlinghen,</hi> that ſo by cutting-off their victualls they might quit ſo advantageous a Poſt. His hopes were not abortive, the Enemies coming quickly to be under all ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

them on the other, they were conſtrain'd to abandon their Canon, and make their Eſcape into the Mountains. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> having thus diſperſt their Army, would have retaken <hi>Fribourg,</hi> provided with a ſtrong Garriſon: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> remonſtrating to him that the Enemies had left unprovided all the Other Places to Secure that, perſuaded him to go rather to <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> which being ſtronger by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This was a ſufficient hint to a Prince, who valu'd nothing ſo much as things of great Renown, to Wing him to this Enterpriſe: He forthwith drew near that Place, and having beleaguer'd it, he had it ſurrender'd to him, after the Trenches had been twelve days open. This Conqueſt having been put into a Good Poſture, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> Advanc'd towards <hi>Worms,</hi> and after having beaten part of General <hi>Bek's</hi> Cavalry, he caus'd that Town to be Summon'd, which ſubmitted without ſtriking a Blow. From <hi>Worms</hi> he march'd againſt the City of <hi>Mayence,</hi> whoſe Electour had Embrac'd the Enemies ſide, and after having on his way reduc'd <hi>Oppenheim,</hi> he came before <hi>Mentz,</hi> allready inveſted by part of his Troups. The Electour, neither whoſe Will nor Character led him to be in a Town beſieged, had timely left it to retire to <hi>Cologne;</hi> He had Carry'd along with him, if it may be ſaid, the Courage of the Garriſon; ſo as the Chapter, that beſides had its Intereſts apart from thoſe of the Electour, ſent a Deputation to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> to deſire him not to ruine ſo fine a Town, when juſt ready to open its Gates to his Exeellency. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> in his Anſwer told thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties that he muſt allſo have put into his hands the City and Caſtle of <hi>Binghen,</hi> which the Chapter
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57147:92"/>
had under its Protection; and ſeeing that after ſome Conſults they had had with thoſe of the Town, they had at length thereunto conſented, he gave notice of all to the Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greedy of Honour, he might himſelf repair to the Camp, that the World might preſume his Highneſs to have made this Conqueſt. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were retreated to <hi>Heilbron,</hi> where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to re-inforce their Army: But the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours came in ſo ſlowly to them, that before they were in a poſture of forming any Enterprize, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had taken allſo <hi>Landa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Baccarach,</hi> with ſeveral Caſtles which ſecur'd all thoſe Conqueſts. But the haſt the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi> was in to go to Court to receive freſh Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes, having occaſion'd many to leave the Army, it became ſo Weak, that the Enemies were no longer afraid to ſhow themſelves. Whereupon they began to march after ſo long a repoſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attack'd <hi>Manhein,</hi> that had no more than Two Hundred Men in Garriſon, they carry'd it with Eaſe. This Succeſ having puff'd up their Courage, they conceiv'd a Deſign upon <hi>Spire,</hi> which open'd it's Gates to us before the Siege of <hi>Philipsbourg:</hi> But as this had been Suffering <hi>Philipsbourg</hi> to be block'd up on that ſide, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> did not content himſelf with putting Succours into that Place, but having alſo lin'd the Banks of the <hi>Rhin</hi> with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, he hinder'd the Paſſage of ſome Boates, that by the means of Certain Traytors in the Town, thought to have been receiv'd therein upon ſight. He likewiſe ſav'd <hi>Baccarach,</hi> threatned with ſuch another Enterprize; and as the Governour by his valour had afforded him time to come to it's Succours, he gave him two hundred Piſtols of his own money, and Writ to Court in his behalf: for this Prince had no greater
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57147:92"/>
Pleaſure than in procuring favours for thoſe whom he found Worthy of them; but he did theſe kind of things without affectation, vanity, or attributing to himſelf honour as moſt others do, ſo as that many found themſelves by him rewarded, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whom they had the obligation. Thus he rarely promis'd, but nevertheleſs employ'd his Offices as much as if he had promis'd, for he ſaid, that thoſe who promis'd with ſo much Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeem'd to Engage to bring that about which they had promis'd, which ought not to be done, unleſs it depends on one's ſelf. He ſaid further, that a man that had been amuz'd with ſpecious Promiſes, oftner blam'd him that had engag'd to be his Interceſſor, than him in whoſe Diſpoſall the favour he demanded lay, that this proceeded from the fault of a Certain Number of Perſons, whoſe Character was to promiſe lightly, or not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what they had promis'd.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Enemies having miſs'd of <hi>Spire</hi> and <hi>Baccarach,</hi> as I have newly ſaid, attempted <hi>Creuſenach,</hi> which the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had in like manner reduced to his Obedience: But he being on his march to relieve it, they paſs'd the <hi>Mein,</hi> and went and beleaguer'd <hi>Hochſt,</hi> a ſmall Place in Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſes</hi> Arms, a Prince in our Allyance. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid it was not in a Poſture of making a Defence, haſten'd to its Relief, but having Notice on the Way of its being allready Surrender'd, he turn'd his Arms againſt <hi>Gernſheim,</hi> which compenſated him for that loſs. He wanted nothing more now to Compleat ſo Glorious a Campagne, than to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Enemies again, which he wiſht above all things, as Phancying whatever Glory he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd at the Defeat of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and <hi>Lorrainers,</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:57147:93"/>
the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> had robb'd him of part of it, being Commander in Chief of the Army. Nothing did it avail his telling himſelf, that that Prince being ſtill Young and with ſmall Experience, the World would do him ſo much Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lice as to believe, that he had Contributed at leaſt as much as his Highneſs, to ſo many Great Succeſſes, but this was not capable of Satisfying him; he told him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo at the ſame time, that this Prince was one of the braveſt Princes in the World, and that his Bravery had perhaps produc'd all theſe Great Events; he remember'd to have ſeen him all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Fire in the Midſt of the Enemies, and he had often been more afraid for him in thoſe Perils he ſaw him Expoſe himſelf to, than he could hope to ſee him come Happily off; For as he was one that moſt admir'd that Young Princes Virtue, the Affection he had ever had for his Highneſs, was improv'd to ſo high a Pitch, that he could not have had more for a Son. Not that withall this there was any great Sympathy of Humour between them. The Dake <hi>d'Anguien</hi> lov'd all ſorts of Pleaſures, ev'n to becoming the Slave of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs; whereas the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s whole Delight Conſiſted in his Duty. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> was Cholerick and full of Fire; the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne,</hi> Mild and Temperate. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> Eloquent, and a great Talker; the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſpoke little, and had, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, ſome difficulty to Expreſs himſelf: In ſhort, they had no affinity but that they were both Brave and Cool in Command: but otherwiſe ſo different of Humour, that People had reaſon to Wonder how that Nature having made them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo unlike, had nevertheleſs giv'n them two Qualities ſo reſembling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:57147:93"/>In vain did the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſeek out the Enemies: their precaution to ſhun Meeting him, was greater than his Cunning to find them out; ſo as that fearing to loſe his time, if he perſever'd in his Deſign, he drew near <hi>Philipsbourg</hi> that ſtood in Want of Sundry Neceſſaries; He had there a World of Propoſalls made him on the behalf of the Grandees of the Kingdom, who being diſſatisfy'd with Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> ſought to wreſt new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from his Eminency, by making themſelves formidable; but nothing being ſo Dear to him as his Duty, he wou'd not give the leaſt hearing to any of their Offers, tho' they would have aſſur'd him of vaſt Penſions, and promis'd him a thouſand fine things capable of ſtaggering another's fidelity. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> aſſiſting allſo in the Attacque, offer'd him great Advantages, and endeavour'd to Engage him thro' the Reſentment they fancy'd he could not otherwiſe than harbour for the Concerns of <hi>Sedan,</hi> but his anſwer to him who broke their buſineſs to him was, that in caſe he was ever urg'd upon the like point again, he wou'd make him that did it from ever more being capable of making ſuch like Propoſitions. Yet he knew not whether he ought to mention theſe ſorts of things to the Queen-Mother, having no proofs in hand, and fearing he might be fac'd down into a Lye, for he ſuſpected the Greateſt of the Kingdom to be tampering in this Intrigue, &amp; his Suſpition reach'd even as far as the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> And indeed that Prince, leſs to content his own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition that that of his favourits, was not ſatisfy'd with the Place he held in the Council, and though it was the firſt, yet he had it buzz'd in his Ears, that while the Cardinal left his Royal Highneſs the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Badges of Authority, he attributed it all to himſelf. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> on his ſide, though he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57147:94"/>
accumulated immenſe Riches, found fault if he was refus'd the leaſt thing either for himſelf or his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and wou'd have liſten'd to any ſort of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall that tended to render him ſtill more powerfull than he was. The Cardinal was very much at a plunge how to buoy himſelf up amid ſuch ſelf-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt'd and ſuch Turbulent Spirits, and all his Policy tended only to make the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and then again the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a fair opportunity to do their Buſineſs amid all theſe Diviſions. And indeed the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being unwilling to let ſlip ſuch an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as this, return'd himſelf into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where he beleaguer'd <hi>Lerida,</hi> which the Mareſchal <hi>de la-Mothe</hi> try'd in vain to Succour: A part of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was there defeated; but this having not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that Mareſchal from undertaking to beſiege <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragona,</hi> he was alſo compell'd to raiſe that Siege, which a little leſſen'd the ſame he had acquir'd in that Country. Yet ſome there were who found he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for doing what he did. For beſides that His Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Majeſty had forces infinitely above his and that it was not ſafe ſtaying his Coming, he was afraid leaſt that King might have ſome Deſign upon <hi>Barcelona</hi> or upon <hi>Balaguier,</hi> and that it wou'd be too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs it if he ſtay'd any longer before <hi>Terragona.</hi> Be it as it will, the Court impoſing to him thoſe unhappy Events, ſent the Count of <hi>Harcourt</hi> in his Room, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that after the Glory he had acquired in <hi>Italy,</hi> his bare name wou'd be capable of Creating a Terrour in the Enemies. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not altogether ſo happy beyond the Alpes, Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> though he had only a feeble Succours from us, ſuſtain'd the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> by his own Repute and Credit, Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that after having taken the Cittadel of <hi>Aſt,</hi> he laid Siege to <hi>Final,</hi> which, nevertheleſs, he cou'd not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57147:94"/>
take. As concerning <hi>Portugal,</hi> that had revolted, as I have already ſaid, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cou'd do no great matters there, becauſe that the Affairs of <hi>Catalonia</hi> having robb'd'em of many of their Meaſures, their Thoughts were wholly taken up how to reduce that Province to it's Obedience, preferably to all the Reſt. Thus the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who had been elected King by an Univerſal Conſent of all the People, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly making uſe of that Conjuncture to ſecure his Power, he diſperſt ſome Conſpiracies, which a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of love for the <hi>Spaniands</hi> had foſter'd in the hearts of ſome Perſons of Quality.</p>
            <p>The Beginning of the year 1645. was not over-propitious to <hi>France,</hi> nor to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> Who had ſtill the Command of the Army in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Efforts the Enemies had made on that ſide, having oblig'd him to paſs the Winter upon the <hi>Rhin,</hi> he was at a very great loſs how to provide for the Security of ſeverall Towns that were Equally threatned. Having nevertheleſs effected it by his Prudence, ſo much trouble under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone ſeem'd now to require his enjoying ſome Quiet, when that he had Notice that the Enemies were marching towards <hi>France,</hi> He immediately paſs'd the <hi>Rhin</hi> at <hi>Spire,</hi> hoping that if he cou'd poſſeſs himſelf of the Paſſes, they wou'd find it a hard matter to Execute their Enterprizes. It was now towards the End of Winter, which is very ſevere in thoſe parts, ſo as that an Army ſuffer'd much in a march long and difficult: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> Encouraging his Souldiers with his wonted Sweetneſs, made them find things leſs painfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he ſhar'd with them ev'n to the leaſt Inconveniencies: And indeed he would have 'em Want for Nothing, and Eſpecially recommended to the Quarter-Maſters, to take Care to pitch upon ſuch
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57147:95"/>
Poſts as where the Souldiers might be ſhelter'd, as far forth as the Place and Enemies would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; If he was oblig'd to make them Encamp he commonly Encamped with them, without making uſe of the Privilege of a General, for his Opinion was, that for the well diſciplining of an Army, the Head muſt Serve it for an Example: When there was a Want of Victualls he wou'd have it appear upon his Table, tho' his Men could have got for him in ſufficient Abundance; he ſaid it was not juſtice he ſhou'd feaſt, while others endur'd Thirſt and Hunger; that would to God he cou'd afford them all ſuſtenance by abſtaining himſelf from Eating; that this would be the moſt gratefull thing to him in the World, ſince to him nothing ſeem'd Good, as long as he knew them in Indigency. Thus in thoſe times of Miſery and Affliction, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever long the march might be, he never ſtopp'd to Eat; he ſaid that one ought to ſpare the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers a ſight that render'd them ſtill more ſenſible of their Misfortunes; that a man that was Hungry, was ſtill more Hungry when he ſaw Others Eat, and ſince he partook with them the Honour which redounded from their Actions, it was but very juſt to partake their Pains and Miſeries: When it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that in thoſe Marches ſome Town or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, which he cou'd not oblige to Contribution, made him a Preſent, he refus'd it, ſaying, they wou'd pleaſe him more in beſtowing their Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon his Souldiers, who had more need of them. And that he might in ſome manner oblige them to it, he wou'd often come back again, for fear they ſhou'd forget his Recommendations: for tho' theſe ſorts of Preſents were commonly Chargeable to his Excellency, he had no longer that Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration when they tended to the Eaſe and Comfort
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57147:95"/>
of his Men. Eaſy it is to apprehend that by this ſort of Demeanour he gain'd their Love to Infinity; and indeed he might have led them to the further End of the World, without one of them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, for they were already perſuaded that he caus'd them not to take one needleſs ſtep. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving march'd near three weeks amid the Mountains, and during Continual Rains, and having Croſs'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Rivers, at length he found the enemies upon the Bank of the <hi>Nekre,</hi> who Changing the Deſign they had of attacking him into that of providing for their own Defence, they retreated into the Mountains. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to whom Nothing cou'd have happen'd more agreeable, ſince it was Sufficient for him to have Croſs'd their Enterprizes, fancy'd however that to hinder them from returning he ought to paſs the River, and falling upon their heels he purſu'd them without Intermiſſion. At length his Army being almoſt haraſt off its Leggs, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to Stop; but that he might have certain news of what became of the Enemies, he detach'd Colonel <hi>Roſe</hi> after them, who ſtill follow'd them four whole Days. <hi>Roſe</hi> ſeeing he cou'd not overtake them, and contenting himſelf with having render'd an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> of what he had done, this Prince fancy'd he might ſend his Troups into Quarters; but being far from ſuſpecting any Surprize, the Enemies return'd back at the ſame time with <hi>Roſe,</hi> and falling upon him when he leaſt expected it, they found his Quarters here and there diſpers'd, ſo as that they had him at a Cheap Rate. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> who had plac'd his Head-Quarters at <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endal,</hi> being Surpriz'd at ſuch unexpected Tydings, thought it became him to advance to receive his Troups, to whom he ſent orders to repair to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rendezvouze; but accordingly as they came
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57147:96"/>
thither, as they were but in a ſmall number, they were defeated before they cou'd joyn together, and what might have eſcap'd by flight, knew not whither to run, the Enemies having ſeiz'd on the Paſſes. This put the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> into an inconceivable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: Yet the vaſtneſs of the Danger having not, bereft him of his judgement, he held firm at a Defile, and having thereby giv'n ſome Runnaways the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to joyn him, he march'd again to <hi>Mariendal</hi> where he had left the better part of his Infantry: The Woods and the Night favour'd his Retreat; however being briskly purſu'd he was forc'd to face about ſeveral times: but as his men were ſtill in a pannique terrour, he, with what Officers he had left, perform'd the Duty of a Sonldier, often fighting hand to hand, ev'n as far as the paſſage of the <hi>Mein,</hi> which he was the laſt that croſt. The Enemies then thinking it to be in vain for them to purſue him any further, fell upon the territories of the <hi>Lautgravinne</hi> of <hi>Heſſe</hi> our Ally, which oblig'd Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> then Employ'd againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> to quit the Siege of <hi>Rensbury,</hi> to come to her Succours: Nevertheleſs he left there General <hi>Wrangel</hi> then begnning to enter into ſome ſort of Repute: But whether that he had not Experience ſufficient to effect that Enterprize, or that Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> had left him too few forces, he was oblig'd to retreat from before him, after having loſt much time and many Men. This defeat brought not only this Prejudice to the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Affairs, but alſo hinder'd <hi>Tortenſon,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded another Body for them, from purſuing his Conqueſts with more effect. This General ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Won a great Battle at <hi>Janwitz</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> wherein He that Commanded the Emperours Army had been taken Priſoner, and Major-General <hi>Coentz</hi> kill'd, was fall'n upon <hi>Moravia,</hi> which he had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57147:96"/>
Conquer'd, ſaving the Caſtle of <hi>Brin;</hi> Nay, he had Extended his Conqueſts as far as the Gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> from whence the Emperour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for fear of a Siege: But upon the rumour of theſe Unhappy Succeſſes, he ſeem'd to loſe Heart at the ſame time the Garriſon of <hi>Brin</hi> recover'd Courage. The Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> himſelf, who pretended to joyn him, durſt not venture to enter any further into <hi>Hungary,</hi> where he had allready ſpread ſuch a Terrour, that they had remov'd from <hi>Presbourg</hi> the Regal Crown that is Wont to be put upon the Heads of the Kings of <hi>Hungary,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently after they have been rais'd upon the Throne; for thoſe People are ſo Superſtitious, that they'd imagine that Realm wou'd fall into the hands of Strangers unleſs they kept that Pledge, it being ſo Sacred among them, that they make their Happineſs or Unhappineſs therein to Conſiſt.</p>
            <p>While things were in theſe Terms in <hi>Germany, France</hi> endeavour'd to repair this Diſorder by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Advantages to it ſelf from another ſide, and ſutably as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> made his Greateſt Efforts to reduce <hi>Catalonia</hi> to its Duty, the <hi>French</hi> on their ſide did the like to foment the Rebellion in that Province. The Count <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> was order'd from <hi>Italy,</hi> with a part of the <hi>French</hi> Troups that had ſerv'd in that Countrey, ſo as that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> having now only very mean forces, ſaw himſelf reduc'd to ſtint his Enterprizes to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>la Roque de Vigevane. France</hi> brought two Other Armies beſides on foot; the One it deſign'd againſt <hi>Flanders;</hi> the Other againſt <hi>Germany,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reckoning a Flying Camp, Commanded by the Marquis <hi>de Villeroy.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had ſtill the Conduct of that of <hi>Flanders,</hi> for to amuze him with ſome vain appearance of Command, Cardinal
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57147:97"/>
               <hi>Mazarin</hi> had ſo Order'd matters with the Abbot <hi>de la Riviere,</hi> who rul'd him as he pleas'd, that he ſhou'd take the Government of Arms, while he left him the management of Affairs. This Prince thus feeding himſelf with the fumes foſter'd by his Favourite, was on his march into <hi>Flanders,</hi> while the Kingdom was left a Prey to that Miniſter, who dayly Empoveriſh'd it by New Edicts. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had the Mareſchal <hi>de Gaſſion</hi> for his Lieutenant-General, and being drawn near the Fort of <hi>Mardyk,</hi> he Won it after a Siege, wherein he loſt ſome men. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was in the mean while upon the Wing to Awe and Create jealouſy in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and one while making a ſhew as if he meant to attacque <hi>Bruges,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Other Place, he gave the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> all ſo the leiſure to take likewiſe the Fort of <hi>Link</hi> and <hi>Bourbourg.</hi> The Army ſtanding in need of ſome Repoſe after theſe laſt Conqueſts, at fifteen days end they took the field again, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſtill favouring our Deſigns, we took <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thune, Liſlers, St. Venant,</hi> and <hi>Armentieres.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being after this enclin'd to take a Turn to Court, being either diſpos'd to it of himſelf, or by his favourite who had a mind to wreſt ſome new kindneſs from the miniſter, left his Army in the hands of <hi>Gaſſion,</hi> and <hi>Rautzau</hi> who had been lately made Mareſchal of <hi>France;</hi> and theſe two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals to return the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> his Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, open'd to him the Paſſages for his going to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Hulſt,</hi> which he compell'd to Capitulate.</p>
            <p>As for the New Army going into <hi>Germany,</hi> the Cardinal put it under the Command of the Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> as he had done the Year afore: But tho' Affairs were preſſing on that ſide, this Duke had order to favour the Enterprizes of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57147:97"/>
of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> then buſy'd in reducing ſome Places in <hi>Lorrain</hi> that ſtill Obey'd their Natural Prince. For the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being aſham'd to ſuffer ſo many brave Men to Periſh without giving them Succours, he remounted all along the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> thinking that nothing wou'd oppoſe his Paſſage, but having met with the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> advantageouſly Encamp'd, he was forc'd to ſtop on a Suddain, and the Marquis <hi>de Villeroy</hi> in the mean while render'd himſelf Maſter of <hi>La Mothe,</hi> whoſe Governour had acquir'd much Honour by his Defence. This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair being thus compleated, the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> continu'd his Way, and was Urg'd to make the more haſt by the bad News which arriv'd every Moment: For beſides that, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <hi>Gernſheim,</hi> the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having joyn'd the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and the Troups of <hi>Heſſe</hi> after the Diſaſter that had befall'n him, was continually ſending him Word that he was ready to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by Both, Eſpecially by the Count <hi>de Coningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> who being wont to give much Licenſe to his Souldiers, could not keep them in Diſcipline, which the poſture Affairs were in at that time, did nevertheleſs require them to Obſerve. All theſe things were ſufficient enough, as a man may ſay, to give Wings to the Duke <hi>d'Anguien.</hi> Having thus march'd Day and Night, he us'd ſo much Diligence that he was but one days journey from the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who on his ſide drew near the <hi>Nekre</hi> where they were to joyn. The Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſecur'd <hi>Wiſloc</hi> on his Way, and having Conferr'd with the Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> they reſolv'd to paſs the River, tho' the Enemies all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appear'd on the Other ſide. But Coningſmark refuſing to fight under the Pretence of his being oblig'd to give <hi>Tortenſon</hi> Succours, who was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57147:98"/>
with two Armies, the Troups of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> after his Example, demanded in like manner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, which occaſion'd the Enterprize to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd. The Reſt of the Day and a good part of the Night was ſpent in gaining over <hi>Coningſmark,</hi> and the Officer that Commanded the Troups of <hi>Heſſe;</hi> but <hi>Coningſmark</hi> having ſhown himſelf inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, Ours durſt not attempt the Paſſage of the River, tho' the Troups of <hi>Heſſe</hi> offer'd to ſtay. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> was vext beyond imagination, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> no leſs ſo, tho' of a much more Temperate Humour, for he hoped this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion would afford him the means of Retaliation. But in ſhort there being no Remedy, they took leave of <hi>Coningſmark,</hi> and after that ſquar'd their Meaſures otherwiſe. <hi>Coningſmark</hi> being gone, they beleaguer'd <hi>Wemphem,</hi> and by taking it, which the Enemies could not prevent, became Maſters of a Paſs upon the <hi>Nekre,</hi> by which they intended to make themſelves a way into <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies needing their Forces to defend the entrance of their Country, dreading the fortune of the Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> wou'd not accept of the Battle he offer'd them, and having put ſome Troups into <hi>Dunkespiel,</hi> they retreated near to <hi>Norlinguen.</hi> The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> whom that Place had already af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded ſo much Glory, hoping that it was ſtill deſtin'd to acquire him freſh Lawrells, after having taken <hi>Rotembourg</hi> march'd to <hi>Dunkespiel,</hi> being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſinuate into the Enemies that he meant to faſten upon that Place: But paſſing on, all of a Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, he would have Surpriz'd them, if they had not happily met with a marſh behind which they drew themſelves up in Battalia. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> whoſe Courage was above all ſorts of Difficulties, wou'd needs fall upon that Poſt, whatever the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57147:98"/>
in attacking them: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having made him ſenſible that they could not ſtay long there, temper'd the furies of his Youth; ſo as that he reſolv'd upon driving them thence by famine. In the mean while he Caus'd his Canon to advance, and the Enemies having alſo pointed theirs, this Din laſted till night, and two or three hundred men were kill'd on either ſide. At the long run the want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions having, as the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had well foreſeen, oblig'd the Enemies to diſcamp, the Duke <hi>de Anguien</hi> fell upon their heels, and having overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them before they could reach <hi>Norlinguen,</hi> they drew up their Army in Batalia; after having ſeiz'd on a village, wherein there was a Competent ſtrong Caſtle, they put into't a good part of their infantry, and having plac'd their Cavalry behind, they Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd themſelves ſo much the more in ſafty, as that their Camp was upon two Mountains of Difficult acceſs, by reaſon of a Marſh on the one ſide, and a Wood on the Other. The Duke <hi>de Anguien</hi> after having view'd all theſe things gave the Command of his Right Wing to the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammons,</hi> and that of the Left to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and having reſolv'd to Cauſe the village to be attack'd, he caus'd a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to march thither led on by <hi>Marſin,</hi> that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd with great loſs; <hi>Marſin</hi> himſelf having been dangerouſly Wounded was oblig'd to retreat, and <hi>la Mouſſaye</hi> who had order to take his Room had not a better fortune. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> imagining all things were to Square with his Courage, march'd himſelf to ſee what was the matter, they went not better: But his Horſe having been kill'd under him, and having alſo receiv'd a Bruiſe, the Battle began to cool, when the' Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> found the means to paſs between the village and a Mountain; the Enemies Cavalry Seeing him coming endeavour'd
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57147:99"/>
to ſtop him, that he might remain expos'd to the firing of the village which took him in the Flank; but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> after having Chang'd his Horſe, his firſt having been wounded, receiv'd 'em ſo bravely, that he quickly made them betake themſelves to flight. <hi>Gleen,</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, was taken in that Occaſion. But General <hi>Mercy's</hi> Deſtiny was ſtill more Unhappy; for as he endeavour'd to ſuſtain the Battle with the Right Wing that had not yet buckl'd, he was kill'd ſtone Dead upon the Spot. The Officers Diſaſter drew on that of the Souldiers; Theſe wanting Leaders to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them, fought now no otherwiſe then in Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo as it was rather a Slaughter than a Battle, their Ordnance with moſt of their equipage was the Booty of the victours, and the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> not being of a humour; to let the fruit of his victory ſlip, Seiz'd on <hi>Norlinguen</hi> and <hi>Dunkespiel.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> whoſe ſtates were left as a Prey after the loſs of the Battail, had recourſe to the Emperour, of whom he demanded Succours with great importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Emperour fearing he might proceed to an accomodation with the enemies, who made him ſome Propoſals, caus'd Immediately the Arch Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> with <hi>Galas</hi> to march away; by this means <hi>Tortenſon</hi> found himſelf freed from fear, and continu'd with the more repoſe, but not with the more Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at the Siege of <hi>Brin.</hi> The Coming of Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> and of <hi>Galas</hi> gave Bounds to the Duke <hi>d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien's</hi> Conqueſts, who falling ſick beſides, had been Oblig'd to cauſe himſelf to be carry'd to <hi>Philipsburg.</hi> Before his Departure he Commanded the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> to whom he left the Conduct of the Army, to ſtand only upon the Defenſive, either that he had ſecret Orders from the Court, or that hoping to be Suddainly cured he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57147:99"/>
meant to reſerve all enterprizes to himſelf. But tho' he had not giv'n them theſe Orders, yet Prudence requir'd their not following any other Courſe; For the enemies were much ſtronger than we, ſo as that there was no other way to play the Game then that he directed: Thus after having put Men into <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſpiel</hi> and the Other Places we had taken, the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>de Gramount</hi> and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> march'd away for <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> and the Arch Duke thinking to engage them in a certain Occaſion that was favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, offer'd them Battle, which they were far from accepting, Seeing he could not oblige them to it, he himſelf drew near <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> but having found the place in too good a Poſture to dare to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeige it, and all the Paſſes on the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſo well guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he could not enter into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> he wheel'd about, and bent his Arms another way. The <hi>French</hi> Leaguer, being no longer under any Apprehenſions, for <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> Separated into two, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Mareſhal <hi>de Grammont</hi> and of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne;</hi> and this Prince, though weak, unwilling to loſe time, went and took <hi>Trier,</hi> while the enemies attack'd <hi>Dunkespiel,</hi> and <hi>Rotembourg;</hi> they alſo made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Wiſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k</hi> and <hi>Wimphem,</hi> ſo as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſeem'd to take delight in favouring ſometimes one ſide, and ſometimes t'other.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Catalonia</hi> only was it where ſhe appear'd the leaſt inconſtant; for the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into the Plain <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rgel</hi> to ſtop the enemies while the Count <hi>du Pleſsis</hi> perform'd the Siege of <hi>Roſes,</hi> ſhe declar'd her ſelf ſo far in his favour, that a man wou'd have ſaid ſhe had wedded his Party. In the mean while the enemies being very ſtrong cou'd hardly brook to be thus Check-mated, and made diverſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and not being paul'd by ill Succeſs in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, dayly undertook new matters. The King
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57147:100"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſtill at <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> from whence he preſs'd his Generals to open him the Paſſages, and as he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted his fortune, he had not dar'd to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into his Army, for fear of receiving ſome Affront. His Generals ſeem'd to participate in his fears, and ſeeing His Catholique Majeſty ſo wary, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the more Circumſpect in their Enterprizes. So as that the Count <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> availing himſelf of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays oblig'd the Town to Capitulate. The King to whom this Count had already render'd manyfold ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, made him Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; ſent him back into <hi>Italy,</hi> to ſtop Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Complaints, he not being over-well ſatisfy'd to be left thus without Succours: In the Interim the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having in this manner aſcertain'd the taking of <hi>Roſes,</hi> reſolv'd to Croſs the <hi>Segra</hi> whoſe paſſage the enemies defended. But as it was difficult to compaſs that Deſign in their Preſence, he ſent a detachment towards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mountains, where they were not upon their Guard, and this Detachment having paſs'd the River upon a Bridge of Boats, intrench'd it ſelf on the Other ſide, till the Reſt of the Army was come up. The enemies having had notice that part of the Army was already paſs'd, march'd that waywards, and having begun a Bruſh to hinder the Reſt from paſſing, they were repuls'd and purſu'd ev'n into the Plain of <hi>Liorens;</hi> the two Armies being there in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, the Conflict that had been only manag'd by Detachment became Generall; But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having again been beaten, betook themſelves to their heels, and made their eſcape by favour of the night. The Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> being encourag'd by ſo many happy Succeſſes, layd Siege to <hi>Belaguier,</hi> which had been Surrender'd to the enemies the year afore, and after having re-taken it, he return'd to <hi>Barcelona</hi> by reaſon of a Conſpiracy fram'd by the Baroneſs <hi>d'Alby,</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:57147:100"/>
a Woman of Great Beauty, with which ſhe allur'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People into her Intereſts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing themſelves worſted in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places, endeavour'd to retaliate in <hi>Portugal</hi> and in <hi>Italy;</hi> But the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> having made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion upon the Dominions of his <hi>Portugheze</hi> Majeſty, found more Difficulty than he had foreſeen, and the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> that had hoped to have had Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> at a cheap rate, ſaw himſelf fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of his expectation by the arrival of the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis.</hi> However the Governour not yet deſpairing of being able to impede their Junction, poſted himſelf upon the River of <hi>Mora,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poſſeſs'd himſelf of Certain Poſts made head againſt Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> while that on another ſide Endeavours were us'd to ſtop the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis;</hi> But that Prince labouring under a want of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made an Effort to get open the Paſſage, and behav'd himſelf ſo Valiantly in that occaſion, that the <hi>Spaniſh Troups</hi> were put to the Rout. After this there being nothing more to hinder his joyning with the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> he met him on the Way; this Mareſchal having on his ſide done all in his Pow'r to come up to ſhare with him in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of that Day.</p>
            <p>The War that was ſpread in ſo many Places during the year afore, ceas'd in ſome by the Peace, made between the Emperour and the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and between <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> But it continu'd with more force in other Places, becauſe that the Troupes of the Emperour and of the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> being re-united Each to their Party, ſeveral Bodies of them were formed, which carry'd the War into ſo many Parts, that not a Place was there but became a Bloody Theatre; the Winter it ſelf, a time that ſeems
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57147:101"/>
deſtin'd for repoſe, was ſpent in making divers enterprizes, as if the other Seaſons had not been ſufficient. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> impatiently ſupporting the taking of <hi>la Roque de Vigevane,</hi> from whence excurſions were made as far as <hi>Milan,</hi> laid Siege to that Place, and continuing their Attacks, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the bitterneſs of the Cold made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of that Faſtneſs. This enterprize having been begun towards the end of the Year 1645. and compleated at the beginning of the Year following, far from diſheartning Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſtimulated him to take his Revenge upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and having taken a turn to <hi>Paris,</hi> he prevail'd with the Court to ſend a Fleet into <hi>Italy,</hi> to favour a certain Deſign he had upon the Coaſts of <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> But fearing leaſt this might alarum the Grand-Duke, he had the Secret imparted to him, and a Bargain was ſtruck up with his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he ſhould not give any Succours to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Court having thus ſettled matters on that ſide, the Duke <hi>de Brezé,</hi> Admiral of <hi>France</hi> and Brother in Law to the Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> put to Sea with a Fleet, while Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> bent his March to <hi>Orbitella,</hi> which place he had taken a Reſolution to beleaguer. This Town could not be Releiv'd by Land ſave by the Forces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples;</hi> but this Succours being ſlow and beſides very uncertain, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſſembl'd Ships, and made in the interim ſome Attempts with the Garriſons of <hi>Porto-Ercole</hi> and of other Forts they held in thoſe parts. <hi>Carlo de la Gatta</hi> being in the place, perform'd on his part all that cou'd impede the Approaches, and having by his Bravery ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out things into a Length, the Fleet put to Sea, and the Succours departed from <hi>Naples,</hi> but in ſo Scanty a Number, that according to all Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57147:101"/>
they were not much to be rely'd on. The Fleet being ready before the Succours, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> offer'd an Engagement, and the Duke <hi>de Brezé</hi> being Young and deſirous to ſignalize himſelf, having met them half way, they fought on both ſides with great Courage. At length the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not being able to reſiſt the <hi>French</hi> Fury, thought of nothing now but of retreating, and wou'd perhaps have been maul'd in ſo doing, but that, by good luck for them, the Duke of <hi>Brezé</hi> was kill'd by a Canon Bullet, which made the <hi>French</hi> not mind purſuing them. <hi>Carlo de la Gatta</hi> had no other hopes now but in the Succours of <hi>Naples,</hi> and which I have already ſaid to be ſo poor a bus'neſs, that he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of it much to his advantage: but the Iſſue of the Engagement that had been lately fought at Sea, having alarum'd the Neighbouring Princes, each of 'em under-hand augmented this Succours, and it prov'd ſo conſiderable before it came in the preſence of the Enemies, that <hi>Carlo de la Gatta</hi> might well entertain a better opinion of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fearing to be tax'd with too much Vanity. And indeed after having reſted a day or two, this Succours attack'd the Lines with ſo much Valour, as forc'd Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> to untrim the Trenches to line a Thouſand ſeveral places where the Enemies appeared: But <hi>Carlo de la Gatta</hi> laying hold of ſo favourable a time to make a Vigorous Sally, he drove out thoſe that were left in the Works, and having ſet fire to the Bavins and fill'd the Trench, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> had no other courſe to take than of making his Retreat.</p>
            <p>The ill Succeſs of this Enterprize gave ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to <hi>France,</hi> that had found by this occaſion the little kindneſs the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> had for that Crown; and as Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> after this ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57147:102"/>
ſlighted by his Adherents, and that his Deſpair was capable of hurrying him to great Extremities, it was reſolv'd that a New Effort ſhould be made to endeavour a Diverſion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces that were preparing to find him Work ſufficient. The Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> had Order to fit out a New Fleet, and being embark'd he laid Siege to <hi>Piombino,</hi> where the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> came and joyn'd him with ſome <hi>French</hi> Troups. This Enterprize, being more Proſperous than that of <hi>Orbitella,</hi> repair'd in ſome manner our Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Italy;</hi> But the taking of <hi>Piombino</hi> having been follow'd with that of <hi>Porto-Longone,</hi> the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Neighbouring Princes was ſtronger than ever, fatal marks of which, had it been in their Pow'r, they would liberally have beſtow'don us.</p>
            <p>In the mean while tho' the War was carry'd-on with ſo much heat in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet did it in no wiſe cool in <hi>Flanders</hi> or in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was enter'd <hi>Flanders</hi> with an Army, containing the flow'r of the Troupes of the whole Kingdom, and had the Duke <hi>d'Auguien</hi> under him. The Principal Aim was upon <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and this Deſign had been Sufficiently manifeſted the year afore by the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes that had been made on that ſide; for which reaſon the Court of <hi>France</hi> had prevail'd with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> who had ſurpriz'd <hi>Tirlemont</hi> in the very heart of the Winter, that he wou'd ſend Ships before it, and into other parts where they might be requiſite. This Prince advanc'd himſelf in Perſon, fluſtering at a rate as if he meant to attack the Beſt Places, and thereby make a Great Diverſion, he gave the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> Means who was not yet willing to give vent to his Deſign, to go beſiege the City of <hi>Courtray:</hi> Having Secur'd that, he paſs'd the Canal of <hi>Bruges</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:57147:102"/>
and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> drawing near on that ſide, the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> went into his Camp with Six Thouſand Men. Thus the <hi>Spaniards</hi> imagining him as ready for any ſort of Attempt, were oblig'd to divide their forces; but the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> drawing near <hi>Mardik,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had recover'd the year afore, he laid ſiege to't. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> who Expos'd his Perſon as much as the Meaneſt Souldiers, ran there a riſque of his Life, and was wounded in ſeveral Places. In the Interim <hi>Picolomini</hi> endeavour'd to impede this Conqueſt as much as he could; but the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Croſſing his Deſign, he had the Vexation of not being able to effect his Ends. <hi>Mardyk</hi> being taken, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> return'd to Court, and the Duke <hi>d'Anguien,</hi> march'd againſt <hi>Berguen,</hi> which after he had taken he beleaguer'd <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The Siege of this Place, being a Sea-Port, at another time wou'd have Created much jealouſy in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and perhaps they wou'd have us'd their utmoſt endeavours to hinder it: But the Execrable Rebellion they were Engag'd in at that time, rendring them incapable of any other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, they with great Tranquillity beheld the Beginning, Proſecution and End of this Enterprize. The Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> having Compleated his Lines of Circumvallation, preſs'd the Town briskly, &amp; tho' <hi>Picolomini</hi> had laid all other Bus'neſs aſide, to attend the Relief of this Place, he took it, to the great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Strangers, who Expected this Place muſt have held out much longer. This Conqueſt augmented ſtill the Glory which that Prince had acquir'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Court had ſo much regard for him, as began to create a Jealouſy in the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> but as the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> had a Sly and Cunning Wit, he manag'd his Royal Highneſs ſo dexterouſly,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57147:103"/>
as that he removed all his Suſpitions. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> thinking to make advantage of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were under after this loſs, laid Siege to <hi>Venlo;</hi> but having undertaken it only to his own Confuſion, he Retreated into his own Country, while the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> had much ado to get into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The happy Succeſſes we had had in <hi>Flanders</hi> were a little tarniſhed by raiſing the Siege of <hi>Lerida,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and where he conſum'd many Men and much Mony. But the heat of the War was no where ſo manifeſt as in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> Prudence exerted it ſelf in many Inſtances: The <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> having had a little Reſpite by means of the Winter, endeavour'd to Emprove it to advantage, and as they were in their own Countrey, and had advantages the <hi>Suedes</hi> wanted, they retriev'd many Places in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and in other Provinces where they had been loſers. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being upon the <hi>Rhin,</hi> was too remote to give Succours to our Allyes, yet he endeavour'd as much as lay in him to oblige the Enemies to Divide their Forces; for which reaſon he now and then was Tampering in ſome petty Enterprize, and by that means kept 'em in Suſpence and Jealouſy: But in ſhort his Forces were not ſufficient to Archieve what he otherwiſe wou'd, he had but Six Thouſand Men both Horſe and Foot, and with ſuch a handfull he was not capacitated for any great matter. Thus having not been able to hinder the Enemies from taking their Quarters in <hi>Heſſe,</hi> this had Cut him off all Communication with the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and when the Seaſon came to prepare to take the field, he knew not what in the World to do to give them Succours: In the mean while, he was at a ſufficient Plunge himſelf how to be upon
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57147:103"/>
his Defence againſt the Surprizes of the Enemies, who at any time ſupply'd the want of force with all ſorts of Stratagems againſt him; He had newly diſcover'd a Correſpondence they had in <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> and though he had Caus'd it's Authors to be puniſh'd, he knew not whether there might not be ſtill ſome Other, and ſo durſt not remove far from hand; the time however preſs'd, the Imperialiſts laid <hi>Heſſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and ſo incommoded the <hi>Suedes,</hi> as reduc'd 'em to ſtrange Diſtreſs. The <hi>Land-Gravinne</hi> of <hi>Heſſe</hi> ſollicited him to give her Succours, the <hi>Suedes</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame thing of his Excellency, and he ſaw little likelyhood of effecting either, thorow the Dfficulty of the Ways, and the faſtneſſes the Enemies had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Both. At laſt, after having weigh'd well what he had to do, he ſent to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to lend him a Bridge of Boates he had upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and having paſs'd that River above the Borders of <hi>Weſel,</hi> he fram'd a Deſign in his Turn, to cut off the Ennmies Communication, and to pen them up when he had once joyn'd the <hi>Suedes,</hi> in which he cou'd not have been hindered, if he had the Good luck to compaſs the Conjunction. The Enemies might as yet have exempted themſelves from that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, but fearing he wou'd march into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> whoſe Paſſes were open, they quickly left <hi>Heſſe,</hi> &amp; while they were marching in a Body they made Detachments to advance in all haſt upon the <hi>Mein.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> upon the news he had of all theſe motions, fancying that the Succeſs of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize depended only on his opening the Paſſage of that River, Caus'd ſome troups to advance, and theſe Troups having driven away three hundred men that defended a Ford, the whole Army paſs'd, being a days March before that of the Enemies: In the mean while he Seiz'd on <hi>Aſchaffembourg</hi> and of ſome other
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57147:104"/>
Places of leſs importance, and having left a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in ſome, &amp; blown up Others, he march'd towards the <hi>Danube,</hi> where moſt of the Citys open'd their Gates without making other than a mean Reſiſtance; <hi>Rhenen</hi> however ſtopp'd our Armes for ſome days; but having been Won as well as the Reſt, all <hi>Bavaria</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd a Prey to our Army, it having alſo paſs'd the <hi>Lek. Ausburg</hi> only now wanted to be reduc'd, it having at firſt demanded a Newtrality, but calling in the Enemies afterwards, this ſtep oblig'd the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to lay Siege to't. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had like to have been ſurpriz'd in a Country Houſe where he was taking the Diverſion of Hunting; for having not foreſeen that ſo many Rivers cou'd be paſs'd in ſo ſhort a ſpace, he was far from ſuſpecting a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be ſo imminent; he withdrew into his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall City, but not thinking himſelf there in ſafety, he wou'd have gone much further off if he had found the means to remove off the ſtorm with which he was threatned by propoſing to remain Neuter. This Prince, notwithſtanding he appear'd the Moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable of our enemies, having ever kept a Secret Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Us, for We were not over-willing that the <hi>Suedes</hi> ſhould become ſo Potent, and he for his part was not Sorry that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> now and then receiv'd ſome ſmall Mortifications. Thus were poor Miſerable Wretches Sacrific'd for the publique weale, by ſome times giving ground and at others by making a fluſter of puſhing on; This is the reaſon of our Army in <hi>Germany's</hi> being ever ſo Weak; and if Succours had been ſent thither the two years afore, 'twas rather to ſhow what <hi>France</hi> was capable of, than to make any Conſiderable Conqueſts. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Experience had ſhown in the Courſe of one and the ſame year, that Victorious Armies had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to give ground and retreat, for theſe two Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57147:104"/>
had the Secret to make Detachments ſo in the Nick, as to bring matters again to the Equilibrium they had underhand agreed on; but now at this time it fell out quite otherwiſe, and the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> not knowing the leaſt of all theſe ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, had puſh'd things ſo far, as neither ſide knew how to remedy. In ſo great an Extremity, only were there two Expedients, One to ſend the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> order to retire; the other to direct him to ſuffer himſelf to be beaten. The former cou'd not be done without manifeſting the Intelligence, the Other was dangerous, becauſe it had been imparting the Secret to him, which they wou'd not do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. As matters were urging, and that <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſuffer'd extraordinaryly by the ſtay of ſo many Troups, they Choſe to offer a Treaty, under Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of which the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the <hi>Rhin.</hi> This Extremely Surpriz'd this Prince, for the Court truſted entirely in the Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's</hi> Word, he promiſing to abandon the Emperour: but as it was not for him to Pry into the Secret, and that it became him to content himſelf with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, he March'd whither he was Commanded, to the great grief of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who fiercely Exclam'd againſt this Treaty. Thus they Separated with much coldneſs, though not a perſon in their Army but had conceiv'd a peculiar eſteem for him, for he exerted his Benignity ev'n to the Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, not one of whom but he had done ſome kindneſs to, Eſpecially thoſe who had been long in the Service, and he delighted in hearing them diſcourſe of the various Occaſions in which they had been. Now it once happening that one of them was giving him a Relation of the Battle of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> coming to the King of <hi>Suedens</hi> Death, he fell a ſobbing, and Tears guſht out to that degree as hinder'd him from Proſecuting his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57147:105"/>
This Souldier's affection for his King ſo edify'd the Viſcount that he wou'd needs have him into his Service: But this Souldier made him anſwer, that he wou'd have no other Maſter than his Captain; and that after having perform'd all his Life long ſo Honourable a Trade, he was reſolv'd not to engage in any other of leſs Eſteem. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> far from being Scandaliz'd at this Anſwer, was ſo pleas'd with it, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd <hi>Wrangel,</hi> Commanding the Troups of <hi>Sueden,</hi> to give him this Souldier, and a Lieutenancy of Horſe falling Vacant ſome days after in a Regiment of his Army, he made him a preſent of it, with Moneys neceſſary for his Equipage: For this Prince was not only ever ready to ſpeak well of deſerving Perſons, but he allſo did them as much good as he was able, and ev'n ſometimes beyond his Forces; he allſo ſaid, that a man need never fear to Want, if he had been Inſtrumentall to procure the fortune of Others, and that they were as many gratefull Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that wou'd never abandon a Man at a pinch. If he was free to give without being askt, it is to be preſum'd without my ſaying it, that he never refus'd what lay in his Pow'r: Nay, he often met thoſe who needed him, or whom he thought under ſome ſort of Neceſſity, and he did not then inquire whether he alter'd his Expence, or whether it would not incommode him himſelf; and indeed he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, that he that was not good for himſelf was good for no Body, that a Prince cou'd never want, and that having ſo many Helps, he had but very little Charity, if he did not pitty the Miſery of a Man, who often knew not where to put his Head. Nevertheleſs once theſe ſorts of Liberalities brought his Money to fall ſhort, and his Steward, who told him roundly his Mind, began to grumble
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57147:105"/>
ſo far as to tell him, that ſince it was his fault he ſaw himſelf reduc'd to this Eſtate, it was for him to look out for Remedy; Friend, ſaid he to him, let's not be in this Paſſion, and we'le go ſee in a Moment whether we have any Friends; at the ſame time he publickly declar'd the ſtreights he was brought to, of which the whole Army being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, brought him its Money, even to the very Souldiers, who deſir'd him to accept of their Loan, ſaying they ſhould be never the more at a loſs for their Maintenance. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was Overjoy'd at their good Will, and taking what he had Occaſion for out of his Friends Purſes, He thank'd the Reſt, who were under an Unconceivable Grief that Others had been preferr'd before them.</p>
            <p>The Credit he had, made him however not to be at a Penny Charge more than Neceſſary, and ev'n in his Greeneſt Youth he was peculiar in this, that he had Ever ſquar'd his Expences according to his Purſe; For which reaſon he ſaid, that a man ſhould never mind what Others did, becauſe he would ever find thoſe, whom he wou'd have reaſon to Envy; that by this means a man did often incapacitate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſerving; and that a man that had a Noble Ambition, had no need of ſo much Equipage for the doing his Duty; that Luxury it was which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd this Diſorder, and not greatneſs of mind, as many People did imagine. Upon which he told what one of his Friends had done, who being oblig'd to go to the Army, and being without Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, had refus'd to accept of Money, for fear of not being able to get thither at the time required. He ſaid that it became a Man to demean himſelf in this manner, and in an Age wherein Licentiouſneſs and Luxury reign'd beyond Imagination, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to re-eſtabliſh Virtue in the Room of Vice:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57147:106"/>
And indeed, as well among Strangers, as the <hi>French,</hi> his repute was mounted ſo high, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as a Prince, leſs Conſpicuons for his Birth than for the Grandeur of his Sentiments. His very Servants obſerv'd nothing but what was lofty in him, for tho' none in his Houſe but have Manifeſted ſome Weakneſs, he was ſo Exempt from all Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that his leaſt Actions gave Admiration; Nevertheleſs this made him not the more Arrogant with his Equalls, nor the more proud with his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. As for his Domeſtiques, he Carry'd himſelf towards them with ſo much Goodneſs, that they openly averr'd, that being under the Misfortuue of Service, they were over-happy in having met with ſo good a Maſter; He never ſpoke to them Otherwiſe, than if they had been his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls, Ever Mild, ever Affable; and indeed he ſaid their Condition did already ſufficiently Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Commiſeration, without aggravating their misfortune by ill uſage: Nevertheleſs he exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from each their reſpective Dutys, for if he had found out the leaſt Debauchery, he had thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward no further regard for ſuch Perſons, and they muſt Change their Maſter; but this was done ſo mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without violence, and he contented himſelf with letting them know the Occaſion of their being turn'd away, that ſo they might reform. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct procur'd his family to be made up only of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Worthy Perſons, or at leaſt of Perſons who ſeem'd ſo to his Eyes and to the eyes of all People: Such as were prone to a Diſorderly Life had no Bus'neſs in his Retinue, but provided they made appear good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, they were ſure of his Protection; both for themſelves and their family; for which reaſon he did not mind whether they were marry'd or not, and ſuch as were had no need to fear that this ſhou'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57147:106"/>
them from his Service, ſince he phancy'd this wou'd render them the more affectionate to him; If they had any bus'neſs he made it his own, and Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in Perſon, without contenting himſelf to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it by Letters: For he ſaid that Preſence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a greater effect than all the Writing in the World, and how a man that had a mind to do O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſervice ought never to take Notice if he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did more than he ought; but in Solliciting a Judge, he never ſaid I beſeech you do this for me, but I beſeech you do it if you find it Juſt, for he wou'd not that his Credit ſhou'd be injurious to any Body, and he told thoſe who deſir'd him to go interpoſe their Recommendation in his behalf, that they ſhou'd not engage him in it, in caſe their affair was tickliſh in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>The Treaty, above-mention'd, being concluded with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the year 1647. was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready far ſpent, when that the <hi>Suedes</hi> having no mind to evacuate the Places they held, were not in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to ratify the Treaty unleſs they might be left in Poſſeſſion of what they then had in their hands. In the mean while the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> Dy'd before the Year was finiſht, and the Duke <hi>d'Anguien</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd his Name, ſo as when I ſhall henceforward mention the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> I ſhall mean that Duke. The Conteſts that aroſe between the <hi>Suedes</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> occaſioned the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to remain ſtill ſometime upon his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, where he fought a ſhort and ſmart Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; for having Notice that the Enemies were marching towards the <hi>Rhin,</hi> he attack'd them Vigorouſly, and purſu'd them to the very Gates of <hi>Newbourg;</hi> he alſo took ſeveral ſmall Cities of of his Electoral Highneſs's Country, for to oblige him to give all manner of Contentment to the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57147:107"/>
               <hi>Suedes,</hi> it became him to exert ſtill the ſame heat. In the mean while as Affairs ſpun-out into a Length, a Part of the Army advanc'd towards the Lake of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and alarum'd the <hi>Cantons</hi> by the taking of <hi>Bregens</hi> and of ſome other places: They ſent Deputies to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to know his Intentions; but this Prince having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd them that the King his Maſter had not the leaſt thoughts of making any Innovation in their Regard, they return'd very well ſatisfy'd, as being perſuaded he would not have giv'n them this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, if he meant afterwards to Violate it. And indeed thoſe who knew him, knew that for any thing in the world he wou'd not have been prevail'd with to deceive any body. And it was alſo a Common ſaying of his, that there was a great Difference between the Stratagems of War and Cheats; and foraſmuch as a man was eſteem'd who knew how to put the former in practice, ſo much ought he to be blam'd who made uſe of the later to bring about his Deſigns; that a man's word ought to be inviolable as well to Enemies as to Friends, and that if they were to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, 'twas not to be by promiſing them, what a man never meant to perform.

            <p>During theſe Tranſactions the Viſcount de <hi>Turenne</hi> having left <hi>Bavaria,</hi> turn'd his Arms againſt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of <hi>Mayenz</hi> and the <hi>Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57147:107"/>
a Town Charg'd its Party three or four times. He allſo took the City of <hi>Darmſtadt,</hi> the Capital of the <hi>Landtgraſts</hi> of that name's Dominions, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Caſt a Terrour into the Electorate of <hi>Cologne,</hi> he oblig'd thoſe Princes to demand a Neutrality. All theſe Treatys would have ſtartl'd the Emperor; if he had believ'd them any thing long-liv'd; but he expected what in effect happen'd, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having left his Principal Towns in the hands of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> and being Conſtrain'd to remain Armed, could not Subſiſt any longer without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to affranchize himſelf from their Slavery; that this wou'd rather make him Chuſe the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of War, than Moulder away by little and little: For which reaſon he reſolv'd to try if he cou'd induce him ſooner to the Rupture, than he wou'd have fall'n to't of himſelf. In the Interim his Circumſtances were ſo low, that all his Credit ſeem'd loſt in <hi>Germany;</hi> For we were Maſters of the Bancks of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> from <hi>Colin</hi> to <hi>Baſel,</hi> and as the means to pierce into the Countrey, We had alſo reſerv'd to our ſelves <hi>Heilbronn</hi> and <hi>Lawinghen,</hi> which afforded us a free Paſſage as far as into the Hereditary Countreys. On another ſide the <hi>Suedes</hi> poſſeſs'd an infinite Number of Places in the heart of the Countrey; but the Emperour hoping to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail himſelf of the ſtrangeneſs between them and Us, ſince the Treaty of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> expected not only to recover what he had loſt, but alſo to ſuſtain with ſome ſort of Repute the Affairs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that were under great Decadency ſince the taking of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> For conſidering that if the King cou'd once render himſelf Maſter of thoſe Provinces, he wou'd be capable afterwards to give Laws to all the Empire, he fancy'd that tho' he had not ſo much Intereſt therein as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ought
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57147:108"/>
nevertheleſs to Eſpouſe it as his own Bus'neſs: For this purpoſe he ſent the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> thither, that ſo the Grandees being Excited by the Grandeur of his Birth, might rid themſelves of a certain jealouſy to which he attributed the Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the foregoing Campagns. The Arch-Duke being accompany'd with Numerous and well-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd Forces, and being deſirous to Signalize his Arrival in <hi>Flanders</hi> by ſome Conſiderable Exploit, he lead his Army againſt the City of <hi>Armentieres,</hi> whoſe Governour made a Valiant Defence; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having held out about three Weeks without the proſpect of any Conſiderable Succours, it at length Surrender'd upon Honourable Conditions. From <hi>Armentieres</hi> the Arch-Duke March'd againſt <hi>Landrecies,</hi> where he had Intelligence with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>d'Haudicourt,</hi> Commanding in that Place. Thus having taken it with much Eaſe, the <hi>French</hi> Leaguer, then Marching to its Succours, was oblig'd to turn its Arms another way. To repair theſe Loſſes it took <hi>Dixmuyden</hi> and <hi>La Baſſée,</hi> but it kept the former of theſe Two Places ſo little a while that 'tis not worth the pains to boaſt of it; for the Arch-Duke laid Siege to't immediately, while the Mareſchal <hi>de Gaſſion</hi> Attack'd <hi>Lens.</hi> At the ſiege of this faſtneſs, was it that this Captain, who had acquir'd great Renown in all his Enterprizes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Musket-ſhot of which he dy'd; he was much Lamented by his Men, eſteem'd by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and his Relations, who were great Loſers by his Death, nevertheleſs loſt ſtill leſs by it than the State did, to which he was more than ever capable of rendering great Services. In the mean while, the Arch-Duke's Army ſtill Augmenting, and the Court being afraid it might make advantage of <hi>Gaſſion</hi>'s Death, ſent Orders to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:57147:108"/>
who ſtaid upon the Banks of the <hi>Rhin</hi> to Secure his Conqueſts, to repaſs it on to this ſide: But by taking Care of the Affairs of this ſide, thoſe on that fell into Decay, for the Emperour improving this Diverſion, drove the <hi>Suedes</hi> from ſeveral Poſts. For a Height of Misfortune, Colonel <hi>Roſe,</hi> who ſerv'd in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Army, being gain'd and egg'd-on by his Country-men, who as I ſaid before, were Exaſperated at the Treaty of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> made Caballs in his Regiment, and in that of ſome <hi>Suedes</hi> that ſerv'd as well as he under the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> ſo to ſtir up ſome Sedition; and tho' this Priuce having intimation of his Practiſes had him taken into Cuſtody, the thing was not wanting nevertheleſs to have ſtrange Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For as this Prince wou'd have led them into <hi>Flanders,</hi> he heard a Muttering that paſs'd from File to File, and ſuſpecting it to be the effect of the under-hand practices he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, he thought it his beſt way to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to repreſs them; But inſtead of meeting with the Obedience he expected, the Officers as well as Soldiers told him that having been rais'd by the Great <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> they had not made any difference of the Services they had render'd to <hi>France</hi> from thoſe his Majeſty himſelf had exacted, becauſe the Allyance between the two Crowns, interwove their Intereſts, and made, as a man may ſay, but one Party; but now the thing in Agitation being the Carrying the War into <hi>Flanders,</hi> this was not the Intereſt of the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and that by Conſequence they wou'd not go. The Soldiers had all this while the Match in readyneſs nor more nor leſs than if they had been before an Enemy; but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> without being ſtartled, told the Officers that they were to anſwer for the Reſt; that they

ſhou'd come to a Reſolution in four and twenty hours time, if not he knew how to execute his. That time was ſpent in Parleys of both Parties; the Mutineers demanded to have paid them what was owing them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that afterwards they were ready to go whereever their Generall ſhou'd lead them: but as this was only a Pretext to cover their Diſobedience, they ſeparated themſelves from the reſt of the Army upon asking them time to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them. They were Two Thouſand Five Hundred men or thereabouts, and Marching in <hi>Battalia</hi> with an Extraordinary Courage, they reſolv'd notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being ſeverely Threatned, and the Difficulty of the Ways, to go and find out <hi>Coningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> who made them a Thouſand Advantageous Offers to draw them to him. The Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> having ſpar'd them till then, by reaſon of their Bravery, which he had ſo often try'd, having now no other Courſe to take, follow'd them at their Heels, and having overtaken them in a Streight, where they had put themſelves in a Poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he defeated a part of them, and purſu'd the Reſt. Having taken ſome Priſoners he reſolv'd to have them Hang'd, and to begin with ſome Officers; But an Old Man with a White Hoary Head of Hair, and Venerable for his Years, having open'd his Breaſt, on which were Two and Thirty Wounds, <hi>We do not fear Death,</hi> ſaid he to the Viſcount, <hi>let it preſent it ſelf in what manner it will to our Eyes, and my Companions can ſhew thee as well as I, that they have confronted it a Thouſand times without turning Pale; lead <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s whither thou wilt provided it concerns the Service of the Crown, whoſe Subjects We are Born; But let's not follow thee for the Intereſts of thine, which We will not do without having firſt receiv'd Orders for that purpoſe from the Queen of</hi> Sueden, <hi>our only</hi>

               <hi>Miſtreſs. Thou ſayſt we are Mercenaries, and as ſuch ought to follow thee over all; If we have been in the Pay of the King thy Maſter, we have Serv'd him well for his Mony. Here's Thirty two Wounds I have got within theſe Ten Years that I have been in his Service, and tho' I have born Arms ſince Fifteen Years old, I never was in ſo many Battles, nor ſo many Sieges, as ſince I have been under his Banners. Every man of us will tell thee as much, and there are thoſe of them that cou'd ſhew thee much othergueſs Wounds, and yet have had no great Recompence. I don't ſay this to Reproch thee, thou do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But do not think I ſay this to Flatter thee, or for that I am at thy Mercy, nothing but the Truth obliges me to't. I am above Sixty Four Years old, and thus having a foot in the Grave, thou canſt only very little advance my End; but have a care of Diſhonouring thy Life by inflicting an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Puniſhment upon Brave Men, and Conſider well the Conſequences this may be of to the King thy Maſter.</hi> The Aſſurance wherewith this Old man ſpoke, had matter to ſurprize all thoſe that heard him. It was generally expected that having fail'd in his Reſpect to his General he was going to be ſent to Execution; But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> admiring the greatneſs of his Courage; <hi>I pardon thee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the freedome with which thou speak'ſt to me, and in favour of the Bloud thou haſt ſhed in ſo many good Occaſions, I ſpare thee what thou haſt left, and that of thy Companions: But, me thinks, all thy Long Service has not over well taught thee Due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let the Danger thou art in, teach thee, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to be wiſe, and I am content that thou ſhould'ſt know that if I did my Duty, thou would'ſt not perhaps come-off at ſo Cheap a rate.</hi> He diſmiſs'd him after
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57147:110"/>
this anſwer, and having giv'n him and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents leave to go whither they pleas'd, they went and joyn'd their main Body, to meet whom <hi>Koningſmarck</hi> was advanc'd.</p>
            <p>This Diſobedience having much diminiſh'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> Army, he found no more now than Six Thouſand men when he was on this ſide the <hi>Rhine;</hi> Being nevertheleſs advanc'd into <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> this did not hinder him from Sacking the Open Country, and from taking ſome Caſtles with the little City of <hi>Wirton.</hi> The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being then oblig'd to ſend Troups to make Head againſt him, this ſo weakned their Army, as incapacitated it from any further Attempt. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was however in hopes to meet with ſome favourable occaſion to fight, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of the City of <hi>Wormes</hi> being Beſieged, he turn'd back to go to it's Relief: And indeed needfull was it to oppoſe the Emperour, who wag'd War with Succeſs: For tho' the <hi>Suedes</hi> had taken the City of <hi>Stinfwrt</hi> in <hi>Franconia,</hi> and that of <hi>Egger</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they had loſt ſeveral others that were of much greater Moment; Upon which the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſeeing his Country eaten up by their Troups, took occaſion to break the Treaty he had with <hi>Sueden;</hi> for he was not only vex'd to ſee his Territories Garriſon'd, but was alſo willing to partake with the Emperour in the Spoils of that Crown, which he ſaw abandon'd by <hi>France,</hi> and which he thought cou'd not be ſo ſuddenly Succoured, for the King had his hands full in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and beſides in all likelyhood wou'd reſent what had newly occur'd in Relation to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> Thus the more to oblige us not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in his Affairs, he openly Proteſted he had no Deſign to come to a Rupture with us, and forbid
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57147:110"/>
his Troups to commit any Hoſtility in places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Juriſdiction. We let him alone for ſome time, as not being ſorry, as I think I have already ſaid, to curtaile a little the Pow'r of the <hi>Suedes:</hi> But when we ſaw, that after he had drove them out of his Country, he Pretended to extend his Conqueſts, ev'n upon the other Places they held in <hi>Germany,</hi> we began then to think of giving them Succours. Whereupon the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had orders ſent him to paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> again, and he reinforc'd his Army with ſome Garriſons in <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Alſatia,</hi> thro' which Provinces he directed his Way.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions News came from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi> that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condé</hi> being gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to relieve the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> had not been more proſperous before <hi>Lerida,</hi> which Place he had alſo beleaquer'd. This Unhappy Event, join'd to ſome other ſmall Diſgraces which befell us in <hi>Flanders</hi> and in <hi>Italy</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Sack'd <hi>Montferrat,</hi> obliging the Court to take Care leaſt Matters ſhou'd grow ſtill worſe in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> they endeavour'd to regain the <hi>Suedes</hi> Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who were not ſo dull, as not to entertain ſome ſuſpicion of the Sentiments we had in their regard. However nothing perplex'd us more in the Conjunctures that offer'd themſelves, than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the United Provinces, who manag'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, a Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for tho' we remonſtrated to them, upon the ſuſpicion we had on this Account, that their only ſafety was to remain inſeparably link'd to us, they were ſo Weary of the War, that they thought any Peace, however bad, to be preferable to it. The Court having, got the Wind of their Intentions, <hi>Servient</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and He, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57147:111"/>
fine Words they gave him, judged they had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to abandon us; for which reaſon orders were ſent to the Ambaſſadours we had at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and who were Aſſembl'd there to Treat of a General Peace, to mind Carefully the Paces of the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whoſe Conduct was ſo much the more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, in that it was conceal'd. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Death happening juſt in that Nick, ſtill contributed to inſpire them with this Deſire; for they conſider'd that after having loſt this Prince, a Perſon of ſuch vaſt Experience, their Affairs wou'd perchance, change face under the Conduct of Prince <hi>William</hi> his Son, who wou'd need much time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as much knowledge as his Father had had, and in War, and in Policy. Be it as it will, they remain'd without doing any thing, as if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented their having Aſſiſted us in the taking ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Good Places. And indeed this was ſaid to be the Reaſon why they moſt deſired to make Peace, and that they already began to diſtruſt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; For they conſider'd that <hi>Flanders</hi> being ſo Remote from the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s other Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; Nay, and the Paſſages of <hi>Italy</hi> ſtopp'd by the means of <hi>Lorrain</hi> which we had in Poſſeſſion, this Prince was not in a Condition to defend himſelf againſt ſo formidable a Pow'r as Ours, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally when there ſhou'd be any Diverſion in our favour. But what vex'd them moſt was, that by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a Sum of Money, we oblig'd them moſt commonly to favour our Conqueſts, without affording them any ſhare in them, as had been practic'd in the Two laſt Campagns: They ſaid that after having fought for their Liberty for a whole Century to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, a great want of Judgment wou'd it be to ſuffer others to gather the fruits of all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; that if they cou'd not enlarge their State,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57147:111"/>
it was ſufficiently flouriſhing in what it contain'd for them to be contented; that the Peace wou'd infinitely improve it's advantageous Condition, and that at length after ſo much pains and Blood-ſhed, it was high time to enjoy ſome reſt and dye in their Beds. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being no Strangers to theſe Sentiments endeavour'd to foſter them; but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> on their ſide knowing the deſire the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had to divorce them from us, ſet the Peace at ſo high a Rate, that ſome hopes were ſtill left, that they wou'd not proceed to an Accommodation.</p>
            <p>Things being in this Poſture at the beginning of the Year 1648, a ſad Year for us, as I ſhall ſhew in due Place, yet not by the Advantages the Enemies gain'd, for they were rather Conquer'd than Victors, but thro' our inteſtine Diviſions, which had like to have occaſion'd the ruine of the State. The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who had try'd a Reverſe of Fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lerida,</hi> was return'd to Court, where he Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the Command of the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> little minded now by the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> ſo as after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtain'd it, he took the field againſt Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> who had miſs'd of <hi>Courtray,</hi> which he meant to have Surpriz'd by <hi>Scalado.</hi> The Enemies were Extraordinary ſtrong that Year, and menac'd no leſs then to Invade <hi>France</hi> thro' <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> which they Equally threatned. To remedy this Diſorder, Troups advanc'd from Sundry Parts; nay, and ſome were drawn out of <hi>Briſac,</hi> making a ſhew of Inveſting <hi>Fribourg,</hi> to the intent to draw a ſmall Body of the Enemies to March that way to diſpute with them their Paſſage. The Mareſchal <hi>de Rantzau,</hi> who had had the Government of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> drew together on the Other ſide, divers Garriſons; and the Arch-Duke being oblig'd to divide his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being of a daring, Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57147:112"/>
Humour, laid Siege to <hi>Ypres.</hi> The Arch-Duke who expected to be Maſter of the Campagn, was ſtrangely Surpriz'd at his Boldneſs, as being in a Condition to give him Battel; but fearing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might declare her ſelf for the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> he durſt not attempt to force his Lines, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his Highneſs to Compleat his Conqueſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him all the Obſtruction he might have done As many of our Men dy'd before <hi>Ypres,</hi> and that beſides this the Army was Weakned by the Garriſon that was put into that Place, the Arch-Duke who had taken on his ſide the City of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,</hi> and had had time to know his own ſtrength, thought it his Duty to make ſome Enterprize, and went and Beſieg'd <hi>Elters.</hi> This Place had neither the Strength of <hi>Ypres,</hi> nor was it worthy of ſo great an Army; Nevertheleſs, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be a leſſening his repute to Suffer it to be taken without offering its relief, decamp'd in all haſt; and march'd that waywards. Yet whatever diligence he cou'd make, it was Surrendred before his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, which made him a little Angry with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that Place; but quickly comforting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he drew near the Enemies, who after having provided for their New Conqueſt, had led their Forces againſt <hi>Lens:</hi> He found them Maſters too of that Town; Inſomuch that being prevented of his good Intentions for that Place, he reſolv'd to Wreak his Revenge on the Enemies, to whom he offer'd Battel, remaining two days in Battalia with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſtirring from the Town. At laſt being afraid of being famiſh'd, they made ſome motions, but the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being at the ſame time at their Heels, did not ſuffer them to Eſcape without fighting. Now as he had undertaken to retrieve his Reputation, which had ſuffer'd ſome blemiſh by
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57147:112"/>
raiſing the Siege of <hi>Lerida,</hi> he of his Perſon did Wonders, and after having defeated their Left Wing, He fell upon their Right, which the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> had attack'd with leſs Succeſs. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order was great among the Arch-Dukes Troups, and this Prince was never able to rally them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Peril he himſelf confronted for the ſetting them an Example, <hi>Rantzau</hi> taking the Advantage of this Victory, went and Attack'd <hi>Frondatte,</hi> who with a ſmall Body of <hi>Spaniards</hi> Cover'd the Places on the Sea-ſide; and after having beaten him into his very Retrenchments, he beleaguer'd <hi>Furnes,</hi> whither the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> repair'd. He receiv'd there a Musket-Shot on the Reins, but the Bullet being flatted by his Buff, that happen'd to lye in folds, he came off with a Bruiſe. Theſe loſſes ſo allarum'd the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> that they reſolv'd to paſs o'er all Conſiderations that had thitherto hinder'd 'em from coming to a Concluſion with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the Treaty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſign'd, they imagin'd they might be in a Capacity to take their Revenge. However their Concerns went not only ill on that ſide, but they had been alſo compell'd to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Flix</hi> in <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> had taken <hi>Tortoſe</hi> from them; they had likewiſe been oblig'd in <hi>Italy</hi> to abandon ſome Iſlands they had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd themſelves off upon the <hi>Po,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> having the Command of the Army, by reaſon of ſome Diſcontent Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> had giv'n the Court, had beſieg'd <hi>Cremona</hi> in the State of <hi>Milan</hi> with an Army of Fifteen Thouſand Men. They apprehended the Event of that Siege as a thing fatall to their Grandeur. The Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> us'd all poſſible Care and Induſtry in this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as well as the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> and the Marquis <hi>Ville,</hi> who particularly had the Whole
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57147:113"/>
Care of the Attacks, but the latter having been been wounded by a Cannon ſhott, of which he dy'd two days after, ſeem'd to carry all Good luck away with him. In effect the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Suffer'd ſome Loſſes in diverſe Sallies, thought it became him not any longer to proſecute that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and though he had loſt Men and time in't, he made leſs reflexion on the Shame that wou'd redound from raiſing the Siege, than on the Obligation he was under to ſave the Reſt of his Men. The joy the <hi>Spaniards</hi> receiv'd from rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Siege of <hi>Cremona,</hi> was preceeded by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Event, to which they had been ſtill more ſenſible; and indeed the thing was of much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Conſequence to them, and as I have not yet Spoke of it, I ſhall here drop a Word or Two, ſince the Occaſion ſerves. The Vice-Roy they had at <hi>Naples,</hi> having diſpleas'd the People, as well as the Nobleſs, a General revolt there was againſt him the Night afore; and fearing leaſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might inflict an Exemplary Puniſhment, they call'd in His moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty to their Succours, who ſent them the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a Perſon to them acceptable. This Duke being brave, ſuſtain'd things for ſome time with great Vigour; but being addicted to his Pleaſures, he ſuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be led away by his Temper, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the humour of the Nation, jealous ev'n to fury. Thus they not pardoning him ſome little Amours, that had made but too much noiſe, they fram'd ſeverall Conſpiracies againſt him, nay and render'd him ſo ſuſpected to the King, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty left him, as it were, to himſelf. In ſo great an Exigency he wou'd have open'd to himſelf a Paſſage, to introduce Proviſions into the Town, then labouring under great want of them; but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57147:113"/>
going out himſelf imprudently, thoſe that had a Deſign againſt him deliver'd a Gate to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who on another ſide ſeiz'd on his Perſon. Now this Event was to them of too Great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, for them to refrain entertaining an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary joy; but it wou'd have been ſtill much greater, without what occur'd in <hi>Germany.</hi> I have ſaid before, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having broke his Treaty, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was march'd away again for <hi>Germany</hi> by order from the Court; and as this Prince knew the neceſſity there was to make haſt, he march'd long Days journeys till he had paſs'd the <hi>Rhine:</hi> He joyn'd the <hi>Suedes,</hi> whoſe great occaſions for him, from them extorted great excuſes, for having receiv'd his Mutinous Troups, and having offer'd to put them again into his hands to Chaſtize them as he pleas'd, his anſwer was, that all thoughts ſhou'd be laid aſide of what was paſs'd and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they were more Obedient, he willingly pardon'd them. This Affair being thus terminated without there appearing any bitterneſs on either ſide, the Army march'd directly to the <hi>Danube,</hi> where the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemys waited with thirty thouſand men, as if they meant to give Battail, but upon the Tydings they had that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> drew near, they march'd to <hi>Donawert,</hi> where they paſs'd the River. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> perceiving by this, that they had no Intention to fight, deſign'd to force them to an Engagement, by paſſing it himſelf at <hi>Lawinghen,</hi> and to make the more haſt, he left there his ſick aud his Baggages. <hi>Melander</hi> who commanded two years afore the Troups of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> but out of ſome Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent had ſided with the Emperour, thought it not yet fitting to accept of the Battail, and thinking to reach the little River of <hi>Armuth,</hi> he was much Surpriz'd to ſee that his Rier attack'd before he cou'd paſs <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merhawen.</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:57147:114"/>
He immediately repair'd thither, to put things in the beſt poſture he cou'd; but in his ſtriving to ſtop the enemy, that puſht him briskly, he receiv'd a Piſtol-ſhot in his Reins. He eaſily perceiv'd the Wound to be Mortal, but being a man of Great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he told thoſe that were very earneſt to give him help, that they ſhou'd only think of ſaving the Army, and having commanded them to preſs it on as much as they cou'd, he Surrender'd his Soul in uttering theſe Words, Advance, Gentlemen, Adv-a-n-ce. The Rier had much adoe to paſs the River, and a great Number of them were kill'd upon the Bancks, but the reſt having at length got over, they broke down the Bridges and ſtill purſu'd their way. In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Wirtembourg</hi> poſted himſelf in a Meadow with twelve hundred Horſe, ſuſtaining two Batallions, plac'd to impede our Paſſage, and he behav'd himſelf ſo valiantly in this imploy, that a Man cannot ſay too much to his Honour. And indeed, though he had loſt above the half of his Men, they being kill'd by our Canon, he ſtood firm in his Poſt, untill Night, when he made his Retreat. The Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> not dare to paſs in his Purſuit, but at break of day, the Army began to work upon the Bridges, while the Cavalry were ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a Ford. At length having found the means to paſs in leſs than three hours ſpace, it fell a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Enemies who fled towards <hi>Lek.</hi> As they had got a nights ſtart, and that beſides fear gave them Wings, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> cou'd not overtake them, and being come to the Banck of the River, he ſaw them on the other ſide, a making intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He brought up his Canon, that made not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order enough to oblige them to give ground, ſo as that he turn'd toward <hi>Rhain,</hi> where there was a Bridge, he had a mind to ſurprize. The Garriſon
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57147:114"/>
defended it for ſome time with reaſonable Courage, but fearing to be forc'd, they ſet fire to't, which ours immediately extinguiſh'd. After we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd it, the Army paſs'd o'er, and entring into the heart of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſpread there ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, that the Duke did not think himſelf there in Safety: Feign wou'd he have brought the Treaty again on foot, but as there was no truſting him ſince his former behaviour, they wou'd not ſo much as give him a hearing. Being thus debarr'd the ways of Accommodation, his Electoral Highneſs departed from <hi>Munik</hi> with all his Family, and 'twas a thing worthy of Compaſſion to ſee ſuch a great Prince, as his Electoral Highneſs, fly away at the Age of Seaventy Eight Years old, after having been 'till then ſo Potent, that he had often Created a Jealouſy in the Emperour. He Embark'd upon the <hi>Iſer,</hi> and for a Retreat repair'd to the Biſhop of <hi>Salzburg:</hi> But Fortune being minded to make him ſenſible of her Pow'r in his own regard, before his eyes caus'd a Boat to ſink, containing a part of his Adherents and Servants. This Duke having thus abandon'd his Territories, they were giv'n up to Plunder, and the Souldier had matter to ſate his Avarice. Nevertheleſs the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had a grudging to purſue the Enemies, who had made their Retreat towards <hi>Paſſaw;</hi> but <hi>Wrangel</hi> oppos'd it, under pretence of ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence he had in Low'r <hi>Auſtria,</hi> having a mind to Invade that Province. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> not prevailing with this General to be of his mind, was oblig'd to follow his, leaſt thro' a Separation the Enemies might fall upon his back. Thus away they march'd towards the River <hi>d'Inn,</hi> where after having in vain attempted the Caſtle of <hi>Waſſerbourg,</hi> they fell to making a Bridge; but

the Waters encreas'd ſo in the Night, that they carry'd away all the Boats. After they had been got together again, they ſought out another place where they fancy'd they might with more eaſe effect their purpoſe: But the Commons being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd from all parts, and preſenting themſelves on the Bank of the River, they needed only to ſecond the furious Impetuoſity of the Water, which already put a ſufficient obſtacle to our Paſſage. As <hi>Wrangel</hi> was fully bent upon his Deſign, he was not paul'd by all theſe Difficulties, and we ſtill ſundry times attempted to make a Bridge. Thus having loſt much time to no manner of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Enemies had the means giv'n them to call for Succours from ſeveral parts. During theſe Tranſactions <hi>Koningſmarck</hi> ſurpriz'd the little ſide of <hi>Prague</hi> where he got an Ineſtimable Booty, and which for his own ſhare only was ſaid to mount to above Twenty Millions; and as he had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to render himſelf Maſter of the reſt of the Town, he Beſieg'd it in the forms. This Succeſs whoſe Sequels were of great Conſequence for the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> made them think of forcing the Paſſages, to go to the Succours of the Beſieged; So as that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> caus'd a Bridge to be laid at <hi>Neufburg,</hi> that in caſe they paſs'd in any Place he might Cut 'em off on the Way. The Buſineſs of <hi>Prague</hi> plung'd the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> into utter Deſpondency; for as the Emperour abandoned all other Deſigns to attend this, His Countrey remain'd Expos'd as a Prey, without hopes of being able to ſave it. However <hi>Picolomini,</hi> whom the Emperour had ſent in the Head of his Forces, had ſome regard for his Electoral Highneſs, and for fear that Diſpair might Compel him to Conclude ſome diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57147:116"/>
Treaty, he made head againſt the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> then Eating <hi>Bavaria</hi> out of Houſe and Home; while the <hi>Suedes</hi> preſs'd <hi>Prague.</hi> Thus came they dayly to Blows, but without Engaging all their Forces, which they husbanded on both ſides, thro' the inconveniencies that were inevitable if any conſiderable loſs befell them. However they were not ſometimes ſo abſolutely Maſters of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but that their Courage hurry'd them beyond their Orders, and in one of thoſe Occaſions did the Enemies loſe the Duke of <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> who had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd himſelf ſo Gloriouſly, as I ſaid afore, in Defence of the River of <hi>Armuth.</hi> To comfort them for this loſs they had ſome petty Advantage Two or Three days after, but as theſe Conflicts were, (properly ſpeaking) only Skirmiſhes, they decided nothing; The World daily Expected ſome Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Event, when all of a Sudden the Peace was known to be concluded at <hi>Munſter</hi> between the Emperour, and <hi>France,</hi> wherein their Allyes were comprehended, with exception however to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> It had been Uſher'd, as I ſaid before, by that of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who had hereby incurr'd the Blame of the Potentates that had any Allyance with them; but as they had their Reaſon, as is before related, they let Others talk their fill, and in the mean while enjoy'd the Advantages they had thereby procur'd. As this News was quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by ſeveral Expreſſes diſpatch'd on purpoſe to Both Armies, they ſtopp'd all Hoſtilities, ſo as that the Leaders having nothing more to do, 'till ſuch time as the Ratification of the Peace ſhould come, courted ſuch amuzements as were conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Inclinations. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> made divers Matches of hunting with the Principal Officers of his Troups; but being one day at that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57147:117"/>
ſport with <hi>Wrangel,</hi> who on his ſide was attended by all the Conſiderable Officers of his Party, <hi>Jean de Wert</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Iſer</hi> at <hi>Munic,</hi> and drew near a Place, that was the only inlet into the Forreſt; In a trice did he cut off ſome Dragoons, that had been poſted there more for form's ſake than out of any Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion; and having caſt ſuch a terrour among all theſe Officers, as that there was not one of them but imagin'd himſelf loſt, he was preparing to take the Advantage of his Enterprize, when God rouz'd a Buck that ſhew'd 'em a Way, in the midſt of a Marſh, Surrounding the Forreſt on all ſides. An Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer having try'd whether there was any ſafety in following him, found it to his deſire, and they all following his Traces, thank'd God for the Miracle he had that day perform'd on their Behalf. In the mean while, the Ratifications being come, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies retreated. But we on Our ſide were in no good Eſtate to enjoy the fruits of the Peace. Diſmal troubles aroſe in <hi>France,</hi> and tho' they were ev'n to Extremity, did nevertheleſs continue, tho Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things are ſaid to be of no long Duration. I have allready remark'd that the Squandering away of the finances compell'd the making of New Edicts. This occaſion'd Murmurs in the Populace, but as they cou'd do nothing without the Succours of the High and Mighty, their Complaints would have been little minded, had they not joyn'd effects to menaces by the Occaſion that was imprudently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them. <hi>Emeri,</hi> the Super-intendant, having Exhauſted his Wit in a vaſt Number of Edicts, not knowing what to have recourſe to, for the filling the Exchequer, inſinuated to the Cardinal that he ſhou'd retain the Penſions of the Officers of the Parliament, of thoſe of the Other Sovereign Courts, and in ſhort of the Preſidials, and of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57147:117"/>
the other Juriſdictions. The Edict having been Seal'd by the Chancellour, a man devoted to the Cardinals Deſigns, the Parliament far from verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, gave an Arreſt of Union; that is to ſay, an Act by which the Sovereign Courts ſhould Unite themſelves with one another, to bring a Change in Affairs, ſo as that the Intereſt of ſome Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, did what the Intereſt of ſo may Provinces had not been able to bring about, that had groan'd under Oppreſſion ſince the Regency. The Court, Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling this Affront, made ſemblance of diſgracing <hi>Emeri,</hi> and gave the Adminiſtration of the Finances to <hi>Meil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leraye,</hi> and the Edict was revok'd with many other tokens of weakneſs. During theſe Occurrences the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having won the Battle of <hi>Lens,</hi> whereof I have before made mention, the Queen-Mother who had not without difficulty conſented to all theſe things, thought her ſelf now in a State of Exerting the Royal Authority, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having aſſiſted at the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> ſung at <hi>Notre-Dame,</hi> as a Thankſgiving to God for that Signal Victory, two of it's Members were taken into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody at their going out of the Church. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who hated the Cardinal, were in Commotion upon theſe Tydings; All thronging into the ſtreeets, and as the Sedition was going to break-forth, the Queen-Mother ſent Perſons of Conſideration to the People to reduce them by Lenity and Mildneſs; But being return'd to the <hi>Palais-Royal,</hi> where the King then Reſided, after having ran a hazard of their Lives, the Queen-Mother Commanded them to take ſome Troups of the Guards, and to ſeize on the Mutineers that purſu'd the Chancellor, when a going to carry new Edicts to the <hi>Palais.</hi> The Command was eaſyer to give than execute, a Hundred Thouſand men were there already in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57147:118"/>
Arms, and thoſe that were at the Head of thoſe Troups having had the Imprudence to cauſe fire to be giv'n, were quickly forc'd to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to flight, ſo to ſteal away from the fury of a Mobile, no longer capable of Obedience. The Queen-Mother, who had word brought every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Sedition augmented, wou'd not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it in the leaſt, and continu'd to take Vigorous Reſolutions; On this Account was it ſhe receiv'd ſo ill the Coadjutor of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> He adviſing her to give way for a time to that fury, which ſhe cou'd no longer ſuppreſs by force, but having intimation that they were every where Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoing it, Neceſſity requir'd her taking Deſigns more Moderate and more conformable to the time. In the mean while, the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled, ſent a Deputation to the King &amp; his Counſel, to have its Members releas'd that were then in Durance; But theſe Deputies returning, without having been able to obtain any thing in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the People ſent 'em back with Menaces, that if they were once again refus'd the return of their Members, they wou'd go ſet fire to the <hi>Palais-Royal,</hi> and ſtab the Cardinal with all his Adherents. The Deputies having not in the leaſt Conceal'd any of theſe Things from the Queen-Mother, and her Councel, an Anſwer was to be glv'n at the very Inſtant, and tho' the Queens Opinion ſtill was to ſuſtain the Royal Authority to the very laſt, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Mazarin</hi> having been of another Sentiment, they prevail'd over Her Majeſty ſo as the People had promis'd them what they demanded. This Succeſs gave a new audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to the Parliament, and as it found it ſelf backt by the People, it Pretended to turn out the Cardinal and put in a Miniſter to its Phancy; for
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57147:118"/>
this purpoſe Meaſures were taken with the Duke of <hi>Orlean,</hi> he being egg'd on to the ſame thing by the Abbot <hi>de la Riviere,</hi> then become Biſhop of <hi>Langras,</hi> but not being contented with this Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wou'd needs joyn to it the Luſtre of the Purple, which the Cardinal had, in vain ſooth'd him with the hopes of: Thus accuſing him of having amuz'd him, he was become his Enemy, and lay at Watch for all Occaſions to ruine his Eminency. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal having the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him, had now no other Recourſe than to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> then in great Conſideration for his New Victory: But the Duke <hi>de Châtillon,</hi> his Relation, and a Perſon that had a great Aſcendant over his Mind, endeavour'd to direct his Highneſs from ſiding with his Eminency, Complaining, as well as <hi>la Riviere,</hi> that the Cardinal had long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him the Baton of Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſeeing any effect of his Promiſes. In fine, all depended on the Byaſs this Prince ſhould give to his Reſolution, when the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> being inſtigated by the Affection he bore the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, found means to make him incline on his ſide. Whereupon the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having declar'd he wou'd take the Court and his Eminencies Part, the Parliament that had allready paſs'd an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt againſt the Cardinal, which Enjoyn'd him to depart the Kingdom, durſt not puſh things farther, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whoſe Spirit was ſo-ſo Moderate, unwilling to draw upon his Back a Man of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s fame and Courage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a Conference demanded by the Court, to Salve ſuch Matters as were complain'd of. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs as <hi>La Riviere</hi> ſtill poſſeſs'd the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> judg'd it Convenient to Confirm to him the Aſſurances he had giv'n him
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57147:119"/>
of a Cardinals Cap, which the Crown was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for him at the firſt Promotion; and <hi>la Riviere</hi> having taken his Sureties as far forth as ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair wou'd allow off, the Obſtacle vaniſh'd that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the Publique Accomodation. The Cardinal being thus deliver'd from the misfortune that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, inſtead of thinking to Content <hi>la Riviere,</hi> he phancy'd he ought to be cautious how he procured him ſuch a ſettlement, which wou'd have put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome manner of Concurrence with him: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he was very much at a loſs after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to break his word with him. But the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont,</hi> who had an infinite deal of Wit free'd him out of this Plunge, he ſo order'd matters by the Prince of <hi>Condé's</hi> means, that the Prince <hi>de Conti</hi> his Brother demanded to be made Cardinal at the firſt Promotion; and as his Birth did not allow of any one ſoever to diſpute with him that Honour, <hi>la Riviere</hi> ſaw himſelf as far off from his hopes as he had phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd himſelf near their Accompliſhment. He cou'd not refrain ſhowing his vexation, he hinder'd his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from going as he was wont to the <hi>Palais Roial,</hi> &amp; when he cou'd not diſpence himſelf from going, his Diſcourſe with the Cardinal was tart and eager, and much more ready to quarrel with him, than to give him any good words. The Queen-Mother, being juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incens'd that a man of <hi>la Riviere's</hi> Birth, ſhould ſo embroile affairs again; that the Kingdom was ready to relapſe into Diſorder, and Confuſion, propos'd to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> without whom her Majeſty durſt not venture upon any thing, to have him taken into Cuſtody. But the Prince fearing leſt this might the more exaſperate the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and as he was at that time far from the Reſolutions which he ſince embrac'd, he deſir'd the Queen to take Milder Courſes. The Queen follow'd his Advice, and things
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57147:119"/>
were Pacify'd more eaſily than expected; for <hi>La Riviere</hi> having had the wind of what was propos'd againſt him, fearing leſt the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> might ſuffer him to be Expos'd to that Princeſſes juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, was the firſt to Suggeſt to his Maſter the Renouncing of that Danger. Yet tho' the times hereby ſeem'd to have retriev'd their Serenity, yet was it not of any long Continuance; The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being made up of many Members, who out of private Conſiderations hated the Cardinal, they were not at quiet till they had rais'd new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions. They had recourſe to the Coadjutour, whoſe haughty Spirit and full of Ambition was equally inflam'd with the Deſire of wreaking his Revenge for the Contempt the Queen had had of him, and to fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the Cardinals Room: However as he did not find his Shoulders ſtrong enough all alone to accompliſh ſo great a Deſign, he tempted the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s fidelity, and inſinueted into his Highneſs ſuch great hopes, that he prevail'd with this Prince to promiſe him ſomething. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did not keep his Word with him, which ſo Vex'd the Coadjutour, that without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Reſpect owing to his Birth, he ſpoke of him in very ungratefull Terms, and which being again told to this Prince, gave the ſtart to that ſtrong Averſion which they ſince proſecuted againſt one another. The Coadjutour no longer minding to husband him, Phancying he might peſter him ſo much the more by ſtriking up an Union with the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> his Brother, out with him at that time upon the account of ſome Amours, he ſought to regain his Confidence, and having but ſped too well in that Deſign, He had him declar'd Head of the Party of the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> a name giv'n
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57147:120"/>
to thoſe that had Sworn the Cardinals Ruine. In the mean while the Parliament ſtill continued its meeting, and the Princes of the Blood were there for the moſt paſt preſent, by their Authority to divert the finiſter Reſolution, that Aſſembly wou'd otherwiſe have taken. The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> whoſe hatred to the Coadjutour, Extended to all thoſe who had any Affinity with him, ſeeing that <hi>Viole,</hi> one of the Boldeſt <hi>Frondeurs</hi> had bolted out ſomething againſt the Cardinal, interrupted him ſmartly, and the Other nevertheleſs continuing his Invective, he threatned him with his Hand. This Action did not pleaſe the Company, that pretended a Right to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Pow'rs ſtill above him: But as they were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, all their reſentment only appear'd in a ſurd Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, which nevertheleſs went to his very heart. And indeed whether that his Highneſs imagin'd he had loſt it's Affection by what had happen'd, or that he was Stimulated by the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont,</hi> he undertook to humble it to that Degree, as that it never more might be in a Condition to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſo much Pow'r to it ſelf. Yet a Difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was it for him to effect his Purpoſes, for the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> infinite in number, made its Cauſe their own, and the Court had Sufficiently perceiv'd by what had happen'd, that there was no imprifoning any of its Members with Impunity, wherefore he took another Courſe, which was to block up <hi>Paris,</hi> hoping the <hi>Pariſians</hi> would no ſooner find Scarcity and Dearneſs in their Town, but that they would attribute their Miſeries to thoſe they then ſtil'd their Protectors. The Deſign was Great, this Prince having but Seav'n or Eight thouſand Men, but his Paſſion ſhowing him more things eaſy than they really were, he prevail'd with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to Strike in with this Reſolution, by the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57147:120"/>
means of the Abbot <hi>de la Riviere,</hi> to whom he promis'd that the Court wou'd abandon the Prince of <hi>Conti's</hi> Intereſts at <hi>Rome</hi> for the giving him ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This Reſolution being taken, they caus'd the King to leave <hi>Paris</hi> with the Duke <hi>D'Anjou</hi> his Brother, and the Queen carry'd him to <hi>St Germain en Laye,</hi> to ſee from thence, as from off a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, what wou'd be the reſult of ſo great an Enterprize. In the mean while the Grandees were ſollicited by each ſide to declare themſelves, and the Parliament allur'd-in ſome of them dayly to come and offer it their Service, for they did not ſpeak their Intentions to be againſt the King, on the Contrary they publiſh'd Manifeſts, by which they made appear that the Cardinal to ſtretch the Royal Authority too far ſhock'd all the orders of the Kingdom, and brought the State within an ace of it's Ruine. Beſides the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who had embrac'd it's Party, as I have already hinted, the Duke <hi>d'Elboeuf,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others had already declar'd themſelves in it's favour. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was preſs'd to do the ſame with his Army, and the Duke <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> expecting theſe Commotions wou'd make way for his Reſtauration in <hi>Sedan,</hi> never ceas'd ſolliciting him to draw near <hi>Paris.</hi> He was Deaf to his Perſuaſions, as long as there were any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in the Field, but ſeeing the Peace made, he began to think it no ſuch Criminal buſineſs to improve his Brothers Pretenſions, joyn'd to this that he was piqu'd againſt the Cardinal, who, after ſuch long Services, had newly refus'd him a favour he had requir'd of him for one of his Friends. The Cardinal, diſtruſting his Reſentment, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſpatcht away <hi>Hervart,</hi> Controlleur General of the Finances, to his Army; and <hi>Hervart,</hi> by the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57147:121"/>
means of his Money, having gain'd the Colonels, they abandoned the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> tho' they had promis'd his Excellency to aſſiſt him in all his Undertakings. <hi>Hervart's</hi> Deſign was after this to have ſeiz'd on his Perſon, but having notice giv'n him by an Officer, he ſtept aſide betimies, and made his Eſcape. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> knowing his Experience, did all in their Pow'r to get him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>France</hi> in the Head of one of their Armies; but as things were not long without coming to an Accommodation, they cou'd not derive all the Advantages they expected from theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Blockade of <hi>Paris</hi> made ſo numerous a People Clamour, and perceiving a Scarcity on the very firſt day of the March, above half of 'em repented of what they had done; however now it was too late, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in whom reſided the Sovereign Authority, not being reduc'd to ſuch great Diſtreſs, far from talking of humbling themſelves paſs'd a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt againſt the Cardinal; but the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> without ſtopping thus at ſuch frivolous things, proceeded from menaces to deeds, and the <hi>Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And indeed an infinite Number of People departed out of this Great City, that having repell'd them with two or three Squadrons, he Surpriz'd his own Party, as well as the nemies by ſo Extraordinary a Boldneſs; This having favour'd the Duke <hi>de Châtillon</hi>'s at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, he won the firſt Retrenchments with a ſingular Bravery: But when there was but one Barricade
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57147:121"/>
more to force, he receiv'd a Musket-ſhot, of which he dy'd the next day, to the great grief of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who lov'd him ſufficiently to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd him the greateſt Employments. His Diſaſter did not hinder the Royaliſts from making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Barricade; but this Burrough was of too ſmall Cenſequence to comfort the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> for the loſs he had had. There were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other petty Engagements to gain or defend Other Poſts, but they were all Diſadvantageous to the Parliament, which as much enhanc'd the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Glory, as it leſſen'd that of the Generals that had undertaken its Defence. The <hi>Pariſians</hi> who had dayly promiſes of having the Paſſages open'd, knew not what to ſay of all this, and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd aloud enough againſt the Parliament, to give occaſion to fear they wou'd abandon it. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſay publickly that the Peace was preferable to ſo Unhappy a War, and the Parliament not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Capacity to continue it, wou'd willingly have found out a favourable means to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into its Duty. Of all the Perſons of Quality that were in its Party, there was not one but had Commerce at Court, none of 'em thus ſtanding out, but to reap the more Advantage. Thus now were they the Impediments to the Concluſion of the Peace: Nevertheleſs not a man of 'em wou'd be the firſt to propoſe it, for fear ſuch a tender might be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to his Fortune: But the Court whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt requir'd the appeaſing theſe troubles with the ſooneſt, ſent an Herald to the Parliament with a Letter, and the Parliament Embracing that Occaſion to make its Peace, ſent back the Herald with his Letter, under Colour that Heralds being only ſent to Sovereign Princes, and to Enemies, they had neither of thoſe Qualities to receive him; but that

if it pleaſed the King they wou'd ſend Deputies to <hi>St Germain</hi> to be inform'd of his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Queen-Mother was too ſagacious to miſs of perceiving from whence theſe Submiſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, but labouring under the Apprehenſion, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might improve theſe Diſorders, to whom the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> had allready ſent an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ſhe took that Occaſion by the foretop to make propoſalls of Accommodation; they agreed upon a Congreſs at <hi>Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l,</hi> and at length after ſome Conteſts on Both ſides. a Treaty was made, which brought ſome Appearance of Serenity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, becauſe the Minds of the Grandees were poſſeſs'd with too much Ambition to leave the People long in Quiet. A generall Amneſty was granted to thoſe that had been tampering in this Affair, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> returning by this Means, he kept Cloſe about the Prince, who after ſuch Signal Services had reaſon to Expect Complyance from the Court to all his Deſires. During all theſe hub-bubs, the Enemies had Caus'd the Siege of <hi>Cambray</hi> to be rais'd, which the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> had attack'd with all his forces, and they recover'd the Towns of <hi>Ypres</hi> and of <hi>St. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> with ſome Other Poſts on that ſide. All theſe Places had been ſo ill Deſended, that it's incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how much Weakneſs, not to ſay Cowardice, our Men ſhew'd in thoſe Occaſions. But all theſe Loſſes wou'd have been quickly repair'd, without the Civill Warr which began more ſiercely for the Reaſons I am going to deduce. What the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> had newly done in favour of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, produced two effects; One that this Prince pretended all was owing to his Deſervings; the Other, that the Cardinal ſeeing he was nearer to be ſatisfy'd, reſolv'd upon getting ridd of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57147:122"/>
he was going to fall under. For that purpoſe he inſtill'd a jealouſy into him of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo farr as to perſuade his Highneſs, the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs</hi> had a deſign upon his Life. The Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> that did not love them over-much before, redoubl'd his averſion for them, and they not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in ſafety at leaſt without joining themſelves to the Cardinal, they diving into his Sentiments, forgot the hatred they had for his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency. The Cardinal finding his Advantage in treating with them, did not boggle on his ſide to follow that Courſe; Inſomuch that the only difficulty lay in ingaging the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> or rather <hi>la Riviere,</hi> who was entirely devoted to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> upon his giving him his Promiſe to Serve him, as has been allready mention'd, in obtaining him the Cardinals Cap. But the Coadjutour being in no ill terms with this Duke, having found the means to inject into his Royal Highneſs a jealouſy of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who had had the imprudence ſome days afore to beat an Officer of his Guards, He made him Swear he would not reveal o the Queen what he had to tell him, and after having taken his Oath, which he caus'd him to make upon the Bible, he propos'd to him the Securing the Perſon of the Prince of <hi>Cordé</hi> of that of the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and of the Duke <hi>de Longueville</hi> their Brother-in Law. And indeed this feat was not to be done at twice, becauſe there had been danger in Confining ſome without All. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> after having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſc'd in the Reaſons the Coadjutour brought him, to make bim approve of this Deſign, conferr'd with the Cardinal, and the thing having been reſolv'd on between them two, they purpoſely brought a Cauſe into Debate, then depending in the Council, for one of the Duke of <hi>Longueville's</hi> Relations,

hoping they would all three meet there for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the mean while, the Guards were doubl'd, but that this might not give the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> any ſuſpicion, he had a forg'd Secret paulm'd upon him, as under the Roſe, ſo as that he thought it only with intent of Securing certain Perſons that held inſolent Diſcourſes againſt the Preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Yet he had notice from ſeveral Parts not to go to the <hi>Palais-Royal,</hi> and that there was ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt his Perſon; but his Deſtiny hurrying him into the Precipice, he was Secur'd in the Queens Cloſet, with the Prince <hi>de Conti,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Longueville.</hi> He was committed into the hands of the Count <hi>de Mieſſens,</hi> who at the head of Sixteen <hi>Gens-d'armes,</hi> conducted him to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> taking his way thro' the field, leaſt by going thro' the Town ſome Accident might befall him. As ſoon as this News was ſpread about <hi>Paris,</hi> His friends, fearing to be involv'd in his Misfortune, fled their Ways, ſome into <hi>Normandy,</hi> Others into <hi>Guienne,</hi> in hopes of Cauſing thoſe two Provinces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Queens forecaſt render'd all their Deſigns Abortive, ſo as that there wou'd not have been the leaſt Buſtle or Commotion, if the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had receiv'd new Outrages from the Cardinal, His Eminency having refus'd him the Government of <hi>Avergne</hi> after having promis'd it him, had not Repair'd to <hi>Stenay,</hi> a Place giv'n to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> as a Reward for his Services. He had ſo little Money when he left <hi>Paris,</hi> that he had not wherewithall to perform his Journey; But in <hi>Champagne</hi> he met with a Gentleman at his Devotion, who gave him Six Hundred <hi>Golden-Lewiſſes.</hi> The Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Stenay</hi> in a few days after with her Jewels, which ſhe offer'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to raiſe Forces,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57147:123"/>
and 'for the more efficacions endeavouring the Freedom of her Brothers and her Husband. As the Money that cou'd be rais'd upon them was not ſufficient for ſo great a Deſign, they reſolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſending an Agent to the Arch-Duke. But while they were in expectation of his Anſwer, the Viſcount <hi>de Tu enne</hi> not being proof againſt the Charms of that Princeſs, fell in Love with her Highneſs. She was of a Complexion extremely tender, and of which ſeveral Perſons neither of his Merit nor Quality had had Inſtances: But ſome reaſon I know not of rendring him more Unhappy than others, ſhe was not contented with being Cruel to him, but ſhe alſo paſt railleries upon his Paſſion with <hi>la Mouſſaye,</hi> Governour of <hi>Stenay,</hi> ſo as that inſtead of continuing to love her, he ſlighted her extremely. At length came th' Arch-Duke's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and being conformable to expectation, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> departed with ſome Troups that were at his diſpoſal to go joyn the Body of an Army the Arch-Duke was to commit to his Conduct. They Conferr'd and Conſulted together what Courſe they had beſt to take, and having laid their meaſures, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> entred <hi>France,</hi> while that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had Correſpondencies in his own Country, advantag'd himſelf of ſo promiſing a juncture. The Marquis <hi>de la Ferte Seneterre</hi> was ſent againſt the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> while that the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> who had been ſent for from <hi>Italy,</hi> march'd againſt the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> This Prince's Deſign was to draw as near as he cou'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſeize on the Paſſes of the Rivers, and to advance with Two Thouſand Horſe as far as <hi>Vincennes,</hi> from whence he pretended eaſily to free the Princes. And indeed he had already got Poſſeſſion of all
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57147:124"/>
the Paſſes as far as <hi>Vela-Ferté Milon,</hi> when by the Treachery of the Count <hi>de</hi>—the Arch-Dukes Favourite, who had a Penſion of a Hundred Thouſand Livres from the Cardinal, and to whom the Arch-Duke had reveal'd the Secret, the Princes were remov'd to <hi>Marcouſſis,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Havre de Grace.</hi> This Count had alſo Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at the Court by the means of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Chevreuſe,</hi> with whom he had had a Charming Engagement, at the time of her being at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> under the Reign of the Late King, and ſhe had procur'd him this Penſion in Acknowledgement for the Pleaſant Paſtime he had procur'd her during her abode in <hi>Flanders:</hi> But tho' this Penſion was ſo conſiderable, the Cardinal did not grudge his money after having receiv'd ſo wholeſome an Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having miſs'd his Aim, bruſh'd back the the ſame way he came, and went and poſted himſelf near <hi>Sompais,</hi> where the Arch-Duke was arriv'd in Perſon. The Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> had Coaſted him in his Retreat, and the two Armies Skirmiſh'd dayly without daring to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a Battle; for on th'one ſide th'Arch-Duke was afraid, that if he loſt the Day, he ſhou'd find it difficult to make his Retreat, and on th'other the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> left the very Heart of the Kingdom for a Prey, if Fortune prov'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to him. While that ſuch weighty Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations with-held both ſides, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd to the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis's</hi> Army, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him order to Fight, he ſtaid in the Camp where he lay upon the bare Ground, without fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fully his Purple.

for th'event, Break of day was no ſooner come, than that the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> drew-up his Troups in Battle-array; The Arch-Duke and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> did the like on their ſide, and the two armies being ſeparated only a Musket-Shot from one another, quickly came very furiouſly to Blows. The Succeſs was equal on both ſides at the firſt bruſh, the Arch-Duke's Right Wing, where he was in Perſon, was put to Rout, while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> Commanding the Left, broke the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis's</hi> Right Wing. The Viſcount thinking to improve the advantage he had, &amp; to compleat the Battle at a blow, attack'd the Enemies left Wing; but this being in good order made ſuch a Defence, as gave the Right leiſure to rally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Arch-Duke having not been able to do the like with his, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was quickly encompaſs'd on all ſides: He did wonders to diſpute the victory, but having been forſaken by the Arch-Duke, nay and by a part of thoſe that fought under him, he was forc'd to Court his ſafety in his flight. He had not gone a League when he perceiv'd himſelf purſu'd by a Squadron, which made him ſay to thoſe about him, that there was no other Courſe to take than to face about upon the Enemies: Theſe his followers, being all Officers and men of great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, having declar'd to him they were ready to do all he thought expedient, they marchall'd themſelves in order, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> leading them forthwith to the Charge, they utterly routed this Squadron, the moſt of whoſe Troupers were kill'd upon the Spot. Having thus got rid of this importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Attendance, they continu'd their way with the more freedom; but to this inconveniency there Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded another, which though not ſo dangerous, was not the leſs preſſing.

The Cardinal, thro' the Aſcendant he had got over this Princeſſes mind, had found the means to render this Duke ſuſpected, and he had undergone a hard Captivity, inſtead of the favours he might reaſonably have Expected. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had happily made his Eſcape out of the <hi>Donjon</hi> of <hi>Vincennes;</hi> but was ſo animated againſt the Cardinal, that his Sufferings were as preſent as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57147:125"/>
if he ſtill endured them: He was become Head o the Party of the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> but had little Commerce with the Court, which made him gratefull to the People, having withall Popular Manners. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his mind wou'd have been very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for the Liberty of the Princes, if another thing had not been a great Obſtacle. He was a Sworn Enemy of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who on his ſide having declared himſelf abſolutely againſt his Houſe, was partly the Occaſion of his Misfortune, for he had openly oppos'd the Match which the Cardinal wou'd have made 'tween one of his Nieces and the Duke of <hi>Mercaeur;</hi> this Dukes Eldeſt Brother, and the Cardinal had reſented this ſo highly that he had haſten'd his Ruine. The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> being in th' Intereſts of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and having marry'd a Siſter of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> might indeed, be a mediatour between them, but he was not in over-good terms with his Brother-in-Law, for that his Carriage was not over-kind to the Siſter. He was in Love with <hi>Madam de Châtillon,</hi> and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Complaiſance to his Miſtreſs, or that he did not Love his Wife, he refrain'd her Bed. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s friends fearing leſt his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment ſhou'd be very long, and not ſeeing any ſpeedier Remedy than to come to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and his Cabal, they went to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and engag'd him to remain ſome time without ſeeing <hi>Madam de Châ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon.</hi> This Prince did ſtill more, He lay with his Wife, and having hereby regain'd her Affection, She reconcil'd him with the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> her Brother. This good underſtanding having made way for what was deſired, the Affair of the Princes was brought into Deliberation: But as the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> demanded Conditions, which the Duke

               </gap> an Occaſion to ruine him, all theſe Pow'rs combin'd together to effect that Deſign. The Parliament paſs'd Arreſts againſt him, the Duke <hi>d'Orleans</hi> told the Queen that he wou'd come no more to the Council as long as he ſhou'd be near her Perſon, and the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> tho' they durſt not talk alltogether ſo loud, yet ſaid enough to make the Queen appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſome fatall Revolution. In the mean while, they all demanded the Princes Freedom, as a thing on which depended the Peace of the State; and it was a wonder to ſee that thoſe who had alone
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57147:126"/>
Conſpir'd to raviſh them of it, ſhew'd themſelves ſo Zealous for their recovering it. As the Parliament perceiv'd the Queen had much ado to reſolve upon the Cardinals remove, and to the Princes being ſet at Liberty, it redoubl'd its Arreſts againſt that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and paſs'd one in favour of the Priſoners; ſo as that the Queen apprehending ſome Diſorder, conſented at the long run, that the Cardinal ſhou'd go off, and the Princes be releas'd out of Priſon. Yet this notwithſtanding ſhe was ſome days without, Expediting an Order under the Privy Signet neceſſary for their Liberty; but being preſs'd ſhe cou'd no longer refuſe it. The Cardinal being the cauſe of this Delay, tho' abſent from Court, having notice of what Occur'd, receiv'd at the ſame time an Order juſt like that which had been Expedited, and was dated two days before, and departed immediately for <hi>Havre,</hi> he pretended the Princes ſhou'd have th' obligation of their Freedom to him; Yet he durſt not come into their Preſence till he had firſt pumpt them by the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont.</hi> But the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had too much Wit to be ſlurr'd upon in this manner, and having told his mind to that Mareſchal, his friend, the Mareſchal fear'd he ſhou'd not prevail with him to ſee the Cardinal. In the mean while, the Mareſchal ply'd him with ſo many reaſons, and repreſented to him ſo many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies in this refuſal, that this Prince at length conſented to his Introduction. The Cardinal enter'd trembling, and ſetting about Excuſing himſelf, the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> perceiving he wou'd make a Blundering Buſineſs on't, interrupted him, ſaying, that all thoughts were to be diſcarded of what had paſs'd, He invited them to drink together, and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being loth to do it, as longing to be out, wou'd not ſuffer any thing to be dreſs'd.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57147:127"/>
But calling for a reliſhing Bit, and taking a Glaſs, he drunk the Cardinals Health, and then roſe up immediately. Each having done the like, tho' they had not had time to put a Crumb into their Mouths, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> went down out of his Chamber, the Cardinal keeping Cloſe at his Elbow, deſiring him to remember upon Occaſion that his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the work of the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> and not his, that he it was on the Contrary that contributed to his Freedom, and that if his Advice had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, his Highneſs had obtain'd it ſooner. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> made him no great Compliment, and taking Coach he drove away for <hi>Rouen,</hi> from whence he got to <hi>Paris</hi> in three days. All the Town went out four Leagues to meet him, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> went to receive him at <hi>St. Denis,</hi> where he preſented the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and the Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutour to him. He Embrac'd 'em both, and after having thank'd 'em all for procuring him his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he mounted into the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Coach, wherein went allſo the Prince <hi>de Conti,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Longueville,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and the Coadjutour. They went to alight at the <hi>Palais-Royal,</hi> follow'd by an infinite Number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who proclaim'd by their Huzza's and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the joy they had for their Return: They were receiv'd by the King and Queen-Mother, with ſeeming Marks of Good will; But this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Cardinals Spirit ſtill reign'd at Court, though his Perſon was at a Diſtance; this Manifeſted it ſelf Two Days after by the Reproaches the Queen made certain Perſons that went to viſit the Prince of <hi>Condé;</hi> Nay ſhe happen'd to bolt out publickly, that the Court was become a Deſart now ſince the Prince of <hi>Condé's</hi> Return, which being told again to this
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57147:127"/>
Prince, he conceived ſuſpicions, as by what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd afterwards, were found not to be ill grounded. In the mean time the Exiles return'd, that is to ſay, thoſe that withdrew upon the Princes Impriſonment. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> return'd alſo, tho' the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had endeavour'd to get him ſtay with them by a Thouſand fair offers, with which they thought to have tempted his Fidelity; but this Prince made great difference between ſuch an Action as this, and that he had done. Being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> receiv'd him with open Arms, and as a man that had for his ſake expos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all ſorts of Danger: But ſome days after, this Prince appear'd more cold and reſerv'd thro' the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville's</hi> perſuaſions, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining he had aſpers'd her with poynant Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, when he was with the Arch-Duke. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> finding by this unjuſt carriage how things went, and how unworthy it was after what he had done for him ſo lately, thought not fitting to enter upon great Juſtifications, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on that occaſion to divorce himſelf from him, he made his Court more aſſiduouſly to the Queen who had giv'n him a favourable Reception, and let nothing ſlip that might wed him to her Service. In this Deſign ſhe caus'd ſome Offers to be made him by <hi>Meſſieurs de Lionne</hi> and <hi>le Tellier,</hi> who in the Cardinals Abſence were her moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Agents, as being very affectionate to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal: But he made anſwer, that his humour was not to ſell his Services; that his Refuſal did not however proceed from the deſire of embracing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intereſts; that he ſhou'd thence-forward eſpouſe thoſe of that Princeſs as much or more than thoſe in whom ſhe moſt Confided, and that when he ſhould have thereby merited ſome Reward, he wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57147:128"/>
it more willingly than at preſent, that he own'd himſelf unworthy of her Bounties. The Queen knowing the occaſion he had to complain of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> found ſomething ſo handſome in this Anſwer that ſhe us'd ſtill further endeavours to gain him; but he neither chang'd his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor Stile, which the Queen attributed to his Policy, imagining that what he did to be only that he might not come to an abſolute Breach with the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> In the mean while mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were more than ever embroil'd at Court, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had been intercepted from the Cardinal to the Abbot <hi>Fouquet,</hi> and from th' Abbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In effect this Prince having forgot that his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had only been mediated and obtain'd on this Condition, dayly found Pretexts to retard that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance, and the leaſt delay being Suſpicious in the then preſent poſture of Affairs, the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> fell into inconceivable Diffidencies, and ſuch as were not without Foundation.

no longer ſhew'd himſelf ſo ſcrupulous; but as there wou'd have been weakneſs in him to be the Author of the Cardinals Return, he that had made him undergo ſo harſh a Captivity, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to clear himſelf in ſome manner in the world, that the Queen ſhou'd not oblige him to contribute thereto, and that ſhe ſhou'd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his not interpoſing any obſtacle. This was all the Queen deſired, thus it prov'd no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. But another made the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> more at a loſs, which was to diſengage himſelf handſomly from the Match of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Chevreuſe,</hi> with whom the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> being fall'n in Love, it was not eaſy to diſſwade him from it. As the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had kept all very Secret, he had Negotiated with the Queen, it had been difficult for the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> to ſhrift into it; but perceiving by his Deportment, that there muſt need be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than ordinary in Agitation, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to make ſo ſure of the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> as to prevent his giving ear to the Counſels that ſhou'd be inculcated into him. For this purpoſe they reſolv'd to proceed to the Marriage, and ſecretly ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Diſpenſation, by reaſon of the Kindred between thoſe Parties. The Coadjutour being Allmighty in <hi>Paris</hi> for theſe ſorts of matters, they pretended by his means that the Diſpenſation being once come they ſhould be marry'd without the Privity of any. The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> to content his Paſſion further'd their Deſigns, Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> to ſee her Daughter a Princeſs of the Blood deſired it, and the Daughter long'd for nothing More than to be Marry'd. In a word all <hi>Paris</hi> had an Extreme deſire to ſee this Matter brought to a Concluſion, when the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having intimation of what occur'd, told the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> that being ſo well ſhap'd and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57147:129"/>
handſome a Perſon, he had reaſon to ſeek after ſome further Pleaſingneſs; that his Marriage was going to adorn his head more than he imagin'd, that he wou'd have horns loaded with Mitres, Arms and Corner-Caps, and in fine by taking <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Chevreuſe</hi> for his Wife, he was going to make ſure to himſelf of the Church, of the Nobleſs and of the third Eſtate. Thereupon he pointed out to him the Coadjutour, the Marqueſs <hi>de Noirmouſtier</hi> and <hi>Commartin</hi> to be his Miſtreſſes Intimate friends; and as the Diſtance is not great from a great Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a great Jelouſy, the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was ſo Strongly ſeiz'd with the later, that he reproach'd his Brother with not having giv'n him notice ſooner. Nothing at all had been known of this Converſation, but for the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> he being too much ſmitten to hold his Peace; He diſcourſt his Miſtreſs upon the Matter, but in ſuch bitter terms, as provoak'd her. <hi>Madam de Chevreuſe</hi> ſhar'd as farr as became her in her Daughters Reſentment, as well as all the Caball; but the Coadjutour, a Man naturally violent, Suffer'd himſelf to be hurry'd to ſo great an Exceſs of Anger, that if he had been of the Quality and Profeſſion of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> he wou'd not have ſtaid ſo long without taking his Revenge. For want of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he made his Party reſolve upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the Means to ruine that Prince, and having none more certain than by ſalving up Matters again with the Queen, he made all the Advances, and thereby break the Treaty which the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> had rough-drawn with her. The Queen, to keep ſome Meaſures nevertheleſs, pretended that <hi>le Tellier</hi> and <hi>de Lionne</hi> had Engag'd her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond th' Orders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he had giv'n them, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd her ſelf to leſs advantageous Offers, ſhe propos'd ſtill ſome Accommodation, Suſpecting he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57147:129"/>
wou'd not abate the leaſt of what had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him. In effect this Prince ſeeing he had been paulm'd upon, was rather contriving to engage the Queen in New Troubles, than to accept of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals tendred him, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his Deſign, for the gaining him, he buckled his Spirit to all ſorts of Complaiſances. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who for ſome little Amours was out with her Husband, who dayly threatned her to carry her into his Government of <hi>Normandy;</hi> Nay, to ſhut her up, did in the mean while all ſhe cou'd by the means of her Lovers, to whet him on to raiſe a Civil War, imagining that in a time of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Diſorder, they wou'd have ſomething elſe to do than to mind her Conduct. Thus the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being Excited by his Reſentment, by the Intereſt of his Siſter, whoſe Reputation he had a mind to Spare in the Eyes of the Publique, and by the Perſuaſion of his friends, employ'd his thoughts wholly upon gaining new Creatures, and to aſſure himſelf of thoſe over whom he formerly had Pow'r. As he ſtood not in the ſame terms with the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> as he had done before his Return, he grew fervent again in his Regards for him, hoping this new Ardour wou'd produce its effect: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> without unboſoming himſelf either one way or th' Other, receiv'd as became him the marks of his Amity which not ſatisfying the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> he Engag'd him in a Deſign of Pleaſure he was to be preſent at in the <hi>Marais,</hi> hoping that amidſt Wine and Debauchery, wherein the greateſt Sages commonly diſcover their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it wou'd be eaſy for him to conjecture what was from him to be Expected. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> wou'd not deny him going thither; but ſhew'd himſelf ſo reſerv'd, that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:57147:130"/>
not being able to fix any judgment that tended to his Advantage, was oblig'd to induce him to a Clearer Explication of his Sentiments. Whereupon Perſons having ſpoken to him on his behalf, he made them anſwer, that he was his Highneſſes Servant, but that his Highneſs had us'd him ſo ill, that he was not reſolv'd to Eſpouſe his Intereſt to the Prejudice of his own; that he had not thought of his friends ſince his return, tho' he might have done them Service; that on the Contrary he had affected to rob 'em of the Knowledge of all he had treated of under-hand, as if he had been afraid of their Partaking in his good fortune, as they had done in his bad; that to have an Occaſion, not to do any thing for him, he had laid hold of ſome ill-grounded Complaints of Madam <hi>de Longueville,</hi> tho' he had let him know that ſhe it was that had held Diſcourſes to her own Diſadvantages, that he had run himſelf over Head and Ears in Debt upon his Account, and that being lately Marry'd, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him to mind more narrowly his Affairs. In effect, he had newly Marry'd the Daughter of the Duke <hi>de la Force,</hi> an Extreme Virtuous Lady, and more conſiderable thereby, than by a thouſand other Qualities, which nevertheleſs render'd her very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable, for beſides her being of one of the Beſt Families in <hi>France,</hi> ſhe had a vaſt fortune, and was beſides handſom enough to invite the Affection of a Husband. The Viſcount <hi>de Turennes</hi> anſwer having made the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> preſume that it wou'd be difficult for him to Engage him on his ſide; Yet wou'd he try all ſorts of Ways rather than be baulk'd of his hopes; and as the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> did not ſeem ſo Malecontent, tho' he wou'd not give him any poſitive Word, he tender'd him a World of Advantageous things for them both;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57147:130"/>
he deſir'd the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> to hint it to his Brother, for the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe of Sixteen Hundred Troupers, with his Regiment of Foot, which render'd him ſtill the more conſiderable to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> whoſe poſture of Affairs at that time needed both Troups and Friends. Theſe offers mounted to a Hundred Thouſand Crowns each, and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> Engag'd to procure them, beſides this ample Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom he was allready in Treaty. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> ſuffer'd himſelf to be inſenſibly lur'd by theſe fair Promiſes, and conſidering that his Houſe had at all times been link'd to that of <hi>Condé,</hi> he endeavour'd to gain his Brother, who took other meaſures; for he had Commerce with the Queen, who to take them both off from the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> made them on her ſide a very advantageous Offer. However they were both deep in Debt, and for the paying their Creditors, needfull was it to procure themſelves the beſt fortune they could, they did not abſolutely break off with the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> that they might Whet the Queen to do ſtill more. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> knowing their Negotiations, and foreſeeing that, conſidering the State things were in at that time, the Queen wou'd not let them Scape her, preſs'd the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> to tell him what they both requir'd, that ſo this Affair might with the ſooneſt be termina<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

The Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> who by the means of his Daughter was in the Prince of <hi>Condé's</hi> Intereſts, ſaid the ſame thing to the Duke <hi>de Bouillon;</hi> and being at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to come to a Declaration, he demanded two hundred thouſand Crowns for himſelf and his Brother; that the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> ſhould paſs the like Arreſts againſt the Cardinal as that of <hi>Paris</hi> had done, that ſo they might be thereby
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57147:131"/>
aſſured that <hi>Guienne,</hi> whither they pretended to carry the Warr, wou'd ſide with the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé;</hi> that they ſhou'd have in the Places, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him the ſame pow'r he had there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that, in fine, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhou'd give them Sureties for a hundred and fifty thouſand Livres Penſion for them Both. The Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> found theſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Extreme great, Eſpecially in reguard of the Places, for they pretended to no leſs than the Power of appointing or depoſing Officers; but in ſhort the State of things obliging them to paſs over all ſort of Conſiderations, they agreed to all, and the Hour was ſet for Signing the Treaty at the <hi>Palais d'Orleans</hi> whither the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> repair'd. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having ſtruck up an Engagement with the Queen, and pretending his Duty oblig'd him rather to take her Part, than that of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who aim'd at Embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State, told his Brother that he had not giv'n his Word to ſign any Treaty, nay that he advis'd him to turn as well as himſelf to the Queens ſide, and having both ſought out expedients to come off handſomly from this matter, they treated with the Queen, who caus'd the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> to be declar'd Miniſter of State, &amp; deſtin'd the Command of the Armies to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> During theſe Tranſactions matters grew to that exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between the Queen and the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> that the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> propos'd to her to rid her hands of him by a Violent way. The Queen being a good-natur'd Princeſs and at a diſtance from ſuch ſorts of Sentiments, rejected this Propoſall, but concluded afterwards on that of ſecuring his Perſon. The <hi>Frondeurs</hi> took upon them to make the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> agree to the Matter, he being
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57147:131"/>
properly ſpeaking a Weather-Cock for all Winds; and having atchiev'd what they had promis'd, nothing now remain'd but to contrive th' occaſion; which was ſome time after Mett with when the Queen leaſt expected it. Going the Tour with the King, ſhe there found the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> all alone in his Coach, but not having had her Wit ſo ready as to make uſe on't, ſhe miſs'd a ſtroke that wou'd have prevented many Diſorders. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having had inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Deſign that was upon his Perſon, trembl'd when he ſaw he had ſo imprudently giv'n himſelf up into the hands of his Enemies, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ways preſently, he reſolv'd to have more Caut<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on for the future. However he fell from one extremity into th'other, for having notice that two Troups of Guards were Commanded out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Germain,</hi> he fancy'd that it was to inveſt his Houſe, and not willing to ſtand to that extremity, he took Horſe, and advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Chartreux,</hi> the neareſt place to the Hoſtel <hi>de Condé</hi> to get into the fields; This Alarum'd him extremely, having heard at a diſtance Horſes coming towards him, but it was found to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, this noiſe being only caus'd by Market-People, bringing their Proviſions to <hi>Paris.</hi> Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light being come he got upon a high place to ſee what he cou'd diſcover, and then perceiv'd that thoſe Troups, which had put him into that fright, were going to <hi>Tournelle</hi> to aſſiſt with main force the Loyalifts that were affronted, for in the then unhappy State of Affairs, every one took ſuch free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms as wou'd have been ſharply puniſh'd at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. He was at a great loſs whether it was beſt for him to return to the Hoſtel of <hi>Condé,</hi> or purſue his firſt Deſign of retiring from the Town.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57147:132"/>
But as he had already undergone a hard Captivity, it made him more Suſceptible of fear than he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wou'd have been, ſo he choſe to repair to <hi>St. Maur,</hi> one of his Houſes, but three ſmall Leagues diſtant from <hi>Paris.</hi> His Retreat being generally known, ſo great a number of Perſons of Quality went to offer him their Services, that he thought himſelf more in a State of Creating Fear than of Entertaining Apprehenſions The Queen ſent the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> to him, under Colour of asking him th'occaſion of his Retreat, but in Reality to work him to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd it wou'd be more eaſy for her to Surprize him: But the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> bearing an ill will to the Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi> for not having Reveal'd the Deſign in hand to Secure his Perſon, to which he was Privy, wav'd entring into any Parley with him, and only told him that the Cardinals Spirit ſtill reign'd too much at Court, for any relyance to be had in the Queens Word. However to place his Family in ſafety, he ſent his Wife and only Son to <hi>Montrond,</hi> a ſtrong Place he had in <hi>le Berry,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Longueville</hi> being deſirous to free her ſelf from the Apprehenſion ſhe juſtly labour'd under, of her Husbands deſigning to puniſh her for her Infidelities to him, went along with her Siſter-in-Law. Thus the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having no longer the trouble of a Wife and Son, the Weakneſs of the former's Sex, and the Greenneſs of the others Years, made him dread ill Conſequences in caſe he was forc'd to a Suddain Departure, he returned again to <hi>Paris</hi> to re-animate his friends, Eſpecially ſuch as were Members of Parliament, whom endeavours were us'd to Spirit away from him. He found the thing more difficult than he Expected; for beſides the Credit the Coadjutour had in that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57147:132"/>
Aſſembly, the firſt Preſident to whom he had done an ill turn render'd him as much ſuſpected as he cou'd. Yet as the Preſent juncture of Affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd his ſeeming united with this Body, from whom the People ſeem'd, if a Man may ſo ſay, to borrow its Motions. He aſſiſted at all its Aſſemblies, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd One, and Careſs'd Another, and appear'd very wide from that Violence which formerly made him threaten one of its Members. The Coadjutour who would have thought it wou'd have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning the Party, for him not to be preſent there too aſſiſted at it in like manner as Councellour of Honour, a Quality attributed to the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Paris:</hi> But knowing the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to be perſuaded, that him it was that wou'd have inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated into the Queen the Cauſing him to be Kill'd, he went not thither without being well attended. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> not knowing with what Intention he did this, for his part he invited his friends to do the like with him, and Each ſide bore Arms, nor more nor leſs than if they were going to War. The <hi>Queen</hi> ſiding in this Occaſion, wou'd have the Coadjutour to be Guarded by a Brigade of <hi>Gens d'armes,</hi> and of the Kings Light Horſe, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> that knowing what ſhe did to be rather out of the hatred ſhe bore him, than out of any Love ſhe had for th' Other, more then ever thwarted her Intentions. The only deſign of this Princeſs tended to procure the Cardinals Return, but ſhe had difficulties to overcome on all ſides before that cou'd be effected; For tho' the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> were ſeemingly in a ſtrict Union with her Majeſty, they had a very different Aim; They were in the Intereſts of <hi>Châteauneuf,</hi> Keeper of the Seales, who after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poſſeſ'd the firſt Place in the Council, had try'd a Reverſe of fortune that had diſtanc'd him
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57147:133"/>
thence; Yet the moſt part did not deſpair of his being reſtor'd, and not a Perſon beſides the Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutour but wiſht it, as not being of a humour to leave to another what made him do ſo many things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming his Character. However being one day at the <hi>Palais</hi> he happen'd into a great perplexity, for going out of the Great Chamber to hinder any Diſorder from happening between his Friends, and thoſe of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> that ſtaid in the Great-Hall, he ſaw himſelf all of a ſuddain Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Swords, and if every Individuall had not retired to his own Company, he wou'd have fancy'd, that not a man of 'em All but had his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the mark of his Revenge. At length having diſtinguiſht his friends from his Foes, he rang'd himſelf among the Former, while that the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucaut</hi> plac'd himſelf at the Head of the Latter. Thus a man wou'd have ſaid they were juſt going to fight; but the fear they were under of diſcrediting their Party in the Parliament, occaſion'd their reſting ſatisfy'd with threatning one another. After this they wou'd both return into the Great Chamber; But as the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucaut</hi> had got the Start, he wayted the others coming behind the Bar-Door, and juſt upon his paſſing he Clapt it ſtrongly to, and Caught his Head between the other half of the Door that remain'd ſhut. The Coadjutour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſchream'd-out as if he had been upon the point of being Aſſaſſinated, and the Parliament being interrupted by all theſe things, was rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving how to appeaſe this Diſorder, than to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate about the matters for which it was Aſſembled. The Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucaut</hi> that he might not ſhock the Parliament, anſwer'd the Complaints the Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutour made immediately againſt him, that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d no Deſign of inſulting him in any manner, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57147:133"/>
that if he had ſhut the Door, it was only to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe of his Party who purſu'd him from wanting Reſpect to ſo Auguſt a Body: But the Reſpect born it was ſo ſmall, that the Duke <hi>de Briſſac,</hi> the Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutours near Relation fell to uſing bitter Words, which the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucaut</hi> wou'd never have ſuffer'd without taking ſatisfaction, if the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> had not interpos'd to bring 'em to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. This was a more vexatious Bus'neſs to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutour than can be imagin'd, he was Univerſally blam'd for offering to meaſure himſelf with the firſt Prince of the Blood, and as his Profeſſion did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to do any thing Violent of which all his Actions had the Appearance, what the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> gave out of him found the more eaſy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, namely that he had a Deſign of Aſſaſſinating him. As the Queen cou'd not doubt of the hatred they bore one another, ſhe look'd upon it as a great piece of Merit from the Coadjutour to her Majeſty; and for th'engaging him to continue as he began, ſhe promis'd him the firſt Cardinals Cap, which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould grant to <hi>France.</hi> Thus in that time of Diſorder and Confuſion, Vice had the Compenſation of Virtue, for ſufficient was it for a man to be in a capacity to make himſelf fear'd by his Intrigues &amp; Cabals, and provided one did not directly thwart the Queens Intentions, he had fair hopes of obtaining any ſort of favour. During theſe Tranſactions, the Parliament being back'd by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who through his natural incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy chang'd his Party as often as his Shirt, dayly perceiving more and more that the Queens whole aim tended to bring about the Cardinals return, who in lieu of diſtancing himſelf from <hi>France,</hi> as ſhe had promis'd, ſtaid at <hi>Liege,</hi> paſs'd new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts againſt him, importing that not any Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57147:134"/>
tho' of the ſame Nation, ſhou'd thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward have admittance into the King's Council. The Queen not daring openly to declare her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, was oblig'd to ſubſcribe to ſo hard a Condition, by cauſing an Edict to be expedited in Conformity with the Arreſt. This did not hinder her however from ſending him money, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> caus'd a Carriage deſign'd for him to be ſtopt, that came from the Provinces bordering upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> where the Blood of the People was not ſpar'd no more than the reſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was laviſht upon him to facilitate his Return. The Cardinal by the means of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney rais'd Forces, and having wherewithall to keep in with his Quondam-Friends, and get new, he Fortify'd his Party as much as he cou'd, and did not yet renounce the hopes he had of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more than ever Potent. The People ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all theſe Novelties, complain'd in the mean while, that for the intereſt of one ſingle man, the whole State was near it's Ruine: but withall moſt of the Grandees were, glad that they had this Pretext given them to render themſelves the more Powerfull, and tho' that amid their Diſobedience they had ever the Publique Good in their Mouth, when it came to the making of Propoſalls, all turn'd upon their Intereſts, and not a Word was there about the Poor People. In the mean while the King entred into his fourteenth year, being the time ſix'd for the Majority of our Kings, and People hop'd that being a Major he might poſſibly apply ſome Remedy to the Evils that afflicted the Realm, principally when he ſhou'd be let know whence they proceeded, and the Means to be made uſe of to put a Stop to them: But the wiſeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected but little Eaſe from that ſide; they ſaid
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57147:134"/>
it to be a great miſtake to believe that a Child foſter'd in the Love of his Mother, and in the hatred of the Princes of the Blood, whom he was made to believe had a Deſign to bereave him of his Crown, had the judgement to diſcern truth from falſhood; that if Our Kings were declar'd Majors at fourteen years of Age, 'twas rather thro' Cuſtom than Reaſon; that well known it was that at that Age a Man was not capable of any great matter; that it was alſo Manifeſt they needed Council more than Ever, by cauſe that beginning to have ſome Intentions, yet without being able to diſtinguiſh what was wholeſome from what inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, they were to be redreſs'd and ſet to Rights when they had made a falſe Step. And in truth this Ceremony was perform'd with more Pomp and Luſtre than Profit, and all the Change there was, conſiſted in there being no more than the Kings name in the Declarations, whereas that of the Queen was there allſo before. But the ſame Maximes, and the ſame Sentiments ſtill appear'd, ſo as that it was plainly ſeen the Peace of the Realm was not hence to be expected. In the mean while the Parliament ſtill continu'd it's Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and not a Week paſs'd without receiving two or three Letters under the Privy Signet; but this did not hinder it from purſuing it's Road, and when it had done what it pretended to, they contented themſelves with remonſtrating to the King th' inconvenience there wou'd be in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Deſires; They ſent him Deputies ever and anon, that ſpoke ſiercely againſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Return, which was whiſper'd up and down, notwithſtanding all th' Aſſurances giv'n to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But at length diverſe Letters that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted having left no room for Doubt, the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57147:135"/>
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> who had long minuted the War took his journey towards <hi>Guyenne,</hi> after having ſent Orders to the Counts <hi>de Tavanes</hi> and <hi>de Marſin</hi> to bring him the Forces that Eſpous'd his Intereſts: By this piece of Treaſon thoſe two Leaders, one of whom commanded in <hi>Champange</hi> and the other in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> left thoſe two Provinces as a Prey, which very much further'd the Affairs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well as the Civil-War, which kindled at the ſame time in ſundry parts of the Kingdom: For ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, either egg'd-on by the Zeal they had for the Intereſts of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> or hoping to advance their Fortune, declar'd themſelves in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Highneſs. The King ſeeing the main of the War was going to fall in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> went into <hi>Poitou,</hi> that ſo he might be the nearer at hand, after having provided for the Frontiers as far forth as his preſent Circumſtances wou'd allow of. During theſe Tranſactions he call'd about him thoſe in whom he cou'd put any Truſt, and having Written to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he repair'd to his Majeſty at <hi>Poitiers.</hi> Since his return from the Enemies, he had ſtaid in his owu Family, where he enjoy'd Eaſe and Quiet; he had endeavour'd to ſet his Affairs to Rights by the means of ſome Benefits he had receiv'd from Court, and ſeeing that in the Troubles that aroſe, a great deal of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was mingl'd with the Pretexts laid hold of to trouble the State, he was very glad in having avoided the Ambuſcades that had been ſo long laid to trepan him. Being arriv'd at <hi>Poitiers</hi> he receiv'd from the King and Queen-Mother all the kind Treatments he cou'd deſire: For beſides their being acquainted with his Merit, as they ſtood in need of him, they did not ſtick ſometimes doing more for him, than they wou'd have done in another
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57147:135"/>
occaſion; the Queen eſpecially embrac'd him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending her Son to him in ſuch terms as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Compaſſion; for ſhe had every moment Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings brought of new Inſurrections, which made her afraid that this bad example might ſeduce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> comforted her the beſt he was able, and having aſſur'd her of his Loyalty, he receiv'd her Orders, which were to go oppoſe the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who with a Body of Seav'n or Eight Thouſand men was on the ſide of <hi>Montargis.</hi> The Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> March'd in the mean while againſt the Province of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> many Towns of which allready repented of their Revolt; for when the buſineſs is Waging War againſt one's own Prince, ſo many things ariſe that were not foreſeen, that one wou'd often wiſh it were again to begin. <hi>Bordeaux</hi> was divided into Factions that were all in Appearance for the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> but were ſo oppoſite one to another, thro' the Private Intereſt of thoſe at the Head, that the City was dayly upon the Point of it's Ruine. The other Towns in the Province after their Capitals example were not in a better Poſture; the moſt part had declar'd themſelves thro' the hatred they bore the Cardinal, but ſeeing the Remedy they thought to have apply'd to their Evils was worſe than the Diſeaſe it ſelf, they complain'd that thoſe they had call'd to their Succours were only come to render them ſtill the more miſerable. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> diſſembled theſe things to his Principal Officers, for ſear they might be pall'd by ſeeing the Weakneſs of his Party: Bur at the long run he cou'd not bar them of the Knowledge of it, by a Sedition that happen'd at <hi>Agen,</hi> wherein he wou'd have put a Garriſon; He found it a difficult buſineſs to diſentangle himſelf handſomly from that matter, whoſe Conſequences he dreaded, as fearing
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57147:136"/>
the other Towns might thereby Square their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. But having terminated things in an amicable manner, tho' a little to his own Diminution, he had news brought him which render'd him again uneaſy. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> had ſome days afore joyn'd the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> with four or five thouſand Men, and pretended, by reaſon of his having the hand at Court of Forreign Princes, to retain allſo that Prerogative in the Army: The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> did not agree to the matter, and tho' Brothers in-Law they had often come to Blows, if thoſe about them had not narrowly Watcht them. This Diviſion was injurious to their Party, and both remain'd without the leaſt Action, while the King drew near <hi>Anjou,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had form'd his Party, thinking to pen him up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and his Adherents. This News gave (as I have already hinted) a great deal of Vexation to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and leſſen'd the joy he had for ſome happy Succeſſes gain'd o'er the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de St. Lue,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> However the time preſent made him leſs uneaſy than the future, he receiv'd dayly new Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how that the miſunderſtanding encreas'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> and fearing that this might at the length produce ſome bad buſineſs, he reſolv'd to march that way, that ſo by his Preſence removing the Subject of Diviſion between thoſe two Leaders, he might by that means ſree himſelf from Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Enterprize was extreme Dangerous, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces, and ſeveral Rivers had he to Croſs, and this journey was to be perform'd without At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, ſo not to abandon <hi>Guyenne;</hi> but his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune having carry'd him thro' all theſe Difficulties, after having evaded ſundry Dangers, he came into the Army of thoſe two Dukes, to the Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57147:136"/>
of all his Adherents. The King had newly reduc'd the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to Reaſon, and was again mounting up the <hi>Loire</hi> to ſecure the Towns ſcituated upon that River. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having joyn'd the Marquis <hi>d'Hocquincourt,</hi> who had been made Mareſchal of <hi>France</hi> for having ſhewn Great Affection to the Cardinal, to meet whom he had been upon the Frontiers, and had Conducted him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to the very Court, Commanded the Army joyntly with him; they were in Quarters where <hi>Hocquincourt</hi> thought himſelf in Safety, as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> far diſtant; But this Prince being deſirous to ſignalize his coming by ſome illuſtrious Action, march'd all the Night, and won two of this Mareſchals Quarters, before he cou'd put himſelf into a Poſture of Defence. At laſt <hi>Hoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quincourt</hi> having re-aſſembled all he could in haſt, in the general fear by reaſon of the night, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd towards the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Plander'd two more of his Quarters, thought to gain the Reſt as Eaſily; His Countenance giving this Prince to underſtand there not to be that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility in the undertaking as he had imagin'd, he made a halt, to give his Men time, that were here and there diſpers'd in Plundering, to rally, and leading them forthwith to the Charge, he Compell'd the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourt</hi> to abandon the Head of a Quarter, and to retreat behind it. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s men ſet fire to't, and pretended to have paſs'd-on further, but the other Quarters had had leiſure to ſtand to their Arms, ſo as that ſaving ſome Equipages that were ſtill taken, the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourt</hi> was quit for what he had loſt; He put his Infantry into <hi>Blenean,</hi> and the Horſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired on another ſide. In the mean while, the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> upon the Notice he had of the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourts</hi> being attack'd, with the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57147:137"/>
utmoſt Expedition he aſſembled all his Quarters, and without ſtaying for his Infantry, he advanc'd within a Hundred Paces of a Wood that was upon the Way; Had he had his Foot with him, he had poſſeſs'd himſelf of it, before the Prince of <hi>Condés</hi> Arrival; but his not being come up, he durſt not Engage his Cavalry in ſo diſadvantageous a Place. The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who after having beaten, as he had done, the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourt,</hi> did not imagine that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> durſt ſtay his Coming, advanc'd on in the mean time, aiming to Surprize the Court in <hi>Gien,</hi> a Place of ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and uncapable to hold out againſt him. And in truth ſome Run-aways having carry'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the News of their Defeat, it gave ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Alarum, that they knew not whither to ſave the Kings Perſon, and that of the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as for the Cardinal he was allready Booted to betake himſelf to flight. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having ſtopp'd the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> the Court had more time to come to it ſelf again, and recovering Courage, upon his ſending Word thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it had no reaſon yet to be in any fright; the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> hoping nevertheleſs utterly to rout him, caus'd his Infantry to Advance, that lin'd the Wood, and as the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſuffer'd Extremely, he Retreated ſome Paces, which gave him a little Reſpite. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> thinking he gave Ground, caus'd his Horſe to march, but the Ground was ſo inconvenient, that beſides it could not hold above Seaven or Eight Squadrons afront, there were ſeveral Ditches that hinder'd him from drawing up in Battalia. In the mean while, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> apprehending that if he Suffer'd him to Advance further, the whole Army wou'd by Degrees be upon his Bones, he repaſs'd
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57147:137"/>
a Defile behind which he had poſted himſelf, and making his On-ſet upon that Cavalry, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd it upon one another. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was not of a Humonr to be paul'd by the firſt ſtroke, but the Diſadvantage he had in fighting in ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous a Place, Curbing his Courage, they plaid the Canon the reſt of the Day. The Court being very uneaſy about the Succeſs of the Battel, ſent Couriers after Couriers to be inform'd of it in time; but having Notice that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had not been able to gain his Point, it ſent Orders to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to retreat at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Night; which he eaſily atchiev'd, by the means of Sundry <hi>Defiles</hi> that Separated the two Armies. He receiv'd from the King, the Queen, and Cardinal, all the Teſtimonies of Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he cou'd hope for, after ſo ſignal a piece of Service; and the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourt</hi> only, from whom the vexation of having been beaten, dropt words to the Viſcount's Diſadvantage, as if he had accus'd him of having contributed to his Defeat, by not Succouring him in due time: But a man overwhelm'd with Affliction had eaſily granted him the freedom of Complaining, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſlighted theſe ſorts of Matters, the Diligence he had us'd being by all Sufficiently known. And indeed the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> whoſe humour was to render juſtice to his very Enemies, did himſelf openly Proclaim, that but for the Viſcount, he had at one ſtroke put an end to the War, and taking a Pleaſure in exaggerating his Valour and Conduct, he ſeem'd to aim at rendring him ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to his Party: On the contrary he made a Thouſand keen Railleries on the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> which did not at all pleaſe the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who knew that in the preſent Poſture of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57147:138"/>
things, and in an Age wherein each one glory'd in being Diſloyal, there needed no more to make his Fidelity be ſuſpected. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> after having gain'd this Advantage, led his Army towards <hi>Châtillon,</hi> and having a Deſign to take a turn to <hi>Paris,</hi> he took the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> along with him, that his abſence might obviate all freſh Diſputes with the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who nevertheleſs was inlittle condition for any, as having been dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Wounded in the laſt Battle. During theſe Tranſactions the Parliament had paſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d an Arreſt, by which it's hatred broke-out more than ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cardinal, for they ſet his Head at Fifty Thouſand Crowns, and to give ſome ſort of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to thoſe that undertook to Kill him, this ſum was rais'd by the means of a new Impoſition laid upon the People; ſo as that in th'Unhappy State of the Kingdom, they were become equally the Victims of the Cardinal and his Enemies: But the Odium born this Miniſter was ſo Univerſal, that no body complain'd of this Tax, and never had they paid any ſo chearfully. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being come to <hi>Paris</hi> found the Parliament and the People in ſo favourable a diſpoſition for his Highneſs, that he had nothing more to deſire: He was look'd upon by both with Admiration, and he at laſt conceiv'd ſuch vaſt, ſuch towring hopes, that the Cardinal having made him new Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Accommodation, he cluded them all by Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Demands. The Cardinal, who was a great Politician, prolonging theſe Negotiations, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by granting him a part of what he demanded, another by oppoſing him, gave in the mean while the People to underſtaud, that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s hatred for him was not ſo ſtrong, but that it might be extinguiſh'd if he wou'd content his Ambition;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57147:138"/>
ſo as that this People, that had flatter'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that he had taken up Arms in behalf of their Intereſts and for their ſakes, &amp; had ſo often expos'd his Life and Fortune, ſeeing themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiv'd, dwindled inſenſibly in the kindneſs they bore him. During all theſe Intrigues, his Army which he had left on the ſide of <hi>Châtillon</hi> upon <hi>Loin</hi> falling under the want of all Neceſſaries, the Baron of <hi>Clinchant</hi> and the Count <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> under whoſe Command it was, led it towards <hi>Eſtampes</hi> that ſided with his Highneſs. In the mean while the Court ſeem'd to have a Deſign of Blocking-up <hi>Paris</hi> again, for it had Troups in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places around it, which oblig'd the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to ſend a Detachment on the ſide of <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> which the Kings Forces had a Deſign to ſeize on. This Detachment being weak, and <hi>St. Cloud</hi> no place of Defence, it reſted ſatisfy'd with making it ſelf Maſter of the Bridge, an Arch of which it blew-up; by this means did they hinder the In-roads that were made to the very Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> and which had occaſion'd ſome Clamour in the Inhabitants of that great City. But the King meaning to Mortify them and puniſh ſo many Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediences, ſent to recover the Bridge, and upon the notice the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had of it, he left <hi>Paris</hi> to go encourage his men, being attended by ſeveral Perſons of Quality, nay and by ſeveral Citizens that had taken Arms. His Preſence having ſtopp'd th'Enemies Deſign, he march'd againſt <hi>St. Denis,</hi> where the King held a Garriſon, and after having taken it he retired to <hi>Paris,</hi> where there was more Caballing than Ever. The King was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to draw near it, to retain there ſome Servants that were ſtill Loyal to his Majeſty, and he did ſo upon their Deſire, after they had remonſtrated to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57147:139"/>
him, that otherwiſe all was loſt. And indeed his Remoteneſs had made it preſum'd that he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd that Beauteous Town; but his Preſence having giv'n another Opinion, thoſe who had as it were forſaken his Party, made reflection upon the fault they had Committed, and their thoughts were wholly how to repair it. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſtill Cover'd the Kings Perſon in a March that laſted above forty Leagues, and after having Notice of his being arriv'd at <hi>Melun,</hi> he lead his Army towards <hi>Chaſtres,</hi> that ſo the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> then at <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> might have no longer any Communication with <hi>Paris.</hi> All theſe motions that cou'd not be made without the Deſolation of the Countrey, rais'd a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring in the People, that began to grow weary of the War, ſo as that ſeveral Deputations were made to the King to beſeech him he wou'd diſtance the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from his Perſon, after which he ſhou'd find as much Obedience as ever in <hi>Paris,</hi> and in all the Reſt of the Kingdom: But the moſt truſty ſervants his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had in that great Town told him without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning to him the removing this Miniſter out of the way, that there needed no more than his returning thither to make all things huſh again; that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Parliament and of the Citizens were very much undeceiv'd of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> after having ſeen him neglect their. Intereſts to think bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own; that this Diſpoſition was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, and not to wait till he had regain'd their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence by new Artiſices: In a word, that they ſtood Warrantees for the Event, and that their Lives ſhou'd be anſwerable for it. Theſe Reaſons joyn'd to the Deſire the King had to make the <hi>Pariſians</hi> ſtill ſenſible of the Inconveniencies of the War, that ſo they might have ſtill the more Paſſion for Peace, made his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty reſolve upon Cauſing <hi>Eſtampes</hi> to be attack'd, the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57147:139"/>
taking of which wou'd have cut off the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Orleans,</hi> from whence they receiv'd a world of Wines, and other things neceſſary to Life. Yet wou'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e firſt know of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> if he approv'd of this Reſolution: But this General ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repreſented to the King a world of Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies that might thence enſue, the King left all things to his Ordering, &amp; continu'd ſtill in his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters near <hi>Chaſtres</hi> and <hi>Montlery.</hi> In the mean while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having Intimation that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle d'Orleans,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans's</hi> Eldeſt Daughter, had in her paſſage, thorough <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee the Prince of <hi>Conde's</hi> Leaguer in Arms, he broak up with his own, and Surpriz'd one of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs in the time the Enemies were Sprucing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up for that Review. The Diſorder therein was ſo great, that moſt of the Troupers abandon'd their Horſes, and without <hi>Lauville,</hi> the <hi>Meſtre de Camp</hi> of the Regiment of <hi>Conti,</hi> and who commanded the Guard, and did effectually his Duty, the Diſorder had been much greater. This Succeſs having Surpaſs'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> hopes made him Change his mind, and thinking to improve the Conſternation the Enemies Army had plung'd them in, he beſeig'd <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> that far from being a place of War has but one bare wall with a ſorry Caſtle on the ſide of <hi>Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> without Outworks, without a Ditch, nay and open on ſundry ſides. But the Army within the Town ſupply'd all theſe Defects, and an enterprize was it Sufficiently great to attack it there, how ever ſorry the Place. Nevertheleſs the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken his Precautions, rais'd his Aſſaults and Batteries, and as he preſs'd the Town, he had Notice that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> advanc'd to cauſe him to raiſe the Siege. The Court having no Reſſourſe left, if it chanc'd to looſe it's Army, was extremely Surpriz'd
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57147:140"/>
at this Tydings, and not ſtanding to conſider what Courſe to take, it diſpatch'd away an Agent to this Duke to ſee whether his humour wou'd lead him to treat for ſome Money. In the Int'rim the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had orders ſent him to raiſe the Siege as ſoon as that Duke ſhould draw near; but his anſwer imported the thing not to be yet ſo Urging, and that when it were ſo, he wou'd take ſuch Care, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ill ſhou'd come on't. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no greater Paſſion than to heap up Money, was byaſt to the offers of the Court: but as the point was the more or leſs, he ſtay'd in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Paris,</hi> under Colour of coming to Conferr with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condé;</hi> there aroſe a Conteſt between him and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> for the rank, and he caus'd it to laſt ſome days, that ſo the Court might have time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think it ſelf whether it ſhou'd give him what he demanded. At laſt the Court, not very opulent at that time, having found the means to furniſh the ſum he requir'd, it was agreed in Concert with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Brother-in-Law, that the Siege of <hi>Eſtampes</hi> ſhou'd be rais'd, on Condition that as ſoon as the King's Army was drawn-off, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Forces ſhould Evacuate the Town. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having thus provided for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, talk'd of returning, according to the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he lay under by a ſecret Treaty he had made with the Court: But the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> exclaiming againſt him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to ſtay, and inſtead of directing his March back for <hi>Flanders,</hi> as he had engag'd to do, he March'd away towards <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>al,</hi> where he laid all the Open Country in Fire and Blood; This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to March againſt him, and ſome Hoſtilities having paſs'd between
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57147:140"/>
the Two Armies, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took a Pretext from thence, to ſay, that the Court fail'd in its Parole to him, and both Parties were oblig'd to come to New Explications. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having learnt by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that mild Remedies had no effect upon him, prepar'd to give him Battel. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being ſtript of his Dominions, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and Credit ſubſiſting only by his Troups, he did not think fit to hazard them, but Caus'd a Bridge to be laid over the <hi>Sein</hi> ſo to have that River between the Two Camps: But ſeeing himſelf preſs'd in ſuch manner, that he cou'd no longer avoid fighting, he deſir'd My Lord <hi>Digby</hi> that his Lordſhip wou'd interpoſe in a New Treaty, then on foot. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> wou'd by no means hear it mention'd, and with the Sword pretended forthwith to decide the matter: But the Court, ſtanding then alſo in need of his Forces, wou'd husband every thing with the utmoſt Waryneſs, and Choſe rather to grant the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſome farther favour, with which, as I may ſay, it drove him out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Tho' all theſe Succeſſes were not great on either ſide, the Court however thence derived great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for the People growing impatient to ſee an End put to their Miſeries, did more earneſtly wiſh for Peace than before, and complain'd of the Violences the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had Exercis'd, in lieu of the Advantages they had Expected by his coming. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Troups, being drawn near the Bancks of the River <hi>Seine,</hi> made a Shift to render theſe Complaints alltogether Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, by the Deſolation they ſpread thro' all the Countrey, whoſe Grain and Forrage they not only conſum'd, but Pillag'd the very Houſes. The Prince
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57147:141"/>
of <hi>Condé,</hi> had dayly Complaints made him of 'em; but whatever Care he us'd he cou'd not Suppreſs the Licentiouſneſs of the Souldiery, who imagin'd that a Civil War Entitl'd 'em to all Exorbitancies, and whom beſides he durſt not command abſolutely to refrain, having not the means to pay them. All theſe things ſtimulating thus the <hi>Pariſians</hi> to return to their Allegeances; the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to place himſelf at the Head of his Forces, that ſo they might not only live in better Order, but alſo to preſerve them from Danger; For the, Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſeeing himſelf freed from the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> pretended to force them to a Battle, notwithſtanding they thought themſelves ſecur'd from that by the Bridge of <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them free paſſage to either ſide the River. The Court ſeeing no better means to terminate the Civil War, than to Defeat the Remains of that Army, which dayly diminiſht for want of Pay, ſent for the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> with the Troups he had in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and this Mareſchal having caus'd a Bridge of Boats to be made over the <hi>Seine</hi> near <hi>St. Denis,</hi> pretended to nab the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> on the one ſide, while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſhou'd attacque him on th' other. This Prince to avoid his Defeat, otherwiſe inevitable, diſcampt forthwith, and having abandon'd the Bridge of <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> he had a Deſign to demand Paſſage at <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſhelter his Forces with the Rivers of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57147:141"/>
Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> plying him Cloſe at his Heels; not having giv'n him the leiſure, His Rier was oblig'd to face about to ſtand the Brunt of ſome Squadrons which the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd, with intent to begin the Battle: Much a do had it to diſengage it ſelf, and to gain the Point of <hi>Faux-bourg St. Antoine,</hi> where the Van was drawn up in Batalia; the Prince thinking that by reaſon of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſome Intrenchments, made to hinder the Inroads of the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi> Army, the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> wou'd be Cautious how he attack'd him. Wherefore he choſe this Poſt, as the only one that cou'd hinder this Defeat, for the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was much ſtronger than he, and beſides, Expected the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> who upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> March, was to come ſuddainly with his Troups. All theſe things making him preſume, as I have newly hinted, that he wou'd find it a Difficult matter for him to come off from this Puſh, he meant however to have ſav'd his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in <hi>Paris:</hi> But thoſe that held there the Kings Party, caus'd him to be deny'd the Gates, and he was oblig'd to place 'em upon the Ditch that's between the Town and the <hi>Fauxbourg.</hi> In the mean while, the King, who in ſo tender an Age allready manifeſted his Warlike Humour, mounted upon the top of <hi>du Meſnil</hi> to have the Pleaſure of ſeeing his Troups fight; they forthwith Fil'd and Marſhall'd into Order, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> unwilling to leave the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> any further time to contrive his Matters, Caus'd him to be attack'd by a Batallion, which the Prince repuls'd, he having plac'd himſelf at the head of a Squadron made up of Men of Quality. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it wou'd be a hard Matter for him to force that Place where the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was himſelf

It is not to be Expreſs'd how angry the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> was at this ſight, nor the Diſorders ſome Squadrons were in that were Expos'd to the firing from the Houſes before-mention'd; However the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> having a Courage too great to be dejected by any Diſgrace, meaning to try if he cou'd not Speed better than the Reſt, march'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all the men of Quality in his Army: But as he Advanc'd, one of his Squadrons that were upon its Retreat, taking him for an Enemy, Charg'd him, and he did the like, while that thoſe of the Barricade that had other thoughts fir'd upon both. In the mean while, all <hi>Paris</hi> was throng'd

The King ſeeing that <hi>Paris</hi> had declar'd it ſelf againſt him, ſent to the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> to retreat; and the King embracing him, as well as the Queen-Mother and the Cardinal, they promis'd him all three, they wou'd never forget his Services. The King cou'd not however refrain giving Praiſes to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> whoſe Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct had appear'd with ſuch a luſtre, that his very
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57147:143"/>
Enemies proclaim'd, that only he was capable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage himſelf from ſo dangerous a point. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal diſtruſting the Affection of moſt of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, interrupted this Converſation as much as he cou'd; but the King peculiarly delighting in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon ſuch ſorts of matters, wou'd needs know of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> all the Particulars of the Action, and the Cardinal was forc'd to give him a hearing as well as others: The Prince of <hi>Conde's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having thus ſav'd it ſelf in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Citizens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excited by his Great Actions ſeem'd never to have born him ſo much Affection; they crowded their Windows to ſee his Entry, and nor more nor leſs than if he had been victorious they cover'd him with Prayſes: but this Kindneſs extended ev'n to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soldiers; they carry'd 'em drink to the very Gates, and thoſe that had occaſion for Linnen for their Wounds, found twice as much as they needed. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was a perſon of too much ſhrewdneſs to ſuffer their Affection to cool, he had new Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes concluded for the Extermination of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and that this Deſign might be General, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were oblig'd to give outward marks of it, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſtraw in their hats. Thus nought elſe was ſeen in all <hi>Paris</hi> than ſtraw hatbands, nay and Trophys were made of the ſame material for Coaches and for Horſes: Thoſe that had not timely notice of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Wearing them had like to have been kill'd by the Populace, and they ran after them as after mad Dogs, crying a <hi>Mazarin.</hi> During theſe Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies an Aſſembly was held at the <hi>Hoſtel de Ville,</hi> but much diſorder happen'd there, which ſome attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who to deſtroy ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom he ſuſpected of not being well-affected to him, did not care though Others were expos'd to the like Danger; ſome Musket-ſhots were made into the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57147:143"/>
Windows, and ſome meaning to look out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to ſee what was the matter, they were oblig'd to retire. The thing proceeded much farther, the Gates were forc'd, and ſome Members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. This Violence, which many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, as I allready hinted, to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> made him loſe the Peoples Affection, and his Enemies gave our, to take away all Doubts, that it was him; that among thoſe Seditious Perſons there had been ſeen Soldiers of his Army, and that they had been ſeen going into his Houſe a Day or Two afore. This Misfortune did not be fall him ſingly, it was follow'd with his loſing the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who quarrelling with the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> upon ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other matter that had ſet 'em at Odds before, he was kill'd in Duell by a Piſtol-ſhot. It was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs great Pity, for he was as brave as a Man cou'd be, Gentile, Civil, Liberall, and having in ſhort all the Good Qualities that can be deſired in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Condition.</p>
            <p>Neither of the Two Armies did any thing in the mean while; that of the King was withdrawn into the Neighbourhood of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and that of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> into the plain of <hi>Yvry,</hi> the River of <hi>Seine</hi> between both; <hi>Paris</hi> ſuffer'd equally from Each Party; the one made Excurſions to the very Gates of St. <hi>Denis</hi> and St. <hi>Martin;</hi> the other laid all Deſolate, as far as the Suburbs of St. <hi>Victor</hi> and St. <hi>Merceau,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> not having a Penny to pay it. The <hi>Pariſians,</hi> who had allready dwindl'd in their Affection to him, by what happen'd in the <hi>Hoſtel de Ville,</hi> loſt all the Reſt thro' the ſacking of their Houſes. However their Odium to the Cardinal ſtill prevail'd over all other Conſiderations, and while the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> endeavour'd to make his Accommodation, by the means of the Duke of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57147:144"/>
               <hi>Bouillon,</hi> Deputies were ſent to the King to beſeech him to diſtance that Miniſter: The King detain'd the Deputies without vouchſafing them an Anſwer, and having left them at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> while he went to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> went to fetch them away at the head of Two Thouſand men, and brought 'em as in Triumph back to <hi>Paris.</hi> During theſe Occurrences, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had a great Affliction, occaſion'd by his Brother the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Death, which happen'd after a ſickneſs of but few Days Continuance: He was Lamented by Both Parties, by whom he was Equally Eſteem'd for his Merit and Probity; He was a Faithfull, Loyal Friend, a Man of Wit and of the Cabinet, but whoſe Humour had ſeem'd Chang'd within this Seaven or Eight Years; for as much as he had formerly lov'd Intriguing and Cabals, as much did he now love Reſt and Tranquillity. This muſt be attributed to his Conſideration of his Numerous Family, and to the Affection he bore his Wife, by whom he left Ten Children, five Boys and five Girls. For his Principality of <hi>Sedan,</hi> he had as a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the Dutchy of <hi>Eureux,</hi> with ſeveral other Large and Noble Lordſhips. He dy'd in the Kings Eſteem and Affection; but in the Averſion of the <hi>Hughenots,</hi> whoſe Religion he had forſaken at his Wifes Perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the King endeavour'd to gain o're the Topping Men of the Parliament, and of the Citizens, and to ſow ſome Diviſion in that Body, he Transferr'd it to <hi>Pointoiſe;</hi> but few of 'em repair'd thither, which making the King preſume that it wou'd be a Difficult thing to reduce the City to it's Duty, without diſtancing the Cardinal, he comply'd with the time, yet with a reſolution however of recalling him
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57147:144"/>
when occaſion ſerv'd. Then thinking he had remov'd all ſort of Difficulty he demanded of the People and Parliaments th'effect of their Promiſes; But they quickly manifeſted that this Removal which they had demanded with ſo much Paſſion, had been only a Preteuce to cover other Intereſts. Their Diſobedience put the King into great fits of Anger, he reſolv'd to employ Force, ſince he had not proſper'd in Mildneſs, and having Reinforc'd his Army as far ſorth as his preſent Circumſtances wou'd allow of, he Block'd-up <hi>Paris</hi> ſo cloſe that the <hi>Pariſians</hi> were pincht with great Neceſſity: The continual Taxes they were over and above to pay for the maintenance of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Army undermin'd 'em utterly, ſo as being no longer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of furniſhing what was requiſite to raiſe Forces to oppoſe the King's, they for the ſecond time call'd-in the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. He came with an Army of Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, and Encamping near the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Troups did the like, while that the Duke of <hi>Wittembourg</hi> on another ſide endeavour'd to ſhut him up between thoſe two Armies and his. Never did the Court lye under ſo much Diſquiet as at that time, it wou'd needs alſo bargain with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for him to get him gone his ways; but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> pretending dayly to diſcamp, at length took his time to paſs the River <hi>d'Hieres,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broke his Bridges, he was far off, before th'Enemies were in a condition to purſne him. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being ſick at <hi>Paris,</hi> fancy'd that this could not have been done without Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> but he durſt not expreſs his thoughts of it, as fearing he might have occaſion for him in the condition he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57147:145"/>
to. And indeed the <hi>Pariſians</hi> wou'd no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger furniſh Money for the maintenance of his Troups, and being enrag'd at the Violences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi> Army and that of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> in the Country, they reſolv'd at length to recall the King. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> did not at all prevail in his oppoſing this Reſolution, Deputies were ſent as far <hi>as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne</hi> to beſeech his Majeſty to return, and all the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Credit cou'd prevail no further than to deſerr the buſineſs for ſome days. In ſhort ſeeing all his Intrigues abortive, he choſe to withdraw out of <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> an Action that tarniſh'd many of thoſe he had done afore. Thus the King return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> and recall'd the Cardinal, who was already come upon the Frontier, for his Remove had been only, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, a pure Grimace. The Kings was follow'd with ſeveral Novelties, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> withdrew to <hi>Blois,</hi> a Town of his Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, with his Wife and Children, ſeveral of the Parliament were Exil'd, and the Coadjutour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd; nevertheleſs having brib'd one of his Guards, he made his eſcape from <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and went to find out the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> his moſt Mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: But this Prince thought him ſufficiently Puniſh'd in his Misfortune, without adding to't, by making him ſenſible of his Reſentment, wherefore he receiv'd him with Humanity; and having ſhewn himſelf more Generous in Pardoning him, than he wou'd have done by treating him after another manner, he won ſo much upon him, that the Coadjutour gave himſelf abſolutely to him. All theſe Mutineers having been thus puniſh'd, the world expected that the Partizans of the Court were going to be Rewarded, the moſt part of whom
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57147:145"/>
had great need of Recompence, having been at vaſt Expences, in a time when the neceſſity of the State oblig'd 'em to take all upon themſelves: But the Cardinal, whoſe Credit was much greater than ever, bent his thoughts much leſs upon content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Old Friends than in acquiring New ones. Thus the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> who had reaſon to expect ſomething for his Services, receiv'd only fair words, while others receiv'd Effects.</p>
            <p>The Rebellion was ſtill on foot in divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and eſpecially in that of <hi>Guyenne;</hi> but the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having not been able to retain <hi>Paris</hi> where he had a world of Creatures, and where his great Valour was equally admir'd by all Parties, it is not to be wonder'd if the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who had no other repute than that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from his Brother, cou'd not hinder <hi>Bordeaux</hi> from being loſt. However <hi>L'Aine</hi> who was in th' Intereſts of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> did all in his Pow'r to diſpell the Practices that aroſe againſt him; But Father <hi>Favre,</hi> a Cordelier, to whom the Cardinal had promis'd a Biſhoprick for a Reward of his Cares, got that Aſcendant over the minds of both Male and Female Bigots, that thoſe of his Order confeſs'd it to be impoſſible for him to remedy this Misfortune. Yet this was not effected without ſhewing a Fleet in the River of <hi>Garonne;</hi> for <hi>Marſin</hi> who had the Command of the Arms in <hi>Guyenne</hi> under the Authority of the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> threatned to put all to Fire and Sword, if he ſaw the leaſt Appearance of a Conſpiracy. He had moreover ſent for Succours to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who under the name of Protector had uſurp'd the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> after the moſt Execrable of Parricides committed on the Perſon of the Late King. This made it neceſſary, the Court not being ſure
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57147:146"/>
of the Anſwer he wou'd give to let a fleet appear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to oppoſe his Enterprizes. But two things hinder'd <hi>Cromwel</hi> from declaring himſelf; One, he had a War to Suſtain againſt the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> the Other, he was willing to make as few Enemies as poſſible for him in the Beginnings of his fortune. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he allow'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to make Leavyes of <hi>Iriſh,</hi> of whom he was very glad to rid himſelf, as being his moſt formidable Enemies; By this means the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom <hi>Marſin</hi> had allſo call'd to his Succours ſtill for a while foſter'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Bordeaux:</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Vendôme</hi> commanding the Fleet of <hi>France,</hi> having Seiz'd on the Burrough and Caſtle of <hi>Lormont,</hi> and having Batter'd Two Forrs upon the <hi>Garonne,</hi> ſhut up <hi>Bordeaux</hi> ſo Cloſely, that they found themſelves reduc'd to Great Extremities. Thus the Rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to grow as ſenſible of the famine as the Poor, the Number of the Conſpirators augmented dayly, and if <hi>Marſin</hi> had not repair'd in all haſt to the Town, they were going to deliver it up into the Kings Hands. Nevertheleſs, falling ſuddenly at Odds with the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a jealouſy of oue another, quickly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd this Prince to Liſten to ſome Propoſalls made him on the Courts Behalf, or rather he made uſe of this Pretence to abandon a Party, not only all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Staggering, but allready fall'n: For tho' the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had taken <hi>Rhetel, Château Porcien, St. Menchou,</hi> and ſome other Places in his retiring: All this was not capable of being brought into Compariſon with the Great Loſſes he had Suffer'd. Thus the City of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> return'd under the Kings Obedience, and this happy Succeſs having been Uſher'd-in by the Reduction of other Places of the Province, <hi>France</hi> that had been near five whole
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57147:146"/>
Years in Civil Wars, Re-United it ſelf to oppoſe Strangers that had advantaged themſelves much from theſe Diſorders. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> during this time of Misfortune and Diviſion, had not only Extended their Frontiers on the ſide of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but had allſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Cazal,</hi> beſides <hi>Piombino</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolongone</hi> which they had retaken. This made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to retrieve our Reputation, then loſt among the Neighbouring Princes. <hi>Italy</hi> eſpecially fancy'd allready that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had ſo often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to ſettle their Sway there, were going to Subdue it; ſo as that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had more Occaſion than Others to apprehend them, either by reaſon that he had Embrac'd our Party, or that his Countrey was more for their Bienſeance, only thought of appeaſing them by ſome Treaty. The King, whom it notably concern'd to detain him in his Allyance, immediately diſpatch'd to him <hi>de Pleſſis Beſancon,</hi> a Man both for War, and the Cabinet, who remonſtrated to his Highneſs, that <hi>France</hi> being no longer divided in it ſelf, as it had been in the Years laſt paſt, His Neighbours were going to find the Effects of its Protection, that after having Subdu'd the Rebells that were buoy'd up by all the Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> it wou'd be no hard matter for him to vanquiſh thoſe ſame Forces, that were no longer Seconded with the Rebellion of the Towns, and the Revolt of the Principall Subjects; that All being return'd to their Duty by the King, and his Miniſters Wiſe Conduct, the World was going to ſee great Changes; that we had ſtill a Door left us into <hi>Italy,</hi> by which to Enter Succours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Occaſion of Our Allies, and that in ſhort he wou'd ſuddainly have tokens of this, as to his own Particular. He for whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts the King ever ſhew'd himſelf as Affectionate
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57147:147"/>
as for his own. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> wou'd not have been Contented with all theſe fine Words if they had not been follow'd with the March of Five Thouſand Men, that having joyn'd Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand that we had remaining in that Countrey, made a ſmall Body of an Army that re-incourag'd him a little. From thence <hi>le Pleſſis Beſancon</hi> paſs'd on to the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> to whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Surrender'd <hi>Cazal</hi> in Appearance, but of which they were in effect Maſters, by the Garriſon which they payd with their own proper Moneys. He made him ſome Propoſals: But either that this Duke did not think us in a Condition to perform what we promis'd him, or that the Allyance of Blood he had with the Emperour, did not Suffer him to cloſe with Intereſts that were oppoſite to thoſe of his Imperial Majeſty, He anſwer'd this Envoy, that his Reſolution was not to diſturb the Repoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> which wou'd ever Subſiſt ſo long as <hi>Cazal</hi> ſhou'd remain as it then did in his hands. <hi>Le Pleſſis Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancon</hi> having ſped ſo ill on that ſide, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whom he endeavour'd to Egg-on to ſome Motion; but thoſe Wiſe Politicians, whoſe Grandeur only Subſiſts by Peace, were farr from being influenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:57147:147"/>
was preparing to enter into <hi>Piemont,</hi> where he had allready made ſome Conqueſts the years afore; which being neceſſary to be remedy'd, Our Troups march'd towards the <hi>Alexandrin,</hi> that by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion they might induce them to forſake their Enterprizes. And in truth the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thinking it more for their Advantage to keep their own than acquire anothers, bruſht back the ſame Way, and the two Armies encountring, fought for three hours by Detachment, the Ground not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper to bring all the Men up to the Charge yet this did not hinder the Battle from being Sharp, and both Parties boaſted their having gain'd th' Advantage: But the <hi>French</hi> ſeem'd to have more Reaſon than the Others, for the Marquis <hi>de Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> was wounded in that Occaſion, beſides the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abandoned the Field of Battle. Be it as it will, after the two Armies had thus try'd their Forces, they made Truces and open repeated them, which conſum'd the Reſt of the Campagne, ſo as that nothing Conſiderable occurr'd in that Country. As for <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourt</hi> was ſent thither, rather however to give a jealouſy to th' Enemies, than to recover what had been loſt: Nevertheleſs the Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourt</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Gironne,</hi> and had taken it, if certain flies that are very rife in that Countrey had not deſtroy'd the better part of his Cavalry. The Enemies that had not as yet dar'd'to appear in the field, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to fear after this Accident, drew near <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>d'Hocquincourt</hi> having no more Horſe to oppoſe them was forc'd to raiſe the Siege. The Enemies purſu'd him, and thought eaſily to have defeated him: but having intrench'd himſelf in a Placa where he had more need of Foot than of Horſe, he let 'em ſee that they were very remote from their

               </gap>g the Siege of <hi>Gironne.</hi> However all theſe things were of ſmall Conſequence to it, in Compariſon of what occurr'd upon the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Champagne.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> after having been oblig'd, as I hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, to forſake the heart of the Kingdom, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his thoughts wholly in eſtabliſhing his Power in thoſe two Provinces, he had already in <hi>Champagne, Rhetel, St. Menchou,</hi> and <hi>Mouzon,</hi> and by the means of thoſe Places he made Inroads within fifteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Kings whole Deſign was to recover them, for as long as the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhou'd have footing in the Kingdom, it was to be fear'd this might foment the Rebellion therein. The Clubbs too and Meetings were continu'd in the very Metropolis, what ever Prohibitions were iſſu'd out to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and the Parliament as well as the Grandees ſeem'd to lye at watch for an Occaſion to ſet All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a Combuſtion. The King in the need he had of Money, had caus'd thirteen Edicts to be verify'd, which were laid upon the Commonalty, &amp; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal had been ſo cunning as to cauſe 'em to be paſs'd before his Return, that they might be imputed to ſome others, and not to him: But being known to give the turn to all things as well at a Diſtance as near at hand, this piece of Craft render'd him but ſo much the more Odious. The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> as I have ſaid, was withdrawn to <hi>Blois,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'Anvilie</hi> being his Confident, but who, out of hopes of a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune had promis'd friendſhip to the Cardinal, perform'd ſeveral journies, to endeavour to prevail with him to return to Court. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> who ſuffer'd himſelf to be eaſily govern'd already comply'd; but his Wife who had ſtill more Power
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57147:148"/>
over him than the Duke <hi>Danville,</hi> interrupted his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, out of the Averſion ſhe bore the Queen-Mother &amp; the Cardinal; Beſides ſhe lov'd Solitarineſs, which making her Deſire to ſpend her days remote from the tumult of the Court, and from ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues with which ſhe had been overwhelm'd ſince her marriage ſhe at laſt prevail'd with her Husband to renounce all ſorts of Caballs; which was what the Cardinal moſt deſired. Thus this Miniſters good luck having made him meet with eaſyneſſes, which he cou'd not with any likelyhood have entertain'd the hopes of; for if the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had been ſo minded, he might have deriv'd conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for him and his, if he had only feign'd to do in ConſIderation of the Cardinal, what he did out of Complaiſance for his Wife. Fortune having thus declar'd her ſelf for the Cardinal in a matter of ſuch great moment, his thoughts were wholly employ'd how to fix his Pow'r by Allyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the moſt conſiderable Perſons in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and as the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who had been allways deſign'd for the Church, had a Spirit far remote from that Profeſſion, he caus'd one of his Nieces to come from <hi>Italy,</hi> being the Daughter of <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, and offer'd her to this Prince with Conſiderable Advantages. The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was loath to cloſe with this Match; but after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the Young Lady, who had Merit and Beauty, this Allyance did no longer Bug-bear him ſo very much; to which he was ſtill the more egg'd-on by People about him the Cardinal had gain'd; They were perpetually repreſenting to him that the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> had not made ſo much ſcruple, tho' his did not turn ſo well to Account; that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his Brother being with the Enemies, all his Riches, all his Offices, and all
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57147:149"/>
his Governments were for him if he knew but how to make uſe of his Good Fortune; that there was no likelyhood of his ever making Peace after the Meaſures he had taken with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that he was not to ſtand S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Diſcourſes being familiar to the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> he had no reluctance to reſolve upon a thing, he was allready egg'd-on to by his natural Levity. In the mean while the Cardinal, who had not yet loſt hopes of coming to an Accomodation with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> deferr'd this Allyance untill he had ſeen his laſt Reſolves, and was very glad to give him Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that ſo out of the fear of loſing all his Eſtate, which was conſiderable, he might not puſh things to Extremity: But this Prince after having gone ſo far as he had done, did not one minute ſtand pondering what Reſolution to take and being beſides Inſtigated by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who promis'd him no leſs than giving him ſome Places in Sovereignty, He us'd his utmoſt Endeavours to Enter <hi>France,</hi> where he had ſtill good Acquaintance. This broke the Cardinalls Meaſures, who had ſpar'd nothing to put the Army of <hi>Champagne</hi> in a ſtate to reduce the Places which this Prince poſſeſs'd in that Province. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> Commanded it, to whom the Cardinal had at length granted the Government of <hi>Limoſin:</hi> He had beſieg'd <hi>Rhetel,</hi> which very much incommoded the People of <hi>Rheims,</hi> they having ſent to Court ſeveral times to beſeech the King to deliver them from that Servitude: The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> making uſe of that time to Execute what he had reſolv'd, paſs'd the <hi>Somme,</hi> and being enter'd
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57147:149"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> caus'd all to Tremble to the very Gates of <hi>Paris. Roy</hi> offer'd at ſome Oppoſition, but its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizement for ſo doing, follow'd ſo Cloſe, that the Other Towns became Wiſe at its Coſt, ſo as that they receiv'd in Garriſons, and furniſh'd him with all he ſtood in need of; However he wou'd not divide his Forces, wherefore reſting ſatisfy'd with the Aſſurances they gave him of their Fidelity, he ſtill march'd further on, hoping perhaps to cauſe ſome Sedition in <hi>Paris:</hi> But ſeeing that no body ſtirr'd in his Behalf, he repaſs'd the. <hi>Somme</hi> after having gain'd much Booty. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having had time to aſſure the taking of <hi>Rhetel,</hi> march'd towards <hi>Picardy</hi> to oblige him to a Retreat: But ſeeing he had prevented him, His thoughts were only how to ſecure the Places upon the <hi>Somme,</hi> which the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> ſeem'd to threaten All Equally; He put Succours into <hi>Peronne,</hi> St. <hi>Quentin</hi> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and ſtaying in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Ham,</hi> he kept in a Readineſs to march where occaſion requir'd. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> ſeeing he broke all the Meaſures he cou'd take on that ſide, made a feint of deſigning to attacque <hi>Arras,</hi> ſo to draw him into Even Ground: But the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> having not forces to reſiſt him, troubl'd his Head not much about this Enterprize, knowing the Place to be well provided with all Neceſſaries, and keeping in his Camp, he deferr'd reſolving what Courſe to take, till he ſhou'd be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inform'd of his Deſigns. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> ſeeing him remote, took that time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer <hi>Rocroy,</hi> and repairing thither with all his Army he Won it, while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Mouzon;</hi> not but that he wou'd rather have reliev'd <hi>Rocroy,</hi> but the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wou'd by no means venture a Battel, fearing
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57147:150"/>
that if the Succeſs prov'd adverſe to him, this might renew the Faction, by the Advantages the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> wou'd derive from his Victory. Wherefore he Choſe rather to repriſal that Loſs by the taking of <hi>Sainte Menchou,</hi> whither he ſent the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> obſerv'd the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi>

Bordering upon <hi>Lorrain,</hi> this Commiſſion was giv'n to the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> the Governour of that Dukedom, and who in the beginning of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne had joyn'd his Troups to thoſe of the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne.</hi> But their two Humours did not Cotten; the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> was of an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Violent Temper, and ſo ſelf-conceited of his mean parts, that he wou'd feign have had the World thought him to have been th' only Man of Univerſal Knowledge, In the Campagne afore a thouſand little piques had Occur'd between them. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had ſo order'd matters by his Wiſdom, that all came to be appeas'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making a Noiſe. However the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> dayly found a thouſand Occaſions for his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of him; for as much as his fiery Humour made him hated by the Officers, ſo much did that of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> that was oppoſite to it, gain him the Love of all ſorts of People: And in the Truth, the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> knew ſo well the hatred they bore him, that he never Engag'd in any Battle, without firſt going to ask Pardon of thoſe he had Offended, for he fear'd them more than he did th'Enemies; he did nevertheleſs theſe ſorts of things by way of Deriſion, I mean in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe who ſaw him do it, for in regard of others he did it heartily. I remember how that one day when the Battle was juſt ready to begin, ſome body having ask'd him whither he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becauſe he remov'd from his Poſt, he made anſwer, that he was going to ſeek th'Amneſty, a word extremely in uſe at time, on th'account of the Motions before related, and for which People were often compell'd to have recourſe to it. All th'Officers ſmil'd at theſe kinds of Whims, and knowing the Reaſon the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57147:151"/>
not to bear him any good will, they ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to diſcourſe of 'em in his preſence: But this Prince not taking any Pleaſure in hearing any body ſpoke Ill of, minded them at the ſame time of the Reſpect they ow'd a Perſon of the Rank of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> and thus took his part that goar'd him on all occaſions; for when ever the Viſcount happen'd to be the Subject of the Diſcourſe, the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> never fail'd of Darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the luſtre of his Actions or of his Virtue, of objecting that he had born Arms againſt the King, &amp; from thence pretended that All that he cou'd do wou'd never be capable of repairing what he had done. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to whom theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes were told again, far from being in Anger, anſwer'd gravely that he was very much oblig'd to him for putting him in mind of his fault, that it was however needleſs, becauſe he had it ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Imagination; not that he pretended to make the Juncture of Times his Excuſe, on which many People would have rejected All that Occurr'd; that nothing cou'd Excuſe a Subject for his Diſobedience, and that it was alſo only in the Mercy of God that he hop'd for his Pardon. So Worthy, ſo Handſome and Moderate an Anſwer ſhou'd, one wou'd have thought, have made the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> abſtain thence-forward from ſuch like Diſcourſes: But this was far from rendring him Diſcreet, if I may ſay ſo, of a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> his Violences were but the greater, and proceeded ev'n to extremity; For one day find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> Guards out of the Camp, he askt him who had ſent him thither, and whether he knew not that it was forbidden to paſs the Guards, and without giving him a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Can'd him to ſome purpoſe. The Guard made
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57147:151"/>
his Complaints to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne:</hi> But this Prince calling immediately for the Captain of his Guards, bid him go from him to the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> and tell him, that ſince the Guard muſt needs have very much offended him to make him do what he had, he ſent him him to compleat his Puniſhment; and that he wou'd alſo Diſcard him if he thought fitting, and that he needed only to give him the hint to be obey'd. At the ſame time the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> who after having made Reflexion on what he had done, knew not how to Clear himſelf in the world, was ſtill the more ſurpriz'd at this Complement; he endeavour'd to Excuſe himſelf the beſt he could; but having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd the Captain of the Guards, he told ſuch as were then preſent, that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> manner of receiving this Offence, gave him much more Confuſion than if he had ſhewn Reſentment; and the dint of Truth compelling him to diveſt himſelf of Self-Love to do his Adverſary Juſtice, he cou'd not forbear ſaying, that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was as Diſcreet as he was Paſſionate.</p>
            <p>However, tho' all this came to the Cardinals Knowledge, it was not capable of procuring them a Command apart; For it was one of this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Maxims to foſter in the Grandees a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Jealouſy of one another; being withall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give ſo much Credit to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> as that he might abuſe it; We ſhall nevertheleſs ſee in the Proceſs of this Hiſtory, that this Maxim was none of the beſt, and there-thence enſu'd Inconveniencies as were ſufficiently conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as to induce him to change it. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> would in the Interim have made Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſo Propitious a Juncture, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not harbour'd a Diffidence of his Conduct, for
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57147:152"/>
they ſaw him ſtill irreſolv'd whether or not he ſhou'd come to an Accommodation with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who to render him the more ſuſpected, ſtill amus'd him with new Treati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s; this Prince had beſides quitted ſeveral little acquaintances in the Kingdom that held him by the Heart; and tho' it ſeem'd that ſo great a man as he, ought to be but little ſenſible to ſuch ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rts of things, yet they ſufficiently poſſeſs'd him as to make him regret what he had forſaken: More eſpecially he had a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who meant to build his Fortune on his Ruines, and he cou'd not think of his being upon the point of going to fatten himſelf with his Spoils, without deſiring to traverſe him in his Pretenſions. In the mean while on another ſide he knew not what Confidence to put in the Cardinal, who had ſo often broke his word with him, and who wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d perchance wreak his Revenge on him by ſtill a harſher Impriſonment than the former. In ſo uncertain a condition he was extremely to be pitty'd, when after having made Reflexion upon his laſt Actions that gave him little hopes for Pardon, he reſolv'd to think no more of <hi>France,</hi> and to abandon his Fortune entirely in the hands of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And in truth he had notice that his Brother's Marriage had been concluded on at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and that his Place of <hi>Grand Maiſtre</hi> of the King's Houſhold was allready conferr'd on Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> which did not over well pleaſe the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> for it had been promis'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Marriage: But the Cardinal who thought he had him faſt enough by that Match, no longer minding to husband him, choſe rather to gain a New Creature than keep his word with him. In the Interim, this Miniſter who had his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in a peculiar Recommendation, had caus'd a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57147:152"/>
great part of the Benifices he poſſeſs'd to be reſign'd up to him, and it being ſeen how that he enrich'd himſelf with all he cou'd clutch, while that he Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh'd others, he was dayly the more and more hated, tho' People were leſs in a condition to give him tokens of it, for he had been carefull to gain ſuch of the Grandees that cou'd ſtill foment Stirrs and inſurrections; and thoſe that had done him moſt Miſchiefs, were thoſe that had been the beſt Rewarded. Thus they had ſeen the Count <hi>d'Ognon,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Saint Germain Beaupré</hi>'s Younger Brother, made Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> with a Preſent of a Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Livres for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abandon'd the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> s Intereſts.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> practis'd a different Policy towards the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> then become ſuſpected to it; more Eſpecially ſince he had ſuffer'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to Eſcape, as was before related; for when he fancy'd himſelf in the beſt terms with them, and thought he had regain'd their Confidence by new Treaties, he was Seiz'd on at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> and convey'd thence into <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence he did not ſtir out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, 'till the Peace had been made between the Two Crowns. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having dayly diſputes with him for the Rank, was not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Sorry for his Misfortune; but having learnt by his own Experience, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not of a humour to pardon, he was more than ever Confirm'd in his Deſign of renouncing all the Intrigues he had kept a-going on that ſide. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being willing to give them certain Marks of his Intentions, he Egg'd them on to beſiege <hi>Arras,</hi> which was no ſooner known of at Court, but that the King went on purpoſe to the Parliament, to have him declar'd Guilty of High-Treaſon, and one
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57147:153"/>
that had forfeited the Quality of firſt Prince of the Blood, with all the Prerogatives due to his Birth; and in ſhort to dye ſuch a Death as his Majeſty thought fitting: Thoſe who follow'd his Party were in like manner Condemn'd to be Beheaded, and among Others <hi>Marcin, Perſan</hi> Senior, and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Violle,</hi> for in regard of th' Others, they were only cited in judgment to give them time to know themſelves; but not a man of them All would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him on this ſcore, ſave the Prince of <hi>Tarante,</hi> for tho' they hereby loſt their Eſtates, yet they loſt not their Lives, the Court not daring to puſh things to that Extremity, for fear the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> might uſe Repriſals. And, indeed, ſince his being in <hi>France,</hi> thoſe of his Party had caus'd an Officer of the Kings Army to be Hang'd, upon the Notice they had that the Cardinal had ſerv'd one of theirs in the ſame manner, and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> far from Checking them for their Proceedings, had utter'd his mind ſo roundly upon this Article, that the Court cou'd not doubt of his Intentions. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> upon the Suſpicion he had that the Enemies had an Eye upon <hi>Arras</hi> march'd that Waywards in all haſte, and after having put a re-inforcment into that Place, he paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and march'd againſt <hi>Stenay,</hi> which had been too long the <hi>Azylum</hi> of Rebells, to leave it any longer in their hands. The Concern the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had in it, the Propriety of the Place appertaining to his Highneſs, as I ſuppoſe I have already inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, making the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> nevertheleſs believe that this Prince wou'd not ſuffer it to be taken without a puſh, he thought not fitting to ſtay within the Lines, but took an Advantageous Poſt to fight him. And this was indeed the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s main Deſign, who pretended at any
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57147:153"/>
rate to ſave this Place; but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who wou'd have got nothing thereby, chooſing much rather to Beſiege <hi>Arras,</hi> which if they cou'd take, was to be their Potion, inveſted it the ſame day the Trenches were Open'd, before the other Place. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> thereby perceiv'd he had no Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to lye under as to the Succours of <hi>Stenay;</hi> for which reaſon after having giv'n the neceſſary Orders to the Marqueſs <hi>de Faber,</hi> whom he left before the Town, he repaſs'd the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> with a Deſign to Starve the Enemies, 'till ſuch time as he had forces ſufficient brought him to fight them. The Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> joyn'd his Troups to the Viſcounts; and both drawing near the Lines of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they Seiz'd on certain Poſts, from whence it was Eaſy to Cut them off their Victualls and Forrages. The Neighbourhood of the Two Armies dayly produc'd ſome Skirmiſhes, wherein fortune did not yet ſeem to decide any thing, for they were one while to th' advantage of one ſide, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the adverſe Party; but at laſt the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <hi>de Crequi,</hi> now Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> having found the means to get Succours into the Town, caus'd it to declare for his Party. And indeed this Succeſs as much fluſh'd the Courage of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd, as it dejected that of the Beſiegers: The later beſides ſtanding dayly more and more in need of Proviſions and Forrages, ſo as that they were ready to raiſe the Siege, if the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> then call'd <hi>Bouteville,</hi> had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted a Convoy to the Camp, acroſs a thouſand Ambuſcades that were laid for him. This Succours having thus made them perſevere in their Deſign, they puſht on briskly their Attacks, inſomuch that <hi>Mondejeu</hi> that Commanded in the Place, ſent to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to come and relieve it. This
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57147:154"/>
Prince having hitherto deferr'd doing it, thinking to Effect it without Fighting; but having ſeen the Contrary by what had happen'd, he made all things ready for the Succours, wherein he was Seconded by the Mareſchals <hi>de la Fertè,</hi> and <hi>d'Hocquincourt,</hi> the laſt of whom had brought him the Troups that had taken <hi>Stenay,</hi> and others which he had drawn out of the Towns above the <hi>Somme.</hi> The Enemies ſeeing themſelves upon the point of being attack'd, dayly fortify'd their Camp, wherein they had made great holes not only to ſtop the Cavalry, but allſo to ſerve for Precipices to the Infantry, for they were Extreme deep: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being inform'd of all this, as well as the Other General, they reſolv'd no longer to defer th' Attacque, which they gave notice of to <hi>Mondejeu,</hi> that ſo he might take that time to make, Sallys. In the mean while, to give a jealouſy to all the Quarters, they were all view'd in their Turns, which the Prince of <hi>Condê</hi> not being able to endure without ſhewing himſelf, he went out of his Lines, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune having Seconded his Courage, he beat all that ſtood in his Way, after which he Forrag'd at large, which without this he durſt never have undertaken. As this Succeſs was capable of damping our men, if not ſuddenly repair'd, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> attacqu'd divers Poſts, which the Enemies held upon the Avenues, and making himſelf Maſter of them, he caus'd Part of the Army to march about five a Clock in the Evening on the ſide of Mount <hi>St. Eloy,</hi> while the Mareſchals <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> and <hi>Hoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quincourt,</hi> led the Reſt towards <hi>de Mouchy le Proux</hi> thro' ſeveral Ways. The Enemies having Parties out were quickly inform'd of this March, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fir'd a Canon which was the ſignal they had agreed among themſelves to give notice of Our
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57147:154"/>
Approach, they ſtood to their Armes. The Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſeeing their Deſign diſcover'd, as well as the other Generals, nevertheleſs continu'd their March, and falſe attacques were made on the ſide of <hi>Mouchy,</hi> to cover the true one that was made on the ſide of <hi>St. Eloy.</hi> In the mean while, Several Matches were ſhown faſten'd at the end of great Sticks, which made the Enemies run that way-wards they were ſeen: But the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> having us'd this Diverſion for the making of his Attacque, all buckl'd before him, the Lines of Circumvallation were forc'd, and after having been fill'd by the Infantry, the Horſe paſs'd, and fell in purſuit of the Enemies, moſt of whom betook themſelves to flight without fighting. None but the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> made any reſiſtance, but it rather tended to ſave his Men, than repair the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Party. As for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd their Canon, their Tents, and their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages, of which the Soldiers made ſo conſiderable a Booty, that many of them enrich'd themſelves for all their Life long. Above Sixty Canons were found in their Camp, with Five or Six Thouſand Tents, All ſtill ſtanding, many Sumpter-Horſes half loaden, but which they had not had time to take along with them; In ſhort, all the tokens of a great Diſorder, and a ſtrange Surprize. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> made his Eſcape to <hi>Doway;</hi> but he was ſtill in the Lines, when the Van was allready ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd; for that he might not abandon his Troups, he ſeveral times Expos'd his Perſon, ev'n to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in among the Enemies like a Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> knowing him in the hurry, often admir'd his Valour, but at the ſame time deplor'd his Deſtiny; which thus kept him link'd to the Intereſts of thoſe againſt whom he
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57147:155"/>
wou'd have more gloriouſly Employ'd it. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Defeat was no ſooner known at Court, but that all the Honour of it was giv'n to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne;</hi> For tho' he had two Mareſchals of <hi>France</hi> that were his Equals in the Command, yet it being known to have him that forc'd the Lines, and that the Others on the Contrary wou'd not have ſped by having loſt their Ways, they thought themſelves bound not to Confound him with them. And in truth, the Cardinal, who was, as I may ſay, the Soul of the Kingdom, thought he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Obligation to congratulate him alone, and made him ſuch great Promiſes, as render'd it eaſy to gueſs how deeply he thought himſelf concern'd in that Succeſs. In Effect, this Miniſter had dayly new Diſquiets, and there had been lately ſtopp'd upon the Frontiere, a Certain Perſon, <hi>Beaulieu</hi> by name, who had Commerce with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to kindle anew the Sedition in divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. Thus an unproſperous Event was capable of replunging the Realm in the Troubles it had but juſt got ridd of: Wherefore he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound to teſtify his Acknowledgment to him that had Secur'd his own repoſe, and that of the State. In the mean while, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> relying on his Promiſes, having of him demanded the Effects of them ſome days after, found, as many others had done before him, that they were not to be overmuch truſted; for having askt of him the Charge of Colonel General of the Horſe, fall'n Vacant by the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi>'s Death, he ſhamm'd him with ſo many Put-off's, that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſaw plainly he made a Mock of him: He wou'd not ſpeak of it to the King and Queen-Mother, who had ſeveral times aſſur'd him, nothing cou'd be deny'd his Services. The
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57147:155"/>
King himſelf came into his Camp during the Siege of <hi>Stenay,</hi> and there renew'd to him all he had promis'd him in other Occaſions: But tho' his laſt Action ſpoke allſo in his behalf, he did not think it convenient to Expoſe himſelf to the Maſter's Denial, and that it was ſufficient to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone that of the Miniſter. This notwithſtanding, he ſhew'd not any Reſentment, and continuing to ſerve with as much Zeal as ever he manifeſted, he went and Beleaguer'd <hi>Queſnoy,</hi> a Place in <hi>Hainaut,</hi> and of more importance for its Scituation than its Outworks, that were imperfect; yet as it might be improv'd to an advantageous Poſt, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to fortify it, as ſoon as he had got it into his hands; and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having had time to gather up the Wrecks of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, advanc'd to interrupt the Works; But the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne,</hi> after having ſeiz'd on certain Poſts reduc'd his hopes to Weak Skirmiſhes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not having had all the Succeſs he Expected, he ſhut up the Place in ſeverall ſides, as if he had a Deſign to Block it. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſeeing the Party he had Embrac'd, let the Cardinal know it, who had long afore deſign'd the Beſieging of <hi>Clermont,</hi> that he might now with eaſe effect this Enterprize, and the thing having been reſolv'd on in Council, the Mareſchal <hi>de la Fertè</hi> had Orders to ſit down before that Town, while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſhou'd obſerve the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> Thus <hi>la Ferté</hi> having not been diſturb'd in his Enterprize, finiſht it without much trouble. After this the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſeeing that in the preſent State of Affairs, and in the Seaſon no longer proper to keep the Field, it wou'd be loſing his time not to ſend the Army into it's Winter-Quarters, reſolv'd to depart him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for Court, after having giv'n Orders for that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57147:156"/>
purpoſe. However he ſtaid on the way at <hi>Mouchy,</hi> a Houſe of the Marquis <hi>de Humiers,</hi> very agreeable for Hunting, but whither other Pleaſures invited him; for before he went to the Army he had found this Marquis's Lady ſo Charming, as gave him an Urging to ſee her again. The Marquis <hi>de Humieres</hi> being come to his Houſe, receiv'd him there as one of his moſt particular Friends, and the good Reception he met with both from him and his Wife, oblig'd him to return often thither. Theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits which he paid ſtill more frequently at <hi>Paris,</hi> made him at length ſo very much in Love, that he no longer ſeem'd to be the ſame man. The Marquis <hi>de Humieres</hi> after the wonted rate of Husbands, did not take notice of theſe ſorts of things, and attributing to the freedom which reigns among Perſons of Condition, this Aſſiduity, which wou'd, perhaps, have giv'n ſuſpition to another, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to live with him as he was wont. In ſhort, this Fancy laſted Eight or Ten Years, and was not unprofitable to the Marquis <hi>de Humieres's</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who having a great deal of innate Merit and much acquir'd, has attain'd to the Dignity of Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> thro' what the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſaid dayly in his behalf. And indeed the Chevalier <hi>de Grammont</hi> knowing whence this proceeded, and loving a little Drollery, cou'd not refrain breaking a Jeſt to the King, upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties asking him at the time of his Promotion to that Dignity, if he knew whom he had made Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> he anſwer'd him, <hi>Madam de Humieres;</hi> which ſo offended this Prince, who did not love Railleurs, that he Baniſh'd the Chevalier at that very Inſtant.</p>

               <hi>Flanders,</hi> no not by much. The Court had ſent the Mareſchal <hi>de Grancey</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and tho' the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> that began to riſe again, might have very much facilitated him in his Enterprizes, he was under a continuall uncertainty of what he ought to do. Thus did he ſuffer much time to ſlip, after which he paſs'd into that part of the Land of <hi>Milan,</hi> call'd the <hi>Alexandrin:</hi> but the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers being ſwell'd by continual Rains, his whole Campagne terminated in Conſuming the Forrages, and ſome ſlight Skirmiſhes. In th' Interim as the Fleet bound for the Coaſt of <hi>Naples</hi> under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> was forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into our Ports, after that our men who had made a Deſcent had been repuls'd with great loſs; the Mareſchal <hi>de Grancey</hi> was alſo conſtrain'd to repaſs the <hi>Tanare,</hi> for fear of ſeeing all the Forces that had been employ'd in that Kingdom come pouring upon him. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and He did not want reaſons to excuſe the failings they had made, and they charg'd all to the fault that had been committed in having been too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all things that had been ſent them, as if what paſs'd in that Country had not been of any Moment; and indeed a man wou'd have ſaid the Cardinal had diſcarded all Sollicitude for thoſe Parts, nay and he would have little minded th' Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> if he had not been willing to content the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> whom he had ſent thither on purpoſe, that he might not yet diſreliſh his Allyance. This Prince had no great Experience, but to ſupply that want he had good Lieutenant-Generals in th Army, who unwilling to ſuffer it to lye Idle, caus'd it to march againſt <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> a ſmall Town at th' Entrance into <hi>Conflans,</hi> Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated between two Mountains, and ſeems to have

But the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> growing quickly Weary of War, was very willing to find a Pretext to go hold the States in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that he might gratify his Natural fickleneſs. His Wiſe repair'd to him thither, tho' allready diſſarisfy'd with him, for he had made her a Preſent, which Modeſty does not ſuffer ſpecifying, and which after having reduc'd her to ſtrange Extremities at the long run, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd the loſs of her Life: Thus was the Year 1654 ſpent. But I ought not to forget what befell the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> whoſe Wiſdom was ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, that the Count <hi>de Montbelliard,</hi> who had diſputed together for their Principality, referr'd themſelves to him, and the Duke of <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> for the Determination of their Differences. And indeed after having Examin'd into the Rights of Each, he paſs'd his Judgment, which ſo pleas'd thoſe two Brothers that they reſolv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to Submit to it. It was not only with thoſe two Princes that he paſs'd for Prudeht, and for a Lover of Juſtice; His Virtue was known much farther in <hi>Germany,</hi> and he dayly received Letters, by which he was deſir'd to give his Opinion upon certain Matters that fell under Debate: He did it immediately, but without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to derive thence a Vanity; far from ſuffering that his Advice ſhou'd be taken for a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Theſe are my thoughts, Writ he back to thoſe that had ſent him theſe Letters, you will needs
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57147:157"/>
have me give you my Sentiment, it is for you to judge whether I am now miſtaken or not, for that I often am. God grant I am not ſo at this time, that ſo you may receive from my Councills the Conſolation you Expect from them. He was as modeſt in all things as he was in that, for whether that he was deſir'd to give a particular Account of an Action he had been preſent at, or to ſay rather, whoſe <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> he had been, or that he was oblig'd by Reaſons that wou'd be needleſs to ſpecify, to entertain the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Diſcourſe, he never ſpoke of himſelf, but in confounding himſelf with others. We did ſuch and ſuch things, ſaid he, ſuch a Regiment did this, or that ſuch an one did by ſuch a motion occaſion the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the enemies: But he was never heard to ſay, that it was I, that gave this Command, who took the Enemies in the flanck, and a thouſand other ſuch like things, which all Generals are wont to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to themſelves, and which he might attribute to himſelf as well as others. But he did not do ſo when he was to blame himſelf, he was the firſt to tell his own failings, and he often found out ſuch as no body elſe had taken notice of; which happen'd more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when he was to excuſe any one: Not a man, ſaid he, is there exempt from Committing faults, this is what commonly renders us wiſe, and if there were no vicious People, Virtue wou'd not be in ſuch Great Admiration. But his Goodneſs never appear'd more than when any one had done ſomething in War for which he might be blamed; to prevent the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that might be made him, he told every one a thouſand things in his favour: 'tis none of his fault, added he, if he has been unproſperous, and if all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have been beaten were to be ſlighted, 'tis long agoe that I ſhou'd have been of no Account. D'ye not remember what befell me at <hi>Mariendal,</hi> and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57147:158"/>
what happens to me ſtill dayly; believe me, the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyeſt Perſons are ſubject to ſuch like Adventures, &amp; for this do I not eſteem a man the leſs. However to furniſh him with the opportunities to repair his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he ſent him back to Warfare till he had gain'd ſome Advaintage, and then there needed no other Trumpet than the Viſcount to proclaim it. Did not I tell you, ſaid he, that he was a Brave man, and that he wou'd not be long without having his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; I am ſeldom miſtaken in the Judgment I paſs of a Perſon, and I ever thought he did not want either Courage or Conduct. This Carriage got him to that degree the Affection of th' Officers and Souldiers, that they all began to call him their Father; and in effect they bore him as much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſpect as if he had been really ſo. He did the like on his part, that is to ſay, he lov'd them as his own Children; And indeed he never had any greater joy than when he had th'oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of procuring any one's Advancement. We are only in the World, ſaid he, to do good to one another; and thoſe to whom God has giv'n ſome Credit, ought t'employ it only in procuring th'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of thoſe who ſtand in need of their Protection. But he did not content himſelf with ſaying it, he did it alſo as he ſaid it, for then he did uot mind paſſing for troubleſome with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and he who durſt not ſpeak in behalf of his own Intereſts, never let him reſt when it requir'd his promoting of others. Tho' the King was ſtill pretty Young, yet as he was of a ſharp under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he had ſo much reſpect for the Virtue of this Great Captain, that it ſeem'd as if only he in his Kingdom was worthy of his eſteem; His Majeſty diſcourſt him ſometimes for whole hours together, which made the Cardinal ſeem a little

uneaſy: But she Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> who delighted in cultivating the Sentiments of this Young Prince, that was entirely inclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to Virtue, not taking notice that he minded it, troubl'd his head little with having his Friendſhip, provided he had that of his Maſter. For this Reaſon did he ſpend ſo many Winter-Quarters at a diſtance from the Court; for the Cardinal under Colour of the leaſt things, ſent him Order not to leave the Frontier, which ſtill diſcriminated him from th'other Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, who expos'd themſelves for the moſt part only to ſhare the deeper in the favour of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. In the mean while the Year 1655. began, and as the Enemies had Block'd-up <hi>Queſnoy</hi> to all Intents, and that the Garriſon began to be diſtreſs'd, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> reſolv'd to lay open the Paſſes. For this purpoſe he divided his Troups in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral little Bodies, as if he had had ſeveral Deſigns, and cauſing them to March ſome one way, others another, the Marquis <hi>de Caſtlenau,</hi> a Lieutenant General ſurpriz'd Five Hundred men that were in the <hi>Bas Catelet,</hi> and having put them to the Sword, he ſet fire to the four Corners and to the Heart of the Town. This exploit having made the Enemies afraid that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had ſome Deſign on the places on that ſide, they made uſe of the Troups that were employ'd in the Blocade of <hi>Queſnoy:</hi> But they were hardly got to the Rendezvouze, when this Generall caus'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to paſs he had ready, and revictuall'd the Town. Holding it then in ſafety, he Rendezvouz'd all his Forces, and March'd againſt <hi>Landraecies:</hi> As he had once allready taken this Town, he knew both it's Strength and Weakneſs, which much facilitated to him his Enterprize, joyn'd to this that the Kings Preſence, who was come into his Camp ſo anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57147:159"/>
the Souldiers, that they contemn'd all ſorts of Danger. The Beſieg'd being in hopes of a ſpeedy Succours wou'd never hear talk of Surrendring, tho' the King Summon'd 'em ſundry times: but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having not been able to raiſe Forces ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for raiſing the Siege, they ſaw themſelves at length oblig'd to capitulate The King after his wonted rate ſhew'd an extreme Confidence in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and wou'd by all means have him upon every occaſion give him a Reaſon for what he did. This pleas'd this General more than it did Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who wou'd very willingly have brought up his Majeſty like a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon, and not like a King, that was call'd to the Government of the Nobleſt Kingdom in all Chriſtendom; He took him off moſt commonly from thoſe Converſations, under pretext of ſome other Affairs; but the King did not leave them without regret, and tho' the Queen his Mother had foſter'd him up in a great Complaiſance for this Miniſter, he cou'd not ſo well curb his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but that he manifeſted the Violence he did him. Thus did <hi>Mazarin</hi> endeavour to make a weak King, that he might ſtill ſecure to himſelf th' Adminiſtration of his Dominions. But th' Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Nature were ſo great in this Prince, that he had no need of Education, and we ſee in his Majeſty one of the Greateſt Kings that ever wore the Crown, and yet, perhaps, the Worſt Educated. This was a Subject of Admiration for the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne:</hi> However without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what this Miniſter cou'd ſay to the matter, he inſtructed the King in what he had a mind to know, and gave him Leſſons of War, wherein he wonderfully delighted. <hi>Mazarin</hi> durſt not tell him openly his thoughts of this Carriage; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

without making ſemblance of any thing, he told him, that the King was yet too Young, to have confided in him things of Conſequence, and that in the Poſt he was it became him to keep all Secret. Thus did he conceal under the pretext of Myſtery, Motions full of Ambition, and perchance of Jealouſy; for in ſhort this great familiarity of the King's with the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> diſpleas'd him extremely, and he fear'd leaſt the Viſcount ſhou'd get that Aſcendant over his Majeſtys mind, as that he ſhou'd not be able to drive him thence. For this Reaſon had he for ſome Years laſt paſt Aſſociated the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> with him in the Command of the Forces. But the Difference of their Humours had produc'd an effect quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he had expected: The King being a Lover of Mildneſs and Lenity cou'd not wont himſelf to the Violences of that Mareſchal, who was ever ſeen in Anger ev'n at his up-riſing. In the mean while the Cardinal to leſſen the Glory that might redound to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> for ſo many happy Succeſſes, laid a part of them to th' Other, and the Generality to pleaſe this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, endeavour'd to conferr on him Praiſes, often without mentioning the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> This Prince ſmil'd in himſelf, and ſtill continu'd his old Road, being well perſuaded that many were there that did him Juſtice: But in ſhort the Enemies quickly decided the Queſtion, and made appear with whom they moſt fear to have to do. After the taking of <hi>La drceies,</hi> th' Army divided into Two. Ths Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> took one part of it, and the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> th' other; the later March'd againſt <hi>St. Guilain,</hi> the former againſt <hi>Condé.</hi> The two Garriſons were very different. As th' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were particularly under Apprehenſions for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57147:160"/>
the later of thoſe two Towns, they had put two Thouſand men into the place and above three Hundred Reformed Officers. Th' other was nothing near ſo well provided. However the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> having loſt time to no purpoſe in trifles, th' Enemies March'd againſt him, and oblig'd him to Retreat. He return'd and joyn'd again the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Army, who had been more cautious, and directed his Meaſures better, ſo as that th' Enemies drawing near, durſt not undertake to force his Lines. Having thus had time to continue his Attacques, he won the Out-works, and forc'd the Garriſon to Surrender: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having loſt this Town, made divers motions to hinder him from attacquing <hi>St. Guilain;</hi> but having provided for all the places they might threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he laid Siege to't, and carry'd it under their Noſe. They endeavour'd to Revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on <hi>Queſnoy,</hi> round which they held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Poſts; but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> went and Encamp'd upon the Avenues, and their Army durſt never attempt to open the Paſſage. So proſperous a Campagne ſtill augmented his Repute, and if the Cardinal had not ſtill had a Secret jealouſy of him; the King wou'd have heap'd on him ſo many Bounties, as wou'd have put him into a Condition to Envy no Bodies Fortune. But this Miniſter told the King in Private, that it was not conveuient to raiſe him ſo high, and that after having twice ſided with Rebells, he was more than rewarded for the Services he had ſince perform'd. The King was not wont to reſiſt the Cardinalls Wills; thus things ſtopp'd there, tho' there was a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between his Actions, and thoſe of th' other Captains that Commanded the Armies: In effect, People obſerv'd ſundry faults they committed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57147:160"/>
this Campagne; and yet all the Rewards were for them. The Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who was in <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> after having taken <hi>Cepdaquiers</hi> that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded the City o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Roſes,</hi> inſtead of quickly paſſing the Mountains, trifl'd away his time in Debauchery with the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> his Brother-in-Law, who was arriv'd upon the Coaſt with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, ſo as that he gave the Enemies time to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, on whom he might have made conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conqueſts. For the Cardinal to take away a thouſand Diſtaſts that People endeavour'd to give him of his Allyance, had done all he had been able to put him in a Capacity of acquiring Honour: But all this was bounded in taking <hi>Caſtillon</hi> and <hi>Solſonne,</hi> two ſorry Places, but whoſe Conqueſt was Highly Boaſted among thoſe who knew not what they were, for the offering Incenſe to the Cardinal. This gave him Occaſion to ſhed his Bounties upon this Prince, who was in no good Condition to enjoy them; for in the Middle of the Campagne he was forc'd to leave the Army, to go ſeek for Remedy to a Malady that was become too invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to be cured. The Count <hi>de Merinville</hi> had the Command of the Army after his Departure, and made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> raiſe the Siege of <hi>Solſonne,</hi> which they thought to have recover'd: But the ſame Misfortune befell him before <hi>Bergues,</hi> which they had taken, and he wou'd have retaken from them; Inſomuch that neither ſide had any great reaſon to Vaunt of its Great Succeſſes. Much the ſame thing was it in <hi>Italy,</hi> where if we had the Advantage of Cauſing the Siege of <hi>Reggio</hi> to be rais'd, which the Governour of the <hi>Milanez</hi> had laid out of ſpight to the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> our Ally, We had afterwards the vexation of diſcamping from before <hi>Pavia,</hi> whither we march'd under the Orders
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57147:161"/>
of that Duke, and under thoſe of Prince <hi>Thomas:</hi> As divers faults had been noted in the Conduct of all thoſe Generals, it was a Subject of enhancing the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Glory, who knew ſo well how to diſgeſt his Entirprizes, that without ſome great Misfortune, he was ſure of bringing them about. However tho' his friends made uſe of all theſe things for matter in his Praiſe, it was not needfull to go ſeek it ſo far of, and there needed only to make reflexion upon what he dayly did, to judge that few there were like him: For without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning Military Actions, he gave every moment Occaſion to admire his Virtue; this was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally manifeſted in point of Intereſt, which may be ſaid to be the touch-ſtone of Men, ſince the truth is, few there are but ſhew Weakneſs upon this Chapter. As his Charge gave him the Pow'r of Eſtabliſhing Safe-Guards, this was a ſure means of making himſelf Rich, and the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> ſet him th' Example, deriving thence dayly three or four hundred Crowns; for he ſent Troupers thither, to whom he gave a Crown of the five or ſix he Exacted of each Place, and the Number produc'd him a vaſt Revenue. The Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> did not want People that advis'd him to do the like, Eſpecially thoſe that had the management of his Expences, who remonſtrated to him, that this was a Succours ready at hand for a thouſand things that were wanting in his family. But the Prince was ever ſo far from being prevail'd with to be tampering in ſo Villanous a Commerce, that he chid thoſe very much that made him the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and left thoſe ſorts of Profits, one while to his Captain of the Guards, and another to Officers that needed it. Not a man cou'd refrain admiring a Generoſity, that had no Example among the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57147:161"/>
but he ſaid when he was ſpoke to upon the point, that he did not believe they did all that was imputed to them, and that he wou'd lay a Wager the ſame thing was ſaid of him, tho' the truth was he was never reckon'd in that Number. Thus did he endeavour to excuſe others for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the Praiſes People wou'd have conferr'd on him, and he evaded them in ſuch manner, that often he prevented them by Diſcourſes as would have made it believ'd he had been in Anger, if the reaſon of his ſpeaking ſo had not been known. However to hinder any one from being ſo hardy as to give him the like vexation, he was wont to ſay, there was nothing ſavour'd more of the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, than a man that pretended to commend another in his Preſence; That it was with them as with thoſe Women, who after having told one another a Thouſand obliging things, are no ſooner at a diſtance from one another, than that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter one another as much as poſſibly they can. However in the time that this Prince was the moſt eſteem'd, it wanted little, but that an unexpected Death had cropt him in the flower of his Age. As he was extremely weary'd in the foregoing Compagn, he was hardly arriv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> but that he fell ill, and having been oblig'd to keep his Bed, People were afraid that his ſickneſs might have Dangerous Conſequences, for he had a fierce feavour with Redoublings; Inſomuch that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians did not tell their Opinions. The King ſent twice a day to enquire how he did, as well as moſt of the Grandees; But the Cardinal in this Occaſion lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide the jealouſie he bore him, by reaſon of the Intereſt of the Kingdom, paid him not only diverſe viſits, but brought him alſo ſome Medicaments, which he had been told to be wonderfully effectuall againſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57147:162"/>
his Diſtemper. In a word the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping more happily than the World expected, he return'd his viſits as ſoon as he was in a Condition of going abroad, and being dayly more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his health, nothing any longer hindred him from repairing to the frontiere, but the Marriage of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Bouillon,</hi> Courted by the Duke of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeufi</hi>'s Eldeſt Son. This Prince was of ſo Illuſtrious a family, that all the kindred agreed immediately to the Match: For beſides this he had a great Eſtate, &amp; might alſo pretend to ſome conſiderable Settlement at Court: but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> ſeeing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Others, oppos'd it Clandeſtinely, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to Madam <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> that this Prince having us'd his firſt Wife Ill, whom he had kick'd when with Child, of which ſhe dy'd, 'twas expoſing her Daughter to the like treatment; that he was addicted to Wine and Women, Qualities not only unworthy a Perſon of his Rank, but all ſo to a little Catamitiſm; that beſides he had a Son by his firſt Bed, who by Birthright wou'd have all his Father's Eſtates and Offices; that thus it wou'd be rendering the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that ſhou'd come of her Daughter and him ſo Unhappy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they wou'd uot have wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to uphold the Luſtre of their Houſe; that it wou'd be better to think of providing for her in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> where they had already ſome Allyances, and where Enow other Matches might be found; that ſhe ought not to conſider that ſhe diſtanc'd her ſelf from her by doing this, that it were much better for her Daughter to be happy far off, than unhappy at her Door; that the true kindneſs of a mother conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in procuring her Children's felicity and not her own; and that in brief any farther thoughts of this Match were ſteering the quite Contrary Courſe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bouillon</hi> in all things rely'd very much on the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57147:162"/>
Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> but wou'd not refer her ſelf to him at this time, for ſhe imagin'd it wou'd be the ſame thing to her to have her Daughter Dead, as have her marry'd ſo remote; However this was not th' only Impediment; She was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Wedded to her Religion, and afraid that if ever her Daughter went into <hi>Germany,</hi> ſhe might with the air of the Country have inſtill'd into her the Sentiments of her Anceſtours, that had been all Proteſtants. Thus the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not been able to diſſuade her, was oblig'd to conſent as well as Others to this Marriage, which was perform'd in the preſence of the King and Queen-Mother, and of all the Court, their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties meaning thareby to teſtify to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> the Conſideration they had for a Perſon of ſo near Relation. This Match was quickly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecundity, whereas the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was not Bleſs'd with any Children; which was the only Subject of trouble in his Marriage, for he had otherwiſe a Wife that lov'd him infinitely, and was an Example of Virtue: He reſign'd himſelf however to the Will of God, and thro' this want he look'd on his Brother's Sons as if they had been his own; He had alſo other Nephews, but as they were his Siſters Sons and did not bear his Name, he made ſome ſort of difference between 'em: Not but that he ſtrove to give 'em teſtimonys of his kindneſs in all Occaſions, &amp; principally to the Counts <hi>de Duras &amp; de Lorge,</hi> who had great need of it. For they follow'd the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Party, wherein they were ſo En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, that they had all imaginable trouble to get out of it. However the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> loſt no time in his endeavours to diſentangle them thence, and having at length effected his purpoſes, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the King's leave for their Kiſſing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtics

hand; After that, he ſent them to ſerve in <hi>Italy,</hi> for as they were Young, he thought it not fitting that they ſhou'd be expos'd to the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and Suſpitions that might ariſe, if they ſtaid in the Neighbourhood of a Prince they eſteem'd, and with whom they had newly broke as a man may ſay againſt their Wills. In the mean while the Campagn drew near, and that having oblig'd him to leave <hi>Paris,</hi> at a time when all his Family was in joy for the Match before-mention'd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd to <hi>Flanders</hi> whither all the Troups directed their March. We had newly made a ſtrict Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who after the moſt Enormous Crime that had been ever heard of in the world, had found the Secret to become formidable not only to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but alſo the neighbouring Princes. In virtue of this Allyance he was to give us Succours by Sea and Land, and we were Engag'd to ſhare with him the Conqueſts we might make. Theſe Conventions amaz'd the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> this, notwithſtanding, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing of what might contribute to their Defence, and Don <hi>Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> being newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in the Low-Countrys, ſhew'd himſelf indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, after the Prince of <hi>Conde's</hi> example, who was on Horſe-back Day and Night: they had in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſs'd of the City of St. <hi>Guilain,</hi> which render'd us a little haughty, not to ſay inſolent: but fortune prepar'd them matter of Conſolation, which we were far from diſtruſting. I ſaid before that the Marſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> had great jealoſie of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> this had been already adverſe to the Kings Service in Sundry Occaſions: But the Cardinal out of I know not what Policy being not willing to Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, they had orders to march joyntly againſt <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt Towns in all the Low Countrys, but whoſe out-work were not in an
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57147:163"/>
overgood Condition: They work'd on 'em with great Application, yet if we had made right uſe of the Conjunction, it might have been taken without Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, before they had put it into a Condition. But the Marſchal <hi>de la Ferte</hi> labouring under an Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on purpoſe ſtaid the forces that were under his Command, for fear the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> might without him accompliſh that enterprize. Being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what recover'd of his health, he came before the place which the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had allready inveſted, and where there aroſe between 'em new ſubjects of Diviſion; for after they had open'd their Trenches, and puſh'd on their Works very far, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having ſignify'd to him to have a Care of his Quarters, that were Separated from his by a Canal, which was impoſſible to fill, and on which there were Bridges for the having Communication toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he took this advertiſement as an Injury, and refus'd to receive four or five Regiments of Re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Viſcount offer'd him for his Security. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having notice by his Spies, that he was to be attack'd in the Night, did not deſiſt for this forc't Refuſal, and having ſent him Word that the Kings Service requir'd his making him once more the ſame Offers, he Expected his Anſwer; but that having been no more favourable to him than the former, he ſtood upon his own Guard and left th' other to do as he pleas'd. The Night being come, the Enemies did not fail of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching under the Conduct of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> who had us'd their utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances for the Relief of ſo conſiderable a Place, and thinking to have a better hand o're the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> than of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> they attack'd his Lines with ſo much Vigour, that they were forc'd after a Conflict but meanly diſputed.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57147:164"/>
The moſt part endeavour'd to ſcape o're to the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s ſide; But the Waters, which the Enemies had caus'd to diſgorge on purpoſe, after having ruin'd ſome Bridges upon the Dyke, and the others were ſo over-burden'd by the great Numbers of men that fled away, that ſome of 'em broke. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> caus'd Men to march immediately that Way-wards to hinder the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from mingling among the Runaways; but this being a difficult matter to accompliſh by reaſon of the darkneſs and Diſorder, he caus'd the remaining Bridge, to be broke down, and thereby took away all hopes of ſafety from the Vanquiſh'd: After this it was nothing but a Slaughter, many were drown'd in the Dyke in endeavouring to avoid periſhing by the hand of the Enemies, th' Others were kill'd fighting, and the reſt were taken Priſoners, and among others the Mareſehal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> who was led to <hi>Rocroy;</hi> the Waggons, Tents, and Baggages were the Booty of the Conquerours: But meaning to puſh on their Victory further, they endeavour'd to repair the Bridge, to Purſue the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> in his retreat to <hi>Queſnoy.</hi> In the mean while, having Seiz'd on an advantageous Poſt, he ſtaid in Battalia for the Fugitives, and there came a much greater Number than cou'd be Expected, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Mighty Diſorder that had been; But the Night had often confounded a <hi>French-man</hi> with a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the later for fear of deſtroying a friend had often ſpar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d an Enemy. This Unhappy Succeſs amaz'd the Court, that glory'd a little too much afore in all the advantages it had gain'd; However, putting a great Confidence in the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Prudence and Conduct, he had ſent him a re-inforcement of ſome Troups, with which he durſt not only keep the Field, but likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57147:164"/>
Enterprizes. In effect, ſeeing that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had Attacqu'd <hi>St. Guilain,</hi> he went and took <hi>La Capelle,</hi> and then march'd to give them Battle. The Enemies judg'd it not convenient to ſtay his Coming, and having rais'd the Siege he revictuall'd the Town. The Court having been afraid of ſome new Blow, was ſtrangely Surpriz'd at this Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Performance, and the Cardinal thinking he had too great an Obligation to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to remain without giving him Inſtances of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment; promis'd him many things. But this Prince placing all his Ambition in ſerving well the King, demanded no other Recompence but that he might never more be coupl'd with the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> which was granted him. This Year paſs'd thus in <hi>Flanders</hi> with a fortune Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd with Good and bad, while that in <hi>Catalonia</hi> we ſtood upon the Defenſive, and that in <hi>Italy</hi> we beleaguer'd <hi>Valence.</hi> This Siege was long and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for th' Enemies having Aſſembl'd all their forces, and drawing near our Lines, thought to put us under the Conſtraint of raiſing it, after having got ſome ſuccours into the Town; but the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> commanding our Army, obſtinately perſevering not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Unhappy ſucceſs, minded his Bus'<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs more narrowly, and having ſhut up the Paſſes better than he had before, he at length reduc'd the Beſeig'd to ſo great an Extremity, that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to capitulate. This was a great Mortification for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who began to tremble for the Land of <hi>Milan,</hi> that had been ſo ſucceſsfully ſet upon. In the Interim they endeavour'd to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on <hi>Roſes,</hi> which we ſtill held in <hi>Catalonia;</hi> but we ſo well broak all their Meaſures, that they durſt not come nearer than two Leagues from the Town: All theſe Proſperities made the Cardinal forget the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57147:165"/>
vexation he had had for the Mareſchal <hi>de la Fertè's</hi> Defeat. But fortune being willing to put him in mind that he ſhou'd be Expos'd when ſhe pleas'd to her Caprices, made him feel a New Afliction by the loſs of Madam <hi>de Mercoeur</hi> his Niece after ſome few days illneſs. This Grief, being particularly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his family, was follow'd by another wherein the Publique ſhar'd, which was the taking of <hi>Saint Guilain,</hi> of which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made themſelves Maſters, what ever Precautions were us'd on our ſide. Nay, and Suddainly after this too we under went a New Diſgrace, which was the raiſing the Siege of <hi>Cambray,</hi> whither the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had march'd with all his forces. This Place, whoſe Conqueſt was of ſuch importance to the repoſe of <hi>Picardy,</hi> having only a Weak Garriſon, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> fancy'd a more propitious time cou'd not be taken for the reducing it to Obedience; for which reaſon he made haſte to inveſt it, and to work upon the Lines of Circumvallation; But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that breaks, when ſhe pleaſes, the juſteſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, popt the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> in his way, which diſappointed his Enterprize. The Prince, without foreſeeing this Siege, had appointed his Horſe to Rendezvouve near <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57147:165"/>
to paſs the Wood, he came at Night within a Musket-ſhot of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had not yet finiſht his Lines of Circumvallation. Thus the way being all Smooth, he paſs'd without any Obſtacle, and march'd very cloſe, untill that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been diſcover'd by ſome Squadrons that march'd againſt him with Sword in hand, they fell juſt upon that his Highneſs led, where were moſt of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and having routed it, ſeveral were taken, ſo as that he wou'd have ran a riſque of falling into the Enemies hands, cou'd they have known him: But ſcaping by favour of the Night, he joyn'd his Other Squadrons that were advanc'd towards the Town. Thus <hi>Cambray</hi> having been reliev'd by a throw of Hazzard, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s part was now to retreat; for tho' he had not loſt a man, yet as the Weakneſs of the Garriſon was his invitation to the undertaking that ſiege, it requir'd his altering his Conduct. Things having thus Chang'd their Aſpect, this did not hinder the Court from thinking of Other Conqueſts, and that of <hi>Montmedy</hi> being important, the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> receiv'd orders to march thither, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to oppoſe it's Relief: th' Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſeing him Encamp'd between <hi>Montmedy</hi> and them, and a difficult task to make their way thro' him, made a fluſter as if they aim'd at all Our Places ſo to get him leave his Poſts. But the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> contenting himſelf with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for thoſe that were threatned, did not diſtance himſelf in ſuch manner as to be Cut-off. Having thus kept the Enemies in Breath, they march'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Charlemont</hi> where they had a Paſſage upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> which oblig'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to throw himſelf into the Lines of <hi>Montmedy</hi> with a Detachment.

General, remain'd in the mean while with the reſt of our Army to have an Eye to and ward our Places, ſo as that th' Enemies having no hopes on that ſide, aſſembl'd a flying Camp of the Garriſons of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and other the Towns bordering upon the ſea, and after having made a ſhew one while of falling upon <hi>Ardres,</hi> another upon <hi>Bethune,</hi> all of a Suddain they pour'd upon <hi>Calice,</hi> whoſe Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been Weakned to provide for another ſide. They at the very firſt carry'd the Lower Town, by having met with ſmall Oppoſition in the firſt ſurprize; but upon their aſſaulting the Upper Town, they were vigorouſly repuls'd, after having nevertheleſs gain'd ſome petty Advantage as might augment their hopes. The Enemies having thus miſs'd their Stroke, reſolv'd to Enter <hi>France,</hi> hoping that this wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d oblige us to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Montmedy:</hi> But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> drawing near the <hi>Somme,</hi> they were afraid leaſt he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſs that River; ſo as that after having made an Inroad into <hi>le Santerre,</hi> they retreated in all haſte. All theſe Motions gave the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> time to continue his Aſſaults, and having won all the Outworks, thoſe of <hi>Montmedy</hi> Surrender'd, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having obtain'd an Honourable Capitulation. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being then no longer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to obſerve th' Enemies, march'd againſt <hi>Saint Venant,</hi> which made them believe they ſhou'd have time to take <hi>Ardres.</hi> And indeed the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſound much more Difficulty than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in his Enterprize, not however thro' the Reſiſtance of the Beſieg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, but becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary of th' Army had not Money wherewithall to further the Works: Seeing this, he caus'd his Plate to be cut in pieces to much about the worth of a Crown, and diſtributed it among the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57147:166"/>
in due Proportion. Having thus remedy'd that Obſtacle he march'd againſt the Enemies, who upon the Tydings of his Coming rais'd the ſiege of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres;</hi> but they having ſeiz'd on certain Poſts by which he was to file off, they attack'd his Rear, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having put it to ſome Diſorder, they plunder'd ſeveral Waggons, part of which were nevertheleſs recover'd. This Exploit having not however been capable to comfort them for the loſſes they dayly under went, they beleaguer'd <hi>Mardyk</hi> after having receiv'd ſome Reinforcements; But this Enterprize ſpeeding them no better than the former, they retired without Shewing themſelves any more that Campagne. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having them no longer upon his hands, fell to fortifying <hi>Saint Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and <hi>Bourbourg,</hi> the Enemies having been ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as to abandon this laſt Place; for by the means of thoſe two Poſts he pretended to ſhut up <hi>Dunkirk</hi> in ſuch manner, as to hinder any thing from entring that faſtneſs. However in the Midſt of ſo many happy Events he was not Exempt from feeling the laſhes of fortune. Madam <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> a Princeſs extremly Virtuous and very neceſſary to his family, dying, he ſaw himſelf Encharg'd with his Nephews, the Eldeſt of whom was not yet in his Sixteenth year; He endeavour'd to bring 'em up in Virtue, and having ſhewn them by his own Example, that they ſhou'd leſs apply themſelves to the heaping up Riches than to the acquiring a good Reputation, they improv'd ſo well by his Leſſons, that they gave him all kind of Content.</p>
            <p>Our Succeſſes in <hi>Italy</hi> had not been ſo propitious as in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> after having taſted repoſe was grown as weary of that as he had been of Warr, and out of a Genius that it was impoſſible to fix, he had demanded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57147:167"/>
of the Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> which had diſpleas'd the Duke of <hi>Modena.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> hoped that this Diviſion wou'd the more facilitate to them their recovering of <hi>Valence,</hi> and they had Block'd it up ſo cloſe, that they expected neceſſity wou'd make it fall into their hands without their ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a blow. The Marquis <hi>de Vallavoir,</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this place, never ceas'd repreſenting to theſe two Princes the want he labour'd under of all things; which made them Prorogue their Differences to give him Succours. Good luck having ſeconded their Enterprize, they open'd a Paſs, and having put in two Convoys, their Miſunderſtanding renew'd as before. The Town being nevertheleſs Secur'd by this means, they were aſham'd to have it ſaid that with ſo conſiderable an Army as that they had, they lay ſtill without any Performances; For which reaſon they went and beleaguer'd <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but their Diſſention ſtill more and more augmenting, things ſpun out into ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>r the Canon had made, that they choſe rather to raiſe the Siege, than to expoſe themſelves what might poſſibly be the Iſſue of th' Engagement. Having made ſuch a ſcandalous Retreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> th' Enemies Block'd-up <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> anew, being not ſtrong though to attacque it by main Force. In truth they had ſent a great part of their Troups into <hi>Portugal,</hi> where the War was re-inflam'd after ſome Ceſſations that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the Hoſtilities: This Diverſion did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57147:167"/>
incapacitate them from undertaking any thing conſiderable in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where the War was but juſt kept alive, without any great Advantage on either ſide, for while one ſide took a Caſtle the adverſe took another; and thus paſs'd the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn, none but the People ſuffering, who had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffer'd ſufficiently by ſo long a War. The Two Crowns cou'd not be otherwiſe than weary, as well as their Subjects, for Miſery had rais'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts in <hi>Spain</hi> as well as in <hi>France,</hi> which did but too much manifeſt the need there was of Peace. The Cardinal had already (a Year or two paſt) caus'd ſome Propoſals to be made to <hi>Don Antonio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h th' <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heireſs of the Crown. Thus the Council of his <hi>Catholique Majeſty</hi> had judg'd with ſome ſort of Reaſon, that all the Offers that were made of cauſing the King to renounce her Succeſſion, would hold good no further than this Young Prince ſhou'd pleaſe, ſince by the Laws Eſtabliſh'd in his Kingdom he was acquitted whenever ſo minded of what was to his Prejudice. Theſe things putting thus an Impediment to the Peace, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to puſh on his Conqueſts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to oblige the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to ſerve him ſtill with the more Affection, he gave the Charge of Lord High Chamberlain to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> for which however the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that had it afore, had ſome ſort of Compenſation. After the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had thank'd the King, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his leave of him, he repair'd to the head of his Army that aſſembl'd upon the frontier of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnois,</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:57147:168"/>
and being entred into the Country he caus'd <hi>Caſſel</hi> to be attack'd, that was guarded by five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men; Ours wou'd not receive them otherwiſe than at Diſcretion, after which th' Army approach'd <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which was inveſted by four thouſand Horſe. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> on their part, according to the Convention before mention'd, ſhut up the Paſſages of the ſea with a Good Fleet; and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> Expecting the Enemies wou'd ſpare nothing to relieve a Place of This Conſequence, made haſt to preſs on his Works and Attacks. But the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon being good, retarded both by it's ſaillies, at length th' Enemies had time to take the field. The Mareſchal <hi>d'Hocquincourt</hi> had Expos'd their Party, upon ſome affront he pretended to have received from the Cardinal, and of which having demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reparation without having been able to obtain it, he had run to that Extremity, in hopes of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an Occaſion to Wreak his Revenge. As he was a Soldier, he meant to Signalize his Coming by ſome Action that might make him noted by both Parties. Whereupon he advanc'd to view us, but having been wounded at the ſame time with a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot, his hopes ended two hours after with his Life. His Diſaſter was a fatal Preſage for thoſe of his Party, but as Brave Men are not ſtartled at ſuch like things, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and <hi>Don Juan</hi> purſu'd their enterprize. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to ſpare them the pains of coming to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque his Lines, march'd out of them at the Head of his Army, leaving however in the Trenches as many men as were neceſſary to guard them; They drew-up in Battalia, as ſoon as they were out, and the Enemies having done the like, the Battle began very obſtinately on both ſides: But th' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies having been overwheIm'd by numbers, gave
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57147:168"/>
ground by little and little; after this their Ranks growing ſtill more and more thin, the Diſorder was ſtill the Greater; Inſomuch that they were put totally to ſlight. None but the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who at the head of ſome Squadrous he had rally'd, and where all thoſe Brave men plac'd themſelves, that follow'd his fortune, that endeavour'd to make any further Reſiſtance: But the moſt part having been either Kill'd or taken Priſoners, he was very happy in having a good Horſe to ſave himſelf. The Victory cou'd not be more ſignal than it was for us, the Enemies fled away 'till Night, without facing about, and far from being in a Condition of returning to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> they cou'd hardly bring ſix thouſand men together all the Reſt of the Campagne. After the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had giv'n the Orders neceſſary for the purſuing them, he returned into his Lines, where he was no ſooner come, but that he made known the Succeſs of the Battle to the Beſieged, that ſo they might take their Meaſures accordingly. They pretended not to be in any wiſe daunted, and, in Effect, made ſeveral Sallyes more: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having ſhut 'em up by little and little, and taken all their Out-works, at length he render'd himſelf Maſter of the Town by Compoſition. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt wou'd have occaſion'd Great joy thro' all the Kindgom, if we had not been bound by the Treaty made with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to put it into their hands. However in a few days after, we were in no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make that Reflexion, by an Accident of a far greater Moment. The King, whoſe Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was all Warlike, being not to be prevail'd with for two or three Years laſt paſt, to abſtain from repairing into his Armies, he came during this Campagne, to viſit the Fort of <hi>Mardyk,</hi> an
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57147:169"/>
Unhealthfull hole of it ſelf, but whoſe Infection was ſtill the Greater thro' the Garriſons way of Living, that Eating only Fruits and filthy things, was for the moſt part ſick. However this Prince being Young, and not knowing the Danger, muſt notwithſtanding needs ſtop there, that he might ſee All, and having taken-in the Ill Air, he return'd to <hi>Calice</hi> with the Sun on his head, which complicated his misfortune. Whereupon he began to undergo great pains, but having conceal'd his Malady for two days, for fear they ſhou'd oblige him to keep his Bed, at laſt on the third he found himſelf ſo weak that he cou'd no longer diſſemble it, on the, fourth he was ſtill worſe, which alarum'd the Court and eſpecially the Cardinal, who ſaw his Fortune loſt, if this Young Prince happen'd to dye; for tho' his Majeſty had a Brother, he cou'd not promiſe himſelf that he ſhou'd have his favour as he had the Kings. The Queen-Mother was alſo under an Affliction that's beyond expreſſion: But it was quite another thing at ſome days end, for it was not only believ'd he cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d never ſcape, but the very Curtains were drawn, the Phyſicians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declar'd him Dead. Some Courtiers being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by theſe words, went to pay their Homages to the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> his Brother, but they had occaſion to rue it, for as thoſe ſorts of things are rarely pardon'd, the King look'd on them with an ill eye, when he had recover'd his health. In the mean while, the Queen never leaving him day or night, ſeeing he was abandon'd by his Phyſicians, caus'd one to come from <hi>Abbeville,</hi> whom ſhe had heard well ſpoken off, and he having giv'n him two Potions of <hi>Emetique</hi> wine being not yet in uſe at that time, freed him from his illneſs to the Courtiers great Satisfaction, whoſe hearts this
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57147:169"/>
Young Prince had won by manners alltogether En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging. They alone did not rejoyce at this happy Succeſs, the People ſhar'd in it as deeply as became them, and gave a thouſand teſtimonies of their gladneſs. But not a man had more joy than the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had often diſcourſt the King, and diſcover'd in his Converſation many great things, which Others knew not ſo well as he; yet as he cou'd not teſtify it to him orally, he teſtify'd it to him by Letters, to which the King made a moſt obliging Anſwer, ſignifying to him among other things, that what he dayly perform'd for his Service, perſuaded him ſufficiently of his good will, without its being neceſſary for his confirming it to him by Letters. This having giv'n him ſtill the more deſire to Sacrifice himſelf for his Majeſty, he purſu'd his Conqueſts, which be ſtill augmented with that ef <hi>Bergues, Furnes,</hi> and <hi>Dixmuyden:</hi> But when he was preparing to puſh things further, ſeveral Seditions broke out in the Provinces of <hi>France;</hi> which occaſion'd the ſending Troups thither: As there were no conſiderable Perſons that buoy'd-up the Rebells, they were quickly reduc'd to Obedience by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome; <hi>Bonneſon</hi> was Beheaded, ſome others were hang'd; &amp; all this having requir'd only the time of going and coming, there remain'd ſtill enow to terminate this Campagne, as it had been begun. Whereupon Orders were diſpatcht to the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> to Advance with the Troups that had Winter'd in his Government, and the Viſcount <hi>de Terenne</hi> having promis'd to make head againſt the Enemies, <hi>La Ferté</hi> Beſieg'd <hi>Gravelines,</hi> which we had loſt again in the time of our Civil Wars. The Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> having accompliſht this Enterprize, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> took <hi>Oudenarde,</hi> and <hi>Menin,</hi> after which he march'd againſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57147:170"/>
City of <hi>Ypres.</hi> The Prince <hi>de Ligne,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry, knowing we were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to inveſt it, quitted the Neighbourhood of that Place, under which he was Encamp'd, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd as far as a <hi>Defilé,</hi> where he not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the paſs, but allſo repuls'd two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Houſe: The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was ſtrangely amaz'd to ſee 'em come back in Diſorder, and having Commanded the Count <hi>de Roye</hi> to march with the Regiment <hi>Royale Aranger,</hi> of which he was Colonel, he retriev'd the Others Reputation, and oblig'd the Prince <hi>de Ligne</hi> to retreat; whereupon the Place having been inveſted by this Count, who was the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Nephew, the Siege was quickly form'd, and had the Succeſs as ſo many Others had had. This ſtartl'd the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſaw ſo many good Towns wreſted out of their hands, without being able to uſe any Prevention; for as their Dominions are divided from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Succours they might draw thence, were reduc'd to a ſmall matter, before they arriv'd where they were neceſſary. In the mean while, little more proſperous were they in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of ſo many Principalities and Kingdoms, ſeem'd, to ſhelter them from ſuch like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, for they had not been wanting to loſe allſo that Campagne, the City of <hi>Trin,</hi> which they had kept at leaſt Six or Seaven Years, that is to ſay ſince our Domeſtique Diviſions had render'd our Allys unprovided of all ſort of Defence. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to repair this Loſs by the taking of <hi>Valence,</hi> which they pretended to Surprize by Scalado; but they were ſo well repell'd, that they loſt three or four hundred men in that Action: Beſides this we took <hi>Mortare;</hi> and having made Inroads as far as the Gates of <hi>Milan,</hi> the Inhabitants of that Town
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57147:170"/>

               </gap>ce. We were not alltogether ſo Succeſsfull in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where having Beleaguer'd <hi>Campredon,</hi> we were compell'd to raiſe the Siege: However as this was a ſmall matter in Compariſon of what had happen'd in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> all the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Potentates were wonderfully Surpriz'd to ſee ſo great an Alteration in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, which gave, as I may ſay, the Law to all <hi>Europe,</hi> not above fifteen or ſixteen years afore. Yet it ſelf was ſtartled, and as it ſaw no Remedy, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Many were of Opinion to conclude the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi>'s Marriage with the King, but the Difficulty mention'd a little afore ſtill ſubſiſted, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> cou'd not reſolve upon't, ſo as that recourſe was to be had to other means. The Court of <hi>France</hi> knowing the Repugnance the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had to this Match, ſet their thoughts to work, to provide for the King on another ſide, and there being not a more agreeable Princeſs in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor that better ſuted his Majeſty, than the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> Her Picture was ſent for, which ſo pleas'd the King, that he reſolv'd to go ſee the Original; whereupon the Court took a Progreſs to <hi>Lion,</hi> whither the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> repair'd with her Children. The Princeſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> did not by her Preſence deface the agreeable Ideas the King had form'd of her, and as he was ſuſceptible of Amorous Impreſſions, he was in a great Diſpoſition to Love her; when the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeeing the War Eternal, if this Match came to be conſummated, ſent <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentel</hi> to <hi>Lions</hi> to break it off.

The King knowing that all things were regulated, made Preparations to go receive his Bride, who was to be brought him as far as the Entrance of his Dominions. He wou'd needs have the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to attend him in this journey, and ſent for him on purpoſe from the Army, whither he had ſent him to have an Eye to all things: For as in Truces a Surprize is more particularly to be apprehended, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> himſelf had been of Opinion to repair to the Army. The King being come to <hi>St. Jean de Luz,</hi> was very willing to ſee the <hi>Infanta</hi> without making himſelf known; but the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who wou'd needs conduct his Daughter himſelf, and had often ſeen the Kings Picture, eaſily knew him; the King being diſcover'd, no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd himſelf. The two Kings Embrac'd with great Cordiality, after which they preſented to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Principal Lords of their Court. The Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne,</hi> not advancing one of the firſt, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ask'd to ſee him, ſaying he was very willing to make his Peace with him, that he franckly confeſs'd he had often born him an ill will,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57147:171"/>
conſidering he had been ſeveral times the Cauſe that he had not Slept heartily; but that ſince the Peace was made, he was content to pardon him. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> receiv'd as became him theſe teſtimonies of Eſteem, and this firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview of the two Kings being terminated with much Civility on either ſide, each withdrew his own Ways. In the mean while, all things were put in readineſs to forward the Marriage, and <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> to whom the King had ſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation to Marry the <hi>Infanta,</hi> having ſatisfy'd this Ceremony, ſhe was put into the King her Husband's hands, who after having Marry'd her anew in the face of the Church, return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Entry was prepared for his Majeſty. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> did not leave him one ſtep in all this journey, and from his Goodneſs he receiv'd Sundry takens of Eſteem and Acknowledgment; for the King being not contented with giving him the Charge of Colonel-General of the Horſe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated allſo that of Mareſchal <hi>de Camp</hi> General, with which he gratif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'d the Viſcount. The King wou'd have conferr'd on him many other ſavours, if he had not been chill'd in thoſe his kind Intentions, by the Averſion he bore People of the Religion; for which reaſon he himſelf propos'd to him to turn Catholique, and made him hope, that in caſe of Conformity, he wou'd revive the Charge of Conſtable in his favour, that had been Suppreſs'd after <hi>Leſdiguicre's</hi> Death, who had laſt poſſeſs'd it: but after having thank'd the King for his goodneſs towards him, he deſir'd to be Excus'd if he cou'd not obey him in this point, adding that he would not betray his Conſcience for all the Riches and the Honours in the World. The King did not Eſteem him the leſs for this, nor did any of the

Courtiers, knowing the Offers he had ſlight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the mean while, the King being come to <hi>Paris</hi> was receiv'd there with an admirable Magnificence; Every Individual with Emulation ſtriving to teſtify the Value and Affection he had for his Majeſty, and this Prince began from that time to attract the Admiration of his People, by the manner of his management of the Government. But it became quite another thing after the Cardinals Death, which happen'd ſuddainly: For as all Tranſactions cou'd only be attributed ſolely to his Majeſty, they plainly ſaw that nothing but great matters were to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from this Prince, who from the beginnings gave ſuch great Marks of Prudence and Wiſdom. Both which were principally manifeſted in the Choice he made of his Miniſters, after he had caus'd <hi>Fouquet</hi> the Superintendant of the Finances, to be Confin'd; who being become Suſpected to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by the Memoires the Cardinal had left him, Compleated his own Downfall, by an Expence above the Pow'r of a Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ct: For beſides his Houſes and his Moveables, wherein Profuſion equally reign'd, he gave the King one Entertainment, that coſt him above fifty thouſand Crowns. He was ſecur'd at <hi>Nants,</hi> and the King having intimation that he had gain'd many of the Governours of the Places by the means of his Money, he bid the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> follow him, that if any thing happen'd he might have him ready at hand to ſerve him with his Counſel, and to Execute what he ſhou'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: But no Body ſtirring, tho' Memoires were found among his Papers, that juſtify'd the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences I have mention'd, the Court return'd to <hi>Fountain-Bleau,</hi> where the Young Queen had ſtaid with the Queen-Mother. In the mean while, this Superintendants Proceſs was drawn-up; But the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57147:172"/>
Deſire that <hi>Colbert,</hi> His Succeſſour, in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Finances, had to deſtroy him, having made him ſeek after ſhamefull means to bring that Deſign about, this latter Crime made the other appear the more Innocent, ſo as that the Judges ſav'd him. In effect, as if <hi>Colbert</hi> had been afraid of his juſtifying himſelf, he caus'd his Papers to be taken away from his Houſe of <hi>Saint Mandé;</hi> but it being the Will of God, that <hi>Berier,</hi> whom he had Employ'd in that buſineſs, ſhould leave there, out of Careleſsneſs, a Requeſt that was Preſented to <hi>Colbert:</hi> This juſtify'd the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery that <hi>Fouquet</hi> had Suffer'd, and this later alledging it to be impoſſible for him to make his Defence, ſince he was bereav'd of the means by taking his Papers from him, he was only condemned to Baniſhment, tho' there was more than needed to put him to Death. <hi>Colbert's</hi> favour occaſion'd his Puniſhment to be commuted into a perpetuall Impriſonment, wherein he remain'd till his Death, which did not happen till above twenty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but this may be ſaid to have been for his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs, for making a good uſe of his Priſon, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd his faults, and repented his having liv'd as he had done amid Diſorder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he compos'd in his Confinement ſome Books of Devotion and Morality, which were publiſh'd in his Life time, but out of Modeſty wou'd not attribute them to himſelf. Be it as it will, the long Penitence he underwent, attracted him the Compaſſion of the People, and as they extremely hated <hi>Colberts</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, they regretted his, and they expreſs'd as much grief for his Death, as they had expreſs'd joy for his impriſonment.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the young Queen was brought to Bed of a Son, which rejoyc'd all <hi>France;</hi>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:57147:173"/>
All the Grandees complimented the King on this occaſion, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf of it as well as Others, the King told him, he ſhou'd be very glad he wou'd be one day like him, but that his Religion wou'd be the Cauſe he cou'd not commit to him the Care of his Education, which he wou'd have willingly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd for th'inſpiring Sentiments into him worthy of his Birth. The Viſcount <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Three or Four years Slipt away in this manner, without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable matter occurring in that State, unleſs that the Warr, that had been Extinguiſh'd had like to have been reinflam'd by an Unexpected Accident. The Count <hi>d'Eſirades</hi> was th'Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de Vatteville</hi> that of <hi>Spain.</hi> In an Entry made by another Ambaſſadour, as it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall with thoſe poſſeſs'd of the Same Dignity, to ſend their Coaches to ſuch a Solemnity, the Baron <hi>de Vatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> brib'd ſome <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to favour his Deſign of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his to paſs before that of the Count <hi>d'Eſtrades.</hi> In effect th'Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> his Coach coming up, they cut his Horſes Harneſs, and while he was ſetting them again to rights, the Baron <hi>de Vatteville</hi>'s took the Firſt place, which oblig'd th'other to return Home. As this was a ſignal Affront for the Crown, the King made a great noiſe at this Action, and having demanded ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for it in <hi>Spain,</hi> without prevailing, he ſent Orders to his Ambaſſadour at <hi>Madrid</hi> to return to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57147:173"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and his Majeſty prepar'd for War. He held divers Councils thereupon with the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who adviſing him againſt his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts that were to be at the Head of the Armies, told the King, that it ſufficed him his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhewn his Reſentment without ſtill puſhing things to extremity; that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not being in a State to renew the War, little Appearance wou'd there be, that upon ſo Unjuſt a thing they wou'd expoſe themſelves to the Inconveniences that might happen from this Rupture; that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, that they ſhou'd much rather abandon their Pretenſions, and that a little time wou'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him what Meaſures were to be taken. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ſtopp'd this Young Princes Courage that hurry'd him to Actions of great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Renown, he gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> leiſure to conſider this Action more warily than they had yet done, ſo as that after many Deliberations, they reſolv'd to diſown this Buſineſs of the Baron <hi>de Watteville.</hi> The King did not ſpeak himſelf content with this ſatisfaction no more than with the Offers that were made him to declare that they did not pretend to diſpute the Step with him, he requir'd to have this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration giv'n him in Writing; for as th'Affront had been Publique, words ſeem'd not to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to repair i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57147:174"/>
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This Affair having been thus paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, there aroſe another, which tho' it came from quite another ſide than that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet was not wanting to occaſion it to be believ'd that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had a hand in it by reaſon of his Concern in preſerving the repoſe of <hi>Italy.</hi> This Diſpute aroſe between the Pope and the King, upon the Subject of ſome Violences, that had been done to the Duke of <hi>Crequi,</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope's Guards. The King having Reaſon on his ſide, and knowing his Strength, did not conſider, as ſome of his Predeceſſours had ſillyly enough done, whether it was with the Pope he had to do, and pretended that his Holyneſs's Dignity did not exempt him from doing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Juſtice: But the Pope, pretending the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, caus'd his Army to March into <hi>Italy,</hi> after having ſent his Amb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſadour Orders to repair to his Royal Perſon. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being not ſorry that the King undertook this War that they might have occaſion to Create him Enemies, endeavour'd to Provoke the Pope againſt him, and incline to the <hi>Venetians</hi> to undertake his Defence: But the Pope wiſely conſidering that the Spiritual Arms were not ſometimes ſufficient to reſiſt the Temporal, and that he wou'd be oppreſs'd before he cou'd be Reliev'd, he choſe to come to an Accommodation with the King. Wherefore he granted his Majeſty, that for a Reparation of th'Offence done to his Ambaſſadour, a Pyramide ſhou'd be erected in the Place where the thing happen'd, that ſo it might be an Eternal Monument to Poſterity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he had pretended to give him; but the King contented himſelf with having caus'd it to be Erected, conſented ſome time after to have it taken down. In the mean while the Kings Honour
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57147:174"/>
Augmented dayly, and gradually as he grew in Age, the world diſcover'd new Qualities in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, which would have exalted him above all the Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> if he had not ſuffer'd himſelf to be too much led away with Love, and with an exceſſive deſire of acquiring Honour. He fell in Love with <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Valliere, Madam's</hi> Maid of Honour, and this Amour made the Young Queen ſometimes paſs her time ſorrily. After having gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd his fancy on that ſide, he ſet his thoughts to ſatisfy it on the other, to which he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the Marquis of <hi>Luvoy,</hi> a Miniſter that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter into Credit, and has ſince acquir'd a great Authority by his great Services. He was the Son of <hi>Monſieur le Tellier</hi> Secretary of State, afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, a Perſonage that had never abus'd his favour, and who in a time when it was difficult to Screen one's ſelf from hatred, had made many Envyers, but few Enemies. The Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> who had the ſurvivance of his Place having much Ambition, thought that the War wou'd be more favourable to him than the Peace; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without minding the Renunciation the King had made by his Contract of Marriage, he inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into him the War againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext that the Queen had Right to divers Provinces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> according to a certain Law, which he caus'd to be explain'd in his favour. Thus the War was undertaken upon this Proceſs, to which the Parties were not Summon'd, and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> was all on a ſudden Invaded, the King mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her himſelf. He did not Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Deſign to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> 'till ſome few days before his departure, having told him that he rely'd upon him for this Expedition, wherein he wou'd follow only his Council; for
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57147:175"/>
tho' the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> return'd to Court imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Peace, the King ſtill kept him at a diſtance, and had giv'n him ſome Subjects of Mortification. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had experienc'd the King's goodneſs in ſundry Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, principally when the point in Agitation was to Marry the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> his Nephew, whom he caus'd to Marry a Perſon, accounted to be of a much higher Birth than ſhe ſeem'd, was overjoy'd to ſee himſelf ſtill diſtinguiſh'd in this. However he loſt much of his wonted Gayety, for he had try'd one of the heavieſt Misfortunes that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a man. He had loſt his Wife, after a long tedious ſickneſs: and as he lov'd her as much as he was oblig'd to do by her Virtue, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find Conſolation. The King had done all in his Pow'r to alleviate his Grief, what by teſtifying to him the ſhare he took therein, or by granting him dayly ſome new favour; He had made the Count <hi>de Duras</hi> Duke and Peer in his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and his Relations and Friends were ſo well treated, as Created a Jealouſy in others. But as time alone cou'd cure him, all th'other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies us'd for that purpoſe prov'd in vain. The King, whoſe Goodneſs cou'd not be greater in his regard, being willing to ſpare him a Remembrance ſo ſenſible to him, diſcourſt him now only on the approaching Campagn; And having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him wherewithall to make his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> took Care to aſſemble th'Army, whether the King repair'd in a few days after with all the Court. This Young Prince being greedy of fame, wou'd needs have him tell him all things, and as he ſhutt himſelf up with him ſometimes ſev'n or eight hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without admitting any Miniſter, he was by
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57147:175"/>
all look'd on as a favourite in a Condition to do whatever he pleas'd. The Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came jealous, and tho' the Warr gave him ſtill the more acceſs to the King than he commonly had, he was afraid he might bereave him of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties kind opinion. The King, the longer he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt with the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> the more he reliſhed his Wit, preſs'd him then to accept the Charge of Conſtable, upon the Conditions he had offer'd him; for an Example he cited to him the Duke <hi>de Leſdiguicres,</hi> who had not boggl'd to Change Religion upon the like Account: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſtopp'd his Majeſties Mouth, with telling him, that he thought himſelf in the Right Way; and that if he had another Opinion, he ſhou'd be very unhappy if he did not do what he deſired.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Campagn began, or rather the Diſorder of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking I cannot call War, what was not attended with any Defence. <hi>Charleroy</hi> open'd his Gates as ſoon as we came before the Town. <hi>Douay</hi> made but little more reſiſtance, nor <hi>Tonrnay, Ath, Courtray</hi> and <hi>Oudenarde,</hi> and if <hi>L'Iſle</hi> had not held out a little longer, all this Expedition wou'd rather have had th' Appearance of Intelligence rather than of any thing elſe. All theſe Conqueſts with ſome Others of leſs Importance were owing to the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Prudence and Conduct, while that the Mareſcal <hi>d'Aumont</hi> with a flying Camp took <hi>Bergues, Furnes</hi> and <hi>Dixmuyden,</hi> which we had reſtor'd to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon the General Peace. They ſaw all this without being able to oppoſe it; for they could hardly bring five or ſix thouſand men into the field, with whom <hi>Marſin,</hi> who had been Excluded the Amneſty upon the Concluſion of the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57147:176"/>
Peace, attempted the Relief of <hi>L'Iſle:</hi> but not coming near it 'till the Town was reduc'd to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, it Surrendred before they had news of one another. The King then paſs'd thro' <hi>L'Iſle</hi> to go to <hi>Marſin,</hi> and ſurpriz'd him in ſuch manner as that he thought only of retreating. However as the King had march'd only with one Detachment, he was not only in a Condition to make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but allſo of giving a ſtroak that might have repair'd ſo Diſadvantageous a Campagn: but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhou'd have to do with the Whole Army, he gave ground, by which his Rear ſuffer'd much. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> feebleneſs, was matter of much think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch Potentates as did not love ſuch Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> eſpecially, whom the thing more nearly toucht than Others, were alarm'd, and not having been able to oblige the King upon their Requeſts to leave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Peace, they reſolv'd to Employ Arms to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſince there was no other way to ſecure their Quiet. For this purpoſe they made a Treaty with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> by which theſe three Powers united themſelves together to ſave <hi>Flanders,</hi> which ran a great riſque without their Succours. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as it was none of their Intereſts to proceed to Warr, they only put themſelves into a poſture of making themſelves feared, after having made conſiderable warlike Preparations, they ſignify'd to the King that they wou'd declare againſt whoever wou'd not make Peace. Tho' this Term was a little leſs harſh than another they might have made uſe off, the King had not the leſs reſentment againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to whom he imputed more than to Others the Obſtacles that interven'd to his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes: However as after ſo formall a Declaration it was for him to chooſe his Courſe, he promis'd
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57147:176"/>
to lay down Arms, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for a Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for his Pretentions, wou'd leave to him his Conqueſts. Theſe Offers appear'd harſh to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who gave out that theſe Pretentions were only imaginary; but th' Other Pow'rs having their Reaſons, as I have newly ſaid, to terminate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by mildneſs, theſe propoſals of the King were put into Deliberation, and a Convention was held at <hi>Aix-la-Chappelle,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after their Wonted rate, Spinning out things into a Length, gave the King time to make New Conqueſts; He took the <hi>Franche-Comté</hi> in Eight days ſpace, not in truth by the force of his Arms but by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the Governour, who had ſold it to him, before he left <hi>Paris.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who as I ſaid before, cou'd not Support <hi>Mr. de Turenne</hi>'s favour, Employ'd the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that by ſubſtituting ſo fam'd a Captain in his Room, the King might inſenſibly loſe the Eſteem he had for the Viſcount. The Loſs of the County not only ſtartled the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but allſo th' Aſſembly of <hi>Aix-la Chapelle;</hi> ſo as that to ſtop the Courſe of ſo good a fortune, they all determin'd at length to grant the King what he had demanded; but he wou'd needs have comprehended in his Conqueſt, that which had been newly made, which none agreeing to, the World Expected things were coming to Extremity, ſo much the more as that Preparations for War were made on all ſides. However the King making Reflexion that it was expoſing himſelf to ſtrange Conſequences; He that had not any Ships, to reſiſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were extreme Powerfull at Sea, as to expoſe himſelf to a War, whoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs might have been ſo uncertain. It Is inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable how much Confidence the King put in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> in all thoſe Parleys of Peace
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57147:177"/>
and War; and but that the Intereſt of the State requir'd that the one ſhou'd be preferr'd before the other, I ſhou'd ſay that the Jealouſy the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> conceiv'd on this account, ſmoothen'd many Rubbs that otherwiſe wou'd have been met with. Be it as it will, never Courtier ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo Moderate in his favour as did the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he requir'd not of the King ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the leaſt favour for himſelf or for his Friends, which extremely pleas'd the King, who offer'd him again ſeveral times the Charge of <hi>Conſtable,</hi> on the Conditions he had propos'd to him afore. But it was for the Glory of this Great Captain not to Change his Religion in a time when it might have been thought to have been done out of Intereſt; and tho' that one of his Nephews, who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Cardinals-Cap from <hi>Rome,</hi> had allready begun to ſtagger him very much in his Opinion, he wou'd not make a ſtep in a time when the leaſt Motion might have been ſuſpected; yet he had ſtill a certain Scruple left, which made him dread taking that leap: But the Fathers of the Oratory with whom he had ſecret Conferences at the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtins,</hi> having found the means to perſuade him to all intents, he at length declar'd his Deſign, which as much Rejoyc'd the King as it Afflicted the Proteſtants. But it was impoſſible but that a Prince who knew better how to manage the Sword, than to diſentangle himſelf from ſo many things as lay not within his Sphere, could reſiſt able men as ply'd him on all ſides. However as he ſtill feared it might be ſaid to have been Intereſt that caus'd him to do it, he refus'd all the Favours the King offer'd him, which gave admiration not only to thoſe whoſe Party he had newly embrac'd, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to thoſe he had newly forſaken. The Fathers
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57147:177"/>
of the Oratory, who had contributed moſt to ſo great a Change, had after this the greateſt ſhare in the Affairs of his Conſcience: But tho' that their Party was entirely oppoſite to that of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> he did not forbear following Father <hi>Maſcaron,</hi> whoſe Sermons pleas'd him above all others, on the ſcore of his Eloquence, and of a moſt peculiar Gracefullneſs he had in the Pulpit. Thus he ſpent three or four Years in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Piety, without being troubled by Motions of War, from which the Kingdom was Exempted. But the King who had a Grudging to the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> for what they had done, having found the means to diſunite them from the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> prevail'd with the former to make War upon them by Sea, after having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him to declare againſt them by Land: As among Sovereigns there's never a want of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for a rupture when they pleaſe, the two Kings found quickly matter to pick a Quarrel with the Republique; but withall this, they would, perhaps, have found great Difficulties in the effecting their Deſigns, if it had not been divided in it ſelf by the different Intereſts that Reign'd there. Three Parties were there, of one of which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was the head; <hi>John de With</hi> of the Other; and the Other had none, nor wou'd it have any, as believing it to be derogating to the Dignity of the Republique to have one. The Firſt had for Object the rendring of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> as Potent as his Predeceſſours had been: The Second wou'd exclude him from all ſorts of Employments to Eſtabliſh it ſelf upon his Ruines, and the Third was for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement neither of the one nor of the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that, as I have newly ſaid, the Republique after having render'd it ſelf ſo Flouriſhing of it
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57147:178"/>
ſelf, had no need neither of the Prince of <hi>Orang</hi> nor of <hi>de With,</hi> to maintain it ſelf in the Splendour it was in: However, when the two Kings came to Declare War; this third Party perceiv'd there to be a neceſſity to have a head for the oppoſing ſuch Dangerous Enemies, ſo as that the thing only turning between the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>de With,</hi> all the Provinces found themſelves as it were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between the One or Other: But the moſt part ſtill remembring the great Actions of this Prince's Predeceſſours, to whom, as I think I have allready ſaid, was owing their Liberty, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themſelves inſenſibly to be led into the deſire of ſeeing him at their head, and he was at length, nothwithſtanding all the Obſtacles <hi>de With</hi> us'd to the Contrary, proclaim'd Captain General of the State. This Prince, tho' without Experience, by reaſon of his Green Youth, was not wanting to give all the Orders neceſſary for a ſtout Defence, and, if his Advice had been follow'd, many Places had been abandoned wherein a Number of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons had been maintain'd to no Purpoſe: But not having been Maſter of the Reſolutions, he ſaw himſelf a General without an Army; for the States far from having Troups ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to put an Army into the field, they were far from having enough to line all the Towns they pretended to keep. The King meeting with ſo much eaſe in his Deſigns, enter'd into the heart of the Country by the means of the Electour of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who had alſo declared War againſt the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> attacking them on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the Republique was in great Perplexity. The King who had made extraordinary Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for this War, had giv'n Employment to the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> This Prince march'd away before
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57147:178"/>
with an Army of thirty five thouſand men, and the King follow'd him at five or ſix Leagues Diſtance with as numerous Troups. He wou'd not have the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to leave him, for being to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance very far into the enemies Country, he was very willing to have ſuch a Perſon as him about him to free him out of Danger. And indeed, ſuch things might have happen'd as wou'd have put him in ſome Danger; he was going to engage himſelf amid Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that ought to be extremely ſuſpected to him, joyn'd to this that he left <hi>Maſtricht</hi> behind him, which might give him a furious Diſquiet, for the enemies had put ſo great a Garriſon into that Place, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Armies were not more conſiderable, and things might turn after ſuch a manner as to make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat difficult. To remedy this, it would have been neceſſary to have attacqu'd that Place: But the King fearing it might take him up too much time, or that he might loſe there a part of his Army, he drew near the <hi>Rhin,</hi> where he ſhou'd not meet with ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who watch'd all his Paces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little leſs concern'd in them than the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves, had ſtill reaſon to augment their jealouſy, by the ill Treatments, they ſaw themſelves expos'd to; for the King having not been able to make that ſtep without paſſing o'er their Territories, they were ravag'd whatever Care he had taken to prevent it. However, as he had them re-inburs'd for the forrages his Army took, it wou'd not have been to them a Subject for a Rupture, if his Conqueſts had not augmented their Diſtruſts; they paid him, nevertheleſs, in his Paſſage, all the Honours that are due to a Great King, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Low-Countreys ſent to Compliment his Majeſty, and thoſe that Commanded in the Towns, caus'd their Canon to be Fir'd when he

Thus every One endeavour'd to precaution himſelf by making Leavyes. But the King's firſt Exploits gave quite another Apprehenſion, in four days ſpace he took <hi>Orſoy,</hi> and <hi>Rhinberg,</hi> while the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> reduc'd <hi>Weſel,</hi> and <hi>Burik.</hi> Theſe Conqueſts ſo ſtartled the Enemies, that they animated the King to make new Ones: But not being able, if a man may ſay ſo, to be without the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he caus'd him to repair to him again, and after having paſs'd the <hi>Rhin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> at <hi>Weſel,</hi> he march'd in the Traces of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who had directed his way againſt the Town of <hi>Rhees.</hi> The Garriſon knowing that <hi>Weſel,</hi> a much ſtronger Place, had Surrender'd, forthwith deputed to the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to have ſome favourable Compoſition: But this Prince, who wou'd ſooner have granted it ſome favour, if it had made an anſwerable Reſiſtance, wou'd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it otherwiſe than a Priſoner of War, no more than that of <hi>Emmerick,</hi> which he afterwards attacqu'd, The Garriſon of <hi>Weſel,</hi> of <hi>Orſoy,</hi> and <hi>Burik,</hi> had not a better Treatment, and that only of <hi>Rhinberg</hi> had been diſtinguiſh'd, yet not in conſideration of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57147:179"/>
its Bravery, but becauſe it had not ſtopp'd the King, who had a Deſign to pierce farther into the Countrey. Many other Places Surrender'd ſtill without ſtriking a Blow; Nay, and without waiting for the Perſon of the King, or that of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> for the fright was ſo great, that every Individual thought he gain'd much in currying the Conquerours favour. By this means the King made himſelf Maſter of all that was not ſhelter'd by Rivers: But as the <hi>Rhin,</hi> by the means of two Branches it makes, contains a good Part of the Countrey, he thought himſelf at the end of his Conqueſts, or at leaſt that they wou'd coſt him Dearer than they had hitherto done: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon conſulted the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who was not of Opinion to attempt to force the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> one of thoſe two Branches, on the Banks of which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had intrench'd themſelves. However to make them believe that we march'd directly againſt them, he perſuaded the King to take that way: but at the ſame time he ſent orders to the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to inform himſelf where the <hi>Rhin</hi> might be paſs'd with leſs peril, that he might fall upon the back of the Enemies. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had an eye to all, ſuſpecting this Deſign, ſent <hi>Mombas</hi> to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the <hi>Tholus,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had caus'd the Paſſage to be Sounded: But <hi>Mombas</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abandon'd his Poſt either through Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Cowardice, another was to be ſent in his Room, for they durſt not yet abandon the <hi>Yſſel</hi> by reaſon of the neighbourhood of of the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which ſtill made a ſhew of entering that way into the heart of the Country. And indeed the King Skipt on the Right and Left, as if he had had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſign: But all of a ſuddain he departed with his Horſe to repair to the Prince of <hi>Conde's</hi> Army &amp;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57147:180"/>
having march'd all the night, he arriv'd upon the Bancks of the <hi>Rhine</hi> in the ſame place where the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had caus'd the paſſage to be Sounded. <hi>Wurtz</hi> was there to defend it, and had with him ſome Horſe and foot: but inſtead of going againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, he gaz'd on them while they paſs'd one by one, thinking perhaps they wou'd never have the Boldneſs to paſs before his eyes, or that he ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat them eaſily when they were paſs'd, by reaſon that he ſhou'd attacque them in as ſmall numbers as he pleas'd. But if the Contempt which the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cuirafieers had ſhewn of Death, in paſſing ſo large and ſo rapid a River, and wherein ſeveral of that Body had been Drown'd, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d wherewithall to ſurprize <hi>Wurtz,</hi> he was much more ſo, when that going to oppoſe it, he ſaw it come with Sword in hand, though as yet no more than the Van paſs'd. We cannot ſay that the Bruſh was great or Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſince that <hi>Wurtz</hi> his Troups gave ground as ſoon as they had made the firſt Diſcharge; and this Succeſs having put Courage into thoſe that were ſtill in the Water, they made haſt to joyn their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who after having thus drove away the Enemies, ſtaid for them upon the Shore. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being willing to render himſelf conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the King by the Succeſs of this Action, which particularly regarded him, paſs'd allſo the River with the Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> his Son, and the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> his Nephew; and as this latter had been debauching it in the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Camp, where the King had made ſome ſtay at his Coming, the ſumes of Wine not being yet diſſipated, made him Commit a fault, which Occaſion'd his Death, and that of ſeveral Perſons of Quality: For inſtead of following the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who advanc'd towards ſome Infantry that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57147:180"/>
were intrench'd on this ſide the Caſtle of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and demanded nothing more than to be aſſured that they ſhou'd have good Quarter giv'n them to lay down Arms, he himſelf alone went to inſult them in their very Retrenchments, which caus'd it to make a Diſcharge upon him, and upon the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who doubting of his Imprudence was advanc'd to prevent his Nephew: But not coming ſoon enough, he had the regret to ſee him fall Dead before his face, as well as ſeveral Perſons of Condition, who were rang'd around him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as they did not diſcontinue their firing he was wounded in his hand, which ſo inflam'd him, that inſtead of the Promiſes he had before paſs'd to the Enemies of giving them Quarter, he had them all put to the Sword. In the mean while, the King, who ſtaid on the other ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> preſs'd his Troups to paſs with all imaginable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and this occaſion'd their throwing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Squadrons into the Water; but tho' this ſeem'd to be a much greater Contempt of Death, yet they did not hazard ſo much as the Others had done, becauſe that as the Great Number of Horſes broke the Stream, they withall animated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus a great part of the Army having allready paſs'd, the King caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a Bridge to be laid over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which was however needleſs, for the King was hardly got over the River, when he had an Account of the Enemies having abandoned the <hi>Yſſel</hi> for fear of being taken behind. Upon this Notice he turn'd back and at the ſame time ſent a Relation to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this day, which would have been one of the moſt Glorious of his Life, without the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi>'s Imprudence, who had caus'd a World of brave Men to periſh with him. The Viſcount
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57147:181"/>
               <hi>de Turenne</hi> receiv'd this News with an inconceivable joy, and having divulg'd it among the Troups that ſtaid with him, Every Individual regretted his not having been preſent at an Action that was like to make ſo much Noiſe in the World. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth it was not very uſual to ſee ſuch a River as the <hi>Rhine</hi> paſs'd in the Enemies Preſence; ſo as they may be ſaid to have been very faulty, for if they wou'd but have advanc'd into the Water, when our men ſtill paſs'd but one by one, we ſhou'd without Difficulty have been oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; It is allſo certain, that from hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Diſorder the Republique was in, for the King wou'd have thought twice before he wou'd have attempted to paſs the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> which was thought to be much more Dangerous than indeed it was, for the King had been aſſured that the River was not fordable, that the Entrance, and going out were Difficult, for the Year was ſo dry, that there was hardly any Water in the River, yet when they came to paſs it, they found little more than a foot and a half.</p>
            <p>The Prinee of <hi>Orange</hi> Retreated toward <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> but the Conſternation of this Town was ſo great, that his Preſence cou'd not Encourage it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tho' it was ſtill Cover'd by ſeveral Citys that were not yet attack'd, it ſent its Keys to the King, who was march'd to the Siege of <hi>Doesburg.</hi> In the mean while, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded by his Wound, cou'd not take on him again the Command of his Army, and it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had a long Conference with the King and with the Prince of <hi>Condê,</hi> touching the Preſent State of things. The King askt them their Opinion, and they told him that they were miſtaken if he held the Conduct
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57147:181"/>
he had thitherto held, if he pretended to keep ſo many Places; that he ſaw as well as they that his Army dayly diminiſht by ſo many Garriſons; that he ought to be ſatisfy'd with retaining ſome Paſſes, and that at leaſt without being ever ſtrong in the field, he would quickly ſee <hi>Germany</hi> in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that muſt needs be jealous of his Conqueſts. The King declar'd that he reliſh'd their Reaſons; but having diſcourſt the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy,</hi> who dayly acquired more and more Aſcendant o'er his Mind, he forgot the Conſequences that theſe two Princes had made him obſerve; Inſomuch that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Advice he reſolv'd to follow that of this Miniſter, which was to keep all the Conqueſts he cou'd make. We cannot truly ſpeak the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi>'s Deſign in doing this, unleſs that he thought to reduce the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſo low, that they ſhould be oblig'd to Submit themſelves to all ſorts of Conditions before that they cou'd hope for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. Thus believing that the King wou'd be in a Condition to retain his Conqueſts, he wou'd not abandon them; he might have ſtill another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That as he had Intelligence with the Prince <hi>de Lokowitz,</hi> the Emperours firſt Miniſter, he truſted in the promiſes this Prince made him of Prevailing with his Maſter to keep the Peace. Be it as it will, his Advice having been follow'd preferably to that of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and of the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> the King found himſelf with Six or Seaven Thouſand men in a few Days after, tho' he was entred the field at the head of ſo flouriſhing an Army. That of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was little more Numerous at ſome days End, for after having taken <hi>Arnheim,</hi> he reduc'd Eight or Ten Places more, wherein he was oblig'd to put Garriſons. However tho' that among theſe there were many
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57147:182"/>
ſtrong Ones, not one made any reaſonable oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, unleſs that of <hi>Nimmeghen,</hi> which held him tack Seav'n or Eight days; not but that he might have taken it in leſs time if he had ſo minded, but he wou'd not Squander away his Soldiers as they did in the Kings Army, where they caus'd 'em to carry the Bavins, and mount the Guard in open Day, as if the Life of ſo many brave Men had not been a thing to be carefully preſerved. But the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> ſaid, that more Soldiers periſh'd by fatigues, than in thus Expoſing them ſometimes: that this was neceſſary, particularly, in Sieges, where the leaſt delay was of ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that it was in no wiſe to be remedy'd afterwards; Wherefore to make Diſpatch, they no longer minded to open the Trenches at a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Diſtance, but open'd it ſo near as coſt a great many men. Yet this did not hinder the King from puſhing-on his Conqueſts as far as the Gates of <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> But the Marquis <hi>de Rochefort</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding on that ſide, having miſs'd of <hi>Muideim,</hi> of which he might have made himſelf Maſter, without ſtriking a Blow; the Enemies who had committed ſome faults on their ſide, remedy'd them after they had rid themſelves of <hi>de With,</hi> who was become ſuſpected to ſeveral, and principally to the Populace, by whoſe hands he fell. In the mean while, the King, who had ſtopt at the Gates of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> in hopes that the Peace which the States had caus'd to be propos'd to him, having not been able to obtain what he demanded, plainly perceiv'd the fault he had committed, in not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving believ'd the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> for if he had advanc'd towards <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> at the head of a Potent Army, this Town that was allready wavering, wou'd never have
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57147:182"/>
dared to take Vigorous Reſolutions: But ſeeing him with not above Six or Seaven Thouſand Men, it had breathing time, and he for his part durſt not Engage further with ſo ſmall a Number. But the greateſt misfortune that befell him from this Overſight, was, that the Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> being gain'd by the <hi>Hollander's</hi> mony, took the field at the head of twenty five thouſand Men, which began to ſet all <hi>Germany</hi> in Motion, and the more ſince the Emperour was allſo upon the point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf: But the Prince <hi>de Lokowitz</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deferr'd the Cauſing his Orders to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Campagne paſs'd without any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable being done, which being come to the Emperour's knowledge, he caus'd this Miniſter to be ſecur'd and depriv'd him of his favour. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Brandenbourg's,</hi> March did, nevertheleſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this Effect, that the King return'd home, after having endeavour'd to ſurprize <hi>Bolduc,</hi> where there was only a Simple Garriſon; but it chancing to rain two or three days together, the Town was ſecur'd by it's ſituation, which in ſuch times renders it impregnable: for being Seated in a very low Place, and all ſurrounded with a Marſh, the water quickly Spreads it ſelf around, nay and came as far as to <hi>Boxtel</hi> two Leagues from thence, where the King had fix'd his Quarter. Having thus perceiv'd that there was nothing for him to do on that ſide, he took his journey for <hi>France,</hi> after having giv'n the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> order to re-aſſemble the moſt Troups he could, to march againſt the Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> who advanc'd in long Marches. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> wou'd not mind him, that if he had been ſo pleas'd he might have prevented this Accident; but having ſeen the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> who had caus'd himſelf to be carry'd to <hi>Arnheim,</hi> he
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57147:183"/>
took meaſures with him to divert the King from having ſo much Confidence in his Miniſter, who had not yet Sufficient Experience to regulate all things according to his Phancy. <hi>Monſieur le Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> having got the Wind of this Deſign, and fearing this might ſtop his Sons fortune, found the means to gain the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> by the Promiſes he made him, that the King, thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſhould only employ his Highneſs in the moſt conſiderable Expeditions, and as this Prince had a Secret Jealouſy of the Confidence the King put in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he did not trouble himſelf much about keeping the Promiſe he had giv'n him. In the mean while the King was very uneaſy as to the event of matters beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd with Twelve Thouſand Men, for he had found it more convenient to go meet the Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg,</hi> than to give him time ſtill to Exerciſe his Army; However as ſuch a handfull of Men did not capacitate him to hazzard a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the King ſent him a Reinforcement of Four Thouſand. The Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> had many more, as I have already ſaid; but as the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had only Choice Troups, he drew near him, with a reſolution to deliver him Battle. The Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> fearing that in thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, the <hi>French</hi> Fury, which is extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, might cauſe him to receive ſome Check, thought it convenient to cover himſelf with a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; wherefore he repaſs'd the <hi>Weſer,</hi> and having put ſome Men into <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nna</hi> and other ſmall Cities, that were upon the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> Paſſage, he waited to take other Reſolutions by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies March. Many wou'd there have been who in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> room wou'd have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57147:183"/>
themſelves with having drove the Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> as far as beyond the <hi>Weſer,</hi> but having had notice that divers Motions were made in the Empire in favour of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he thought it became him to prevent their running to a head, which might have pernicious Conſequences if he found not the means to ſtop them: and as this might ſeem to depend on the Succeſs he ſhou'd have againſt the Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg,</hi> he paſs'd the <hi>Weſer,</hi> after having made ſure of the Towns wherein he left Garriſons: They ſuffer'd themſelves to be Batter'd for a day or two, but the Breach being made they open'd their Gates. The Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> had no ſooner notice that he paſs'd the River, than that he found himſelf in a great Perplexity, for on the one ſide it ſeem'd to him to leſſen his Reputation thus to Retreat before an Army weaker than his own, and on th'other he ſaw a Thouſand Inconveniencies, if he chanc'd to loſe the Battle; but Security ſeeming to him preferrable to all things, he took the way again for his own Teritories, hoping the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> wou'd alſo retreat, upon his having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to fear either for himſelf or th' Allys of the Crown. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> who had fatigated his Army by a long March, reſolv'd then to give it ſome repoſe, but hardly did he give it three or four days Reſpite, but that he Purſu'd the Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> who had left ſome Troups upon the Guard of the Paſſages. Theſe Paſſages having been forc'd, he put his Men into Winter-Quarters in the County <hi>de la Mark,</hi> which extremely ſurpriz'd the Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg,</hi> who inſtead of taking his in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Country, as he had expected to have done, ſaw his Teritories deſolated as well by his own
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57147:184"/>
Troups as by thoſe of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> For tho' he poſſeſs'd a Country of an extent ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently large to lodge them, as he had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to put them all together, for fear the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne</hi> might pierce further, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely harraſs'd the places they poſſeſs'd, and thoſe they did not poſſeſs were burden'd with many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies to Supply to the preſent Neceſſities. In the mean while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> Army had all things in Abundance, which made it forget the hardſhips it had ſuffer'd in ſo long and painfull a March. In effect it had been ſometimes oblig'd to go Eight or Nine <hi>German</hi> Leagues, ſo as that both Horſe and Foot found themſelves equally ruin'd: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> applying himſelf wholly to repair both, he employ'd to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not only all he cou'd exact from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Countrey, but alſo all the ready Mony he had, without minding what wou'd become either of himſelf or of his Family. The Officers being little accuſtom'd to ſerve under Generals like him, ſtrangely amaz'd to ſee him ſo dis intereſſed, for he ſometimes gave to a Regiment a Quarters from whence he might have got Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, but this without any Partiality, for Merit alone had the Aſcendant with him: He, however, ſometimes ſaid, that ſome regard ought to be had to thoſe that were not rich, for he was not of the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy's</hi> humour, who imagin'd that when a Man had Wealth he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſpend it in the King's Service. Thus he procur'd them Advantages as well as to Others, when he was in a Capacity to do it, and all the Difference he made, is, that the Poor had ever of them the Preference when there was an Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do Good. What the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:57147:184"/>
had newly perform'd againſt the Marquis <hi>de Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> Equally Surpiz'd both Friends and Enemies. Thoſe who bore us ill will endeavour'd to prevail with that Electour to take Patience; but others remonſtrating to him, that conſidering our height of fortune, he riſqued much by ſiding againſt us, at length they diſpos'd him to lay down Arms. Count <hi>Beauveau De Spence,</hi> having for ſome years paſt found a retreat with his Electoral Highneſs, did wonderfully well ſecond this Deſign, and as this Count was Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s friend, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his Offices for the bringing an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about. The Electour demanded that our Troups ſhould be drawn from off his Territories, that we ſhou'd reſtore him <hi>Weſel</hi> and ſome other Places that were Dependances of the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> that apperrain'd to him, and promis'd in Conſideration of this to abandon the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> But as there was little ſecurity in his Promiſes, and that we were beſides very glad to make him Rue what he had done, things were ſpun out into a Length under Sundry Pretexts, during which we made a ſhift to ruine the County <hi>Vandermark</hi> to all Intents. The Electour complain'd of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure, and ſeem'd to deſire the Peace: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known to Entertain Commerce with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, we requir'd ſuch aſſurances of him, as he could not give, untill at length the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> interpoſing alſo in the Treaty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that he ſhou'd Execute it in good Earneſt. All theſe Delays having thus giv'n time to our Troups to recover themſelves, we agreed to leave his Countrey, and to grant him what he requir'd, on the Conditions, however, that he had the reſerve of taking up Arms again, in caſe it tended to the Weal of the Empire, that had ſerv'd him for a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57147:185"/>
Pretence for what he had done. This Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and their Allyes had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to traverſe as much as lay in their Pow'r, had matter to Surprize 'em All, ſo much the more, as that the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who had been ſeen towards <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> in the Room of the Marquis <hi>de Rochefort,</hi> had Extended our Conqueſts by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Woerden</hi> and of ſome Other Towns of the Province of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Enemies, to preſerve the Reſt, had been oblig'd to open their Sluces, which was a terrible Remedy, and having thereby put themſelves into ſome ſort of Security, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> form'd an Army of fifteen or Sixteen thouſand Men, to which were join'd four thouſand <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent him by the Governour of the Low-Countries; for, in ſhort, tho' they had thitherto been ſo Circumſpect as to declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it was only fear had retain'd them, and not the deſire of keeping the Peace. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> not wanting Courage, and ſeeing himſelf now in a Condition of making ſome Enterprize, which he had not yet been able to do ſince the Beginning of the War, reſolv'd to attreque ſome Place, and having feign'd that he wou'd beſiege <hi>Nareden,</hi> he puzzel'd the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who repair'd forthwith that way-wards: but the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> all of the ſudden turning towards <hi>Nerden,</hi> he laid Siege to that Town; and drew two forts at the head of the Dykes, by which the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> might come to him: he loſt not a moments time to put thoſe Forts into a Poſture, as well as to batter the Town briskly, and taking no Reſt either day or night, his Courage, which ſeem'd Seconded by the Situation of the Places, put him in ſuch a State as was free from Apprehenſions, when he knew that the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg,</hi> notwithſtanding a thouſand Reaſons that
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57147:185"/>
ought to divert him from his Deſign, did, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, march againſt him. In effect, as the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> had dexterouſly conceal'd his Enterprize, the Duke had had time to aſſemble only three thouſand men, which was but a ſmall buſineſs to go attacque a Conſiderable Army, joyn'd to this that he cou'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance only upon the Dikes, at the head of which, as I have newly ſaid, two forts had been erected, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Canon. However as the Duke of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> had ſent the Marquis <hi>de Genlis</hi> Marchal <hi>de Camp</hi> to bring him Succours, he ſtill perſiſted in his Deſign, and march'd directly to <hi>Camprict,</hi> where he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid the Bridge might have been broken: But the enemies having not thought of that, either that they were too buiſy, or that they imagin'd it to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he caus'd his men to paſs over it, and having made a halt to wait for the Marquis <hi>de Genlis,</hi> he was ſtrangely Surpriz'd at his having no Tydings of him. Being afraid of engaging himſelf hand over head, he held a Council of War with the Colonels and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers of his Detachment, and they being for the moſt part young, and having more Courage than Experience, were of Opinion this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to continue their march, ſo as that he jogg'd-on till that being come pretty near the enemies, he caus'd the Inundation to be ſounded that was on the ſide of the Dyke; for to go to the attacque of a Houſe where the enemies had lodg'd ſome Infantry, and from whence they wou'd have fall'n upon the Rear of his men when they ſhou'd have march'd againſt the firſt fort, the Water was of neceſſity to be enter'd, there being no other Paſſage. The Water was found but three foot high or thereabouts. Thus the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> took it firſt, after having order'd a part of his men to advance againſt the Fort. This Duke did wonders of his Perſon, as well as
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57147:186"/>
thoſe that follow'd him, and having taken the Houſe notwithanding a ſtrong Reſiſtance, he facilitated to his Party the attack of the fort which was preceded by a mill, around which ſome Intrenchments had been made. Our Men drawing near them forc'd them with eaſe enough, ſo as that thoſe that were in the Fort allready trembled, as I may ſay, out of fear of the like Succeſs, when the Imprudence of our Men reviv'd their Courage: Inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the Darkneſs which had thitherto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd their Enterprize, they ſet Fire to that Mill, which gave ſuch Aim to the Enemies, that with their Canon which they Charg'd with Cartridges, they kill'd in a trice above two Hundred Men. Then matters began to change their Aſpect, Ours gave back inſtead of advancing, and if the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> had not re-incourag'd them by his Preſence all had been loſt without Difficulty; but as he was very brave he Expos'd himſelf the firſt of All, and our Soldiers who wou'd have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd not to follow their General, behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo well that the Fort was won notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Efforts that <hi>Zuileſteim</hi> cou'd make, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> natural unckle, who was kill'd in defending it. This Action that had, perhaps, more temerity than Conduct, having nevertheleſs ſped ſo well, the Enemies not only abandoned the Other Fort, but alſo rais'd the Siege. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> drew off his Canon and his Infantry, and ſtanding firm with his Horſe, he ſecur'd Both. But the Duke <hi>Luxembourg</hi> aiming only to put Succours into the Town, wherein being come himſelf, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd with the Count <hi>de la Mark,</hi> who was Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of it, and who had made diverſe ſallies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had ſhewn much Courage. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Supported this misfortune with a Conſtancy as Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57147:186"/>
Admiration in all People, and ſeeking leſs to Excuſe himſelf by Words than by Actions, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſurprize the Duke <hi>de Duras,</hi> who was with a flying Camp on the ſide of <hi>Tongres.</hi> For which purpoſe he gave out he had a Deſign upon that Place, and upon <hi>Maſeik,</hi> appertaining to the Electour of <hi>Cologne,</hi> which oblig'd the Duke of <hi>Duras</hi> to ſend to <hi>Montal,</hi> Governour of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> to take Care of <hi>Tongres,</hi> while he wou'd Watch on another ſide. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to render his Deſign the more feaſible, did at <hi>Maſtricht</hi> make great Proviſion of Shovels, and other Inſtruments proper to break Ground, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on their ſide, Acting in Concert with his Highneſs, tho' they had not declared War, did the ſame thing at <hi>Namur,</hi> at <hi>Ruremonde</hi> and <hi>Venlo:</hi> But all of a ſudden Bolting from their Garriſons, they Seiz'd on the Paſſes by which the Duke of <hi>Duras</hi> might retreat to <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy.</hi> While that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> drew near the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to cut him off, it had been eaſy for the Duke of <hi>Duras</hi> to ſhut himſelf up in <hi>Tongres,</hi> or in <hi>Maſeick;</hi> but as he cou'd not do it without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing thoſe Towns, he choſe to retire towards <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> hoping the Priuce of <hi>Orange</hi> wou'd leave him in Quiet, out of the fear he might be under of wanting Victualls by Purſuing him: But this Prince holding his Victory certain, paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe</hi> after having joyn'd the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and purſu'd him ſo briskly that he compell'd him to croſs the <hi>Roer,</hi> upon the Banks of which he would have Defeated him, if the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had the Vanguard, wou'd have march'd after having alſo paſs'd that River; but having been of Opinion to ſtay for the coming up of the Rear, this gave the Duke of <hi>Duras</hi> time to make his Eſcape; and as he ruin'd all in his Paſſage, and that beſides the Enemies began to want Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57147:187"/>
they durſt not Engage farther, and repaſs'd the <hi>Roer.</hi> They directed their way along the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> as if they had been ſtill uncertain where to let fall the Effort of their Arms: But having paſs'd the River, they made a ſhew as if they deſign'd upon <hi>Tongres,</hi> which oblig'd <hi>Montal</hi> to put himſelf into that Place with two or three hundred men. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> knowing him penn'd up there, ſent Seav'n or Eight hundred Horſe around the Town to make him ſtill believe the ſame thing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing in all haſt before <hi>Charleroy,</hi> he ſorely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Montal,</hi> who being Conſummated in Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was diſconſolate that he had been thus tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pann'd by a Young Prince, who as yet perform'd but the Apprenticeſhip of his Trade. The King was no leſs amaz'd than <hi>Montal,</hi> and as the thing was of great Conſequence, he let the Courtiers know, that they wou'd make their Court much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him by reſorting to the Army, than in ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they did, about his Perſon. This was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to put 'em all upon the Spurr; all the Road from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Charleroy</hi> was Cover'd with Perſons of Condition, who to pleaſe the King ſcour'd to the Rendezvouz, without having had the leaſt time to make any Equipage: On another ſide, <hi>Montal</hi> being reſolv'd to periſh or Re-enter his Town, departed <hi>Tongres</hi> at the head of a hundred Choice Cavaliers, and having march'd in the Woods, he mingl'd himſelf among the Enemies as they deſcended the <hi>Bivao;</hi> Inſomuch that they took him to be of their Party. Thus did he continue his way without diſcovery, 'till that being drawn near the Town, an Advanced Guard diſtruſted ſomething, which oblig'd him that Commanded it to call out the <hi>Who goes there:</hi> But having been only follow'd by a part of his Men, the Reſt having not had time to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57147:187"/>
Bridle, <hi>Montal</hi> routed him, and got ſafe into the Town. There without trifling away his time in receiving the Compliments of Every Individual that wou'd have congratulated him upon his Action, he repair'd to the Rampart, where he caus'd furious Diſcharges to be made as well from the Canon as the Infantry; after that he made a Sally, wherein he had ſome Succeſs, ſo as that the Enemies having grounded their hopes, principally, upon his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, reſolv'd to raiſe the Siege, having, beſides, intimation that the Mareſchal <hi>de Humieres</hi> was bringing a great Succours. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> appear'd more ſenſible to this Misfortune than he had done to that which had befall'n him before <hi>Naerden,</hi> he retreated under a great Deſpondency: But this notwithſtanding continuing to aſſiſt the Common-wealth with his Arm and his Head, he attracted more Compaſſion than Contempt, which is, nevertheleſs, allmoſt an inevitable Attendant of Unhappy Events.</p>
            <p>Nothing but the Seaſon hinder'd the <hi>French</hi> from attempting New Conqueſts, or rather the Waters which Cover'd the Surface of the Earth. The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> being ſtill at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> hop'd how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that if it once came to Freeze, he might by means of the Ice ſurprize ſeveral Poſts, that were otherwiſe inacceſſible. As the Enemies were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with his Deſign, they had ever the Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and Pick-Ax in their hand, to precaution them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt this Misfortune, upon the firſt Froſt that ſhould come; they broke the leaſt Ice, hoping by taking ſuch ſtrict Care, they ſhou'd render all his Meaſures Abortive: But it falling a Freezing all on the Suddain, it was impoſſible for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair in ſeveral days, what happen'd in one Night. This caſt ſo great an Alarum into the Places that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57147:188"/>
were the moſt Expos'd, that Peoples Minds were wholly ſet upon removing thence what they had moſt Precious. The Conſternation ſpread it ſelf to the very <hi>Hague,</hi> which being deſtitute of Walls and Defence, cou'd not otherwiſe Expect than a ſtrange Deſolation, if the Poſts that cover'd it came to be forc'd. However, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who laid the Publique Miſeries as much to heart as if they had only regarded him himſelf, had not from all this been under any Apprehenſions, if his Troups by having been ſo often beaten had not utterly loſt their Courage; for tho' the Ice ſeem'd to give a great Advantage to the Enemies, they wou'd however run a great riſque in coming to attack him in Places well Intrench'd, and where his Highneſs might oppoſe againſt them, as many Men as they cou'd have. He was buſy'd Day and Night, either in adding New Fortifications to thoſe that were allready made, or in Encouraging his Captains and his Soldiers: But whatever Care he took, Colonel <hi>Pinvin</hi> Abandon'd his Poſt upon the Requeſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Dergau,</hi> who ſent for him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Walls, The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> truſting rather to their Terrour than his own Forces, Marching in the mean while, towards <hi>Bodegrave,</hi> and <hi>Swammerdam,</hi> Won both at the Point of the Sword; and as if his Action had not been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Glorious, by reaſon of the Little oppoſition he met with, he wou'd render it the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, not only by a Slaughter that was made, not only of thoſe that were found in Arms, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of all ſorts of Perſons, Ev'n of Women and Children. He was often heard amid the pittious Crys that Every one made to move him to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to bid his Soldiers, <hi>No Quarter; Plunder, Kill, and Raviſh.</hi> He himſelf did what he ſaid, and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57147:188"/>
his Men, after his Example, having delug'd the ſtreets with Rivers of Blood, entred the Houſes where they Committed inconceivable Cruelties: Several Women were Violated in their Husbands Arms, ſeveral Maidens in their Fathers, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever went about to oppoſe ſuch Criminal Exceſſes, was pittileſsly Maſſacred by thoſe Furies, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themſelves to be no longer Govern'd but by their Diſorderly Paſſion, and by their Cruelty: They did the ſame thing at the Poſt that was to defend Colonel <hi>Pinvin;</hi> but not being yet content with the Miſchiefs they had done, they ſet fire to thoſe Places, and thus burnt all they could not carry away. Heaven to puniſh an allmoſt unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Barbarouſneſs, even among the moſt Savage Nations, ſent a Thaw at the ſame time, and the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> had much ado to retreat with his Troups, that by reaſon of the bad Weather were forc'd to leave behind a part of their Booty. The Inhabitants of the <hi>Hague,</hi> who could not have avoided the like Misfortune, were thus preſerv'd by a kind of Miracle, as well as that Beautious Place, for I know not whether I onght to term it a City or Village, for if the Beauty of its Houſes, of its Publique Places, of its Walks, may Rank it with the moſt flouriſhing Cities, the want of Walls makes the difference ſo great, that it reſembles neither a City nor a Village. The Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi> being retired to his Quarters, the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Endeavour'd to repair the Miſchief he had done: But for an Example to the Officers, they caus'd Colonel <hi>Pinvin's</hi> Proceſs to be drawn up, who was Sentenc'd to be Beheaded. In the mean while, the <hi>German</hi> Princes ſeeing the Danger this Common-Wealth was in, reſolv'd to give it Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and Allow'd it not only to make Leavyes
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57147:189"/>
in their Dominions, but did the like themſelves for the making ſome Diverſion in its favour. On ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Diet of <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> after having been along while aſſembled at the Emperours Requiſition, who complain'd that <hi>His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> had Committed divers Hoſtilities in the Empire, at length declared the taking up Arms to be neceſſary for the Publique Security, ſo as that the Generality having ſo fair a Pretext to Cover their jealouſy, reſolv'd to declare War againſt us. Thus the <hi>Palz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> prepar'd to turn their Backs upon us; the Electour of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> being threatned with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into the Ban of the Empire, if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in our Allyances, had alſo the ſame Deſign: But as they could not Execute it without hazarding much by reaſon of the Dependancy they were under, they Surceas'd it till a more favourable time ſerv'd. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by reaſon of the bad Succeſs they had had, had rejected all that had hitherto oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd upon the Governour of the Low-Countreys, ſeeing we were going to have a good part of <hi>Europe</hi> upon our hands, no longer feign'd to declare open War againſt us, and after having drawn up a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, they put Troups into <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> with which Place in all likelihood the King wou'd begin his Campagn. The King, ſeeing ſo much Buſineſs on all ſides, endeavour'd to remedy it with his wonted Prudence, he caus'd New Troups forthwith to march, with orders to the Officers to repair with all poſſible haſte to the Rendezvouze: And having held a Council of War with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he made five or ſix Bodys of Armies, which he caus'd to march where there was Occaſion. The Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> thro whoſe fault all this Perplexity happen'd, was oblig'd
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57147:189"/>
to careſs the Principal Officers, in whoſe hands he ſaw his fortune; for he had reaſon to fear that upon the leaſt Reverſe the King wou'd make him Expiate by his Diſgrace ſo many bad Councils he had giv'n his Majeſty: Among thoſe he did not forget the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who was intruſted with the Conduct of the Army that was to march into <hi>Germany.</hi> This Prince receiv'd his Compliments without manifeſting to him either too much Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, or too much Baſeneſs, and having liſten'd to all he was minded to tell him, he made him anſwer, that he knew as well as any Other to acknowledge the Zeal wherewith he ſerv'd the King, but that he ought to be perſuaded that others had no leſs than himſelf; that he told him this to mind him, that he ought not to make his Court ſometimes at the Expence of thoſe that were Abſent, becauſe they had to do with ſo Sagacious a Prince, as not to be eaſily impos'd upon. He made him this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on the ſcore of ſome Diſcourſes he had held to the King, by which he had endeavour'd, to do him a Diſſervice with his Majeſty: But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Louvoy,</hi> having feign'd he did not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with what Deſign he ſpoke in this manner, the Reſt of their Converſation paſs'd in Aſſurances of Service on his Part, and in ſome Civilities from the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeeing the King made Great Preparations for a Siege, and not doubting but that his Aim lay upon <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> they were at a loſs to find out one to put into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Room, who was Dead after a fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> offer'd them <hi>Faria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57147:190"/>
that he was of a Religion conformable to that of moſt of the Inhabitants; they ſent him his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with Orders to the Garriſon to own him. <hi>Faria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> being in the Town found it Convenient to make ſome New Fortifications, but having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to his own Profit part of the Money he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for that purpoſe, the Inhabitants loſt the Eſteem they conceiv'd from his Reputation; Inſomuch that they began to deſire the Kings coming, under whoſe Sway they hop'd to enjoy the free Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Religion, as well as of ſeveral other Advantages: For beſides a thouſand advantageous things they had heard of his Perſon, wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fame was no Liar, they were invited to be under his Obedience by the Luſtre that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in all his Court, when that he came into their Neighbourhood. Thus they hop'd to partake in that Greatneſs, which is, nevertheleſs, but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in the mind of the People, ſince certain it is that this Grandeur being only Atchiev'd at their Coſts, 'tis rather the means to render them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, than to make them find the felicity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſooth this Phancies. Be it as it will, ſuch was the Diſpoſition of the Inhabitants of <hi>Maſtricht</hi> when the King arriv'd before its Walls: For as it was a Siege of Renown, he wou'd perform it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was far from ſuffering ſuch an Occaſion as that to Slip without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſignalize his Bravery and Conduct; but thinking it Expedient to ſuffer the Kings Army to conſume, he preſs'd not much, hoping that the Place would hold out time ſufficient to afford him that of relieving it: The Generality were of the ſame Opinion, which they built on the ſtrength of the Outworks, and the Governours Repute. The King being not Ignorant of his Highneſs's hopes,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57147:190"/>
took in the mean while all his Precautions, and as he was perfectly well ſerv'd, the Lines of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation and Contravallation were not only quickly finiſht, but Batteries were alſo rais'd, of which that of <hi>Montal</hi> having Eighteen pieces of Canon did much incommode the Beſieged; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they made Sallys it batter'd them in the flank, &amp; made ſuch a Diſorder in their Ranks that they knew not where to put themſelves under ſhelter. In the mean while the Trenches were open'd, and the Works having been puſh'd-on with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diligence, the King caus'd the Out-works to be attack'd by his Musketiers, who carry'd a Work with eaſe enough: but theſe Youths being more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to fall-on than Defend, they were in like manner repuls'd. <hi>Artagnan</hi> who Commanded them, was kill'd in this occaſion, whom the King very much lamented; fot beſides, that his Services merited that a great regard ſhou'd be had for his Perſon, he was one of the beſt-bred men living. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> having charg'd himſelf with this Attacque, and in it Conſpicuouſly diſtinguiſht his Gallantry, being reſolv'd to periſh in't or to come off with Honour, demanded new Troups of the King, and his Majeſty having granted his requeſt, the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers repreſented to his Majeſty that it was blaſting their Honour to Command others in their room; that if he wou'd Command them again to the Aſſault, they were abſolutely reſolv'd to take the Work again, or Dye in the Attempt: but the King being minded to preſerve them for a better occaſion, being not to be wrought upon, the Commanded men march'd, and effected their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. This Succeſs was quickly follow'd with the taking of another Work, wherein <hi>Fariau</hi> having thro' overmuch Precipitation, caus'd a Mine to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57147:191"/>
play, his own Men were blown-up inſtead of ours; This leſſen'd his eſteem among his own Party, and particularly among the Inhabitants, who held divers meetings to oblige him to Surrender; All the Prieſts that were in the Town repaired to them with a great Number of Women, and their Deſign being come to <hi>Faria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>'s Knowledge, he was at a great loſs how to remedy it. In the Interim, the Town was thrice ſet on fire, which ſtill aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his Diſtruſt, ſo as that being as much afraid of thoſe within, as thoſe without, he demanded to Capitulate. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> having found more Obſtacles than he Expected in Conducting of the Succours, coming acquainted with this News, was much ſtartled; for as he had been Newly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the Charge of <hi>Stadtholder,</hi> and Lord High-Admiral, and that in a Word he was more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than had been any of his Predeceſſors; He was afraid leſt this Event might loſe him the Affection of the People, by whoſe ſuffrage he had attain'd to this Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>The King, after having repair'd <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> wou'd have carry'd his Arms into the other Places of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Brabant,</hi> if the Enemies had not let looſe their Sluces; but the Water being all around, the King con'd not do otherwiſe than march another way. And as Occurrences in <hi>Germany</hi> made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, he drew near the Frontier, as well to oblige the People of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> not to favour the Arms of his Enemies, as to ſhew himſelf in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> where his Preſence was neceſſary. And indeed Every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual being Excited by the Love he bore his Sovereign, contriv'd to affranchize himſelf from a Sway that was very Different from that he had Experienc'd under his Majeſty; for there was more to do to ſatisfy the Intendants, than there was to
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57147:191"/>
ſatisfy the King, and they moſt commonly made uſe of their Authority to the Ruine of the People. who were in Deſpair to ſee that thoſe who were to uſe all means for their Protection, contributed moſt to render them Miſerable. The King after having given order on that ſide, enter'd <hi>Alſace.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> being Engag'd thro' their own Inclination, and a thouſand Other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to declare themſelves in favour of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, giving his Majeſty only fair words, he caus'd an Arch of their Bridge to be burnt, wherein how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he us'd more Cunning than Strength, for having caus'd ſome Carpenters to be Embark'd at <hi>Briſac</hi> with a ſmall Number of Soldiers, the thing was ſooner known to be done then the Deſign ſuſpected: <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> that was wont to enjoy Peace, finding by this Hoſtility how prejudicial it would be for it to engage in the preſent Motions, the more willingly liſten'd to the Kings Propoſals, and fear bringing them to all manner of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance, the King thought himſelf ſecure ſince that Town did not declare it ſelf againſt his Majeſty. In the mean while he omitted nothing for the putting <hi>Alſace</hi> in a Poſture of Defence, whither he did not doubt but that the Emperour wou'd endeavour to carry his Arms. On another ſide to wreek his Revenge on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he backt the Revolt of the Marquis <hi>de Meximieux,</hi> one of the Principal Lords of the <hi>Franche Comté,</hi> who hop'd that all the Nobleſs wou'd take his Part: but his Pretenſions not prevailing, he was oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>France,</hi> he and his Family. The King gave a Regiment of Dragoons to the Marquis <hi>de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenay,</hi> one of his Sons, and this Young Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf extremely well in all the occaſions he was preſent at, inſomuch that he wou'd have
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57147:192"/>
made his Fortune, if he had not been Kill'd in a Conflict two or three Years after. In the mean while the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> after having provided for <hi>Philipsbourg</hi> which ſeem'd the moſt in Danger, paſs'd the <hi>Rhin,</hi> and having retain'd by his Preſence a number of Princes that were upon the point of Declaring themſelves, he ſpread ſuch a Conſternation where-ever he bent his March, that thoſe that had already taken Arms durſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance very far. They ſent Deputies to him from all ſides to demand ſafeguards of him, and it was a wonder to ſee that thoſe who had threatned ſo loud ſome few days before, were oblig'd by the Neighbourhood of this Great Man to have recourſe to Entreaties and Submiſſions. Thus the Electour Palatin, tho' he had already made his Treaty with the Enemies, durſt not divulge it, nor durſt the Biſhop of <hi>Wirbourg</hi> and ſome others. However as the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was too illuminated to miſs of prying into their Deſigns, he preſs'd the Court to allow him to reduce them by Arms, which the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> oppos'd, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that he cou'd draw 'em o'er to the Kings Party by the means of Negotiations and Treaties. However to make them ſenſible of the Kings Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, the Viſcount de <hi>Turenne</hi> had leave to enter their Territories; but being forbidden Sieges, this only ferv'd to provoke thoſe Princes, whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoov'd more or leſs to manage. The Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> ſeeking only a Pretence to take the Field again, complain'd of theſe Hoſtilities which diſturb'd the repoſe of the Empire, and as his Troups were a Burden to his Electoral Highneſs, in time of Peace, he was very glad we afforded him this means to break the Treaty above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. The Emperour on his ſide caus'd his Army
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57147:192"/>
to March, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> not being able to oppoſe ſuch an Inundation as that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew towards the <hi>Rhin,</hi> where he to no purpoſe waited for Succours: For tho' this Storm had been long afore in ken, the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> could never reſolve upon abandoning an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Places, wherein were above Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men in Garriſon; ſo as that without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that this was it that had ruin'd the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> he perſiſted in the Deſign of keeping them. The Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> ſeeing Peace was no longer to be expected, caus'd <hi>Trier</hi> to be artacqu'd, which held out three Weeks, by reaſon of the Incapacity of thoſe he ſent before it. In the mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to draw-off the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who was about <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> might execute an Enterprize he had upon <hi>Naerden,</hi> made a ſhew as if they wou'd oppoſe the Paſſage of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces that Landed in one of our Ports; and, having ſped in their Deſign, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Beſieg'd <hi>Naerden,</hi> which he preſs'd ſo briskly, that he made himſelf Maſter of it, before the Town cou'd receive Relief. As we were not wont to ſuffer Loſſes, we were willing to reject this bad event upon the Governour, who was clapt into Priſon, and his Proceſs made. In the mean while there was no talk yet of abandoning the Places, ſo great was the obſtinacy; which gave the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> means to March againſt the City of <hi>Bon,</hi> which the Electour of <hi>Cologne</hi> had remitted into our hands. This Prince having there Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd with <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who Commanded the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Troups, this later made head againſt the Succours that might offer it ſelf, while the former beſieg'd the Town, where the Count <hi>de Koningſmark,</hi> Lieutenant General of his Army was Kill'd: But
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57147:193"/>
whatever Vigorous Defence was made by the Beſieged, this having not hindred the Beſiegers from becoming Maſters of the Town; then was it that the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> perceiv'd, but a little too late, the neceſſity there was of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning ſo many needleſs places. The thing at length having been reſolv'd on, the Court ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd it's Reſolutions to the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> that he might draw-off his Troups: But as Parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Griping had the Aſcendant at Court as well as o'er that Dukes temper, who had in all things ever manifeſted much ſelf-Intereſt, he oblig'd the Towns to give him Money, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in all this, loſt much time, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had Ieiſure to intercept his way, ſo that if we had not come-in to his Succours, either he wou'd have been oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of ſo many places we only retain'd the City of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and that of <hi>Graves,</hi> both upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and of an extreme importance, by reaſon of their ſcituation, and of the Contributions that might be exacted by their means. However the Generality murmur'd that this had been ſo long deferr'd, and the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> more than others, who had by this means been oblig'd to retreat. The Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe him, promis'd that he ſhould be thenceforward diſtinguiſh'd from all others, which he had often the hopes given him of without effect; for tho' that the King had Created on purpoſe in his favour the Charge of Mareſchal General of his Camps and Armies, this was a Dignity which ſubſiſted rather in th' Imagination than in Reality: For the Miniſters that they might not give any body Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, had never ſent a Mareſchal of <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:57147:193"/>
with him: Thus he had never ſeen himſelf in a condition to enjoy the advantages of that Charge. Nevertheleſs the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy</hi> kept his word with him this time, and the Mareſchals <hi>de Crequi</hi> and <hi>Humieres,</hi> having been Commanded to Serve in his Army, they repair'd thither, but refus'd to obey him, which occaſion'd their being Exil'd. Tho' the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had reaſon to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of them, and particularly of the Mareſchal <hi>de Humieres,</hi> to whoſe Fortune he had no been ill friend, as I have already ſaid, he would not however be the Cauſe of their Diſgrace. Thus having himſelf deſir'd the King to recall them, he ſhew'd that the goodneſs of his temper did not allow him to do any body harm. The King anſwer'd him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, that it was not his buſineſs but his own, for he did not willingly Pardon Diſobedience: But this not making the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> deſiſt, he perſecuted him in ſuch manner, that he could not at length refuſe him what he demanded of his Majeſty. In the mean while ſome hopes there were of Peace, by the divers Glimmerings that had appear'd of it. The Marquis <hi>de Grana</hi> being at <hi>Cologne</hi> the better to Cut-off all hopes of the Peace then there in agitation, ſeiz'd on ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the King had there, and caus'd Prince <hi>William of Furſtemberg</hi> to be kidnapt, being a <hi>German</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but who had abandon'd the Intereſts of his own Country to eſpouſe the Adverſe Party: By this means and by that of the Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> his Brother, had the King attracted the Electour of <hi>Cologne</hi> to his ſide; and to render the Marquis <hi>de Grana's</hi> Action odious to all Good People, <hi>France</hi> proclaim'd it, as it was true, to be contrary to the Right of <hi>Nations;</hi> for Prince <hi>William</hi> wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57147:194"/>
to be conſider'd as a Publique Perſon. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs whatever noiſe the King made, he was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vey'd to <hi>Neuſtald</hi> where they talk'd ev'n of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Proceſs, as a man that had betray'd his Countrey. But the King taking this Affair to Heart Proteſted that if any Perſon of Conſideration fell into his hands, he ſhould be treated in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Emperour ſhou'd uſe that Prince: Thus for fear of Repriſals all his Puniſhment lay in a harſh Captivity. The King did what he cou'd to have him releas'd; but the Emperour ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inexorable, the Aſſembly of <hi>Cologne</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, inſomuch that His Moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty preſs'd the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> to lay aſide the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mediator, to take up another, from whence he might derive more Advantage. And indeed his Majeſty needed Succours in the Preſent State of things; for <hi>England</hi> having granted a Peace to <hi>Holland;</hi> the Moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King was then in great Perplexity; For the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were much more Potent than he at Sea, prepar'd to enter <hi>France</hi> by the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy</hi> aad <hi>Brittany,</hi> ſo as that the King was conſtrain'd to cauſe the Ban and Arriere-ban to advance. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to derive great Advantages if this Proſper'd, treated with the Chevalier <hi>de Rohan,</hi> who promis'd them to deliver them <hi>Quilleboeuf</hi> by the means of the Intelligences he had in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and they, ſuffering themſelves to be amuſed by his Promiſes, gave him a great deal of Money, as well as to <hi>La Treaumont,</hi> whom he had intruſted with his Secret. The Chevalier <hi>de Rohan</hi> was a Man of Great Quality, but of a very mean Credit; He had never had any conſiderable Martial Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not that he wanted Courage, but becauſe his Intellectuals were not over-ſound; he had
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57147:194"/>
ſpent the better part of his fortune, ſo that not knowing where to put his head, no more than <hi>La Treaumont</hi> who had in like manner Squander'd away all he had, they both ſought the means of Supplying to their Debaucheries, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having been ſo Credulous as to put Credence in their Promiſes, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to whom they had imparted this Intrigue, put to Sea, to ſee what might be hop'd for from it: But the <hi>Chevalier de Rohan</hi> having not ſufficient Credit to procure ſo much as one Village to riſe, they quitted the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy</hi> to try if they could ſpeed better in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> where however they had not any Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence. Being near the Iſle of <hi>Rhé,</hi> a Ship Arriv'd from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and was ſo fortunate to ſcape them, the Enemies being on one ſide, while on the Other it put into the Port of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> In the mean while the King having got the Wind of the Chevalier <hi>de Rohan's</hi> Treaſon, his Majeſty ſent <hi>Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac,</hi> Major of the <hi>Gardes du Corps,</hi> to <hi>Rouen</hi> to ſecure <hi>La-Treaumont,</hi> and had the Chevalier <hi>de Rohan</hi> taken up at <hi>Saint-Germain. Briſſac</hi> being come into the Town, went to <hi>La Treaumont</hi>'s Lodging whom he found in Bed, and having ſhewn him his Commiſſion, he ſuffer'd him as he was his friend, to go into his Cloſet, where <hi>La-Treaumont</hi> ſaid he went to fetch ſomething: But having ſeiz'd a Piſtol, he Clapt it to <hi>Briſſac</hi>'s Cheek, who having bid him fire, two <hi>Gardes du Corps</hi> that were with him thinking that he ſpoke to them, Diſcharg'd their Pieces, and wounded <hi>la-Treaumont,</hi> of which he dy'd on the Morrow-Morning. As he had been the Perſon that had Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd all this Intrigue, the King was much vex'd at the fault <hi>Briſſac</hi> had Committed, in ſuffering him to go into his Cloſet, and it was believ'd this wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Commiſſioners were forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Tryal, who were much to ſeek, for there was not any Proof againſt any of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for which reaſon the Chevalier <hi>de Rohan</hi>'s friends, went Every Night around the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> crying out aloud, <hi>La Treaumont</hi> is Dead, that ſo as he only cou'd Charge him, he might thereby apprehend that he ſhou'd retrench himſelf to, and ſtand upon the Negative; but being too far off to hear any thing, he cou'd not make uſe of this Advertiſement as might have been wiſhed for his Good. In the mean while, the Commiſſioners, who were Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of State, having repreſented to him at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, that the only means to ſoften and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the King, was to have recourſe to his Mercy, that they brought him inſenſibly to fall into the Snare, under the Aſſurances, nevertheleſs, which one of thoſe Commiſſioners gave him of his Pardon; but he had no ſooner got his Secret, than that he went to tell it to the King, who commanded the Proceeding on to the Judgment of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; He was Condemn'd to loſe his Head as well as his Accomplices, bating however the School-Maſter, who was Hang'd. As ſoon as the Sentence was paſs'd, he had a Glaſs taken from him, wherein he drunk, as alſo a Knife he made uſe of at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and asking the Reaſon of it, perceiving that inſtead of giving him an anſwer, his Guards caſt down their heads, he ſuſpected his Misfortune, and inquir'd into the matter.

Tho' his Relations were of the firſt Perſons about the Court, not one durſt ask his Pardon of the King, ſo true it is that real friends are only to be known at a pinch, and in Neceſſity.

In the Interim the Enemies, who upon the Account of this Intrigue had ſooth'd themſelves with ſome happy Events, having found how far they were from this hopes, turn'd their Arms, as I have ſaid before, againſt <hi>Brittany,</hi> where after having made a Deſcent, they were forc'd to retire.

The King, thro' the fear he was under this Advice wou'd be follow'd, had propos'd, by the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> Interceſſion, the Neutrality for that Province; but the Enemies by no means agreeing to it, the King improv'd this Refuſal to the gaining o're the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> among whom he Inſinuated, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities would ſpread themſelves to their very Doors, if the War once drew near <hi>la Comté.</hi> Having thus prepoſſeſs'd their minds, he gain'd o're their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Men by the means of his Money, and theſe having brought the Others to a Complyance to bar the Enemies the Paſſages, the King repair'd into the <hi>Comté,</hi> where he laid Siege to the Principal Places. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had taken upon himſelf to have an Eye to the Conſervation of

Thus the King having not found any Difficulty in his Enterprize, finiſht it in a ſhort time, and without undergoing any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>la Comté</hi> had wherewithall to ſtartle the Enemies; however as they built great hopes on their Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> which was to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſs'd of the Emperours forces, of thoſe of the Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> of thoſe of the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and of ſundry Others, they were not the more inclin'd to make Peace. The King to oppoſe ſo formidable an Army, ſent ſome Succours to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne;</hi> but as he had not Troups ſufficient to reſiſt on all ſides, the King Summon'd the Bar &amp; Arrier-bar of his Realm, which quite ruin'd the nobles, that were already much diſtreſs'd; the ſervice he deriv'd from them was ſo inconſiderable, that the year following he choſe rather they ſhou'd give mony than ſerve themſelves; for which reaſon the fiefs were tax'd in proportion to the Revenue, which made many Gentlemen Clamour; but they were all ſo Low, that whatever Diſpoſition they had to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, Indigency was the Cauſe that not one durſt give any tokens of his ill-will. In the mean while all the World was amaz'd at the taking of <hi>La Comté,</hi> at a time when the King ſeem'd to have ſo much buſineſs upon his hands: but his Conduct being Seconded with his good fortune free'd him from all things with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: In effect about that time was it that the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57147:198"/>
               <hi>Meſſinezes</hi> revolted, which hinder'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from availing themſelves of a victory they gain'd in <hi>Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon.</hi> As they had ſent Troups thither, the King had caus'd the Count <hi>de Schomberg</hi> to march that way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, a Captain that had acquir'd great fame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had ſerv'd, and principally in <hi>Portugal:</hi> but his preſence having not hinder'd the enemies from Seizing on the Caſtle of <hi>Bellegrede,</hi> they were maſters of the paſſage of <hi>Rouſſillon.</hi> After this from <hi>Catalonia</hi> they receiv'd as much victuals as they deſir'd, which made them reſolve to encamp on this ſide the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> They plac'd the Head-Quarters at <hi>Morillas,</hi> and the Marſchal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> being poſted at <hi>San Juan de Pages,</hi> nothing now but the River of <hi>Boullon</hi> ſeparated the two Armies. This River was fordable in ſeveral places, ſo as that we dayly expected the Enemies to paſs it to march againſt <hi>Perpignan,</hi> where we had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Winter afore that they kept ſome Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies. But as there was no coming to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without Engaging themſelves in Great Defile's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> each ſide remain'd above three weeks in it's Camp, without ſtirring, and though ſo very near, all ended in ſome Musket-ſhots, which the Outgards fir'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, the River being between Both. The Count <hi>de Schomberg</hi> caus'd his Camp to be fortify'd, as alſo the enemies did theirs, which dayly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd new Difficulties in the Deſign each Party foſter'd. <hi>Mr de Schomberg</hi> was much ſtronger in men then the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but the latter had much more experience; for properly ſpeaking <hi>Mr. de Schomberg</hi> had only with him the Militia, ſaving two or three Regiments, for as to the Others, they were new Leavies, joyn'd to this, that his principal forces conſiſted in the Militia of <hi>Lanquedoc,</hi> amounting at leaſt to eight thouſand men. This render'd him reſerv'd and wary in his undertakings, beſides he had no great Confidence in
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57147:198"/>
               <hi>Mr. le Bret,</hi> who commanded the Army under him; for this latter being jealous that he was not entruſted with the Command of the Troups in Chief, which he had before the Arrival of <hi>Mr. de Schomberg,</hi> wou'd willingly have ſuffer'd himſelf to have been beaten, meerly to ſpite the Marſchal, which <hi>Mr. de Schomberg</hi> had perceiv'd in two or three Occaſions.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtood matters when the Duke <hi>de St. Germain,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made uſe of a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to engage <hi>Mr. de Schomberg</hi> in ſome falſe ſtep; he ſent to tell him, but without declaring that this came from him, that he was retreating into <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The <hi>Baillif</hi> of <hi>Ceret,</hi> a ſmall Town at the foot of the <hi>Pire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees</hi> was the Perſon he made uſe of in this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and this later being come to tell this news to <hi>Mr. de Schomberg,</hi> colour'd it with ſeveral things which render'd it the more probable; Inſomuch that he gave the Army order to ſtand to their Arms at break of Day: But he not having been able to riſe ſo early by reaſon of ſome indiſpoſition, <hi>Mr. le Bret</hi> thinking to have all the honour of that Day, caus'd the Horſe to paſs the River without ſtaying for his Orders, and the enemies Guard having notice to give way, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently engag'd in floods, on whoſe banks he found Infantry that gave him the entertainment of their Muskets. As that was not a place for his Horſe to fight in, he was at a great plunge how to make his Retreat, and loſt a great many men: But <hi>Mr de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> being come up with the foot, the Diſorder was not altogether ſo great, though ſtill many fled away as far as <hi>Perpignan.</hi> The Militia of <hi>Lanquedoc</hi> was of this number, as well as ſundry new Regiments, which made <hi>Monſieur de Schomberg</hi> fear he might receive ſome greater Rout; But the enemies reſting ſatisfy'd with having diſpers'd his Army, repaſs'd the River after having kill'd twelve or fifteen hundred men, and taken
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57147:199"/>
many Priſoners; <hi>Monſieur de Schomberg</hi>'s Son was of this Number, and he was carried to <hi>Barcelona</hi> with <hi>Monſieur de la Rabbiere,</hi> who commanded our Horſe. The Enemies Deſign was after this to go beſiege <hi>Couilloure,</hi> which they had infallibly taken-in thro' the Diſorder we were in, if the Revolt of <hi>Meſſina</hi> had not oblig'd them to repaſs the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> and go Embark in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the ſame Ships which they had deſign'd for the Siege of <hi>Couillours</hi> ſerv'd them for this Enterprize, which was of an Extreme Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to them, for the Other Towns of <hi>Sicily</hi> were already Wavering, beſides that the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> ſeem'd more enclin'd to revolt, than to contain its ſelf in its Duty.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Meſſinezes</hi> having perceiv'd but too late, how difficult a thing it is to caſt off the Yoke of one's Sovereign, were oblig'd to ſend to the King to beſeech him that he wou'd be pleas'd to ſend them Succours. The King was far from denying them; and as he was in hopes of great Advantages from this Revolt, their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were promis'd they ſhould have Men and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions forthwith ſent them, having equally need of Both. At that time, did the King ſtand poſſeſs'd of a Marvelous Reputation: For beſides, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts he had newly made, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had found means not only to ſtop the <hi>Germans,</hi> but alſo to make them repaſs the <hi>Rhin,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing upon that River without any Difficulty. All the Princes that had embrac'd Our Party, had abandon'd us, as has been ſaid afore, and what is Extraordinary, we had not any more Cruel Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies than thoſe very People that Excited us to the War. But among all Others the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> made himſelf remarkable thro' the hatred he bore us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he thought he had reaſon for ſo doing,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57147:199"/>
on the account of the little Conſideration, he ſaid, we had had for his Electoral Highneſs in divers Rencounters, or that being more expos'd to our Arms, the Miſchief we did him render'd his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents the more Violent. Be it as it will, as he had a Vaſt Wit, he ſo well gained all the Princes, that the moſt part of 'em Acted only by his Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. However tho' the Main Cauſe of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing our Party was the hopes he had given him of Beſieging <hi>Philip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57147:200"/>
giv'n up; and that, on the Contrary, if thing ſped ill, he wou'd be tax'd, as a Perſon that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more Experience ought to regulate all by his Councels. Beſides theſe two Armies that were Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, the Enemies made ſtill flying Camps on Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſides, One of which <hi>Rabenhaut</hi> Commanding at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd <hi>Graves,</hi> a Place whence we too much gall'd the Enemies for them to forbear endeavouring to take it from us. As it was the moſt Expos'd, we had not fail'd to provide it in due manner; thus <hi>Rabenhaut</hi> not meeting there the facilities he had Expected, Chang'd, as I may ſay, his Siege into a Bloccade, that is, he thought much more of ſaving his Men than of Expoſing them; for he hop'd that having two Armies of his Party upon their Wings as ſtrong as were thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Bournon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> they wou'd quickly have ſo favourable a Succeſs, that they wou'd be in a Condition to relieve him As the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> plainly foreſaw all this, he wou'd not give the Enemies time ſtill to encreaſe, and as they every Moment expected the Duke of <hi>Bournoville</hi> without reckoning the Troups of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg,</hi> he reſolv'd to give them Battle before all theſe Succours were arrriv'd. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Caprara,</hi> were Men of too much ability to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr to his Deſign; wherefore they no ſooner ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it but that they contriv'd to elude it by a ſpeedy Retreat. And this was indeed the only means to prevent the Purpoſe. But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having made as much way in Six days ſpace as they had done in Twelve, oblig'd them to face about at <hi>Seintzeim,</hi> from whence they pretended to reach <hi>Wimphem</hi> or <hi>Hailbron</hi> to paſs the <hi>Nekre.</hi> They were Surpriz'd at this Diligence, ſo much the more as that they had left ſome Garriſons on his Paſſage,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57147:200"/>
which they thought muſt have ſtop'd him. But the Viſcount having foreſeen that this might make him miſs of his Enterprize, did not ſpend his time on them, well knowing that they wou'd quickly be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſurrender if he cou'd but gain the Victory. However tho' that <hi>Seintzeim,</hi> where the Enemies Infantry was intrench'd, was no more than a Village, that is to ſay, tho' it had not any fortifications, yet did it, nevertheleſs, give them a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; it ſhelter'd their Horſe, poſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it upon a Mountain, of ſo Difficult Acceſs, that there was no coming at it but by <hi>Defiles,</hi> and theſe too in a very ſmall Number, for the way was fac'd with hedges and Vineyards, and broaden'd gradually as you grew near, ſo as that when we ſhould have taken the Town, they had ſtill the Advantage of a large Front, which is conſiderable for the winning of a Battle. The Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> having been long acquainted with the ground, was not daunted by theſe Difficulties, but caus'd his Army to file off along the way of <hi>Wiſloc,</hi> and not doubting but that the Enemies had lin'd the hedges near the Town with Infantry, he ſent Dragoons thither, that diſlodg'd them thence; they forthwith retreated with the Reſt of the Garriſon, and with it making fire, they for ſome time kept our Dragoons in Awe: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caus'd them to be ſuſtain'd by the Infantry, the Enemies durſt no longer ſhew their heads, and firing thence forward only at Rovers, and much higher than was requiſite, our Men advanc'd to the very foot of the Walls, and ſought to force ſome Gate or Other. The Cavalier <hi>d'Hocquincourt,</hi> a ſon of the late Mareſchal of that Name, whom we have heretofore mention'd, that was a Colonel of the Queen's Dragoons, having found one where they
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57147:201"/>
had not had time to lay Dung, as they had done to the Reſt, had it Cutt and Burſt open, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Enemies throng'd from all ſides to drive him back, he was afraid of being overwhelm'd with the Multitude, and Caus'd his Men to enter the Houſes on the Right and Left, which he caus'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be boar'd: He from thence not only ſtopp'd them, but gave alſo time to thoſe that follow'd him to enter the Town, ſo as that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſeeing they cou'd reſiſt no longer, retired to their Cavalry. The Town being taken in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> caus'd on his ſide ſome Bridges to be laid over a River; which render'd the way impracticable for the Horſe, nay, and for the very foot; for it reaches round a kind of Mocraſs, which even in the greateſt heats of Summer, renders the ground ſo ſoft, that thoſe of the Place are oblig'd to ſeek Paths: He caus'd his foot to paſs o're theſe Bridges, for he was afraid leſt they ſhou'd break under the Cavalry, for which reaſon it fil'd thro' the Town. The Enemies prepar'd to receive us, and had put Foot and Dragoons into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and Places that were moſt favourable to them, which oblig'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> to Poſt Infantry upon a Hill, that ſtood a little beyond <hi>Seintzeim,</hi> from whence it fir'd upon that of the Enemies: But it ſuffer'd much from their Canon, that was plac'd to advantage, and hardly made one uſeleſs ſhot. As there was no Advancing the Cavalry without its Succours, there was a Neceſſity of leaving it there, and according as our Squadrons drew near, the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had them follow'd with Balls, which ſerv'd them extremely. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Horſe had 'till then contented themſelves with beholding all that was done; yet by their Countenance manifeſted they only waited Orders

to March: In effect being not willing to give ours time to form a larger Front, it Charg'd us Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and put us in Diſorder. <hi>Saint Abre,</hi> a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General that was at our Head, was Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Wounded in this Occaſion, which ſtill aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented our Diſorder, ſo as that without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, which had drove away that of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies out of the Vineyards, and fir'd continually, it had been impoſſible for us to rally. The Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who after ſuch fair beginnings was in Deſpair to ſee his Cavalry ſo hardly us'd, went nevertheleſs from rank to rank, to exhort them to do better in a Second Charge that was preparing: But the Enemies being Arm'd, Breaſt and Back, and having beſides each a Creſcent in his Hat, having to do with People that were ſtark naked, put us into ſo ill a condition, that they thought we ſhould never have rally'd: And, indeed, our Diſorder was extraordinary, and if the Infantry had not ſtopp'd the Enemies Cavalry by an almoſt unexampled Bravery, ours were not only ready to betake themſelves to flight, but we ſhou'd alſo have quickly abandon'd <hi>Seintzeim.</hi> Thus the Enemies having not been able to improve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they might in all likelyhood have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from thoſe two Charges, retreated ſlowly, thinking that ours wou'd venture to follow them without the help of the Infantry: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had found to his great Regret the Difference there was between his Cavalry and theirs, wou'd not ſuffer it to budge a ſtep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: Inſomuch that tho' they ſtill ſir'd b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had try'd their Bravery, thought it not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſtay the coming up of this Reinforcement beyond the <hi>Rhin,</hi> and as he hop'd the King on his ſide wou'd ſend him ſome Succours, he repaſs'd on this ſide till ſuch time as this <hi>Reervill</hi> ſhould be arriv'd. The Prince Palatine, lying at watch to ſee what wou'd be the Iſſue of this Conflict, was very much troubled it had paſs'd in this manner; and as for his Misfortune, his Countrey was upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of both Parties; it was he alſo that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to lay the Cloth, and defray the two Armies. For from the Moment that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Caprara</hi> had joyn'd the Duke of <hi>Bournonville,</hi> they directed their March on this ſide the <hi>Nekre,</hi> and while they waſted the Country that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that River and the <hi>Rhin,</hi> the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was on this ſide that River, where his Army ſubſiſted at the coſt of the Lands apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to his Electoral Highneſs.

only held good among <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times us'd among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> 'twas in ſuch Caſes as cou'd not be attributed to him; that he had not refus'd paying the Contributions, nor done any Act ſo Barbarous as to merit this Repriſal; that if he had had ſome Souldiers Maſſacred, his Subjects were Innocent of the matter, and that this had been done by thoſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Spire;</hi> that therefore this was a willfull Cruelty againſt him, for which he ſhou'd be overjoy'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd, if he wou'd diſtance himſelf from the head of his Army; that he needed only to Choſe the field of Battle, and the Arms he was minded to make uſe of; that he was ready not only to grant him both the one and the Other, but alſo to give him all the Sureties he ſhou'd require.</p>
            <p>The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was amaz'd at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of this Prince, accounted ſo Wiſe, and who nevertheleſs had ſuffer'd himſelf to be ſo hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd away with the Deſire of Revenge, that he had preſum'd he might fight with him. Not to leave him any longer in this Errour, he ſignify'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to his Electoral Highneſs that he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Affliction for what had happen'd; that far from going about to Excuſe his Soldiers, not one of All thoſe that Occaſion'd that Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had Eſcap'd puniſhment: But that if he durſt ſpeak ſomething in their Excuſe, the Cruelty that had been Exercis'd upon their Companions, was ſo ſtrange, that it was not to be wonder'd if they had Avenged 'em upon inanimate things; that in their firſt Motions they had not taken the pains to Examine who had been the Authors of ſo Cruel a Uſage; that having ſeen their Comrades Hang'd upon Trees, ſome having their Hearts torn out of their Bellies; Others their Privy Members cut-off;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57147:203"/>
Others their feet burnt, and in ſhort all ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely us'd, as gave Occaſion to believe they had paſs'd thro' the hands of Executioners, he left his Electoral Highneſs to think with himſelf whether they were come to conſult him about taking their Revenge; that if it were ſo he had reaſon to blame him; but that if it were not ſo, &amp; that on the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he had caus'd Juſtice to be done by Examplary Puniſhment, he did not think it reaſonable to be tax'd in ſuch a manner by his Electorel Highneſs; that as for the Combat mention'd in his Letter, he ſhou'd take it for a very great Honour, if the Poſt he was in would allow him to Embrace it: but that his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Highneſs knew better than any man, under what obligations he lay through his Employ; that he could not flatter himſelf that the King would give him the Permiſſion; that it wou'd be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> too pernitious a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and that for his part he would not expoſe himſelf to his Denial. Theſe reaſons, though very pertinent, were not capable of eaſing that Princes Reſentment, he being dayly more and more Exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the ruine of his Country: But what over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd him with Greif was to ſee the ſlowneſs of his Allies, who with ſuch numerous Troups durſt not venture upon any enterprize. <hi>Rabenhaut</hi> was juſt as much advanc'd as at the firſt day before <hi>Grave,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> though he had not yet been joyn'd by the Count <hi>de Montorey,</hi> did nothing but eat up <hi>Flanders</hi> out of Houſe and Home, though his Army was above fifty thouſand men. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was ever at the ſide of him, and they had often been within a League of one another without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable matter occuring. This the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> found fault with as well as the Prince Palatine: and though fortune had left ſome difference between them, ſince the one ſtill enjoy'd his Dominions, and that the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57147:204"/>
other was deſpoyl'd of his, yet as they were Both in tribulation, they jump'd allmoſt altogether in their ſentiments; However when they mutter'd moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe Tranſactions, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd an Occaſion, wherein he might have acquir'd much Glory, if he wou'd have contented himſelf with the Advantages fortune at the firſt offer'd his Highneſs. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> march'd towards <hi>Le fay,</hi> a woody Country, as is moſt part of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Ground obliging his Highneſs to leave ſome Interval between the Van and the Reer, or rather the Van being not able to joyn the Rear, but by paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Defiles, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was prompt to Conceive, reſolv'd to cut it off. For this purpoſe he caus'd the King's Houſhold to march, of which the right wing of his Army was compos'd, which having totally defeated ſome Troups neareſt at hand, ſo ſtartled thoſe that were moſt advanc'd, that without thinking any longer of joyning the Van, they put themſelves into the Church of <hi>Senef,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other places where they expected moſt reſiſtance to be made; thus they abandoned ſome Carriages, that were forthwith plunder'd: but this having not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd our Troups from doing their Duty, All thoſe Places were forc'd, and a number of Priſoners were taken and many men kill'd. This Good Succeſs had not coſt us a hundred men, whereas the Enemies had loſt full three thouſand in the Action, beſides the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipages I have mention'd. This was Sufficient to content another General than the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> but his Highneſs thinking his Victory Imperfect if he did not render it greater, caus'd the enemies to be purſu'd, who had drawn themſelves up in Batalia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>le Fay,</hi> after having garniſh'd all the Avenues with Infantry and Dragoons. He puſht there after a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing manner to drive away thoſe Dragoons and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57147:204"/>
that Infantry: but the Enemies having the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the hedges over us, they kill'd us ſo great a number of men, that in leſs than a moment all the field of Battle was Cover'd with the Dead. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> began to be in Deſpair that he had ſo lightly engag'd in ſo great a Peril: But the Affair being embark'd, he wou'd needs ſee if there was no means to come Happily off. He caus'd freſh Troups to Advance, but the Enemies having done the ſame, his New Efforts only ſerv'd to make him try New Diſaſters; he loſt an infinite Number of Officers, and the end of the Battle was ſo diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dvantageous to his Highneſs, that it defac'd the Honour he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in the Beginning. In ſhort, the two Parties being Paul'd with ſo many Charges ceas'd firing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another; and tho' the Night that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them had not been capable of Separating them, Labour and Wearineſs did what Night had not been able to Effect. However the two Armies remain'd in One Anothers view till Eleven a Clock at Night, which made it preſum'd that at break of Day they wou'd re-ingage. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> being quite ſpent as well as the reſt, had laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down upon a Cloak at the corner of a Hedge, where his mind being full of Care and Diſquiet, he knew not how to repair the loſs he had undergone, and ſtill leſs how to reincourage his men who ſeem'd quite dejected; in effect, the enemies meaning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, ſpread a Univerſal fear and terrour among our men, by a diſcharge they made to hinder us from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating their Deſign: Inſomuch that had they charg'd at the ſame time inſtead of be taking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Retreat, all our Army had undoubtedly been put to flight. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was overjoy'd at the Courſe they had taken, and his Troups ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had time to recover Courage, he obſerv'd the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57147:205"/>
enemies, who had a Deſign to beſeige ſome Place; not one was there but what was afraid, &amp; ſome Governours manifeſted ſo much weakneſs, as prov'd ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them. In fine after having made all <hi>Flanders</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they fell upon <hi>Oudenarde,</hi> wherein the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had newly put the Marquis <hi>de Rann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ons. This Prince knowing ſome Diſcourſes were held to his Prejudice ſince the Affair of <hi>Senef,</hi> hardly allow'd himſelf time, to ſtay for ſome Succours that the Mareſchal <hi>de Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres</hi> was to bring him, to March againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and breaking up as ſoon as Ever it was come, not a man but imagin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, that as his Highneſs was full of Reſentment, a great Slaughter was impending. The Diligence he us'd did not permit the Enemies to take the Place before his Arrival; and the Counts <hi>de Souches,</hi> and <hi>Monterey,</hi> having been of Opinion not to hazard their Troups, which the Circumval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation held Sever'd from one Another, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was forc'd to Conform himſelf thereunto, tho' his Opinion lay rather to leave ſomething to Chance than receive this Affront. The Siege of <hi>Oudenard</hi> having been rais'd in this manner, the Enemies Troups reſolv'd to Separate, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Rabenhaut,</hi> who was ſtill before the <hi>Grave,</hi> wou'd remain there a long while, unleſs he was Succour'd, went thither himſelf with his Forces. The other Enemies made alſo a great Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which they directed their way towards the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> where they took the City of <hi>Dinan,</hi> and that of <hi>Huy,</hi> both ſcituated upon that River. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible was it for the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to oppoſe theſe Enterpriſes, for as much as that a part of his Troups had been drawn out to be ſent to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who every Moment ſaw thoſe Encreas'd that made head againſt him.

               </gap>reſolutions they ſeem'd to have a deſire to faſten. That way-wards had they directed their March, and were in a poſture for any ſort of Enterprize; for in ſhort, their Army was now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd not only of the Troups of the Emperour, and of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> but alſo thoſe of the Princes of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> and of the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> without reckoning thoſe of the Circles under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonville.</hi> They made up at leaſt fifty thouſand men, &amp; only waited for thoſe of the Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg:</hi> But as it had been a ſhame for 'em to hide themſelves being already ſo very numerous, they appear'd in the Field, and ſcattered different rumours as concerning their Deſigns. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was none of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe that dwelt upon theſe ſort of things; thus minding their Paces more then all the reſt, he quickly perceiv'd their Aims were not levell'd upon <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and that their whole ſcope was to paſs the <hi>Rhin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This he oppos'd for ſome time with all the Succeſs he could deſire. But the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies drawing near <hi>Mentz,</hi> they engag'd the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectour, notwithſtanding his having paſs'd his Word to the King to remain Neuter, to ſuffer them to paſs t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To Cover his Infidelity, he ſignify'd to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> that they had trepann'd him, and that having promis'd them paſſage only for the Sick, and for the Equipage, they had made uſe of his eaſyneſs to mingle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the greateſt part of their Cavalry. Eaſy is it to judge how little ſatisfactory thoſe Reaſons
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:57147:206"/>
were to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> But not being in a Condition to exert his Reſentment. he was oblig'd to diſſemble, and to run to what was moſt urging. For the Enemies, after having thus caus'd their Horſe to paſs, had built a Bridge near the Town, which ſerv'd for their Infantry, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready began to appear in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> where they had ev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>n ſeiz'd on ſundry Poſts. The Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> having judg'd by all theſe movements that their Deſign was to enter into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> intrench'd himſelf in their Paſſage; and tho' he had but Twenty Thouſand Men, he ſo hamper'd them that they durſt not venture to give him Battle. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who had Correſpondencies in his own Country, receiv'd every moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> News from thence, by which he had ſignify'd to him that his Highneſs wou'd no ſooner appear but that he wou'd find People in a readyneſs to follow his Fortune; for which reaſon he propos'd to his Allies that if they wou'd grant him ſome Horſe, he wou'd ſo order Matters as to break through into his own Territories: But as they were afraid that the deſire of returning thither, wou'd make him attempt things beyond his Forces, they refus'd him this Succours. This ſo exaſperated him againſt them, that he openly ſhew'd his Vexation, nay and Writ concerning it to the Emperour: But as he had liv'd in ſo ſtrange a manner that he was ſuſpected upon the leaſt thing, the others eaſily waſh'd their hands of his Accuſation; and on the contrary made the Emperour believe, that he minded much more his own particular Intereſt than the Common Concern. In the Interim ſo Vaſt an Army having much ado to ſubſiſt in ſuch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Quarters, the Enemies reſolv'd to repaſs the <hi>Rhin,</hi> to which they, moreover, ſaw themſelves
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57147:206"/>
excited by ſeveral Caballs they had in <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> that endeavour'd to engage the Magiſtrates to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in favour of them. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being ignorant of theſe Practices, was afraid leſt they ſhou'd return on the other ſide that River to Beſiege <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and being willing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, he ſet his Men to work upon a Bridge about half a League from that Town. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being overjoy'd he had thus follow'd the lure, endeavour'd to augment his ſuſpicions to make him paſs the <hi>Rhin:</hi> But as he was not a man to lye long under a miſtake, he quickly diſcover'd what paſs'd, and endeavour'd to apply Remedies accordingly. For this purpoſe he ſent <hi>Machaut,</hi> the Intendant of the Army, into <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> with order to remonſtrate to the Magiſtrates what they expos'd themſelves to, if they were wanting in their Word. That after the Intelligence he had giv'n him, as he had reaſon to harbour ſome Umbrage, he wiſht that either they wou'd remit to him the Guarding of their Bridge, or wou'd give him other Sureties; that it was for them to conſider whether they wou'd rather chuſe to give Hoſtages, but that he was not reſolv'd to truſt to their bare Promiſes. This Complement ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd thoſe Magiſtrates, and being ſpread among the Common People that were gain'd by the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,</hi> there happen'd a Sedition; So as that they were for falling upon the <hi>French.</hi> This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ſtill augmented very much at the approach of ſome Troups, which the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had Detach'd to ſeize on the Bridge; for he had been inform'd that thoſe of the Town were under an engagement to deliver it to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and he meant to endeavour to prevent them: But the Marquis <hi>de Vaubrun,</hi> who led them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:57147:207"/>
not been able to win the Redoubt they had made to ſhelter it from Inſult, he found himſelf ſo engag'd, that had not the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> come up, he and his Men were in great Peril. In the mean while <hi>Caprara<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

There being then no more obſtacles to hinder the Enemies from entring <hi>Alſace,</hi> they had nothing more to mind than to provide for their ſubſiſtance in that Province, for the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> caus'd all that cou'd be of uſe to them, to be remov'd into <hi>Savern</hi> and <hi>Haguenaw.</hi> The King being inform'd of the People of <hi>Strasbourg's</hi> Infidelity, ſent ſpeedy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne;</hi> but this Viſcount Countermanded a great part of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſtartled many People, being generally thought in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

They made a great Trophy of this Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, which had ſped them happyly, &amp; this piquing the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> he wou'd needs let them ſee, that notwithſtanding the inequality of the forces, he was ſtill in a Condition to ply 'em with work Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. In effect, knowing that they kept themſelves in their Leaguer as if they had nothing to fear, and that they ſlept out the whole morning in a great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their forces, he left his Camp at two a clock
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57147:207"/>
after midnight, and endeavour'd to get to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had notice of his march. Without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Rain, which laſted all the night and all the day following, he had effected his Deſign: but his Army not coming till five a Clock in the evening upon the Hills of <hi>Moltzheim,</hi> the Enemies had time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution themſelves, and to prepare for Battle. Tho' his Men were very much fatigated, he made them poſſeſs themſelves of the out-Poſts without ſuffering them to breath, and having ſtood to their Arms all the Night, he led them to the Battle at Break of Day. It was more obſtinate on Both ſides, than any that had been yet fought, and as it was the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Opinion, that when a General had five and twenty thouſand Men, he had nothing to fear, he did not mind, as I ſaid before, that the Enemies had twice as many. However, tho' that the two Armies were drawn-up in Battalia, they fought only by Detachment, and what was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſs'd in a Wood, that was between Both, and where the Enemies had intrench'd themſelves, that they might be able to take us in the flank. They did Wonders to Defend it; but our Infantry and our Dragoons render'd themſelves Maſters of it, after a long Conflict; Nay, and kept it tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Enter'd it with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry fthe Left Wing. The Horſe of the Right Wing ſeeing that all but they were engag'd, fell upon our Left, which it overturn'd upon the Body of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; Inſomuch that with one ſingle Charge it broke us entirely: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having an eye to all, caus'd the Infantry to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and it again ſav'd the Cavalry as it had done at the Battle of <hi>Seintzeim.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had a Horſe Wounded under him, as he paſs'd from one Battallion to another to give his

They made a ſhew of Aiming to Beſiege thoſe two Places, to oblige him to quit his Poſts; but he looking upon all their Motions, as ſo many Snares which they laid for him, he ſo tyr'd them out by his Patience, that they fell to contriving how to enlarge themſelves into upper <hi>Alſace,</hi> where they had not met with any Fortify'd Place; they were oblig'd to take this Courſe, becauſe that ſo great an Army could not Subſiſt alltogether.

The Alarum was great among them, and they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to defend the Paſſage of the River <hi>d'Ill.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> did ſuſpect that wou'd be the Courſe they would take; for which reaſon quitting the Main Body of the Army, with all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition did he advance with three thouſand Horſe, he beat ſome Squadrons, that were poſted upon the Bank of the River, and they were ſo Surpriz'd, that they never thought of giving Notice to ſome of their Garriſons that were Scatter'd up and down in Caſtles. The Army being come beyond the River, he detach'd Great Parties to cut off thoſe that were abroad, and we took a great Number of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. However, tho' we paſs'd in fight of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places wherein ſtill Troups were, yet would not we attack them for fear of loſing too much time. By this means was the Marquis of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> Surpriz'd as well as the Reſt, which was perceiv'd by the fault he committed in abandoning <hi>Turquem,</hi> which is upon the Canal of <hi>Colmart.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being come thither, ſeiz'd on't, and his Troups were no ſooner in the Place, but that the Enemies return'd to drive them thence; this Occaſion'd a Sharp diſpute, wherein many
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57147:209"/>
Men were loſt on both ſides: But the Night co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on without the Enemies having been able to drive us thence, they took that time to make their Retreat, and repaſs'd the <hi>Rhin</hi> at <hi>Strasbourg.</hi> In the mean while, they were not twenty thouſand ſtrong on the Other ſide, and all the reſt periſh'd either in the foregoing Engagements, or in this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Succeſs the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had had againſt ſo numerous an Army, had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd, as I may ſay, the hopes of the Court, yet was it not without apprehenſions, thro' the fear of the like danger; For we were from all parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that the <hi>Germans</hi> made Extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to return more powerfull then Ever. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> being repair'd to Court, the King made him ſo favourable a Reception, as cou'd have no Addition, and having ſhut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up with him in his Cloſet, he wou'd needs know all that had Occur'd during the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn, and cou'd not ſufficiently admire a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that had Screen'd the Kingdom from many Calamities. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> would have laid hold of that Occaſion to have made his Complaints of the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy,</hi> who had often ſent him Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he had reaſon to Complain of, &amp; pretended that all the Generals ſhould obey him, as if he had had more Skill in Martial Affairs than they; but knowing that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had no leſs reſentment than he himſelf had againſt this Miniſter, by reaſon of certain Diſcourſes he had held after the Battle of <hi>Senef,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſee him firſt, and, if poſſible, to act in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with his Highneſs, to diſabuſe the King of the Great Confidence he had in him. The Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> being provok'd againſt the Marquis <hi>de Louvoy,</hi> with joy receiv'd the Propoſal made him by the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and they agree'd together, that the Prince
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57147:209"/>
of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhould ſpeak of it to the King firſt, and that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſhou'd back what he ſhou'd ſay. But <hi>Mr. Le Tellier</hi> having known, by I know not what means what had been reſolv'd of between theſe two Generals, he employ'd the Biſhop of <hi>Authun</hi> much in favour with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſo as that this Prince, no longer remembring what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> let ſeveral days ſlip without ſpeaking to the King. The Viſcount Suſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Occaſion of it, wou'd not ſuffer this to make him be wanting to what he ow'd to himſelf, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out complaining to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> for his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forgot his word, he repair'd to the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching his Majeſty to give him a private Audience. The King having granted it him, he told his Majeſty that as perhaps, he was not inform'd of what paſs'd, he was very glad to acquaint him with it; that he knew not whether it was by his Order that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Louvois</hi> had Written to him ſeveral times touching what he had to do during the Campagne, but as the Directions he had receiv'd were ſufficiently ill digeſted, he attributed them rather to his Miniſter than to his Majeſty, who was too Illuminated to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of faults; that he who was upon the place was more capable to decide what there was to to be done, than the other, that was at a Diſtance; that beſides he left him to judge which was the man of the two that had the moſt Experience; that he did not tell him this, to gainſay what was neceſſary, but to let him know that the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with doing his own Office, wou'd needs alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that of Others; that if he had reſolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on him again the command of his Army, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought his Majeſty that he wou'd vouchſafe to ſend him his Orders himſelf, and receive his Letters; that the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> his Nephew would encharge
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57147:210"/>
himſelf with Both, if not, his Majeſty would Extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige him by diſpenſing him from ſerving any longer, becauſe that as it too much leſſen'd his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to Commit the faults he was caus'd to make, he was very willing to husband his Reputation. The King receiv'd this advertiſement as a Wiſe Prince, and who was not ſo blinded with his Miniſter as to refuſe to do juſtiee to others, he permitted him to write to him directly by the means of the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> adding alſo that he wou'd have him to be the Perſon to convey him his Orders. However as the King knew that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> cou'd not forbear ſpeaking a little bitterly to the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> of what had happen'd, he wou'd needs, for the keeping of Peace between Perſons ſo neceſſary to his Service, have this Miniſter go to the Viſcounts Houſe, and deſire his Amity. Many Others in the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Room would have thought themſelves very much honour'd in the Viſit of a Man poſſeſs'd of the Kings favour, and wou'd, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably, have made uſe of that Occaſion to the Advancement of their fortune: But this Prince acting only thro' a Motive of Glory, receiv'd the Compliment of this Miniſter with ſuch great Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, that the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> remain'd alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Surpriz'd; However, as he had order from the King, as I newly hinted, to require of him his friendſhip, he made all imaginable Advances to obtain it: But the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> anſwer'd him with his wonted flegme, that as he knew very well that theſe Words proceeded only from the Kings Command, he wou'd thenceforward Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Conduct, and when he ſhou'd have done as many things to be of the Number of his friends, as he had done to be of his, he wou'd ſee what it became him to do. This Anſwer was admired by the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57147:210"/>
Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who cou'd not forbear ſaying, That the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had in this perform'd a finer Action, then in Winning ſo many Towns and Battles: And indeed, we meet with more Captains capable of thoſe great Succeſſes, than ſuch as ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle thus againſt favour: And of this the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> himſelf gave teſtimony in that Occaſion, ſince he had, as was ſaid, ſo ſoon forgot what he had promis'd the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> In the Interim, this Affair that had made ſo much noiſe among the Courtiers, far from puffing up the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> ſeem'd to render him ſtill more affable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards All People. All thoſe that had admir'd what he had done in the foregoing Campagn, no leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired his Modeſty, for he generally went all alone in his Coach, and without the Attendance of more than two or three footmen; Every one ſtopp'd to ſee him paſs, and he return'd to Every Individual the Salute with ſo much Goodneſs, that the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> that are eaſily Won upon by Civility, wou'd as I may ſay, have Sacrific'd themſelves for him, and this pleas'd 'em ſo much the more, as that other Perſons of Condition did not do the like, Eſpecially the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who Affected minding no Body in his paſſage.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the King did not ſuffer the Winter to while out, without endeavouring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſeveral Forreign Princes to his Party, by the means of his Money, and among others the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> who had till then deferr'd proceeding to a Declaration; but at length, reſolving upon it at the ſuſcitation of ſeveral of his Council, that were Penſioners of <hi>France,</hi> he took the field, and oblig'd the Electour of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Brunſwic</hi> to draw back the greateſt part of the Troups they had upon the <hi>Rhin.</hi> As it was a long
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57147:211"/>
way to return into their own Territories, Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg,</hi> His Subjects were very much alarum'd at the Approch of the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Army, which muſt needs, if it had been well manag'd, have made advantage of this Sovereigns Abſence: But ſtopping, without any Neceſſity, at ſome Sorry Burroughs, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had time to draw near as well as the Troups of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and thoſe of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that joyn'd all together againſt this Common Enemy: However as there needed not ſo many to bring him to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they quickly ſeparated to act in different places. The Marquis <hi>de Brandenbourg</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured his Dominions by his Preſence, purſued the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who had giv'n ground upon the Notice they had of his being near at hand, and having over-taken them at <hi>Ferb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> was very much at a plunge how to releive the place, not that he wanted Courage to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, but becauſe he had newly giv'n a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Army to go into <hi>Brittany,</hi> where the People were Revolted: The Inhabitants of <hi>Guyenne</hi> had done the like, and both were brought to this extremity by the number of the Subſidies the King had laid upon them, by reaſon of the preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he was in to raiſe Money.

Nevertheleſs he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd his Motions to the Governour, whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to a Vigorous Defence by the Promiſes he made him of Relief, for he hop'd to receive ſome Troups from the Biſhopricks to ſupply the room of thoſe that were gone into <hi>Brittany.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being an Old Captain, fill'd with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and unwilling to give him time to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Forces, ſent to ſcann the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> which was found to be fordable in ſeveral Places, ſo as that having left before <hi>Treves,</hi> only what was Neceſſary for the Guarding the Lines, he march'd directly to the River, with all his forces; he croſs'd it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, yet not without the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi>'s being inform'd of his ſo doing, which oblig'd him to draw-up his Army in Battalia: but his Horſe chanc'd to be gone to Forrage, which allmoſt made him mad, for out of fear of what might happen, three whole days had he forbidden any to ſtir out of the Camp; but under the Pretext that he had giv'n two hundred Horſe leave to go Forrage, the Reſt went along, contrary to his Orders. He fell into an Extravagant Paſſion againſt the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal of the Cavalry's Lodgments, of whom he demanded the Reaſon of their being gone, and this latter having no other anſwer to make, but that he had deliver'd his Orders Exactly as he gave them, His Head turn'd in ſuch manner as that he was paſt knowing what he did: Inſtead of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing two Hills that were upon his Right, tho' he had been minded that it was abſolutely neceſſary ſo to do, he trifled away his time in many things that were of leſs importance, and when he wou'd have done that, it was too late. The Count <hi>de la Mark,</hi>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:57147:212"/>
whom he had Commanded out for that purpoſe, was kill'd in endeavouring to repair this fault, as well as ſeveral Officers that back'd him. This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter was follow'd with the like Succeſs in all the Poſts the <hi>French</hi> endeavour'd to defend, becauſe that our Infantry having not Horſe to make head againſt that of the Enemies, it was ſurrounded beyond the Poſſibility of Prevention. The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Guards eſcap'd into a Marſh, the others betook themſelves into the Woods, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order was ſo great, that the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> fled himſelf at laſt. He knew not at firſt whither to Retreat; but his Deſpair inſpiring him to go to <hi>Trier,</hi> he fancy'd he ſhou'd do well in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's Dictates, foraſmuch as that he had had tydings the Night before, that the Governour was fall'n from off the top of a Baſtion, whither he wou'd needs go on Horſeback, by which fall he was Kill'd Stone-dead. We know not to what to attribute the faults which the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> Committed in this Occaſion, unleſs to the loſs he had ſuffer'd the evening before of his Equipage, which had been burnt, which had put him into ſo bad a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that he was hardly to be known again. The Abſence of his Cavalry did alſo thereto much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, but more than all this the Will of God; who wou'd needs that ſuch Diſaſters ſhou'd follow that we had newly undergone; and which was much greater, for we had newly loſt the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> Be it as it will, the Marſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> being enter'd <hi>Trier</hi> without any other accident befalling him, he comforted the Garriſon for the loſs it had ſuffer'd of the Governour, and tho' the Place was not much worth of it ſelf, he wou'd have ſhewn that Courage is capable of ſupplying great Defects, if one call'd <hi>Boisjourdan,</hi> a Captain of the Garriſon,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57147:213"/>
had not Debauch'd his Companions. This Captain, either being afraid to fall in the Attacques, or being excited by ſome other movement which it is difficult to apprehend, inſinuated into the other Captains, that the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> being become a Bankrupt of his Reputation after what had newly befall'n him, was very willing to get to be Kill'd on the Breach, or to render himſelf conſiderable by ſome deſperate Exploit; that it was for them to ſee if they wou'd imitate him, they who had no ſhare in his fault; that he had ever us'd the Officers, as Servants, and that it was time for them to ſhew their Reſentment on that ſcore; that this was all they cou'd have done for a <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne;</hi> but that a <hi>Turenne</hi> had been too wiſe to ſuffer himſelf to be beaten as this Mareſchal had done, or to demand of them that they ſhould Court being Kill'd to repair his Honour; that for his part, he was reſolv'd to expoſe himſelf rather to all ſorts of Perils, than thus to be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to his Intentions; that if they believ'd him, they wou'd treat with the Enemies about the Surrender of the Place; that the King cou'd not take it ill of them, ſince this was not done, 'till after having defended the Walls in all Points as far as their Honour and the Duty of their Commands could require; that on the contrary he would have reaſon to complain of them, if to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy a Deſperate Perſon, they expos'd their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers beyond what Reaſon and the Laws of War preſcrib'd them. <hi>Bois jourdan's</hi> Diſcourſe was liſten'd to with the more Delight, out of the hatred that each one bore the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who, as he had very well urg'd, had ever been very Courſe in his Behaviour to his Officers. Thus All having approv'd what he had ſaid, he was authoriz'd
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57147:213"/>
to treat with the Enemies. The Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> having had the Wind of ſo extraordinary a Tranſaction, could not believe it, if <hi>Boisjourdan</hi> did not aſſure him of it himſelf, and knowing him to be upon the Rempart, he repair'd thither with Motions of Anger, which, nevertheleſs, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to diſſemble. But <hi>Boisjourdan,</hi> joyning Impudence to Treaſon, made him quickly burſt out from the Conſtraint he was under by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent diſcourſe to him. Then the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> being no longer able to curb himſelf, laid his hand to his Sword, and oblig'd him to leap into the Ditch. <hi>Boisjourdan</hi> went to inform the Enemies that it was time to render themſelves Maſters of the Town; but tho' they made uſe of his Advertiſement, they let him ſee the Eſteem People have for Traytors, for they would not give him a Retreat: This oblig'd him to endeavour to make his Eſcape; but being known at <hi>Metz,</hi> he was ſecur'd, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Beheaded, too mild a Puniſhment for ſuch a piece of Treaſon as his. In the Interim <hi>Trier</hi> was taken, half willingly, half by force, and the Marſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> having refus'd to ſign the Capitulation that had been agreed on by <hi>Boisjourdan,</hi> was made Priſoner of War. The Enemies kept but ill the Conditions they had granted, for as there had been thoſe that had turn'd their Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, at their Entrance into the Town, they made uſe of that Pretext to content their Avarice and their Cruelty; Several Soldiers were Stript, ſeverall Houſes Plunder'd, and ſeverall Women raviſh'd: which made the <hi>French,</hi> for reprizals, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely treat ſome Towns they took. But all this was not capable of Comforting them for the loſſes they had newly made, and which wou'd have had great Conſequences, if the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57147:214"/>
known how to improve the victory: But having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd himſelf with the heads of the Troups that had help'd him to win it, he could not enter <hi>France,</hi> as otherwiſe wou'd have been eaſy for him to have done, for there was no longer any Army to defend the Frontier; and the heart being inclin'd, as it was, to revolt, he had put the State into a ſtrange Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion. On the ſide of <hi>Catalonia</hi> matters went a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more happily, the Count <hi>de Schomberg</hi> recover'd the Caſtle of <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and having thereby affran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiz'd <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> from the Servitude it was under, he carry'd his Arms into <hi>La Cerdaigne,</hi> a Province of ſmall extent, but ſufficiently fertile. We alſo gain'd ſome petty Advantages in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where we took the City of <hi>Auguſta.</hi> However the King having had the Complaiſance to ſend thither the Duke of <hi>Vivonne</hi> in the room of <hi>de Vallavoir,</hi> who minded more his own Concerns than thoſe of his Party, he atchiev'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſiderable though he had forces ſent him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of putting Affairs into a better Condition. The King, after having Committed this fault, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Second in not recalling him, for he knew very well, that he had not ſufficient Experience for an Enterprize of that Moment; add to this, that though he had had ſufficient, he lov'd his Pleaſures too much to apply himſelf in due manner to Affairs; but he was link'd to his Majeſty by too Charming Conſiderations for him to inſpect matters ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was <hi>Madame de Montespan's</hi> Brother, who had taken <hi>Madame de la Valliere's</hi> place, which this latter had laid ſo to heart that ſhe had thrown her ſelf into a Convent. Nevertheleſs all theſe things wou'd not have much troubled the King, but for the loſs of the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who on the twenty ſeventh of <hi>July</hi> had been kill'd by a Canon ſhot. This Prince was advanc'd at the head of his Victorious Troups
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57147:214"/>
againſt <hi>Montecuculi;</hi> an old Captain, that had made War for above theſe fifty years, and who on the Account of his Age was Excus'd from ſerving the year afore. Theſe two Generals poſſeſſing almoſt an Equal Experience, having put in practice all that War had moſt refin'd and crafty, made appear in five or ſix weeks time, that a Good General is not forc'd to fight but when he pleaſes; for though they were ſtill near one another, not one of the two found the Occaſion to attacque. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Difficulties, was contriving to take <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi> thereby to Cut off the Enemies Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Strasburg,</hi> that in appearance remain'd in Neutrality, but would have been very willing to break it in their favour. <hi>Montecuculi</hi> having Suſpected his Deſign, caus'd Troups to file off thither; but the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having taken his meaſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, they got thither firſt. All theſe Paces did not pleaſe the People of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> whoſe Territory was equally a Prey to both Parties; for which reaſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wou'd have had them declare themſelves Speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But the wiſeſt being of a Contrary Opinion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that though they ſuffer'd every year by the Neighbourbood of the two Armies, it was notwithſtanding more advantageous to them, than to be Expos'd to thoſe Inconveniences, as to Eſpouſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Party; that Both were Equally dangerous, becauſe that in endeavouring to ſhew themſelves Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they wou'd perhaps ſuddainly fall into ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; that after this, they could not refuſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of their Town to thoſe on Whoſe ſide they ſhould have declar'd themſelves; and who ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them that either the One or Other would not Seize on it, ſeeing themſelves there the maſters; that good ſenſe requir'd the never receiving into ones Walls any Body that cou'd be ſuſpected; that the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:57147:215"/>
Efforts Both ſides made to Engage them on their Reſpective ſides, ſhould ſufficiently acquaint them what Importance their Town was of. The Emperour and the King made them a thouſand fair Promiſes to bring that about; but the former, nothwithſtanding the advice of the Wiſeſt, advanc'd his Affairs much more then the latter, all whoſe offers were Equally Suſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> knowing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition People were in at <hi>Strasbourgh,</hi> ſent thither to Threaten them, which a little Curb'd their Spirits; for they All making Reflexion that this great Man might ſtill this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn have again the ſame Succeſs he had had in the former dreaded leaſt he might turn his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt their Town. In brief, his Reputation alone retain'd them rather than his Forces; and indeed there was little likelyhood that a Town having Eight or Nine Thouſand men in Garriſon ſhould quake before an Army, that often was hardly more numerous. It was not <hi>Straſb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In ſhort he ſaw himſelf reduc'd to fight or dye of Hunger, when a Fatal day happen'd for us: I mean that Unhappy day wherein we loſt the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne.</hi> He had never been ſeen more gay and joyfull, nor more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he fancy'd that the Enemies cou'd no longer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Eſcape him, and tho' it was not his Cuſtom to ſay any thing to his own Advantage, he cou'd not forbear blazing the then preſent State of things; nay he Signify'd it to the King; But during theſe Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences meaning to go view a Hill, on which he might erect a Battery, he receiv'd a Canon-ſhot, which hit him in the Breaſt, and made him fall Dead upon the Spot. <hi>St Hillaire,</hi> the Lieutenant of the Artillery, whom he had brought with him, having been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time, his ſon began to make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints conformable to the misfortune that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him: But <hi>St Hillaire,</hi> melting all into tears, ſhew'd him the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne's</hi> Body, adding that if any thing ought to grieve him, it ought to be the loſs they had newly ſuffer'd of ſo great a man; this news was forthwith divulg'd throughout our Army, and occaſion'd ſo great a Conſternation, that one wou'd have ſaid that every man had been Condemn'd to Death: After Silence for a while, they fell a Sobbing nor more nor leſs than if they had loſt each Individual his own Father; the new Soldiers as well as the Old broak-out into Skreams and Howlings ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Softening the moſt harden'd hearts, it was a Won 'er to ſee that People that had ſo little a time to know him, were as ſenſible as thoſe that had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ify'd with his favours. In the Camp nothing more but Lamentations were heard: the Soldiers cry'd to one another, what our Fathers then Dead; What ſhall we do? Who ſhall bring us o'er the <hi>Rhine</hi> again in ſafety? nay &amp; when we have paſs'd it, under whom can we Serve from whom we may expect the like Treatment. Each Individual then took Delight in relating the Obligations he had to him; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interrupting his ſtory with abundance of tears that bedew'd his face. Yet wou'd every one ſee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>dy of his General: But this Spectatle renew'd their

Crys and their Wailings. In ſo general a Sadneſs, it was impoſſible to diſcern the Relations from ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo reall was the Grief; Nor indeed was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon, that the Soldiers call'd him their father, ſince that they bore him the ſame Affection, as if he had been really ſo. The Count <hi>de Lorges,</hi> his Nephew, being then at the Army, ſuſpended for ſome Days the tokens of his Grief, for fear it might be capable of daunting the Troups, that remain'd under his Conduct. After this fatal Accident he made them direct their march toward the <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and knowing that the Enemies were bruſhing after him, he Mareſhall'd his Army in Battalia for fear of being Surpriz'd. The Enemies perceiv'd plainly by his Countenance, that matters wou'd not go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>'d with the thought that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Death muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needs afford them a Great Advantage, they made up to the Count with a Reſolution to fight him. Then was it neceſſary for the Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>de Lorge</hi> to put in Practice the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons his Uncle had ſee him he prepar'd for Battle, &amp; did it in ſo much order as ſpoke him to be a great Proficient. The Battle was long and doubtfull, but the Enemies having throughout found an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Oppoſition, they judged more Convenient to retreat, than to faſten any longer upon a thing that had been leſs uſefull than Damageable. The Count <hi>de Lorges</hi> no longer finding any Impediment in paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> Conducted his Troups into <hi>Alſace,</hi> where he reſolv'd to wait the Kings Orders, to whom he had diſpatcht a Courier. In the Interim being willing to pay his laſt Duties to his Uncle, he had him a Service perform'd, whereat, if Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention had not been us'd, Every man of all the Troups wou'd have aſſiſted. For the leaſt Soldier being
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57147:216"/>
hurry'd-on by the Affection he had for his Memory, thought himſelf no leſs oblig'd than the Count, to be at this Ceremony: Not one was there how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that Contented himſelf with wearing Mourning in his heart, Every Individual wou'd needs by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marks ſhew his Affliction; and if as much Crape cou'd have been got as they wou'd have had, we ſhou'd have ſeen what perhaps, had been never ſeen in any Army, that is to ſay, All the Soldiers in Mourning, in Reality they did not mind what it might coſt, and he that cou'd get any, thought it a great favour of Fortune. The King having receiv'd the Count <hi>de Lorge</hi>'s Courier, was ſo very much Afflicted that he wou'd not ſee any Body for ſeveral days together, he ſaid publiquely that he had loſt the Wiſeſt Man of his Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Greateſt of his Captains; and fearing that after this the Enemies might eaſily enter into the heart of his Dominions, he ſent the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> into <hi>Alſace,</hi> and this Prince found the Means to ſtop them. The whole Court was ſenſible to this loſs, as well as the King, ſaving only the Miniſter, who was not ſo very ſorry, tho' he durſt not let it outwardly appear. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Reims,</hi> his Brother, was not, alltogether, ſo Circumſpect, he did ſuch things to ſhew his joy as diſpleas'd his father, who being one of the Wiſeſt Courtiers of the Age, reprimanded him for this Carriage. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs what ever Grief was ſhewn at Court, yet was it ſtill much leſs than that of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> who tho' Commonly ſufficiently tenacious, wou'd willingly have given the half of their fortunes to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd his Life; ſeveral Inſtances did they give of this their Affection, by the Conſternation the whole Town was in at this News, and by their Lamentations for his Death: They were not afraid
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57147:217"/>
to ſay, that after the loſs the Kingdom had newly had, it was in great Danger. In effect, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Opinion, was very willing to make ſure of the Grandees, by conferring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> New favours on them; he made Eight Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> tho' there were thoſe of the Liſt that were not in over-great Eſteem; the Duke of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonne</hi> was of this Number, that gave Occaſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
