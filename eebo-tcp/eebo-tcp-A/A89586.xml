            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of glaſſe mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, &amp;c. ſtand on the ſea of glaſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the harps of God.</hi> This ſea of <hi>glaſſe,</hi> or cryſtall, is deſcribed Chap. 4. 6. placed before the Throne, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the great Laver, or Sea in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, wherein the Prieſts were to waſh themſelves from their uncleanneſſes, whenever they approached nigh to the Altar of God to offer ſacrifice; onely that was made of <hi>braſſe,</hi> this of a more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent metall:</hi> In this Laver the Reformed Churches had lately been waſhed from the foulneſſe, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Antichriſtianity, out of which they had newly eſcaped, <hi>having gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the number of his Name;</hi> and being cleanſed in this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (though mingled with fire, whether of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or other affliction, I diſpute not) they ſtand up on the brim of it, with the harps of God in their hands, with <hi>inſtruments of praiſe,</hi> as the Iſraelites did upon the banks of the Red-ſea, (thorow which they <note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> had lately paſſed, and in it been baptized unto God) ſinging a ſong of praiſe for their great deliverance from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoaſt, who periſhed in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of them; This was their condition, and their poſture, a <hi>delivered, cleanſed condition,</hi> a <hi>praiſefull poſture.</hi> Secondly, their work, during the time of the pouring out the vialls, they ſang an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſong, Canticum gratulatorium &amp; euchariſticum,</hi> a ſong of praiſe and thankſgiving: wherein obſerve two things; firſt, the <hi>Title</hi> of the Song, <hi>The Song of Moſes, the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb:</hi> Secondly, the ſubject matter of the Song, <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:112063:6"/>
The title: Firſt, the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch a Song, and upon ſuch an occaſion as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſang unto God when they had paſſed through the Red ſea: 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. and the ſong of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> we have many ſongs of the <hi>Lamb</hi> recorded in this Booke; cap. 4. 11. <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory, and honour, and power,</hi> &amp;c. is the conſtant ſong of the whole Church of Chriſt; cap. 5. 9. the ſame quire ſings a <hi>new ſong</hi> to the <hi>Lamb</hi> when hee had taken the booke to unlooſe the Seales thereof; cap. 11. 17. the ſame Church ſings <hi>another ſong</hi> of prayſe upon the reſurrection of the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and the fall of the tenth part of the great City, <hi>We give thee thankes O Lord God Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. cap. 12. 10. upon <hi>Michaels</hi> victorie over the dragon, there is <hi>another Song</hi> of praiſe, <hi>Now is come ſalvation, and the Kingdome of our God, and the power of his Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. cap. 14. 3. there's a <hi>New Song</hi> ſung before the throne which no man could learne, but the hundred forty and foure thouſand which were redeemed from the earth: Now whether <hi>this Song</hi> of the Lamb be the Song which thoſe harpers ſang, or whether, and how farre it is compoſed out of the reſt of the ſongs recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Book, is needleſſe (as ſome Interpreters doe) to enquire, becauſe we have the matter of the Song layed downe in ſo many words; it is ſufficient that it's therefore called the Song of the Lamb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was <hi>indited</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lamb, and <hi>tends</hi> to advance the <hi>glory</hi> of the Lamb their Saviour and Deliverer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matter of the Song: which divides in ſelfe into <hi>two parts.</hi> 1. The <hi>Churches confeſsion of the nature of thoſe workes which Chriſt doth in the pouring out the

ſeven vialls,</hi> ver. 3. viz. <hi>Great and marvellous are thy workes, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy ways thou King of Saints,</hi> i. e. They are great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, fit onely to bee done by him who is the <hi>Lord God Almghty,</hi> juſt and true, well becomming him who is the <hi>King of Saints.</hi> 2. The uſe which the Church makes of theſe works, which is threefold. 1. They <hi>record, celebrate, and publiſh them.</hi> 2. They engage and <hi>binde themſelves</hi> faſter and cloſer to him, in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice, <hi>Who ſhall not feare thee O Lord, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify thy Name? for thou onely art holy.</hi> 3. They prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically foretell the uſe which <hi>ſhall be made</hi> of theſe workes by ſuch as yet were <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> viz. As Chriſt proceedes to manifeſt theſe wonderfull and righteous plagues and judgments upon the Antichriſtian world, the people of <hi>Italy, Germany, France, England, Scotland, Denmarke, Sweden, Polonia, Hungaria,</hi> and the reſt of the elect ſhall ſhake off the <hi>Yoke of Antichriſt,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the <hi>Scepter of Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> for <hi>all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judgments are made manifeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have a plaine view of the Text together with the interpretation, out of which many excellent and uſefull truths might be obſerved. As firſt, that <hi>all which is done in the pouring out of the ſeven vialls, is the wrath of God upon the Antichriſtian faction;</hi> ſo that however in the pouring out of every viall there is ſomething which is <hi>grievous</hi> to the reformed <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> to humble, purge, and quicken them, yet there is no <hi>wrath</hi> upon any where ever it is poured, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as there is <hi>ſomething of Antichriſt</hi> among them, which Chriſt will ſearch for, find, and deſtroy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he finds it: Conſider the whole work of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112063:7"/>
and you ſhall finde noyſome and grievous ſores upon them <hi>onely</hi> that have the mark of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the drinking of bloud, the ſcorching with heat, the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their tongues for paine, the being deſtroyed with hailſtones, &amp;c. All theſe light <hi>onely</hi> upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>worſhipers of the Beaſt,</hi> the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> &amp; therefore let none feare any hurt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>theſe judgments</hi> which Chriſt is <hi>now</hi> inflicting, but ſuch as either ſecretly or openly harbour any of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts acurſed ſtuff</hi> which muſt be deſtroyed; &amp; let it be I beſeech you, your ſpeedy care to caſt out of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Church all thoſe reliques, which are the oyl and fuel that feed the flame which burnes amongſt us: God calls you <hi>now</hi> to <hi>this</hi> work, and will be with you while you ſet your hearts and hands to doe it; and doe it <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> it may be it is one Cauſe, why ſo many breaches are made upon you, becauſe you have no more vigorouſly attempted it in the <hi>firſt place;</hi> and fear not that ye ſhould therby <hi>loſe a party,</hi> or <hi>ſtrengthen a party againſt you,</hi> beleeve it, that party that hath drunk of the whores cup, and is in love with her abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will never <hi>be aſsiſtant,</hi> nor wil <hi>Chriſt ſuffer</hi> them to <hi>overthrow</hi> the worke committed to your hands; they may and ſhall deſtroy themſelves, bringing the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes written in this book upon themſelves, and their poſteritie, as <hi>Achan</hi> did by hiding the Babyloniſh <note place="margin">Joſh. 7.</note> garment and wedg of gold in his tent, but the <hi>Lord will be with you,</hi> therefore go on and proſper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve: That how ever in the pouring out of theſe vialls, in the deſtroying of the Antichriſtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſeth the <hi>miniſtery of Angels,</hi> of inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts comming out of the Temple and fitted for that work, yet the work is aſcribed to <hi>Chriſt alone, Great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:112063:7"/>
are <hi>thy</hi> workes, juſt and true are <hi>thy</hi> wayes, <hi>thy</hi> judgments are made manifeſt: Many worthy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inſtruments hath Chriſt ſtirred up and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this Service, many famous and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, many excellent Nobles, many illuſtrious Kings, Queenes, and Princes, many grave Senates, and Parliaments, (amongſt whom I doubt not Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will one day be recorded) have put their hands to this worke, to make this harlot deſolate, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to eat her fleſh and burne her with fire; for <hi>God hath put it in their hearts to fulfill his will:</hi> but they conferre nothing of their own to the work, they are but his inſtruments, his bow and his battle-axe, meer dead tooles, who receive all their efficacy and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his hand who uſeth them; their preſence addes no ſtrength to him, their abſence makes the work no more difficult to him. And therefore let not our faith &amp; comfort ebbe and flow with the increaſe &amp; wane of humane helps. Let us not therefore thinke the work will ſooner be done, becauſe ſtrong is our hand and arme of fleſh, nor that we are therefore like to loſe the cauſe, becauſe our helpes prove either weake or treacherous; the viall now pouring out is the <hi>Lords</hi> work, and he will ſee it done, doubt ye not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. obſerv. That all the <hi>time</hi> of Chriſts pouring out the vialls of his wrath upon Antichriſt, ſhould be a <hi>joyful</hi> time to the Church of Chriſt, al thoſe daies ſhould be days of <hi>Purim,</hi> days of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſgiving; though they ſtand upon a ſea mingled with fire, they ſhould have the harpes of God in their hands, and Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs in their mouths, becauſe Chriſt is judging the great whore, and avenging the bloud of his ſervants at her hand. Although it be ſo diſpoſed by Chriſt,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112063:8"/>
that during the time of the vialls, his Churches have much bitterneſſe, and the hayle of every ſtorme in ſome degree lights upon them, yet muſt they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look their own ſufferings, and be filled with joy for the judgments executed upon Chriſt's, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and not deferre their prayſes till their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances be compleat, but upon every new delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to them, and upon every new judgment upon the enemies, have their mouths filled with new and renewed ſongs of prayſe and thankſgivings to God, as we doe this day.</p>
               <p>Theſe &amp; many ſuch like general obſervations from the words are obvious to every eye, &amp; very ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſuitable to the mercies celebrated this day, I deſire that they may not lightly be paſſed over in your thoughts, though I ſhall ſay no more of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to confine my ſpeech to one only obſervation, which indeed is the very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Text, the burden of the ſong, and to apply it for the ſame ends and uſes for which it is here recorded by the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The workes of Chriſt in the pouring out the vialls of his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Text</note> 
                  <hi>wrath, in taking vengeance of the Antichriſt and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, are great</hi> and <hi>wonderfull,</hi> fit to be wrought by him <hi>onely who is the Lord God Almighty, juſt and true, well becoming the King of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, they are <hi>[great]</hi> works, whether of Mercy, <note place="margin">Explained.</note> or Judgment; or are great, when they are the effects either of great wiſedome in their contrivance, or of great power in their production.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>[marvellous, or wonderfull;]</hi> and that in a threefold reſpect: Firſt, ſuch as are rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall, which ſeldome happen; theſe draw mens eyes after them, and make men wonder at them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112063:8"/>
ſuch as are unexpected, which come <hi>praeter ſpem,</hi> things which no body would think to come to paſſe. Thirdly and chiefly, things are wonderfull, which are beyond our comprehenſion, whereof we cannot ſee the cauſes, whoſe height and depth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaſured, ſuch as nothing but the power of an infinite and Almighty God can bring to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>[Iuſt:]</hi> Wayes are juſt, when they are according to a right rule; and wayes of judgement, (of which my Text) are then juſt, when they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature, kinde, and degree of the ſinnes againſt which they are executed. <hi>Thou art righteous,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 16. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, becauſe thou haſt judged thus; for they have ſhed the bloud of thy Saints, and Prophets, and thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them bloud to drink, for they are worthy: Even ſo Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>[True:]</hi> Wayes are then true, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Covenant, when done according to what was foretold; and theſe wayes become <hi>a King of Saints:</hi> other Kings often deal <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> bearing the ſword, to execute wrath upon them that do well, ſtrengthening the hands of them that do evill, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the righteous, and acquitting the wicked, and often <hi>untruly</hi> breaking their Oaths, falſifying their Covenants; but this <hi>King of Saints</hi> doth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his righteous judgements, that his people ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>According to their deeds,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Word, <hi>hath he repayed fury to his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>

               <p>Firſt, theſe works have been great and wonderfull for the <hi>kinde:</hi> When the Antichriſtian Empire which at firſt was contrived with that wiſedome, and underpropped with that ſtrength, ruling even the ſouls and conſciences of men, and had prevailed ſo farre, that all the Kings and States of the World were ſo drunken with the Whores Cup, that they not onely kiſſed her well-favoured face, but as ſo many brute beaſts lay at her foot-ſtooll, proſtituting all their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her command, making warre even againſt the Lamb himſelf, and helping to drink the bloud of his Saints, none daring to queſtion the truth, or rather divinity of her Commands, ſo that ſhe could glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie her ſelf, and ſay in her heart, <hi>I ſit as a Queen, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow;</hi> now that ſuddenly, it ſhould be put into the hearts of moſt of the <hi>Europaean</hi> States, to hate this Whore, to endeavour to make her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and naked, to eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire, how <hi>great</hi> and <hi>marvellous</hi> doth this ſpeak the work for the <hi>kinde</hi> of it? Who but the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112063:9"/>
could do this? It is <hi>certainly the Lords doing, and muſt be marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if we conſider the <hi>time,</hi> which our Lord Chriſt was pleaſed to make choyce of, for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe great works, they will appear yet more wonderfull; even when his Church was at the <hi>loweſt,</hi> when <hi>he ſaw that their power was gone, and there was</hi>

                  <hi>none ſhut up or left,</hi> when <hi>the enemy was come in like a flood, and no man to lift up a ſtandard againſt him, when he ſaw that there was no helper, even then put he on righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 16, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>as a breaſt-plate, and an helmet of ſalvation upon his head, and the garments of vengeance for his cloathing.</hi> Who can be ignorant of theſe things? who knows not the low condition of <hi>Germany,</hi> when <hi>Luther</hi> firſt appeared, though <hi>onely</hi> againſt the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious abuſe of the Popes Indulgences, and other lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant branches of his Tyrannicall uſurpation? inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that a Biſhop wiſhing him well, yet deſpairing <note place="margin">Albertus Crancius.</note> of ſucceſſe, counſelled him (as the Story reports) after this manner; <hi>Frater, frater, abi in Cellam &amp; dic, Miſerere mei Deus. To thy beads Frier, thou wilt do no good in this work:</hi> For the people of <hi>Germany</hi> were at that time ſo bewitched with the ſorceries of the Whore, and ſo enthralled to her power, that (as that proud <hi>Cardinall</hi> too confidently boaſted) they were <note place="margin">Cajetanus Cardinalis.</note> ready at the Popes command, for the redemption of their ſouls, to have <hi>eaten graſſe and hay, more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> after the manner of brute Beaſts. And was not the Church in <hi>other Countries</hi> as low? namely, at the firſt appearing of <hi>Zuinglins,</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> in <hi>Helvetia;</hi> of <hi>Calvin, Viret,</hi> and <hi>Farell,</hi> in <hi>France; Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley,</hi> (eſpecially) <hi>Bilney,</hi> and <hi>Tyndall,</hi> in <hi>England; Hamilton, Wiſchart, Knox,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112063:10"/>
others, in <hi>Scotland?</hi> at that time, when in a word, the whole Church might have taken up that complaint, Ezek. 37. 11. <hi>Our bones are dried, our hope is loſt, we are cut off for our parts,</hi> then did our Lord Chriſt <hi>open their graves, and cauſe them to come up out of their graves, and made them live, and ſtand up upon their feet, an exceeding great army;</hi> this alſo muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, to be the work of the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who is <hi>wonderfull in counſell,</hi> and <hi>excellent in working.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the <hi>kinde,</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> ſo thirdly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>meanes,</hi> and <hi>inſtruments,</hi> renders them yet more <hi>wonderfull;</hi> to effect <hi>great</hi> things by weak meanes, is an argument of <hi>great</hi> power and ſtrength; That the <hi>walls of Iericho</hi> ſhould fall at the <hi>blaſt of trumpets of rams horns;</hi> that a <hi>Cake of barley</hi>

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:112063:16"/>
as well their hearts filled with admiration of them, as their mouths with praiſe. And this (Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and beloved) let me commend to your practice in the firſt place: <hi>Come and ſee the works of the Lord,</hi> even the <hi>great and marvellous works of the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, how terrible he is in his doings towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men: All his works are great,</hi> his works of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> even of the <hi>leaſt atomes,</hi> the works of <hi>common providence</hi> governing even the wayes of the <hi>piſmire</hi> are great and <hi>worthy to be ſought out of all them that take pleaſure in them;</hi> but the works of the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church, the goings of our Lord and King in his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> ruling his Saints in the middeſt of their enemies, and after <hi>this manner</hi> breaking in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Powers which doe oppoſe them, is <hi>now</hi> the wonder of Angels, and <hi>ſhall be</hi> the wonder of Saints to eternity; and fit therfore that <hi>now</hi> it ſhould be ours. Mans diſpoſition is naturally taken with thoughts and diſcourſes of things great and wonderfull, and is not ſatisfied but in ſomething that raiſes the mind to a high pitch of admiration; here you may behold an object fit, (if any) to beget wonderment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our ſpirits never are right till we ſtand at gaze here, for this diſcovers a plaine difference between the ſpirits of godly and carnall men, theſe latter are more taken with vaine and empty things. A Poet or a well-penn'd Romancy how it takes ſome, waſting upon it dayes, weeks, and moneths, admiring the wit, invention, ſtyle or elegancy; others wonder at the raiſing of this or that poore man to a great eſtate of wealth, at another out of the duſt advanced to the height of honour: theſe things fill their hearts with thoughts when <hi>alone,</hi> their mouthes with diſcourſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112063:17"/>
when in <hi>company,</hi> yet in the mean time the wonders of Chriſt are not taken notice of: Chriſt's perſon, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, adminiſtrations are too baſe things for them to buſie their thoughts about, they can ſee nothing but triviall matters, and not worth their notice in them all, yea they wonder at them who can ſpend their time in the Study of the Scriptures, and the meditation of theſe works of Chriſt. But theſe men (whatever they think of themſelves) are <hi>ſottiſh</hi> beaſts, <hi>carnall</hi> and brutiſh perſons, and I may ſay of the <hi>things</hi> they are ſo take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with, as Chriſt to the Diſciples who were ſo affected with the ſtones &amp; goodly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, <hi>Are theſe the things ye wonder at? I tell you, there ſhall not be left here one ſtone upon another:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 24 2.</note> So theſe riches, theſe buildings, this power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, this great man in his countrey, theſe things I ſay, by too much regarding whereof many loſe their ſoules, what ſhall they all be ere long? Heaven and earth ſhall be on fire, and what ſhall theſe things be then? and I may further ſay of the <hi>men</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire theſe things, that they are greater vanities then the things they wonder at; Who having immortall ſoules, fit to be partakers of the divine nature, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings capable of the knowledge of God, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions worthy only of God, ſhould yet thus baſely proſtitute and abaſe themſelves, to advance a thing of nothing, whereas on the contrary a holy heart is ſo taken with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his wayes, that <hi>all other things</hi> appear to them to be but toyes and folly, as men got up on high neer the Heavens, behold the earth but as a little ſpot. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerved this difference in himſelfe, that ſo long as he was a <hi>ſtranger</hi> from the wayes of holineſſe, he thought the ſtudy of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>

to be a <hi>dull</hi> buſineſſe, infinitely preferring <hi>Tully</hi> before the <hi>Bible;</hi> but after his <hi>converſion</hi> he took no pleaſure in that <hi>Author</hi> where he found not the Name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Oh therefore that you would poure out your hearts in the ſtudy of theſe things, that the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full way of Chriſt's governing in his Church might take up not the leaſt part of your thoughts. How he hath kept this buſh burning, and yet not conſumed; how ſtrange it was that a few Fiſhermen ſhould by preaching and ſuffering, like ſome conquering <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> ſubdue the Nations; Think of his ſtrange courſe, permitting an Antichriſt to Lord it above a thouſand years, in the world, ſo as to ſubdue the world wholly to his yoake, ſuffering the Kings to give up their Crowns &amp; Scepters to him, proſtituting their power at his feet; and when <hi>Satan</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo ſtrong as to continue the Church in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for ever, that then a ſilly Monke ſhould ſet himſelf againſt the world, and in a ſhort time reſcue a great part of it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under his yoak.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112063:18"/>
but we cannot <hi>meditate</hi> on them! <hi>Say not ſo</hi> leſt you prove your ſelves perſons without grace; <hi>Pſalme</hi> 78. it is made the note of a <hi>wretch,</hi> and of one <hi>whoſe dayes God will conſume in ſorrow,</hi> to forget the works of God; and of a <hi>brutiſh perſon,</hi> Pſal. 92. not to conſider them: and if you cannot finde a heart to wonder at Him, and his wayes, as an occaſion of praiſe, take heed he ſhew not himſelfe wonderfull in your confuſion.

I know that there is a dulneſſe and aukneſſe in the ſpirits of the <hi>beſt,</hi> yet <hi>godly</hi> hearts will <hi>endeavour</hi> to overcome it: <hi>He that is wiſe, will ponder theſe things,</hi> will fet his heart <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 43.</note> to taske in theſe ſtudies; and that not as to an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing drudgery, but as to an employment, <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Angelicall,</hi> moſt pleaſing and delightfull: <hi>My medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Him ſhall be ſweet.</hi> And for your better quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this duty, conſider; <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. ult</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that this is the <hi>only way</hi> to make us <hi>Heavenly and ſpirituall,</hi> by feeding on ſuch matters of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <note place="margin">Motives.</note> The <hi>object</hi> about which we are converſant, <note place="margin">1.</note> gives a <hi>tincture</hi> to our ſpirit, <hi>naturally</hi> ſuch as our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are, ſuch are our <hi>ſtudies, pueri crepundia geſtant,</hi> children play with rattles, and <hi>morally</hi> our ſpirits are moulded into the ſtudies we are accuſtomed to.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this will make us ever <hi>fit for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi> This our Lord will be ſerved with <hi>reverence</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112063:18"/>
from his wonderfull workes? all baſe and low conceits will then vaniſh: all ſociety and communion among men is maintain'd by a knowledge of <hi>inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> when we ſee more eminency in men for their <hi>gifts,</hi> and graces and places, it ſtrikes a reverence, and ſtrengthens the bands of love and reſpect, much more ſtrongly doth the ſerious and deep beholding of the unparallel'd perfections and excellencies of God, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his wonderfull works, captivate the ſoule and lay it low before him: but of this more in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond uſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this is the way to make us <hi>profit and grow up in grace;</hi> when God ſees us humble admirers of <note place="margin">3.</note> his greatneſſe, and diligent ſearchers into his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he will reveale himſelfe yet more and more to us, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nathaniel, Becauſe I ſaid this unto thee, beleeveſt thou? thou ſhalt ſee greater things then</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, as a further motive and help, be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly acquainted with thine own <hi>condition,</hi> really <note place="margin">4.</note> ſenſible of thine own <hi>vileneſſe, wants,</hi> and <hi>baſeneſſe</hi> of all kindes; take the dimenſions of thy corruptions, the height, length, and depth of them, conſider that thou art in thy ſelf a vaſſall of Satan, a veſſel of wrath, dead in nature and diſpoſition to good, dead in Sin, poſting to eternall deſtruction, and then <hi>every</hi> thing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> thy Saviour will be wonderful unto thee.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, conſider thy relations to Chriſt, <note place="margin">5.</note> He is thy <hi>head,</hi> thy <hi>King,</hi> thy <hi>Lord,</hi> thy <hi>Husband,</hi> thy <hi>brother,</hi> &amp; withall thy <hi>intereſt</hi> in all his works, they are all done for <hi>thee, thou</hi> haſt a part in every <hi>deliverance,</hi> (they are <hi>thy</hi> enemies that fall, upon the pouring out

               <p>O therefore, that Chriſt would open our eyes, that we might <hi>ſee</hi> his wonders in their juſt dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the <hi>wiſdome, power, faithfulneſſe, greatneſſe, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> ſhining in them, that thoſe things might be glorious, and excellent in <hi>our</hi> eyes, which are mean and common in the eyes of <hi>others,</hi> that wee might be able to anſwer ſuch as ſee no ſuch thing in them, (with the Painter, who being much taken with a piece, though ſeeming plain, yet of excellent workmanſhip, to one ignorantly asking him, what worth he ſaw in that poor peece) <hi>O friend, couldſt thou ſee with my eyes, thou wouldſt be raviſhed with it.</hi> And that our <hi>mouths</hi> might be filled with <hi>praiſes</hi> all the day long, eſpecially upon <hi>this</hi> day, purpoſely ſet apart by us, thankfully to record the <hi>great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works, the true and righteous judgements, of our King of Saints;</hi> In <hi>delivering us from the hurtfull ſword, in being on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, in cauſing our ſoul to eſcape, as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler, making their miſchief to return upon their own head, cauſing them to ſink down in the pit which they made; in the net which they hid, is their own foot taken.</hi> And ſo much for the firſt Uſe, the Uſe of <hi>Admiration.</hi>

But if you will not hearken to me, let me ſadly ſpeak it to you, you are as a City ſet upon an hill, you and your wayes are looked upon by all men;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112063:22"/>
and if you <hi>hinder</hi> the worke by your <hi>lives,</hi> which your <hi>office</hi> calls you to <hi>further, it were better you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born into the world.</hi> Them that honour Chriſt, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> he will honour, and them that deſpiſe him, ſhall be lightly eſteemed; yea he knowes how to make uſe of you, and your gifts, to promote his cauſe, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you for the iniquity of your lives, as many of thoſe who forwarded the building of the arke, yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the waters.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider how loud this <hi>dayes deliverance</hi> cries in your eares to ingage your ſelves to <hi>feare him,</hi> and <hi>glorifie his name,</hi> who hath wrought this great ſalvation for you. It were a waſtefull expence of time to inſiſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the particulars of this late bloudy deſign in <hi>this</hi> Aſſembly; (though in <hi>others</hi> uſefull) All the light we have about it, comes from you. The many great and high hands which were ingaged in it, the ſubtilty of the contrivance, the neerneſſe of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the woefull conſequences, and the bloudy fruits which muſt needs have iſſued from it; The good hand of God in cruſhing this cockatrices egge, before it brake out to be a fiery flying ſerpent, are fit things to be publiſhed and to be ſpread abroad in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Congregations; But to you I ſhall only be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer of thus much: That you knew not your neer approaching danger, and that had this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and bloudy contrivance took effect, many of you had been at your long home, ere this time, and the reſt of this Honourable Aſſembly, hitherto the great <hi>preſervers</hi> of our <hi>liberty,</hi> had beene made as a Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the greateſt inſtruments of the Kingdomes <hi>ſlavery</hi> and <hi>vaſſallage</hi> for time to come. But the Lord was awake when we ſlept, and hath
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112063:23"/>
took the enemies in the pit which they digged, and hath filled your hearts with joy, and given you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day to praiſe him. Can you upon this day of thankſgiving doe leſſe then enquire, What ſhall we render unto the Lord? I will tell you what he calls for, and expects from you, and I beſeech you by theſe mercies of God that you render it unto him: <hi>That you preſent your bodies and your ſoules a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice,</hi> that you feare <hi>him and glorifie his name, for he only is holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, and principally, conſider the late ſacred <hi>Covenant</hi> and vow which you have all entred into; you have not only entred into it your own ſelves, but intend to draw the whole Kingdome with you, into the Oath of God; let me minde you what you have done; you ſaw we were deſigned to deſtruction, and that Gods meer mercy hath hitherto prevented it; You ſee there are ſtill deſtructive and trayterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes in hand, in ſeverall parts of the Kingdome; you acknowledge your own ſins with others, have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all theſe judgements which either lye upon us, or are threatned againſt us, and as a means to prevent our utter ruine, you think it neceſſary to enter into this <hi>Covenant</hi> with almighty God, and you <hi>have</hi> done it, wherein you acknowledge the <hi>deſert of your own ſins,</hi> and you <hi>confeſs</hi> your hearty ſorrow for them, and your <hi>reall intentions to amend</hi> your own lives, and what you will <hi>further</hi> doe to ſave and preſerve <hi>Religion;</hi> and all this you have done in <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> to the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> calling the <hi>God of Heaven, the ſearcher of all hearts to witneſſe your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as you will anſwer it at that Day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhal be diſcloſed.</hi> Think now how <hi>deeply</hi> you
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112063:23"/>
are engaged, and brought under the curſe of God, if you perform not this ſolemn Covenant; Think how <hi>horrid</hi> a thing it will prove, for any of you to ſtand as <hi>perjured</hi> men before <hi>God,</hi> in marters of <hi>ſuch Conſequence; Shall he break his Oath</hi> (ſaid God of a <note place="margin">Ezck. 17. 15.</note> King) <hi>and be delivered? Shall he eſcape that doth theſe things?</hi> O Beloved, <hi>It is a fearfull thing</hi> (in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes eſpecially) <hi>to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> to whom you have appealed, and whoſe vengeance, if you wilfully fail, you have invocated upon your own heads.</p>
               <p>Lay therefore your hands upon your heart, and think what your purpoſes and Reſolutions are in theſe few things, which I ſhall mention to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for what is <hi>paſt;</hi> what reall ſorrow have ye <note place="margin">1.</note> in your hearts, for thoſe ſins which you call God to witneſſe you are thus ſorry for? How grievous is the remembrance of them, how intolerable do you feel the burthen of them? or do you take Gods Name in vain, calling him to witneſſe of the ſorrow for thoſe things which he knows you take pleaſure in? Think what anſwer you will make to this.</p>
               <p>Secondly? What are your Reſolutions <hi>for time to come.</hi> You know what blaſphemies, what prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <note place="margin">2.</note> what uncleanneſſes, you have hitherto lived in; what irreligion and libertiniſme your ſelves and families, have hitherto been guilty of, elſe you would never have acknowledged, your ſins to have deſerved theſe judgements; Now I demand, what you reſolve to do for time to come: Do you purpoſe to go on in your old ways; He that was <hi>unjuſt, to be unjuſt ſtill;</hi> he that was <hi>filthy, to be filthy ſtill,</hi> and had no other purpoſe, but to lead the Kingdom a dance,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112063:24"/>
to go before them in the formality of a ſervice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing your Leopards ſpots, or your Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moors skins; or in truth, be you reſolved, being changed by the renewing of your minde, to become new creatures, to ſerve Chriſt in newneſſe of ſpirit, that Chriſt alone may reign as Lord and King here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, both in your hearts, and lives, and families, as <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> did, when he bid the Iſraelites chooſe whom they would ſerve; for himſelf, he was reſolved, though he went <hi>all alone,</hi> He and his family would ſerve the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as you are <hi>Parliament men,</hi> what are your purpoſes concerning your faithfulneſſe to <note place="margin">3.</note> Chriſt, and the Cauſe of Chriſt, and his Church committed to your hands? If you ſhould altogether fail, deliverance will come another way, the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt the Church of Chriſt; But are ye really reſolved, to ſave the Church and Kingdom, though your ſelves ſhould periſh in the attempt? or do you intend under <hi>pretence</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>factors</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to drive a <hi>trade</hi> for <hi>Satan and Antichriſt,</hi> to betray Religion and Liberty? or to trade in both the Indies, to have a ſtock going on both ſides, that you may ſave your own ſtake, which ſide ſoever win or loſe, to ſave your own skin, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever become of the Kingdom? Like a certain <hi>Deſpot of Servia,</hi> (of whom I have read in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory) who lived among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and kept cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Turk;</hi> who was a <hi>publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of Chriſt,</hi> but a <hi>ſecret circumciſed Turk,</hi> that that <hi>Turkiſh mark</hi> might ſave him, if need were: Have any of you ſuch cunning devices, to procure externall ſafety with the certain ruin of your ſouls?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112063:24"/>
Honoured, and Beloved, I hope better things of you all, though I thus ſpeak, I hope you purpoſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Covenant, and what God requires and expects at your hands, to ſtick cloſe to Chriſt and his Cauſe, to ſink and ſwim with the Church, and Cauſe of Chriſt, with ſingleneſſe of heart, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied reſolutions, to carry on the work of God, to value your ſelves onely as his Inſtruments, and let him do by you, and with you, what is good in his own eyes.</p>
               <p>And for your <hi>Encouragement,</hi> let me ſpeak a little of the third Uſe, which the Church here makes of <note place="margin">3. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> theſe great and <hi>marvellous,</hi> theſe <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>true</hi> wayes, and judgements of this King of Saints, which is a <hi>Propheticall Prognoſtication, and foretelling of what ſhall further happen upon the pouring out of every viall;</hi> and that is, more and more people, and nations ſhall come in, and ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>the Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judgements are made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt:</hi> And this inables me for your comfort, to help you to an anſwer of the moſt <hi>difficult queſtion,</hi> and moſt <hi>perplexing thought,</hi> that I am perſwaded is in the heart of moſt men living at this day, <hi>viz.</hi> God hath caſt our Lot in very perplexed times, all the banks are broken down, all Gods judgments ſeem to invade us at once, and Gods adminiſtration to the Kingdom is ſuch, that the wiſeſt man cannot gueſſe, by Gods dealing to day, what he intends to do with us to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; <hi>Sometimes</hi> the Lord enables a <hi>handfull</hi> of <hi>ours,</hi> to chaſe <hi>thouſands</hi> of the enemies; Sometimes <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> of <hi>ours</hi> flee, <hi>as at the ſhaking of a leaf, when none purſues them;</hi> Sometimes we have <hi>rare</hi> Inſtruments unexpectedly <hi>raiſed up;</hi> by and by very uſefull men

are <hi>taken</hi> off, and <hi>hopefull</hi> men prove <hi>treacherous;</hi> Sometimes the Lord ſeems to intimate (as in a Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit) that <hi>one fight</hi> ſhall end the buſineſſe, one way or other; otherwhiles, all things are ſet as if there would be a <hi>lengthening</hi> out of theſe unnaturall wars, untill the Cities and Countries are utterly ſpoiled, and the Land waſted without inhabitant: Now in theſe calamitous times, every mans thoughts run, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars,</hi> with deſire to know <hi>what ſhould come to paſſe hereafter,</hi> and to demand with that Saint, <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>How long it ſhall be to the end of theſe troubles,</hi> and all <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 13. Pſal. 74. 9.</note> complain, that there is <hi>no Prophet to tell us how long;</hi> neither can I blame them as curious, who are modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicitous to know what will be the event of theſe things, for even the Prophets and holy men of God heretofore, <hi>ſearched diligently to know what, and what manner of times the Holy Ghoſt intended,</hi> when he ſpake <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 10, 11.</note> of the ſufferings of Chriſt, whether in his <hi>Perſon,</hi> or in his <hi>members.</hi> Now my Text gives (I ſay) a <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory anſwer,</hi> to this difficult Queſtion, and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take (without fear of being cenſured, <hi>to be wiſe above what is written)</hi> to tell you <hi>what will be the iſſue and event of all theſe troubles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Proteſtant Writers do agree, that we are under the pouring out of ſome <hi>one</hi> or more of theſe ſeven vialls; Some think the fourth viall is now powring out upon the <hi>Sun</hi> of the Antichriſtian world; Others the fifth, upon the <hi>throne</hi> of the Beaſt; there are, that think we are come as farre as the ſixt viall, and the river <hi>Euphrates</hi> is drying up; I will not determine which of them it is, it is ſufficient, (which of them ſoever it be) my Text aſſures me the event ſhall be this, which is the event of every viall, <hi>Antichriſts
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:112063:25"/>
part ſhall be weakned, and the Church of Chriſt ſhall be ſtrengthened;</hi> Something in every viall may <hi>afflict</hi> the Church, but incurably <hi>wounds</hi> the Beaſt. As the <hi>ſeven Trumpets</hi> were ſo many degrees of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heathen <hi>Empire,</hi> ſo the <hi>ſeven vialls</hi> are ſo many degrees of the deſtruction and ruin of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Empire;</hi> and it is worth your obſerving, that all the time, the whole twelve hundred and threeſcore years of Antichriſts reign, Chriſt always had an army of Saints, to warre againſt the Beaſt, a competent number of witneſſes, <hi>who loved not their lives unto the death;</hi> But all the while of Antichriſts <hi>riſing,</hi> and <hi>triumphant reigning,</hi> the event of <hi>every conflict,</hi> or ſcuffle was, that the <hi>Beaſt grew higher,</hi> and the <hi>Church fell lower,</hi> the Papacy prevailed over all that roſe up againſt it, ſo that the Church in the end was hardly to be found viſible upon the face of the earth; But it is far otherwiſe in his <hi>declining time,</hi> the time when the vials are pouring out, every one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plucks part of his fleece; one of them ſtrips him of this Kingdom, another of that; one of them wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens his Temporall, another his Spirituall Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; He is under the vials, as <hi>Haman</hi> before <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſter 6. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>having once begun to fall, he can never more prevail againſt them,</hi> untill in the end (the <hi>ſeventh viall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poured out upon the whole power of darkneſſe) the whole Church triumphantly ſhouts with a loud voice, <hi>It is done,</hi> there is an utter end of this enemy. So that I dare ſpeak it as confidently as I beleeve the <hi>Revelation</hi> to be divine Scripture, and the meaning of it thus farre made known to the Churches, that what viall <hi>ſoever</hi> is now powring out, the iſſue will be, <hi>That Antichriſt ſhall loſe, and Chriſt ſhall gain:</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:112063:26"/>
And there is but <hi>one</hi> objection againſt it, which I confeſſe to be a great one, and that which troubles many, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the two witneſſes be yet ſlain: their ſtory ye ſhall read in the eleventh of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Theſe two witneſſes, are the <hi>ſmall, yet competent number</hi> of pure worſhippers, who follow the Lamb, and conflict againſt the Beaſt all the time of his reign; now it is there ſaid, that during this whole ſpace of time, they prophecy in ſackcloth and aſhes, in a low and mournfull condition, and the Beaſt makes warre againſt them, and prevails againſt them; but <hi>quando finituri ſunt teſtimonium,</hi> a little before the end of their mournfull propheſie, which is a little before the Beaſts finall deſtruction; the Beaſt ſhall not onely keep them low, in ſackcloth and aſhes, and prevail by degrees againſt them as heretofore, but ſhall <hi>kill them,</hi> and their dead bodies ſhall lie unburied in the ſtreets of that great City, that is, in all the Territories of ſpirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Beaſt and his followers ſhall be more jolly, and glorious, then ever they have been: Now many learned Divines ſuſpect this kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Witneſſes is not yet paſt, and if it be not, the Church muſt go lower then ever it hath been, and how then is the Antichriſtian State weakned by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry viall? To all this I anſwer, that although I am not able to ſay, This bitter Cup is yet paſt, <hi>(Father, if it be poſsible, let this Cup paſſe away)</hi> yet I can ſay, this is true I have delivered, that every viall ſhall <hi>weaken the Beaſt, and ſtrengthen the Church,</hi> and whether they be killed, or not killed, when ever their killing comes, it laſts but three propheticall dayes and a half, that is, but <hi>three years and a half,</hi> and then preſently come in the glorious times, which Chriſt hath promiſed, and
