         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all the Papers which <hi>M J.</hi> weekly
almoſt publiſhes (to ſlander and
condemne the Parliament of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
Perjury, Oppreſſion, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage,
&amp;c.) his maine artifice,
and that which moſt infects the
people, is, his blending and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
things together, which are in nature dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and by all meanes ought to be diſcriminated.
In three things eſpecially his want of ingenuity is moſt
obvious, and his not diſtinguiſhing moſt advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to him. For, firſt, He puts no difference betwixt
that latitude of power which is due to a juſt juſt
in juſt things, and when he purſues the true intereſt
of his people; and that power which conſiſts in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrong. And yet nothing is more notorious then
this, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have vaſt Prerogatives
in doing good, but none at all to do any man, much
leſſe the whole State, harme. Secondly, He diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
not betwixt thoſe actions of the Subject which
are done in times of neceſſity, and upon extraordinary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114241:3"/>
extremities; and thoſe which are done in ordinary
times, when there is no ſpeciall emergent cauſe to
inforce them. Thirdly, He compares not the ſmaller
matters of the Law with the weightier, but attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to both alike; nay, when both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conſiſt
or take place at the ſame time, he makes the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
Law give way to that which is of leſſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and may be reckoned, <hi>inter apices juris.</hi> The
Law will admit of a private miſchiefe rather then a
publike inconvenience; as nature will ſuffer this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
quantity of water contrary to its owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penfity
to be violented and rapt upwards, rather
then that any vacuity ſhould be in the univerſe.
But <hi>M. J.</hi> ſometimes will indure publike miſchiefe,
rather then private inconveniences; he will rather
allow that <hi>Salus Populi</hi> ſhall be oppoſed, then ſuch or
ſuch a branch of Prerogative, or the propriety of the
Subject ſhould be ſtrained. Law is not ſo dull a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as ſome men would have it, nor are its bounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to the ordinary actions and pleas of <hi>J. a Nokes</hi>
and <hi>J. a Stiles,</hi> about a carve of ground, &amp;c. no; the
profeſſion is farre more noble, and as its <hi>baſis,</hi> is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
improved with Logick, ſo its <hi>pyramis</hi> is policy
crowned with Hiſtory and Philoſophy. That Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
therefore that will argue upon this high ſubject,
which <hi>M. J.</hi> now undertakes, ought to roote himſelf
deeper, before he begins to build up his argument,
and to take notice of theſe premiſſes:</p>
            <p>1. That all men who are qualified, and exalted to
beare rule in a ſpheare above other men, are ſo dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
and differenced by ſome Commiſſion; which
Commiſſion muſt be granted by man immediately,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114241:3"/>
or elſe by God extraordinarily, and immediately.</p>
            <p>2. That in this age (which knowes of no Oracles,
or miracles remaining) God does not immediately,
and otherwiſe then by the ſame providence (as rules
in other humane affaires) either deſigne the perſons,
or diſtinguiſh the Prerogative of any Kings or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.
God is not ſaid more properly to promote to
the Crowne of <hi>England Edward</hi> the fourth, then <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the ſixth; nor to make a King of <hi>France</hi> more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitable
then a King of <hi>England:</hi> Theſe things are
left to men, the ſame providence of God attending
them, as attends other matters. Yea, the Scripture
is moſt cleare in this, that when God by immediate
and extraordinary orders from heaven did interpoſe
in deſigning <hi>Saul</hi> to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet he did
it by lottery, and did it ſo, that <hi>Saul</hi> might be ſaid
elected, and conſtituted by the people, as well as
deſigned by God. And indeed ſince all Princes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hereditary, or elective, whether more abſolute,
or more conditionate, whether inthroned by juſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or by tortion, and meere force, have Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
equally from Heaven: How can we thinke that
Heaven acts immediately alike in all? ſince <hi>Cyrus</hi> is
as well Gods anoynted in thoſe Provinces which he
wins by the ſword, as in thoſe which come to him by
deſcent; and the French King is as truly Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent
now in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Charles</hi> (whom he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
upon) is in <hi>England;</hi> and ſince the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> by ſpeciall Law of Heaven, can claime no lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſupremacy in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> then in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi>
then in <hi>Arragon;</hi> what an unreaſonable thing is it, to
aſcribe all theſe devolutions of rule, and variations
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114241:4"/>
of power to the immediate hand of God, which
changes not, rather then to the acts of men, which
are ſeldome permanent?</p>
            <p>3. That if we will ſuppoſe that Princes Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are all immediately drawne and ſigned by God,
yet we cannot ſuppoſe that Gods Commiſſion ever
inabled any man to do injury; his charge to all Kings
is contrary, and does inhibite all inſolence in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
nay even all elation of heart. And for man,
(ſo far as Princes are inaugurated upon earth) we ſee
by experience they all almoſt have their viſible Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Boundaries ſet to them; and it were moſt
unnaturall if the intendment of all humane Lawes
ſhould not referre to the ſafety of the people.</p>
            <p>4. That if any obſcurity or ambiguity be in other
Lawes, yet in the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> there is none
at all. All our Books proclaime our Nation to be a
free Nation, and our Kings to be limited from doing
any wrong. And becauſe there may be diſpute about
the interpretation of theſe generalls, therefore parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
are deduced out of them, and our Lawes do
not onely declare us free, but wherein our freedome
conſiſts; nor do they binde the King from wrong
but ſpecifie withall, what is wrong to the Subject. If
the King arbitrarily change our Lawes, raiſe Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
impoſe Taxes, impriſon our bodies, deny, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
or ſell juſtice to us; this is declared to be wrong,
and inconſiſtant with our freedome. And if any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
ariſe about our Charters, the King himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
interpret, or ſit as Judge, he is in all caſes taken
to be a party, and ſo incompetent to ſit as Judge.
His ſworne Judges are to do right betwixt him and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114241:4"/>
the Subject out of Parliament, and the two Eſtates
are to do right above the Judges, if need be, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
And in caſe of any perplexity or doubt, the
liberty and ſafety of the people is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prerogative of the King; and all interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
muſt rather favour that intereſt which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
then that which is particular. And for the
Military power of <hi>England,</hi> as the King ought not
to uſe any other then the naturall Liege people of
<hi>England</hi> in his Warres; ſo neither can he preſſe the
people of <hi>England</hi> to ſerve in his Warres at diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If the Warre be forraigne, or againſt a forraigne
power, the Parliament ought to be conſulted in it;
but if force be to be uſed againſt Subiects, that force
is to be meerely ſub-ſervient to Law, and whether it
be to execute ordinary Judgements, or to ſuppreſſe
Riots, or Inſurrections (how dangerous or great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
the Sheriffe, and other ordinary Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ought to be imployed in the buſineſſe, and thoſe
which are ſo imployed are to be directed ſolely by
the Judges and Courts of the Land in ſpeeding Law,
and not at all by any extrajudiciall command of the
King in oppoſition to Law: If theſe things were not
ſo, the King of <hi>England</hi> could not be reſtrained from
doing wrong, our Kings would be above all Law, and
the Law could have no power above them, and if
our Kings were above Lawes, and not reſtraineable
thereby from doing wrong, the people of <hi>England</hi>
were not a free people, but as remedileſſe Slaves, as
the Grand Signiors Vaſſells are. Our Lawes provide
againſt ſervitude in us, but that were vaine if they
did not provide alſo for efficacy in themſelves, in ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114241:5"/>
much as Lawes, if the King were above them, and ſo
might alter them at pleaſure, or interpret them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne ſence, or could execute, or not
execute at diſcretion by being ſole Maſter of the
ſword, would be no better then Cobwebs to us.</p>
            <p>By the light which reflects from theſe fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls
premiſed, we ſhall now the better view and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that which Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> replyes to the eight par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of <hi>H. P.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt particular the queſtion is, Whether the
Houſe of Commons have power to examine a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent
or no, Mr <hi>Ienkins</hi> holds the negative upon
this ground, that they have neither the Kings Writ,
Patent, nor Commiſſion for it. It was anſwered,
That they did both ſit and act by the Kings Writ, and
ſomething greater then the Kings Writ. Mr <hi>Ienkins</hi>
not being able to deny that the Parliament was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
by the Kings Writ, and that it is continued
ſtill by an Act paſſed fince, onely quarrells at the Act
of continuance, pretending that the Act by which
this Parliament is continued agrees not with the Act
paſſed lately for a Trienniall Parliament, nor with
that for an Annuall Parliament, paſſed in <hi>Edw.</hi> the
thirds time, as alſo that it is miſchievous, otherwiſe
by Protections, Priviledges, &amp;c. Is not this to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
with the King and both Houſes? Is not this to
tell us that Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> is wiſer then all the three
Eſtates, though joyned together? The King, the
Lords, and Commons judged that this Act did agree
with the other two, yet Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> judges contrary.
The King, the Lords, and Commons judged the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of this Act to be greater then any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114241:5"/>
Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> is of another minde. Our Bookes
have a Rule, That no man ought to be wiſer then
Law; Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> exempts himſelfe out of this Rule;
but in the next place, whatſoever the three Eſtates
may doe, yet Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> tells us, that the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
make no Court, nor Body Corporate, nor Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without the King, no more then a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
a man without a head; Here is the miſtake,
Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> thinkes the King is a head to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> or <hi>phiſicè,</hi> whereas he is ſo but <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
quid,</hi> or <hi>metaphorisè,</hi> for if he were ſuch a
head to the Politick Body, as the true head is to the
naturall Body, the body could have no ſubſiſtence
without him; but experience in our caſe teaches us
the contrary, and we can eaſily calculate that if the
whole Royall Line ſhould be ſpent, and the Crowne
Eſcheat ſitting a Parliament, the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
would remaine a living Parliament, and be the
ſupreame power of the Kingdome without a King:
Alſo if this ſhould happen out of Parliament, the
Lords joyning with the choſen repreſentants of the
whole Kingdome would be equally as competent (if
not more) for all Acts of Majeſty, and ſupreame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
as now they are in Parliament. Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi>
muſt needs alſo know, that there are ſome Acts of
Parliament yet of force in this Land, which by the
Lords and Commons were carried and conſumnated,
not onely without but even againſt the King; but I
forbeare to draw Cenſure upon my ſelfe by citing
them; and whereas it was objected, That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was in a meaner condition then other inferiour
Courts, if the Kings meere diſcretion could ſo make
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114241:6"/>
their deliberations voyd and vaine. Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes,
That this is moſt true and juſt, for as much as
in other Courts the King can neither judge nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole;
but in the Court of Parliament <hi>(quoad Acts)</hi>
the King is both Judge and Controller. And why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the King judge and controle in the ordinary
Courts? becauſe there they have the Kings power
committed to them by Patent, and as they are ſworn
to doe right, ſo the King is ſworne not to interrupt
or fruſtrate them. Thus:</p>
            <p>1 We ſee the Kings Patent to a few men is more
vigorous, then the moſt honourable Writ of the Law
is when it is directed from the King to all the Peeres,
and Commons of the Land abetted beſides with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Statutes.</p>
            <p>2 We ſee an Oath taken from the Judges is of
more valew then the faith and loyalty of the whole
people.</p>
            <p>3 We ſee the King by his Coronation Oath is
ſtronglier obliged not to obſtruct Juſtice in private
caſes; depending before lower Courts, then the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ſafety and welfare of the people in that Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hault
Counſell, which is ſo honourable that none
ought to thinke ignobly of it.</p>
            <p>4 We muſt grant, that Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> can better tell
what the Law is in this point then both Houſes.</p>
            <p>5 Whereas an Argument <hi>Ab inconvenienti</hi> was
valid in Law before, now an Argument drawne from
the ſafety and liberty of the whole State, and from
the end of all Law is made rediculous by Mr. <hi>Ienkins;</hi>
for he which grants we are borne to liberty and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as our right, yet grants no meanes to attaine to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114241:6"/>
that right, nor remedy to recover it, except the
Kings Grace, and even then the Grand Seigniours Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
have their Maſters grace and diſcretion to depend
upon as well as we.</p>
            <p>Thus is our ſtate like a goodly Ship, exquiſitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
ſtrongly man'd, and abundantly riggd with all
kinde of Tackling; and ſo built for agility in faire
weather, that nothing in that reſpect can be added
to her perfection; yet ſtill ſhe is ſo moulded by theſe
kinde of Royaliſts, that the leaſt foule weather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets
her. We have excellent Lawes to ſecure our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
againſt the Crowne; we have excellent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
in Parliaments to ſecure our Lawes againſt
the Judges, and other Miniſters of the Crowne; and
yet nevertheleſſe the Parliament it ſelf is ſo diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuable,
diſſolvable, and controllable by the Crown,
that our all which depends upon it, has nothing in
the laſt place, to make it ſelf good to us, but the
favour of the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Thus may our Lawes and Priviledges, in which
there is acknowledged to be a directive, but no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
force over the King, be compared to an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Mathematicall Line in the heavens, but not to
any fence or circumvallation upon the earth: Well
may they informe the King what we ought to injoy,
as the Lawes of God and nature without them do
to all other Nations; But they can never aſſure us
what we ſhall enjoy. And therefore I wonder why
the Royaliſts ſhould ſo much extoll the rare Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of this Kingdom, when beſides ſome other
flowers of the Crowne, they aſcribe to the King ſuch
a negative voyce in Parliament, as is ſufficient alone
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114241:7"/>
to deſtroy all that is granted us in all things elſe.
But to returne to our Reply.</p>
            <p>'Tis maintained next, that whatſoever power is
in both Houſes, yet there is no power in the Houſe
of Commons to examine at all, becauſe the Houſe
of Commons cannot adminiſter an Oath; and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
without Oath is a meere communication,
and rejected as unprofitable in Law.</p>
            <p>One reaſon why the Houſe of Commons cannot
examine upon Oath, is becauſe it is no Court; and
it appeares to be no Court, becauſe it has no power
of tryall, nor ever practiſed any ſuch power, by Bill,
Indictment, Information, Plaints, or Originall. And
for the Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> Relation, that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
have impoſed Fines, and impriſoned men in
Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and ſince; He ſaies theſe
are but late, and a few matters of fact, and <hi>à facto ad
jus</hi> is no good argument. Here we ſee though the
greateſt plea againſt the Houſe of Commons is the
non-uſer of any ſuch power, yet when the non-uſer is
proved, then 'tis objected, That it is but of late
times, and illuſtrated but by a few preſidents.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon againſt the Houſe of Commons
being a Court, is becauſe it has neither the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
nor any Statute nor common uſuage to make
it ſo. The Houſe of Lords is acknowledged to be
a Court of Record to many purpoſes, partly becauſe
the King ſits there, and partly becauſe there is cleere
Law for their Priviledges; but the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
is excepted againſt (as not within theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.)
The truth is, both Houſes are but one Court,
and one Councell, and the time has been when they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114241:7"/>
have both ſate in one place together; and there
may be good reaſon given why they may ſit ſeverall
and have their priviledges kept diſtinct; and why
the Lords ſhould be more active in ſome matters
of judgement, where the whole Commonalties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
is not touched: But this is no proofe, That
what the Lords act by themſelves, receives no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the Houſe of Commons; Or that the Houſe
of Peeres is of more value in the eye of the Law,
or has any greater juriſdiction by the Law, then
the Repreſentative Body of the whole State. As
for the Kings ſitting in the Houſe of Lords, there is
but little moment in that, in regard that he ſits not
there to judge, or to debate, but onely to propoſe
and conſent. And there is no Law to debarre him from
the like in the Commons Houſe; and ſo it was when
both Houſes ſate together, and ſtill is when they
meet together. And ſecondly, whereas ſome Patent,
Statute, or Uſage, is demanded from the Houſe of
Commons, in maintenance of their judiciall power,
This we ſay is unreaſonable: Nay, if any Patent,
Statute, or Uſage, could be produced for preferrence
of the Peerage before all the Knights, Gentlemen,
and Commons of <hi>England</hi> in this point; that were
rather to be rejected, as moſt unjuſt and unnaturall.
A third reaſon is brought againſt the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
out of the Writ of Summons, foraſmuch as in
that Writ, the King reſolves, conſults, and treats with
his Peeres, <hi>ſuper ardua regni,</hi> but the Commons are
called <hi>ad faciendum &amp; conſentiendum in iis quae ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
de communi concilio ordinari contigerint.</hi> Theſe
words of the Writ, though they are generall, and in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114241:8"/>
ſome things ambigious, yet they are no more diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to the Commons, then to the Lords or
King. But if words are to be interpreted by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of Parliaments, and by the tenour of all our other
Lawes, we ſhall finde that the Kings part is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and conſent, but not to debate; that the Lords
part is to propoſe, debate, and conſent in ſome things,
but not in all: that the Commons part is to propoſe
debate, and conſent in all. And this appeares by the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Treaſure, the grand concernment of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
called juſtly, <hi>Ornamentum pacis &amp; firmamentum
belli</hi> and in this, though the King and Lords may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
&amp; conſent, yet none but the Commons may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
debate, and conſent. From reaſoning Mr <hi>Jenkins</hi>
now betakes himſelf to rayling, and tells both Lords
and Commons, that whatſoever their Writ meant,
they act now quite contrary; for by their Writ they
were required to treat and conſult with the King,
concerning the King, the defence of the Kingdome,
and the Church; whereas they firſt impriſon the King,
next arme the Kingdome for themſelves againſt the
King, and laſtly demoliſh the Church by aboliſhing
Biſhops, Deanes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, the King left them unconſtrained, and
deſerted <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whether they were ſummoned
to attend him, and after tooke Armes to diſſolve
them; but thoſe Armes being now broken, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
keepes him from raiſing new broyles, but
ſo farre are they from refuſing to treat with him, that
they prepare Propoſitions for him, and reject no
meſſages or Letters that come from him; neither is
the Kings reſtraint properly to be called impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114241:8"/>
being much different therefrom, both for the
manner and for the end of it; the manner of it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous,
and accompanied with many accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which thouſands of other Free-men, nay
Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> cannot attaine too; and for
his Attendants, they are truly his Servants, and as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant
in all Offices compatible with the peace of the
Kingdome as ever he had any. The end of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
alſo is not to incommodate him in any degree,
there is nothing aymed at in it but to preſerve the
Kingdome from new diſturbance, till he appeares
fully reconciled, and to preſerve him from drawing
prejudice upon himſelfe. For the ſecond, ſince 'tis
not for the Kingdoms damage, nor the Kings, that
future Commotions be ſuppreſt; the Lords and
Commons could no way better ſatisfie the intent of
their Summons, then by ſuppreſſing Commotions by
the ſame poſture of defence as they now are in. I
could wiſh alſo, that Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> would underſtand,
that as the Kingdome is called the Kings, ſo the King
is called the Kingdoms; and that propriety which the
Kingdome has in the King, is more tenderly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
then that which the King has in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For the third, that the word Church ſhould
onely be applyed to Church-men, or the word
Church-men to Biſhops, Deanes, &amp;c. is more then
the Law teaches: and if the buſineſſe be ſtuddied
well 'twill not be found a thing impoſſible, as Maſter
<hi>Ienkins</hi> ſuppoſes for the Parliament to aboliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Deanes, &amp;c. and yet to advance Church-men,
or to take away ſome of the exceſſive Grandour of
Church-men without any deſtruction to the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114241:9"/>
2 Thus much of Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> Reply to the firſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
I come now to his ſecond, where he takes it
ill, that in caſes of pardons the King ſhould be
thought to be vertually in the two Houſes, for as
much as that power he ſayes remaines ſolely in the
King, and therefore cannot reſt at all in the two
Houſes.</p>
            <p>That the power of pardoning Delinquents is ſo in
the King ſolely, as that he cannot derive the ſame to
the Parliament as he does his other power is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Mr. <hi>Ienkins,</hi> nor can it be poſſibly proved,
and that the King does not derive the ſame (as he
does his other) is as farre from being proved alſo;
for doubtleſſe in all Acts of Oblivion, the two Houſes
convey an additionall vigor, and ſo make the Acts
more vertuous then the Kings meere Act could doe,
and therefore this new vigour which is conveyed by
the Houſes, if it be not that which is derived from
the King, as Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> Tenets deny, then it flowes
naturally and originally from the two Houſes; and
what can Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> cauſe gaine by this? But ſayes
Mr. <hi>Ienkin,</hi> The King is a Priſoner, and ſo having no
power but what is diveſted by his impriſonment, the
power of the Houſes is uſurped by themſelves, and
not derived by the King. The block which Mr. <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi>
here ſtumbles at is this; He thinkes an impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
King has no power at all, or remaines indeed no
King, but this is not abſolutely true of all Kings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
for as our caſe is, either impriſonment is
ſomething more then that which our King ſuffers, or
elſe impriſonment as to ſome Acts may ſtand with
freedome as to other Acts. I have toucht upon this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114241:9"/>
ſubject already. But let Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> bee as bitter as
he pleaſes in his cenſures and reproaches, 'tis not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the two Houſes that the King ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
from doing any acts of juſtice and piety, 'tis only
from raiſing new Forces, and begetting new concuſſions,
that this new guard deſires to prevent him. Maſter
<hi>Ienkins</hi> next ſayes, that the King may revoke and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his Commiſſions at pleaſure, but what of this?
the queſtion is, whether or no the King may fruſtrate
and elude his Commiſſions; and this Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi>
ſpeakes not directly to. Wee need not quarrell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
further about this, we will grant to Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi>
that Parliaments may be juſtly determined and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by our King, provided he will grant to us that the
ſame may be juſtly fruſtrated or eluded. But Maſter
<hi>Ienkins</hi> ſtomacks much at our calling the two Houſes
a Parliament, and cenſures it in us as a great deluſion,
although we know well that nothing is more common
in ſpeech, then to ſay that the King cals his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
writes to his Parliaments, diſſolves his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp;c. The King muſt be taken abſtracted from
that which he cals, writes to, and diſſolves, or elſe wee
muſt conſider him calling himſelfe, writing to himſelf,
diſſolving himſelfe, which cannot be without abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Beſides, when we ſpeake of the great Councell of
the Kingdome, we meane the Parliament abſtracted
from the King, foraſmuch as the King in Parliament
does not ſo properly give as receive Counſell, and why
we may not aſwell call the two Houſes a Parliament, as
the great Councell, treſhault Court, or mickle-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot
of the King and Kingdome, I cannot deviſe. The
Law ſayes the King cannot be abſent from his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114241:10"/>
this muſt be meant authoritatively, not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
for divers of our Kings have been in <hi>France</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Parliaments here, and yet even they were politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
preſent, though phyſically abſent, as Maſter <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
himſelfe muſt needs grant. Now if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be the Kings Court or Councell, and ſuch a
Court or Councell as he cannot virtually bee abſent
from, though in perſon he be often diſtant, and at ſome
time muſt not be otherwiſe, how can it be maintained
by Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> that the two Houſes are not the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?
Another objection of Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> againſt
the two Houſes is, that they were deſerted by divers
of their own Members, who in conſiderable numbers
went to the King at <hi>Oxford;</hi> but this is no other obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
then might be made againſt the Husband, when
the wife elopes and withdraws from his bed, ſhall that
party which remaines conſtant, and attends duly at the
place aſſigned in the ſummons for tranſacting of that
buſineſſe which was ſpecified in the ſummons, ſuffer for
that parties ſake which proved inconſtant, and neither
obſerved the place nor buſineſſe of the writ by which
it was convened? ſure this is moſt unreaſonable; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
when the King cald theſe uncertaine members
<hi>mungrels,</hi> who together with their whole faction would
neither be cordially true to Religion and Liberty at
<hi>London,</hi> nor totally conſent to ſubvert them at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
hee had more reaſon on his ſide then Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> has,
who diſparages thoſe that kept their ſtations becauſe of
the defection of their <hi>mungrell</hi> brethren. In the laſt
place Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> though he confeſſes that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law did alwayes reſtrain our Kings from all tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
&amp; ſubſidies but by conſent in Parliament, as doth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114241:10"/>
appeare by <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> yet he ſayes this is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
becauſe the King cannot take the ſubjects
good at pleaſure, therefore the Commons have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
power with the King in Parliament; indeed
this conſequence is ill-framed, but in its right forme it
appears thus; if the Commons in Parliament have that
great power to raiſe treaſure out of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which the King has not our of Parliament, then
they muſt deduce this power from themſelves, or thoſe
whom they repreſent, and not from the King, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give that which he has not in himſelfe; but ſo it is
that the Commons have this power, <hi>Ergo.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
will anſwer this hee ſhall befriend my intellect.
The laſt objection which Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> makes againſt
this concurrent power of the Commons in granting
ſubſidies is this, that Parliaments may be held, and be
complete Parliaments without ſubſidies, and hereupon
he tels us that former Parliaments rarely granted any
unleſſe in time of forrain-Warres; and <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
a ſubſidie granted, &amp; <hi>K. Ia.</hi> in his firſt year had
none granted him. Is there any ſolidity in this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
I appeal to all ingenuous men, Parliaments may be
without ſubſidies, <hi>Ergo</hi> the granting of ſubſidies is no
act of power in Parliaments; or thus, giving of ſubſidies
is an Act of power in Parl. but ſince at ſome-time it
may be difuſed and intermitted, or a power that at
ſome-times is not reduced into acts, therefore it is no
power, or not inherent in the people, but onely deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
from the King. Let Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> apply his owne
words to himſelfe here, for certainly hee ought to make
a conſcience of blinding the people with ſuch untrue
colours to the ruine of King and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>3. The third particular now offers it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>n order,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114241:11"/>
and here Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> his reply ought to prove that if
the two Houſes had a Parliamentary power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they needed not ſend Propoſitions to the King,
but inſtead of oppoſing this (which was the only thing
made good by his anſwerer) he diverts his force to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the equity and juſtice of the Propoſitions ſent to
his Majeſty. This is not to reply to his Anſwerer, but
to ſatisfie his owne peeviſh diſpoſition; yet ſince hee
may abuſe the people aſwell when he railes as when he
argues ſomething muſt be returned in anſwer to him.
After he has magiſterially condemn'd the Propoſitions
in general as being contrary to law, he vouchſafes at laſt
thus particularly to interrogate us: Have the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
a ſtrict right to lay upon the people what taxes they
judge meet, have they power to pardon all Treaſons,
&amp;c. <hi>ſubintelligitur</hi> without the Kings conſent? We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
they have not any ſuch ordinary power; but if the
Kingdomes ſafety lye upon it, and the King will not
concurre in ſaving the Kingdome in an ordinary way,
they may have recourſe to extraordinary meanes for
the ſaving of it ordinarily the people may not take up
Armes, but in caſe of extraordinary invaſion by forrain
or domeſtick force they may juſtifie taking up of
Arms, and when War it ſelfe is juſtifiable, all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
concomitants and expedients of a politick war
are juſtifiable. Nature has confined water to a deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
courſe, yet not by ſuch a rigid Law, but that for
the neceſſary ſubvention of the whole Fabrick, and for
the avoiding of that vacuity which Nature more abhors
then the diſpenſation, or temporary ſuſpenſion of ſuch,
or ſuch a particular inferiour Law, this ponderous ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may forſake its ordinary courſe, and mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114241:11"/>
In a Village where houſes ſtand ſcatter'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
'tis not lawfull for me to demoliſh this houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that which ſtands next it is all of a flame, but in a
Citie this is lawfull where the houſes are ſo conjoyned,
that the flame of one houſe may extend it ſelfe to the
conſuming or indangering of a whole ſtreet or more.
It is not generally lawfull for me to judge my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
unheard, or to execute my neighbour unjudged:
Yet if I find my neighbour ingaged in ſuch a Treaſon
as <hi>Faulx</hi> was, and ready with his Match to give fire to
ſuch a Traine of Powder as he had layd, and have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes to prevent him, I may runne upon him
with my Sword, and make my ſelfe both his Judge and
Executioner. Now if Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> will ſay, that ſuch
extraordinary acts as theſe are warranted by Law, I ſhall
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ply with him, yet I conceive tis not upon any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Law, but upon the generall law of publick ſafetie
that theſe warrants are grounded upon; &amp; if I am not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
tis rather policy, then Law, that admits of ſuch
ſtrange deviations from the common practice and rule
of Law. But ſayes Maſter <hi>Ienkins,</hi> theſe propoſitions
cannot paſſe into Statutes but by the Kings concurrence,
and has not the King a free power to aſſent, or diſſent in
thoſe things which muſt receive their being from his
concurrence? Or is the ſeeking of the Kings concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
nothing but a meer Complement? We anſwer,
The King has a power to aſſent and diſſent: yet without
any impeachment of his libertie, he may, nay he muſt,
aſſent to ſuch Bills as are for the publicke good, and to
diſſent from ſuch as are tending to the publicke detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the reaſon is, becauſe the free choice of the
King is to receive its determination from without from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114241:12"/>
the matter of the Bills, not from within, or from the
propenſion of his owne will: for the will injoyes a
more perfect libertie when it is attracted, and as it were
neceſſitated by that object which is good, then when it
is left to its owne equilibrious motions, and ſo wavers
indifferently betwixt good and evill. If it be ſaid, that
in the choice of that which is good, the King cannot ſo
well ſatisfie his own judgement by the adviſe or reaſon
of other men, as by that which is dictated to him by
his owne breaſt: It muſt be anſwered, firſt, in the grand
concernments of the Kingdome, wherein the King has
not ſo great a ſhare as the people has, tis more juſt that
the reaſon of two Eſtates be ſatisfied, then his. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in caſes where the King is ſeverally intereſſed, his
particular intereſts ought to ſuccumbe and give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the generall. Thirdly, either the matter in
debate is intricate, and admits of doubts, or not; If
there be doubt in it, then the King ought not to oppoſe
his ſingle judgement, or rather opinion to the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Higheſt Court and Councell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
If there be no doubt in it, (an accident ſure
very rare, that the Lords and Repreſentants of a whole
State ſhould judge a thing to be advantagious, when the
King knowes it certainly to be diſadvantagious) then
the King is to conſider whither the matter in queſtion
be neceſſary or expedient, if it be expedient onely,
then the King ought not to conteſt about it, foraſmuch
as that conteſtation may be more inexpedient for the
State then his conceſſion. But if it be neceſſary (as the
cauſe of true Religion, &amp;c.) where the King being Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
knowes his Subjects to be blinded with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
or Hereſie, and cannot without ſin give his Royall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114241:12"/>
aſſent to ſuch irreligious Bills, as they preſent; then as
it were impious in him to ſigne them, ſo it is outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in him to diſturbe the publicke peace about them.
The reaſon of this is, becauſe Polititians guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
rather by the calculation of what is probable
then what is poſſible onely, and therefore though it be
poſſible that a King with one eye ſhould ſee more then a
Parliament with many, yet ſince this is not probable,
there is ſcarce any State but chuſes rather to be ſwayd
by the counſells of many then by the counſell of one,
and where the counſell of one claimes a prevalence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the counſells of many, 'tis not obey'd without
great reluctance commonly, and publicke diſturbance.
Beſides, if one mans eyes perchance ſee more then the
eyes of many (as is very rare, though not impoſſible)
yet tis very ſtrange that that one mans diſcovery ſhould
not open the eyes of other ſtanders by without force,
in reſpect that light is a thing lovely to all, and ready to
be imbraced upon the leaſt glimpſe of it, and a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thereof being let in through a narrow cranny, may
make all that is contained in a very wide roome viſible.
And if one man poſſibly in things indifferent ſhould ſee
more then many, yet tis very neere to an impoſſibilitie,
that one man ſhould apprehend truth more then many,
where that one man has more prejudice againſt the
truth by ſelfe-intereſts, then the many. And who can
doubt, but that Princes, as Princes, are more drawne
by the by as of ſelfe-intereſts againſt that which is the
good of the communitie, then that Court which is not
onely by the vertue of repreſentation, but even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
alſo in ſome degree the communitie it ſelfe? The
root ſends juice and nouriſhment to the branches, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114241:13"/>
expects none backe from them; and the fathers love
has a ſtrong aſcent towards the fruit of his body, but
weake and virtuleſſe is the deſcent of that juice which
falls from the branches to the root, or of that love which
the ſonne refunds upon his progenitors; and even ſo it
is in the relative Offices of Prince and Subject, the
Prince lookes leſſe tenderly upon the people as being
his root or parent, whilſt yet the people lookes more
tenderly upon the Prince, as its owne ſtemme and iſſue.
Hence it is, that all States are accounted more or leſſe
ſlaviſh, as their Princes are more or leſſe arbitrary in
their ſupreme counſells; and all men are accounted
more or leſſe miſerable, as they are more or leſſe ſlaviſh.
What became of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the whole world that was
ſubject to <hi>Rome,</hi> after it was once yoked by the <hi>Caeſars,</hi>
who might arbitrarily wave the advice of the Senate, &amp;
conſult with Slaves, Eunuchs, Women, Panders, &amp;c.
or what brought us to all our late bloody cataſtrophes,
but the diſcountenance and deteſtation of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Aske the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> himſelfe, and even his
Speeches made in Parliament ſince <hi>November</hi> 1640.
will informe us, that there were many cauſes of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
but the cauſe of all thoſe cauſes was the abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and diſguſting of Parliaments: Sure the Lord
<hi>Digby</hi> may paſſe as an Authentick teſtimony for our
ſide, and yet even the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> before he turn'd
Courtier, had the ingenuitie to reſent this Kingdomes
ſervilitie, when a woman of a falſe religion, hoſtile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and adverſe affection, together with her Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
traine, had more predominance in our publicke
affaires then the two Eſtates aſſembled in Parliament.
But Maſter <hi>Ienkins</hi> will ſtill ſay, that the King is aſſiſted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114241:13"/>
with his Judges, and other Counſell both Spirituall and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
and that the Houſe of Commons in ſome debates may
be divided unto two or three oddes voyces; and therefore why
may not the King ſo aſſiſted be better adviſed then thoſe two or
three oddes voyces? This is an old objection, and ſeemes plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
but is eaſily anſwered: For 1. It is very unequall that a
few Counſellours whom the King chuſes ſhould be preferr'd
before many whom the Kingdom chuſes, in thoſe matters which
import the Kingdome, more then the King. 2. If the Kings
Councell in the Houſe of Peers were equally to be valued with
the Houſe of Commons, yet ſtill ſo long as it is left arbitrary
to the King to follow their advice, or not, the Kingdome is in
the condition as <hi>Turky</hi> is, where the Grand Signior is left onely
to conſult with himſelfe or any of his Concubines or Eunuchs.
And laſtly, there can be no lower or baſer degree of ſlavery ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
then for a Nation to be ſubjected to a Lord that is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
in the higheſt reſults of State, as that he may uſe no
Counſell, or make choyce of what Counſell he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>4. I haſt now to the fourth particular, where M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
againe, that the two Houſes do ſeparate the Kings power
from his Perſon as the <hi>Spencers</hi> did, and from thence frame the
ſame three condemned concluſions as they did. The ſeparation
of his Perſon from his power is proved, partly by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Perſon, and partly by uſurping all his power; for
M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> tells us, that the two Houſes counterfeit a Seale of
their owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereby ſeal Writs, make Judges, ſettle Courts,
and this is done contrary to the Kings conſent, not declared on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Letters, Miniſters, and word of mouth, but by his true
great Seale of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is here, 1. To be noted, that M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> himſelfe does now
diſtinguiſh betwixt that which the King declares by word of
mouth perſonally; And by Letters and Miniſters extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially;
and that which he declares legally by his Writs, and
judicially by the great Seale: and this is a plaine conceſſion,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114241:14"/>
that the Kings Perſon may urge one thing, and his Office ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that his perſonall command may be unjuſt and not to be
obeyed, at the ſame time that his regall command may be juſt,
and neceſſarily muſt exact obedience. It is to be noted 2. That
the reaſon alledged, why the Kings commands in this warre are
legall and juſt, not perſonall and unjuſt, is, becauſe they were
authoriz'd and fortified with the true great Seale: and what is
this but to proclaime, 1. That the great Seale of <hi>England</hi> is
ſolely at the Kings diſpoſe, to be imployed according to his
meere diſcretion: 2. That the meer annexion of the great Seal
makes any Act of the Kings legall and authenticall: 3. That
M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> is better able to judge of the two great Seales which
is the true one, then the two Houſes of Parliament? When
M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> will be as learned in proving, as he is audacious in
preſuming, theſe new quaint poynts, we ſhall know what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
In the meane time we will expatiate no further then his
diſcourſe leades us. As for impriſoment of the Kings Perſon,
we have anſwer'd to that already, and foraſmuch as the keeping
Chaplaines from him is objected, we anſwer thereunto, that
not Chaplaines, but ſuch and ſuch Chaplaines, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as the
State judges Incendiaries, are deny'd, and there is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
in reſtraining ſuch Incendiaries then in reſtraining
Commanders and Armes. Now to parallell the Houſes with
the <hi>Spencers,</hi> M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> ſayes, that they having declared his
Majeſtie to have broken his truſt touching the government of
his people, they have rayſed Armes to take him, they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and impriſon'd him, they governe themſelves, they make
Lawes, impoſe Taxes, make Judges, Sheriffs, and take upon
them <hi>Omnia inſignia Majeſtatis;</hi> and is not this ſayes, he to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the King for miſdemeanours, to reforme <hi>per aſpertee,</hi> to
governe in aide of him, the three concluſions of the <hi>Spencers?</hi>
M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> here, as if he had abjured all ingenuitie, confounds
diverſe things which he knowes to be exceeding different in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For 1. He takes no notice whether the force which has
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114241:14"/>
bin uſed by the Parliament be offenſive, or defenſive; and yet
none can be ignorant, how many things may be juſtified in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
which cannot by the offendant. 2. He diſtinguiſhes not
betwixt that force of the defendant, which aimes only at a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
ſecurance againſt the Aſſaylant, &amp; that which propoſes
to it ſelf vindication or reparation by the total removall, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Aſſaylant. He knows well, that the <hi>Spencers</hi> aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at a totall dethronization of their Maſter, whilſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
aimes at nothing but beating down that Sword which was
drawn againſt them. 2. That the <hi>Spencers</hi> intended to levy offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Arms, for reforming that in their Maſter <hi>per aſpertee,</hi> which
was not ſo dangerous to their perſons and lives, as that which
has bin contrived and enterpriſed againſt this Parliament, for
not onely a partie of 300 Armed men to ſeize and teare five
principall Members out of the Houſe, (and by conſequence
to menace all that retained any freedome in them) but Armies
were ſolicited to attempt againſt this Parliament before they
thought of any force; and this is far above thoſe provocations
which were pretended by the two <hi>Spencers.</hi> 3. The <hi>Spencers,</hi> by
pretext of governing in aide of the King, intended to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
all the Nobility, Gentry, Communaltie of the Land,
but this is impoſſible to be ſuſpected in a Parliament, which
conſiſts of the choice, and are a conſiderable part of all
theſe.</p>
            <p>5. The 5. particular now offers it ſelfe, wherein Mr. <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
maintaines that every King of <hi>England,</hi> and only the King
in <hi>England</hi> can grant pardons, and that in all caſes, and for
this he cites <hi>Stanfords</hi> pleas 99. It was not, nor is denied to M.
<hi>Ienkins</hi> that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have power to pardon delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies,
ſo farre as themſelves are parties ſuffering. But the
queſtion is whether the Kings of <hi>England</hi> onely can, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
can pardon delinquencies; and whatſoever Maſter <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
thinkes, the authorities of <hi>Stanford</hi> and <hi>Dier</hi> are not full to
prove the affirmative; and certainly if it were <hi>proprium quarto
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114241:15"/>
modo</hi> for the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to pardon in all caſes, it were
very unproper for generall acts of indemnity to be paſſed by all
three eſtates, <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora;</hi> if
one of the eſtates be ſufficient; to what purpoſe doe the other
2 concurre? Secondly, all remedy by appeale would be cut off
from ſubjects. For either my appeale muſt make void the Kings
pardon, or if the Kings pardon be not void in this caſe, and as
to this murder committed, my appeale muſt be diſmiſſed. It
had been candid in Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> if he would have replied ſome
thing to this objection about appeales, for now it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
he replied nothing therein, becauſe he could reply no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe; beſides, if the Kings pardon cannot fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat
my appeale (as Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> knowes well it cannot) why
ſhould the ſame deſtroy the remedy and juſtice that is due to a
whole ſtate? Treaſon may be committed againſt the State aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as againſt the King, even as murder may damnifie me
aſwell as the King, and ſhall it be held leſſe contrary to juſtice
that the State ſhould be deprived of its remedy by the Kings
pardon, then that I ſhould? Good Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> policy is not to
be ſuperſeded by Law, but Law is to be improved by policie:
and as in quiet times and private caſes 'tis ſafer to follow Law
then Policy, ſo in times of troubles, and in affairs of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and great concernment, 'tis ſafer to obſerve Policy then
Law. The ſame may be ſaid of not pardoning, for doubtleſſe
the King has as much latitude to refuſe, as to grant pardon, yet
when his power in either may be miſchievous, his power in
both muſt ſubmit to reaſon of State, and Law is not violated,
but better improved when true reaſon of State takes place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it.</p>
            <p>6. I am now to proceed to the ſixth particular, where Mr.
<hi>Ienkins</hi> will not indure that the King ſhall be ſaid to retain the
right or habit of governing, at the ſame time when he is ſaid not
to be actually in a condition to govern; he intimates that the
Law makes no ſuch diſtinction, &amp; infers <hi>ubi lex non distinguit,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114241:15"/>
non eſt diſtinguendum:</hi> by this it ſhould ſeem it is not allowable
that a Lawyer ſhould make uſe of any diſtinctions, for which
he has not ſome book authority, though the difference of things
be never ſo pregnant. A miſerable confinement to Lawyers,
and ſure 4 or 500 years paſt if Lawyers had been ſo confined,
wee had now left us no prints of any diſtinctions at all. All
other Schollars beſides Lawyers, nay all Lawyers that are not
meer Lawyers, (I meane by meer Lawyers, ſuch as have made no
improvement of their reaſon by Logick, Policie, and other
humane literature) are of a contrary opinion, and hold it
more true, <hi>qui bene diſtinguit, bene docet.</hi> But what a ridiculous
thing is this, becauſe <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. lying in his cradle not able to
ſpeak, write, read, or do any act of power, has a right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne,
therefore I muſt grant hee is in a condition to govern,
for feare of diſtinguiſhing when the Law does not diſtinguiſh?
ſo of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and <hi>Ri.</hi> 2. becauſe they had a right to the Crown,
in that moment of time when they abdicated the ſame, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
themſelves unfit to governe, therefore I am obliged
to believe that they were not abdicated nor made unfit for
government. Next Mr. <hi>Ienkins</hi> likes not this diſtinction that
the King is not barred ſimply from returning to his Parliament
though he be barred <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> that is from returning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled
or armed againſt his Parliament, hee profeſſes that
he and the whole City knowes the contrary; how the City
ſhould know the Parliaments intentions ſo exquiſitly, or M.
<hi>Ienkins</hi> be aſſur'd of the Cities knowledge ſo infallably I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine; but I wiſh M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> which takes upon him to
be a Prieſt as well as a Lawyer by vertue of <hi>Iustinians</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
were ſuch a Prieſt indeed, as that we might expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but knowledge and truth from his lips.</p>
            <p>7. The ſeventh particular comes now in order, where M.
<hi>Ienkins</hi> puts us in minde of the oath of Supremacy, taken by
all members of the Houſe at their firſt ſitting, and askes <hi>H. P.</hi>
why he ſtiles the King Supreme governour in all all cauſes and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114241:16"/>
over all perſons, &amp;c. and leaves out onely Supreme? ſurely not
to detract any thing from the Kings celſitude, but becauſe the
word ſeemed ſuperfluous; for he that ſwears the King to be
Supreme over all perſons, ſweares him to bee only Supreme
over all perſons, inaſmuch as there cannot be more Supreme
perſons over all then one; but away with theſe frivolous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomachies.
The argument runs thus, If the King be only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
governour in all cauſes, then in Parliament cauſes, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all perſons, then over both Houſes, and if ſo, then how is he
become a priſoner, and how doe the Houſes Act by vertue of
their priſoners writ? It was anſwered before that the King is
granted to be Supreme or only Supreme over all perſons,
but yet ſtill <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not beyond the Law, nor beyond that
community for which and by which the Laws themſelves
were made. The Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> (the like may be ſaid alſo of
all elective conditionate Kings and Potentates) has no perſon
in any cauſe whatſoever ſuperior, or equall to him: yet he has
his bounds ſet him by the Law; and as the Law is above him
whom it bounds, ſo that power which can make, and alter
Law in <hi>Venice,</hi> is above the Law it ſelfe. M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> himſelfe
confeſſes that the King is not above the Law, nor above the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the people; but in regard that the King is Supreme in
all cauſes, aſwell Parliamentary as other, and over all perſons,
aſwell the Lords and Commons in Parliament as others, M.
<hi>Ienkins</hi> ſuppoſes there is no other Judge of the Law, &amp; ſafety of
the people but the K. but this is not to be admitted by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we know wel that whoſoever is the Supreme judge of the
Law, if not directly, yet he is conſequentially above all Laws,
and whoſoever is above all Law cannot bee reſtrained by the
ſafety of the people, though the moſt ſublime of all Laws.
Wherfore if this be admitted true of our King, that he is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judge of Law, then it muſt follow that the Subject of
<hi>England</hi> has no more aſſurance of Law or ſafety then what is
founded onely in the Kings breaſt, and diſcretion. For the Kings
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114241:16"/>
being a priſoner that has been already anſwered, and indeed it
is is more truly ſaid that his hands are held and diſweapond,
then that his feet are fetterd, or his head undiademnd. Then for
the Parliaments acting by the Kings writ, there ought to bee
ſome miſtakes cleered therein alſo; for we doe grant that the
writ is the Kings, the Great Seale is the Kings, that Officer
which has the Cuſtodie thereof is the Kings, the People are
the Kings; but we doe not grant that any of theſe are ſo the
Kings, as that they are not the Kingdomes alſo in a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degree: for as the Husband is the Wifes truly, but not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eminently as the Wife is the Husbands, ſo the Kingdome is
the Kings, and the King is the Kingdomes, yet the Kingdomes
intereſt and relation far is more valuable and ſublime.</p>
            <p>8. The laſt particular now offers it ſelfe in the cloſe of all,
and here M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> does not deny expreſly that many things
may be good in Law notwithſtanding that ſome formalities, or
thoſe things which we terme <hi>apices Iuris</hi> are wanting; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
where 2 Laws are and both cannot be fulfilled, the leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Law though it be more particular muſt give way to
the more important Law, though more generall. <hi>ex. gr.</hi> when
the King dies, by the common Law in force, Parl. ceaſe, all jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Sheriffs &amp; Officers not abſolutely neceſſary &amp;c. return to
a private condition, and ſo remaine till new Commiſſions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
but if the new King happen to be beyond ſea, as at the
death of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. ſo that new Commiſſions cannot be immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
granted, and thereupon the greater Law of publick ſafety is
brought into competition with the Law of an inferiour nature,
a new ſeal may be made, new Judges, new Officers may be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and either a former Parl. may be continued, or a new one
ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mond, and all neceſſary points of complete adminiſtration
may bee expedited as in probality they were before the arrivall
of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. God did not make any particular diſpenſation his
ſhew-bread might be eaten by common perſons if in diſtreſſe,
or the golden veſſells of his Temple aliend when the City was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114241:17"/>
to be redeemed from the inſolence and rapines of a prevailing.
Enemy, the generall Law of neceſſity was ſufficient to warrant
both the one and the other, but I will preſſe this no further
ſince M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> alledges nothing to ſhew why a Parl. which
cannot deliver it ſelfe by an Act, may not uſe meanes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it ſelfe by an Ordinance. I will not inſiſt further hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But inſtead of diſputing, M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> ſeems to jeere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
for ſetting up Exciſe, raiſing Armes, Taxing the people,
impriſoning the King, aboliſhing the Common Prayer Book,
ſelling Church-Lands, &amp;c. and in an irony he concludes,
that all theſe are in order to publick juſtice and ſafetie. M. <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
here leaves us upon uncertainties, whether he condemnes
our Cauſe becauſe it required ſuch props, or onely theſe props
becauſe they aſſiſted us in promoting ſo bad a cauſe. If he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the ends, but not of the meanes, if he allow we may defend
the Lawes and ſafetie of the State, but not by Armes, or if he
allow of Armes but not of Taxes, &amp;c. He muſt renounce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
rule naturall as well as logicall, <hi>Qui dat finem, dat media con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
were not indanger'd, or if he prove that they may not be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he takes upon him more then is due; for his part is to plead,
not to judge, and anſwers might be given to his pleading, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be ſaid to his judging.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore with the L. <hi>Cookes</hi> Senſure of Treaſon as
M. <hi>Ienkins</hi> does, and am of the ſame opinion, that Treaſon ever
produces fatall and finall deſtruction to the offendor, and never
attaines to its deſired ends; and wiſh that all men for this Cauſe
would ſerve God, honour the King, and have no company with
the Seditious. Yet let me adde this, we have neighbours now in
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> that lately have revolted from their Maſter,
and yet proſper and flouriſh beyond all in <hi>Europe;</hi> the juſtice of
their revolt may be queſtioned by ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I for divers reaſons
do not queſtion it, &amp; one amongſt the reſt is this of the L. <hi>Cookes,</hi>
becauſe I think an act meerly treaſonable cannot proſper.</p>
