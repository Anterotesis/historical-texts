            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe gift of Prophecie or Foretelling things to come had beene in the Church since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and now are Miracles added because of unbeliefe: For observe that when <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Behold they will not beleeve,</hi> the Lord immediatly answer, What is that in thine hand? This double facultie being given here to <hi>Moses</hi> the first Prophet of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> it also descended to a succession of Prophets in that Congregation from time to time. But with this excellent gift it was also given <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to know, and so likewise them that did succeed, that they had this double power not from themselves, but from another: <hi>Moses</hi> his stammering tongue taught himselfe and them so much for Prophecie, and his leprous hand taught so much for Miracles. This succession of Prophets began from <hi>Samuel</hi> and ended in the death of <hi>Christ, Acts</hi> 3. 24. Not that there were not Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> but because they were not expressed by name, as also because vision in that space of time was exceeding rare, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>Now from the beginning of the rule of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the captivitie in <hi>Babel,</hi> were foure hundred and ninetie yeares; and from the end of that captivitie to the end of Christs life upon earth, were foure hundred and ninetie yeares more.

beginning of Prophecie in <hi>Samuel</hi> to the sealing of Prophecy in the death of Christ. <hi>Revive thy worke in the midst of the yeares, in the midst of the yeares make knowne.</hi> Then was it justly to be feared that the spirit of Prophecy would quite have ceased from <hi>Israel</hi> when they were captived among the Heathen. This made the Prophet to pray so earnestly, that God would preserve alive, or <hi>revive</hi> his <hi>worke</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> in the middest of yeares, and in those times of captivitie, that he would make knowne things to come by that gift of Prophecy.

            </p>
            <p>The Jewes had an old maxime, <hi>that after the death of Zacharie, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi and those last Prophets, the Spirit of God departed from Israel and went up.</hi> So that from thence forward, prediction of future things and working of miracles were rarities among them.

            <p n="2">2. His leprous hand disclaimed also any power of <hi>Moses</hi> his owne in these wonders which he wrought, for it was not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that so great things should bee done by that impure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane hand, but by a greater.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Both of these Miracles which were the first that were done by any Prophet in the world, did more specially referre to the Miracles of that great Prophet that should come into the world, by whose power these Miracles were done by <hi>Moses</hi> at this time. For as it belonged to him onely to cast out the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill out of the soule, and to heale the soule of the leprosie of sin, so was it reserved for him first, to cast out the Devill out of the body, and to heale the leprosie of the body. For though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets from <hi>Moses</hi> to Christ had the gift of doing Miracles, and performed wonders many of them in an high degree, yet could never any of them or any other cast out a Devill or heale a Leper till the great Prophet came. <hi>Elisha</hi> indeed directed <hi>Naaman</hi> how he should be healed, but he neither touched him nor came out to him at all, that he might shew that it was not his power, but such cures were reserved for Christ to come.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59066:7"/>
and honourable a message as the Lord would send him on, and this was that that brought him into this danger of death, when he was even going on this message. Observe therefore his evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how they sound exceeding hollow and empty of beliefe. First, <hi>Who am I that I should goe to Pharaoh?</hi> cap. 3. 11. This the Lord answereth, I will bee with thee, and this my appearing to thee may bee an undoubted token to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that I have sent thee. <hi>vers.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>But who shall I say hath sent me?</hi> for forty yeares agoe, they refused me, saying, <hi>Who made thee a Prince and a Ruler over us?</hi> cap. 4. 1. This scruple the Lord removeth by giving him the power of miracles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken to me, for though I may worke miracles upon others, yet is not this wrought upon my selfe, that I speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit better then I did before. This receiveth this answer, <hi>I will be with thy mouth,</hi> vers. 10. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>But I pray thee send by that hand that thou wilt send or stretch out,</hi> vers. 13. for thou saydest to me, <hi>I will stretch out mine hand,</hi> and smite Aegypt, <hi>&amp;c. Chap.</hi> 3. 20. Now therefore I pray thee stretch out this hand of thine, for the hand of man is not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. At this the Lords anger was kindled against him, and that deservedly. For in this he denyed the mystery of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was to be wrought by a man, the God-head going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng with him.</p>
            <p>Now it is time for <hi>Moses</hi> to set for <hi>Aegypt</hi> when he seeth God angry at his excusing: he doth so, but he taketh his diffidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, in that he taketh his wife and children with him. One would thinke that had beene a speciall piece of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but it being looked into, will prove a speciall piece of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust.</p>
            <p>For when God appeareth to him, at the very first, he giveth him assurance of the peoples delivery, and that they should come in their journeyes to that very place, <hi>When thou hast brought the people forth out of Aegypt ye shall serve God upon this mountaine.</hi> Chap. 3. 12.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Moses</hi> had believed certainely this promise, and that undoubtedly he and the people should come thither, he would never have taken wife and children with him to trouble them and himselfe in so long a journey, and in so earnest a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59066:8"/>
but would have left them still with <hi>Jethro,</hi> till he and <hi>Israel</hi> should march up to them. But this he feared, that this his journey would be to no effect, that <hi>Israel</hi> would accept of none, &amp; therfore should obtaine no delivery, that this message would produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unlesse danger to himselfe, and that while he spake of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering others, he might incurre bondage himselfe, so that if he left wife and children behind him, it was odds he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see them againe. And therefore to make sure worke he will take them with him, and for this his distrust the Lord meets him, and seekes to kill him.</p>
            <p>Nor was this distrust and diffidence little or small in him, but if the circumstances be considered, it will appeare to be very great, and his want of faith exceeding much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zipporah</hi> his wife was now lying in Childbed, a weake woman but lately delivered, and therefore farre unfit for so long a journey, and the new-borne childe as unfit, if not unfitter then she: and yet Mother and child in this weake case, must travell to the hazzard of both their lives, for he durst not leave them behind him for feare he and they should never meete againe: For this it is that <hi>Zipporah</hi> twice calleth him a bloudy husband: before the childs circumcision, and after: before, because he had hazzarded both their lives in bringing them forth, both of them being in their blouth and blood: and after, because she through him was put to Circumcise the childe, which bloodinesse a tender mother must needes abhorre: and for this also is the word <hi>circumcisions</hi> in the plurall number, <hi>vers.</hi> 26. <hi>A bloody husband,</hi> Lemuloth, <hi>because of the circumcisions.</hi>

            <p>THat <hi>Zipporah</hi> was so lately delivered of childe, is plaine by observing these things.</p>
            <p>First, that <hi>Jethro</hi> her Father was circumcised both he and his houshold, for he was a <hi>Midianite,</hi> a Sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>rah,</hi> and all <hi>Abrahams</hi> children after the flesh were circumcised, and that not by usurpation or unwarrantable imitation, but by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59066:8"/>
the bond and tye of the institution: therefore though <hi>Moses</hi> had beene absent never so long, or never so farre off, yet would <hi>Jethro</hi> have taken care of the childs circumcision on the eight day: but now the childe may not stay, till hee bee eight dayes old, &amp; whole againe upon his circumcision, but must travell young and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised as he is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, observe the childs name, which was usually given at Circumcision, and if the child were older then we speake of, then had he beene so long without a name, or had had another name then <hi>Eliezer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, he called his name <hi>Eliezer, for the God of my fathers, said he, hath beene mine helpe and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh,</hi> Chap. 18. 4. Now <hi>Moses</hi> was not secure of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> sword, till just at his setting for <hi>Egypt.</hi> For after he came from <hi>Horeb</hi> into <hi>Midian</hi> againe, the Lord tells him that all those are dead which sought his life, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. This doth aggravate his diffidence the more. Who though he had seene such wonders at <hi>Horeb,</hi> and heard of other wonders done for him by God in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in cutting off his enemies there, yet durst he not trust the promise of God, for his returning to his wife and children, but will take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him.

            <p>The name <hi>Jehovah</hi> signifieth three things,</p>
            <p>First, Gods eternall being in himselfe, without dependence or mixture, upon, or with any other thing. For his being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, it is rendred, <hi>the first, and the last; and which is, and which was, and which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his being without mixture, or composition, it is said here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Not, <hi>By my name</hi> Jehovah <hi>was I knowne:</hi> Nor, <hi>My name</hi> Jehovah <hi>was knowne:</hi> But, <hi>My name</hi> Jehovah, <hi>I was knowne,</hi> to shew that God and his name are not two things, united by composition, but one and the same thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Jehovah</hi> betokeneth Gods giving of being to the Creature. To this purpose, it is observeable, that God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> till all the Creation be perfected, and every thing have received its being, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>So in all the speeches that passe betweene <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, God is never called <hi>Jehovah</hi> but once, where mention is made of the Creatures receiving their being, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jehovah</hi> signifieth the faithfulnesse of God in his promise, and in this sense it is rendred, <hi>Amen, true and faithfull.</hi> In this sense it is set after so many commands, Thou shalt, or thou shalt not doe thus and thus, <hi>I am Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in all these significations it is justly prefixed before all the Commandements, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. I am <hi>Jehovah</hi> thy God.</p>
            <p>As this name is not communicable to any Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There was another title of dignity given to the governour of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> in that Land, in after times, namely <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labarcha,</hi> as is to be seene in <hi>Josephus:</hi> which though he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would derive from <gap reason="foreign">

            <head>SECT. XIII. The Plague of Lice. The speech of the Sorcerers, This is the finger of God, Exod. 8. 19. not a confession of the Lord, but an hideous and horrid blasphemy.</head>
            <p>AT the Plague of Lice, the Sorcerers are put to a <hi>non-plus,</hi> and in the least creature can doe nothing, for [besides that it was the will of God, to bring their devices to nought, and to shew himselfe <hi>maximum in minimis]</hi> if they should have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this miracle, they must have done two things: first, they must have produced dust, and then of the dust, lice, for the text saith, <hi>That all the dust of the Land became lice, throughout all the Land of Aegypt, ver.</hi> 17. Neither of which they can doe, and therefore say, <hi>This is the finger of God.</hi> For the understanding of these their words, observe these things.</p>
            <p>First, That in the two foregoing Plagues of blood and Frogs, <hi>Moses</hi> gave warning of them before they came, but of this he did not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Lice were also in the land where <hi>Israel</hi> dwelt, as well as in other parts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for there is no severing betwixt <hi>Goshen</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> mentioned, till the next Plague of Flies, <hi>In that day, I will sever the Land of Goshen. in which my people dwell, And I will put a division betweene my people, and thy perple, ver.</hi> 22, 23, whereas none had beene put before.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Moses</hi> turned the waters of Aegypt into blood, the Sorcerers did so also with their inchantments, and turned the waters of Goshen into blood likewise. Here <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thinketh his Sorcerers have matched the Jehovah that <hi>Moses</hi> so talked of, and that they could doe as much against his people, as he could doe against theirs.</p>
            <p>And so when <hi>Moses</hi> from <hi>Jehovah</hi> brought Frogs upon Aegypt, the Magitians also by their inchantments bring Frog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> likewise
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59066:11"/>
upon <hi>Goshen,</hi> and still they thinke their God is hard enough for <hi>Israels Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is blood and Frogs through all the Land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> but neither were these reall blood or frogges, nor wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment at all upon <hi>Israel,</hi> for it was not from the Lord, but onely vaine delusions permitted by the Lord, that at last he might catch the crafty in their owne net.</p>
            <p>But when the Plague of Lice commeth, it commeth also upon Goshen from the Lord himselfe, and this is a plague indeed upon his owne people, laid upon them by him, as well as upon Aegypt: For <hi>Israel</hi> that had partaken in so many of Aegypts sins, must also thinke to partake in some of her punishments.</p>
            <p>For this it is, why the man of God in <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. reckoning up the Plagues of Aegypt, never mentioneth the Plague of Lice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that was equally a Plague to <hi>Israel,</hi> as to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> they had both blood and frogges as well as they, but not as really, nor from God, and therefore no plague to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> acknowledged a supreame great Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whom they thought they adored in their petty deities, whom they worshipped. For when they adored an Oxe, a Dogge, a Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, &amp;c. they adored not the carcasse, but the good qualities that in these creatures conduced to their benefit and good, so saith <hi>Eusebius,</hi> that whatsoever was helpefull, or furthered the good of humanelife, that they accounted a Deity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They accounted not of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the God of the Hebrewes, but as a petty, triviall God, such as every Nation had one or more of, that that God could doe something, as they saw in the blood and frogges, but could doe no more, if so much, as theirs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Who is Jehovah that I should obey him? I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel goe.</hi> So that the Magicians words, <hi>This is the finger of God,</hi> come from them reasoning thus: When blood and frogges came, <hi>Moses</hi> gave warning of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from his <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but these Lice come and he never gave warning; Hence it is plaine, this is none of <hi>Jehovahs</hi> doing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would <hi>Moses</hi> have knowne it before, but now he did not. Againe, when the Hebrews <hi>Jehovah</hi> brought blood and frogs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our land, he brought none upon theirs, but spared his owne people: but this Plague of Lice is also upon them, as soone as upon us, and without our doing: And therefore this cannot be Jehovah,

for he would not plague his owne people, but this is done by the finger of <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

entred into utter darkenesse; so it is with the Aegyptians here.</p>
            <p>This Plague lay upon them three dayes, namely, the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth dayes of the moneth <hi>Nisan.</hi> For upon the conclusion of the darkenesse, <hi>Moses</hi> being sent for to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> giveth him such distast that he chargeth him never to come into his presence againe, which <hi>Moses</hi> saith he will not do, <hi>I will see thy face again no more:</hi> but before he goeth out of the presence, he giveth him warning concerning the slaughter of the first borne to bee that night, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. by which it is cleare that the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ended on the Passeover day in the morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why then seeing it was the ninth plague in number, hath <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. set it first?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Because it was the most terrible of all the Plagues that came upon them. For those that had gone before had plagued onely their land, or cattle, or bodies; that that came after, light not upon all, but onely on the first borne, but this is a Plague even to the very mind and conscience, and universally so to them all.</p>
            <p>It was not their sitting in darkenesse and not stirring about their businesse for three dayes together, that plagued them so much, for this had beene no great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orment, but their torture was, that in this darkenesse they saw fearefull apparitions of Fiends and Devills, and horrible visions, which so hideously affrighted and even distracted them, that they were as it were in Hell already.

            <p>Hence it is that <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 49. nameth not the plague of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by its name, but in the place where it should come, hee mentioneth that which was the very quintessence of it. <hi>Hee cast upon them the fiercenesse of his anger, wrath, and indignation and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by sending evill Angels among them.</hi>

            <p>THis latter clause, <hi>they rebelled not against his word,</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of <hi>Israel,</hi> who in this plague of darkenesse perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med some speciall part of obedience: And that upon inquiry will be found to be their undergoing of circumcision. For they had followed the Idols of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in Idolatry were become like the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> so were they also in uncircumcision. For when <hi>Joshuah</hi> had circumcised them at their entrance into <hi>Canaan,</hi> hee saith, I have rolled away from you the reproch of <hi>Aegypt, Josh.</hi> 5. 9. or that wherein y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But when God ordaineth the Passeover, he giveth charge for circumcision, for no uncircumcised person must eate thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48.</p>
            <p>Then was required a generall circumcision of all the people, or at least of the most of them, for all were uncircumcised, unlesse it was some few that were more constant to the Covenant of their God. And that there was a generall Circumcision in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is inferred in the forenamed place, <hi>Joshu.</hi> 5. where God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Joshua</hi> to Circumcise the people <hi>a second time,</hi> which infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that there was a first time when they were circumcised with a generall Circumcision as they were that second time.

            <p>Whilst then <hi>Israel</hi> sate sore of their Circumcision, God closeth up <hi>Aegypt</hi> in three dayes darkenesse, and in horrour, that they might not take the opportunitie against his people.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THE Paschall Lamb was Christs body in a figure. Compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 46. with <hi>John</hi> 19. 36. and to this it is that the word <hi>hoc,</hi> in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> had reference and respect. They had but newly eaten the Pasteover Lambe, and that had beene the body of Christ Sacra mentally to the <hi>Jewes</hi> hitherto: but now Jesus tooke bread, and blessed, and brake it, and told them that this hence forward must be his body under the Gospell in that same manner that the paschall Lambe had beene his body under the Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lambe must not be eaten raw, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. which would never have beene forbidden, if the very raw flesh and bloud of Christ, as it was upon the Crosse, were eaten in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as transubstantiation dreameth, for then had the raw Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over represented it the better. And especially among those People who sometimes used to eate raw flesh in their hasty meales as the Jewes did.</p>
            <p>Necessity sometimes transfers the Passeover to another moneth, but never further then the next. So the first Passeover but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, was kept by some on the fourteenth day of the second moneth, because uncleannesse by a dead corps necessitated them to foregoe it at the right time, <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 11. And so the last Passeover but one that we read of before the Captivity was kept in the second mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 2. because <hi>Hezekiah</hi> comming to his Crowne but just in the beginning of the yeare, or very little before, could not procure the Temple, and the Priests to be sanctified and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sufficiently, and the People to be assembled against the right Passeover day, See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59066:14"/>
This translation of the Feast a moneth out of its place, did the more enforce its significancy of things future then of things past; as rather recording the death of Christ to come, then their delivery from <hi>Aegypt:</hi> for the force of the commemoration of that was infeebled much, when it hit not upon the very night. Againe, this mooveablenesse of this Feast, which so neerely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the death of our Saviour, received its equity when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour dyed, not upon the very Passeover day, but deferred the Sacrificing of himselfe to a day after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it seemeth that Christ did not eate his Passeover on the fourteenth day, For <hi>Job.</hi> 18. 28. The Jewes went not into the Judgement Hall, lest they should be defiled: but that they might eate the Passeover.</p>
            <p>Now it is most apparent that our Saviour had eaten the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, over night: which as soone as he had done he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and arraigned all night, and the next morning earely he is brought to <hi>Pilate,</hi> into whose house the Jewes durst not come for feare of defiling, but that they might eate the Passeover: so that it appeares that either Christ or the Jewes hit not upon the right Passeover day injoyned by the Law, either hee a day too soone, or they a day too late.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Neither the one nor the other. For the text expressely saith, that Jesus ate his Passeover, and the Jewes theirs upon the same night, which was on the fourteenth day at even.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 17. <hi>Now the first day of the Feast of unleavened bread, the Disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eate the Passeover?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>The first day of unleavened bread when they killed the Passeover,</hi> So Luk. 22. 7.</p>
            <p>So that the Passeover which the Jewes reserved themselves to the eating of, when they durst not enter into <hi>Pilates</hi> Judgement Hall for feare of defiling, is not to be understood of the Paschall Lamb, which they had eaten the evening past, but of the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bullocke where of mention is made, <hi>Dent.</hi> 16. 2. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Now these bullocks were indeede slaine at Passeover time, but not for the Passeover beast properly taken, for that must be of a Lambe or kid unalterably: but these bullocks were slaine as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants upon the Paschall, from the nature of which Sacrifice
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59066:14"/>
they differed in these particulars.</p>
            <p>First, the Paschall Lambe was alwayes, and all of him rost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d: these were sodden, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Paschall Lambe was rosted whole, and eaten without breaking the bones, these were broken peecemeale, and so parted among the people.</p>
            <p>The Paschall Lambe was a necessary service to which they were bound by command: these were arbitrary according to their stay in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the Passeover weeke; for if they would they might returne home the next morning after the Paschall Lambe was eaten, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 7. and then they needed no bullocke to be killed for their dyet the rest of the Feast: but if they stayed any more dayes of the feast at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> then the first, then was not their dyet arbitrary to eat any thing what they would, but they must eate of these bullockes because their dyet must bee holy at that time. Hence resulteth another difference betwixt the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe, and these, which is this; that these were not of the first institution of the Passeover, nor had they any bullockes slaine at the Passeover in Aegypt, but Lambes onely.</p>

            <head>SECT. XIX. That the Supper in Job. 13. was not the Passeover Supper.</head>
            <p>FIRST, It is very commonly held that the Supper in <hi>John</hi> 13. was the Passeover Supper, and that <hi>Judas</hi> stayed not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, for that our Saviour having dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a sop into the bitter or sowre sawce, which they used to the Paschall Lambe, and given it to him, Satan with it entring into him, he packed him away with, What thou doest doe quickly: An opinion mistaken in the ground-worke that it builds upon, and consequently in the structure built upon it. For that that was no passeover at all, the Evangelist maketh it most plaine in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. when he saith, it was before the Feast of the Passeover, and <hi>Matthen</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 2. telleth, it was two dayes before, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, two miles from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> namely in <hi>Betbany:</hi> The serious Harmonizing of the foure Evangelists together, at this place, will make this most cleare.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59066:15"/>
Secondly, if then it were not the Passeover Supper, there can be no Paschall Lambe looked for at it, nor no Haroseth, or sawce of bitter herbes to eate it with, but the meate that they were then eating, and the sawce in which our Saviour dipped the sop, was ordinary meate, and ordinary sawce.</p>

            <p>IT may be equally questionable, whether Israel shewed lesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty in borrowing what they meant not to restore, or Aegypt lesse wisedome, in lending what they knew would not be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
            <p>For the first, it is easily answered, that they had the expresse warrant of God, who cannot command unrighteousnesse, and whom to obey in all things is piety.</p>
            <p>The second is as easily resolved thus, that Idolaters, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of their Idols, used to decke themselves with Jewels, and Eare-rings, and fine things, thereby to make them as they thought the more acceptable, to their fine decked deity. So doe the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> now conceive of <hi>Israel,</hi> that seeing they desired these their fine knacks, being now going to sacrifice, they intended to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> gods, as they had done heretofore, and they thought, sure there can be no danger of departing the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they still adhere to our Religion.

            <head>SECT. XXIII. <hi>That this story of</hi> Jethro <hi>is misplaced, and why.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat this story is misplaced, is plaine by these things: First, <hi>Jethro, Moses father in Law, tooke a burnt offering, and sacrifices for God, ver.</hi> 12. Secondly, <hi>Now on the morrow, Moses sate to judge</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59066:16"/>
               <hi>the people,</hi> vers. 13. <hi>and made them know the Statutes of God, and his Lawes,</hi> vers. 16.</p>
            <p>But as the story lyeth here, there was no Tabernacle nor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar for Sacrifice yet built; Neither as yet did <hi>Moses</hi> know the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Lawes of God himselfe, for as yet they are not come to <hi>Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe telleth that the choosing of Judges and Elders, which was done upon <hi>Jethroes</hi> Counsell, was not till their departing from <hi>Sinai. The Lord your God spake unto us in</hi> Horeb, <hi>saying, You have dwelt long enough in this mountaine, &amp;c. And I spake unto you at that time, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ying, I am not able to beare you my selfe alone, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 1. from <hi>vers.</hi> 7. to 19.</p>
            <p>So that this story should lye at the 10 of <hi>Numbers,</hi> and come in betwixt the tenth and eleventh verses of that chapter, and the story to be conceived thus. When <hi>Moses</hi> had received all the Lawes which God would give him at <hi>Sinai,</hi> from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. to the Law of the silver Trumpets, which was the last, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. then came <hi>Jetbro,</hi> and brought <hi>Moses</hi> wife and children, and seeing him toyling in judgement, he adviseth him to chuse Judges to ease him; which being done, ere long the cloud removed, and they must flit from <hi>Sinai, ver.</hi> 11. When they are ranked to march, <hi>Moses</hi> desireth <hi>Hobab</hi> or <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father in Law to goe along with him, which he denyeth, but returneth to his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 29, 30. 31, 32. compared with the last verse of this Chapter. Thus lyeth the order of the story. Now, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it is misplaced is this. In the last verse of the preceding Chapter, there is a perpetuall curse decreed against <hi>Amalek, The Lord hath sworne that the Lord will have warre with Amalek, from generation to generation.</hi> Now the <hi>Midianites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites</hi> lived so promiscuously together, that they were as one people, and the <hi>Kenites,</hi> or the family of <hi>Jethro,</hi> dwelt in the midst of them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 6. Therefore that it might be observed that <hi>Jethro</hi> fell not under that curse of <hi>Amalek, Moses</hi> bringeth him in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Campe of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to God, as soone as ever the curse is uttered, that every eye might presently observe that <hi>Jethro</hi> was exempted from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> by this account lay almost a twelve moneth at <hi>Sinai,</hi> before his wife and children came at him, and can this be thought, that they should be so unnaturall one to another?</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>I Beleeve that salvation is by Faith, not by Workes.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1. From the impossibility of their keeping the Law, which their consciences could not but convince them of, by their disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to heare it, and by their daily carriage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that they saw the holiest of their men, and the holiest of their services, to receive sanctitie, not from themselves, but from another. So they saw that the Priest [who was or should bee at least the holiest man amongst them] was sanctified by his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that the sacrifices were sanctified by the Altar. From these premises they could not but conclude, that no man, nor his best service could be accepted as holy in it selfe, but must be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I beleeve that there is no salvation without reconciliation with God, and no reconciliation without satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first part of this Article is so plaine that nature might teach it, and so might it the latter also; and laying hereto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his <hi>lex talionis,</hi> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, it made it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I beleeve that satisfaction shall once be made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59066:19"/>
This they might see by their daily sacrifice, aiming at a time when there should full satisfaction be made, which these poore things could not doe. No lesse did their <hi>Iubilee</hi> yeare intimate when men in debt and bondage were quitted; The very time of the yeare, when the <hi>Iubilee</hi> yeare began, calling all <hi>Israel</hi> to thinke of a Jubilee from sinne and Satans bondage, into which mankind fell at the same time of the yeare.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>I beleeve that satisfaction for sinne shall be made by a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is answerable to reason that as a man sinned, so a man should satisfie: but <hi>Moses</hi> Law about redemption of land by a kinsman, taught <hi>Israel</hi> to expect that one that should be akin in the flesh to mankind, should redeeme for him morgaged heaven: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>I beleeve that he shall be more then a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they learned from the common service about the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, wherein the high Priest, a man as fully hallowed and sanctified as man could be, for his outward function; yet did he offer and offer againe for the people and himselfe, and yet they were uncleane still. This read a Lecture to every ones apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that a meere man could not doe the deed of satisfaction, but he must be more.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>I beleeve the redeemer must also be God as well as man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The disabilitie of beasts to make satisfaction, they saw by their dying in sacrifice one after another, and yet mans conscience cleansed never the better. The unabilitie of man we saw before: The next then that is likely to doe this worke are Angels. But them <hi>Israel</hi> saw in the Tabernacle curtaines spectators onely and not actors in the time and worke of reconciliation. From hence they might gather that it must be God dwelling with man in one person, as the cloud, the glory of God never parted from the Arke.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>I beleeve that mans Redeemer shall die to make satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they saw from their continued bloody sacrifices, and from the covenants made, and all things purged by blood. This the heedlesse man-slayer might take heed of, and see that as by the death of the high Priest he was restored to liberty, so should mankind be by the death of the highest Priest to the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the sonnes of God. Their delivery from <hi>Egypt</hi> by the death of a Lambe taught them no lesse.</p>

8. <hi>I beleeve that he shall not die for his owne sinnes, but for mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every sacrifice read this lecture, when the most harmelesse of beasts and birds were offered.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>I beleeve that he shall overcome death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Israel</hi> saw by necessary conclusion, that if Christ should fall under death, he did no more then men had done before. His resurrection they saw in <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, Manna, Scapegoate, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>I beleeve to be saved by laying hold upon his merits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laying their right hand upon the head of every beast that they brought to be offered up taught them, that their sinnes were to be imputed to another, and the laying hold on the hornes of the Altar, being sanctuary or refuge from vengeance, taught them that anothers merits were to bee imputed to them, yet that all offenders were not saved by the Altar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 12. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 29. the fault not being in the Altar but in the offender, it is easie to see what that signified unto them.</p>

            <p>VVHen <hi>Israel</hi> cannot indure to heare the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given, it was ready to conclude, that they could much lesse keepe them. Therefore God giveth <hi>Moses</hi> privately
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59066:20"/>
fifty seven precepts besides, namely Ceremoniall and Judiciall: to all which the people are the next morning after the giving of the ten Commandements, sworne and entered into Covenant, and these made them a Ceremoniall and singular people. About which these things are observable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they entred into Covenant to a written Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Against tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That here was a booke written forty dayes before the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the two tables: Against them that hold that the first let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that were seene in the world, were the writing of God in those Tables. And we have seene before also two pieces of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before this of <hi>Moses,</hi> viz. the 88. and 89. Psalmes: And of equall antiquity with them, or not much lesse was the penning of the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> most probably written by <hi>Elibu</hi> one of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in it, as may be conjectured from Chap. 32. 15, 16, 17. and some other probabilitie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this first Covenant was made with water, and blood, and figurative language: For the twelve pillars that represented the people are called <hi>the people, Exod.</hi> 24. 4. 8. As the words in the second Covenant, <hi>this my body,</hi> are to bee understood in such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the ten Commandements were not written in the book of that Covenant, but onely those 57. precepts mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>For 1. The Lord giveth the other precepts, because the people could not receive the ten: for could they have received and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served those as they ought, they must never have had any parcell of a Law more: as if <hi>Adam</hi> had kept the Morall Law, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver needed to have heard of the promise; and so if we could but receive the same Law as we should, we had never needed the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Now it is most unlike that since God gave them those other commands, because they could not receive the ten, that hee would mingle the ten and them together in the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not imaginable that God would ever cause a people to sweare to the performance of a Law which they could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure so much as to heare.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ten Commandements needed not to be read by <hi>Moses</hi> to the people, seeing they had all heard them from the mouth of the Lord but the day before.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59066:20"/>
4. Had they beene written and laid up in this booke, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie had there beene of their writing and laying up in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of stone?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Had <hi>Moses</hi> read the ten Commandements in the beginning of his booke, why should he repeate some of them againe at the latter end, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 12.</p>
            <p>Let such ruminate upon this, which hold and maintaine that the Sabbath as it standeth in the fourth Commandement, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Jewish Sabbath, and consequently Ceremouiall. And let those good men that have stood for the day of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other, consider whether they have not lost ground, in granting that the fourth Commandement instituted the Jewish Sabbath. For,</p>
            <p>First, The Jewes were not sworne to the Decalogue at all, and so not the Sabbath as it standeth there, but onely to the fifty seven precepts written in <hi>Moses</hi> his booke, and to the Sabbath as it was there, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The end of the Ceremoniall Sabbath of the Jewes was in remembrance of their delivery out of Aegypt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 15. but the morall Sabbath of the two Tables is in commemoration of Gods resting from the workes of the Creation. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. 11.</p>

            <p>The Tabernacle was <hi>Israels</hi> moveable Temple, and so at every flitting might teach them to looke for one that should not be moved.

            <head>SECT. XXXII. The dimensions of the Tabernacle.</head>
            <p>THe Tabernacle was thirty cubits long, for twenty plankes of a cubit and a halfe breadth apeece made one side, or the length of it, and it was ten cubits broad, as shall appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re hereafter. But first observe these two things.</p>
            <p>First, That those which are translated <hi>boards,</hi> were indeed planks of a good thicknesse, even of nine inches thicke apeece, for it is said, in the fastning of the sides of the Tabernacle, that a barre of Shittim wood, ran through the thicknesse of the boards, as they stood edging oneto another. Now this barre was no small one, for it was the chiefe strength of the side, and therefore must have a large hole bored to run through, and consequently, it must
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59066:22"/>
be a thicke planke that would beare such a hole, and not an inch, or two inch board.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The cubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by which the Tabornacle is measured, was but halfe a yard, or the common cubit, and not the Sanctuary or holy cubit, which was a full yard. For, first, it is said that every planke was a cubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and a hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e broad; if this were a yard and a halfe, doe but imagine where plankes of such a breadth should be had: Secondly, every planke was ten cubits long; if this were ten yards, imagine how they should be carryed: Thirdly, every two silver Bases were as long as a planke was broad; now two talents would fall short of reaching to a yard and an halfe. Lastly, the Altar of burnt offering was three cubits high; if this were three yards, who could reach to serve at it? These things considered, you finde that the cubit here spoken of, is but halfe a yard, and this will helpe well in measuring all the things to be spoken of after.</p>

            <head>SECT. XXXIII. The peoples contribution to the silver foundation: and its forme and posture.</head>
            <p>MEasure out in your imagination, an unequall square, or a plot of ground, of thirty cubits, or fifteene yards long, and of ten cubits or five yards broad, such was the compasse of the Tabernacle betwixt Wall and Wall. The Foundation was of massy peeces of silver, shewing the solidity and purity of the truth, whereupon the Church is founded; Of these massy peeces there were an hundred in all, and in every peece was a talent of silver. Every man in Israel from twenty yeares old and upward, was to give halfe a Shekell, towards these foundation peeces, whereas for other things they were not bound to a setsumme, but to give what their hearts moved them. This might teach them, that to the fundamentals of their Religion, they were all bound, but to other things, each one according to the gift given him. Their manner of giving halfe a Shekell, you finde <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 26, 27, 28. thus. There were numbred of Israel, from twenty yeares old, and upward, sixe hundred thousand, and three thousand five hundred
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59066:23"/>
and fifty men. Reckon thus; The Talent of the Sanctuary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained 120 pound, the pound 25 shekels, or 50 halfe shekels, so that every Talent contained 3000. shekels, or 6000. halves: so that sixe hundred thousand halfe shekels, given by sixe hundred thousand men, doe amount to a hundred talents: Now there were three thousand five hundred and fifty men besides, which gave so many halfe shekels, or one thousand seven hundred seventy five whole ones, with which were made the hookes of pillars, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. 28. These hundred Talents of silver were thus wrought. Each one was cast into a solid peece of thirteen inches and a halfe long, and nine inches square; in the side that lay upward was a morteise hole, neere unto the end, now two and two were laid close together, end to end, and the morteises were not in the ends that joyned, but in the outmost ends.</p>
            <p>Now every planke, whereof the sides were made, was in height five yards, but in breadth three quarters, just as broad as two of these peeces of silver were long, at the foote of the planke, at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corner was a tenon made, the planke being cut downe, or abating so much betweene the tenons, as the tenons themselves were in length, so that when the tenons were shrunke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teises, the middle of the planke setled upon the peeces or Bases.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="34" type="section">
            <head>SECT. XXXIV. The walls and juncture of the Tabernacle.</head>
            <p>THese silver Bases then were thus laid: forty at the South side, forty at the North side, and sixteene at the West end, laid as close together as was possible, so that though there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peeces, yet was it but one intire foundation; Here are foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and fifteene of the hundred talents disposed of, in the two sides and the West end, what became of the foure talents remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of the East end, we shall see hereafter.</p>
            <p>These Bases thus laid, the plankes were set in them, one plank taking up two Bases, twenty plankes making the South side, and twenty the North, and eight the West end; these were five yards long apeece, and so when they were set up, they made the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle five yards and a little more, high upon the walls; Now for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59066:23"/>
the making of these plankes sure, and to stand stedfast, the two corner plankes were great helpes, of which first, you remember the length of the sides, namely fifteene yards or twenty plankes, of three quarters breadth apeece. The West end had sixe plankes intire, besides a planke at either corner, joynting end and sides to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. These corner plankes were of the same breadth that all the other were, and thus set: The middle of the breadth of the one Planke, was laid close to the end of the South side, or to that planke that was furthest West, so that a quarter of a yard of the breadth of the corner planke, was inward, to make up the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle breadth, a quarter was taken up with the thicknesse of the side planke to which it joyned, and a quarter lay outward.</p>
            <p>Thus at the South-west, just so was it at the North-west corner. Then count; the two corner plankes were inward a quarter of a yard apeece, and the sixe plankes that stood betweene them of three quarters apeece, behold five yards, just the breadth of the house betweene wall and wall. These corners knit end and side together, and were strength of the building, as Christ is of his Church, making Jewes and Gentiles one spirituall Temple.</p>
            <p>Besides these corners strengthening the Fabricke, there were seven bonds to make all sure. First, plankes to plankes were close joynted at the foote, so that the Text calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or twins. Secondly, each planke was linked to the next, at the top, with a golden linke. Thirdly, on the side, staples of Gold were fastned in every planke, so that foure barres of Shittim wood, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaid with Gold, were carryed in the staples, from one end of the Tabernacle to another. Besides these, there was also another barre of the same wood, that ran from end to end, through the body or thicknesse of the plankes, a hole being bored through each planke for the purpose. By these barres Christ is fitly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, who is conveyed throughout the whole Scripture, in the rings of diverse passages and stories; In the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> there are seven bonds that bind the Church to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; First, one body; secondly, one spirit; thirdly, one hope of our calling; fourthly, one Lord; fifthly, one Faith; sixthly, one Baptisme; seventhly, one God and Father of all.</p>
            <p>Now view in imagination the body of the Tabernacle, as it stands onely planked [without any more addition to it] with plankes of Shittim wood. The length fifteene yards from end
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59066:24"/>
to end, the breadth five yards from side to side. The sides and West end planked up five yards high and somewhat more, the foundation of those plankes, massy peeces of silver: The top of the house, and the East end left open, till they be covered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: First then of the covering of the top, and sides, and West end.</p>

            <head>SECT. XXXV. Of the Curtaines of the Tabernacle.</head>
            <p>THe Tabernacle was bounded with Curtaines [as lightest for carriage] which Curtaines covered top and sides. These Curtaines were Tapestry worke: The ground was of fine yarne dyed blew, Purple, and Scarlet, woven together; the embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery was of Pictures of Cherubims.</p>
            <p>These Curtaines were in number ten, each one being twenty eight cubits, or fourteene yards long, &amp; foure cubits or two yards broad: They were sewed together five Curtaines in one peece, and five in another: so that they made two large peeces of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestry of fourteene yards long, and tenne yards broad. These two peeces are called couplings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 5. And these two were thus joyned together. In the edge of either, were made fifty loopes of blew tape, one answerable or correspondent to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or one over against another; and with fifty hooks or clasps of gold, he linked the loopes together, and so the two maine peeces were made one covering or Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why were not all the ten Curtaines sewed together on one peece, but five and five sewed together, to make two peeces, and then those two thus looped together with a button or claspe of gold?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, the Tabernacle consisted of two parts; the holy place, and the most holy: which two were divided one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by a vaile; of which hereafter: Now according to this division of the house, was also the division of the curtaines. For <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 32. it is plaine that the vaile that parted the holy from the most holy, was hung just under these golden claspes that knit the five and five Curtaines together: So that five Curtaines lay
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59066:24"/>
over the holy place, and the other five over the most holy, but with this difference: The holy place was ten yards long, and the five Curtaines sewed together were just so broad, and so they covered onely the top and sides, but hung not downe at the end, which was Eastward; but the most holy was but five yards long, and the five Curtaines over, that did not onely cover the top, but also hung downe at the West end, to the silver bases.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the looping together of the Curtaines, five and five on a peece, with a golden tye, doth sweetly resemble the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the two natures in Christ, divinity and humanity, into one person, which two natures were not confounded, as Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines sewed together, but were sweetely knit together by golden and ineffable union.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this might also fully signifie the two Churches of Jewes and Gentiles, knit together by Christ, that so they make but one spirituall Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>Now come and measure the Curtaines againe, imagining them throwne length way over the Tabernacle: they were fourteene yards long, and twenty yards broad, when they were all sewed and looped together: This breadth covered the length of the building, which was fifteene yards, and it hung downe behinde the West end, even to the foundation. The East end was still left open. Of the length of them, five yards were taken up in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the flat top of the house, which was five yards broad between wall and wall: A quarter of a yard was taken up on either side, with covering the thicknesse of the plankes: so that on either side they hung downe foure yards and one quarter, which was three quarters of a yard short of the silver foundation, or little lesse.</p>

            <head>SECT. XXXVI. Of the Goate-haire Curtaines.</head>
            <p>TO helpe this defect, as also to shelter the rich Curtaines from weather, were made Curtaines of Goates haire, eleven in number; in breadth each one two yards, as was the breadth of other, but being one Curtaine more then the other, they were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59066:25"/>
two yards broader then the other, when they were all coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Each Curtaine was thirty cubits, or fifteene yards long, and consequently a yardlonger then those spoken of before. These were sewed, sixe together on one peece, and five on another. These two maine peeces were linked together, with fifty claspes of brasse, as the other were with fifty of gold. But when these cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were laid upon the other over the Tabernacle, they were not so laid as these brazen loopes, did light just upon the golden ones, over the vaile, but three quarters of a yard more Westward, so that the five curtains that went West did reach to the ground, and halfe a curtaine to spare, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 12. The other sixe that lay East, reacht to the end, covered the pillars whèreon that vaile hung, and they hung halfe a curtaine breadth, or a yard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the entrance. Their length of fifteen: yards reacht halfe a yard lower on either side, than the other curtaines did, and yet they came not to the ground by a quarter of a yard, so that the silver foundations were alwayes plaine to be seene, every where but at the West end.</p>
            <p>Thus had the Tabernacle two coverings of curtaines; yet both these on the flat roofe would not hold out raines, and weather, wherefore there was made for the top a covering of Rammes skins dyed red, signifying well the blood of Christ the shelter of the Church.</p>
            <p>Above that was also another covering of <hi>Tahash</hi> skins, a beast not perfectly knowne what he was, but well Englished, a Badger, and guessed well because of his during hide. Thus if you view this building erected, and thus covered, you see the silver foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation alwaies open to view.

            <p>THe Priests entred into the Tabernacle at the East end of it, and so must we; where pace up ten yards forward, and you come to the vaile which parted betweene the Holy place, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59066:25"/>
most Holy of all. The Holyest place of all, was filled and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished before the vaile was hung up, and so it shall be first hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This place was five yards long, five yards high, and five yards broad; a perfect square, the figure of firmenesse, herein fitly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Heaven.</p>
            <p>In this place, at the West end, stood the Arke of the Covenant of the Lord of all the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 11. typifying Christ, by whom God is come into Covenant with Gentiles as well as Jewes.</p>
            <p>The Arke was made like a Chest, hollow, that it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive things within it. It was a yard and a quarter long, and three quarters broad, and three quarters high, made of Shittim boards, and it was gilded both within and without, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christs purity, both in inward thoughts and outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It had no feet, but the bottome stood upon the ground, a figure of Christs abasing himselfe upon the earth. On the outside of the uppermost brink was made a Golden Crown round about, representing [say the Jewes] the Crowne of the Law, but most fitly, Christ Crowned with glory. At each corner was strucke in, a staple or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of Gold, wherein were put two staves of Shit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim wood gilded over, to beare the Arke withall, which staves were never to be taken out, but there to stay continually, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Priests, as some say, to be ready prest for their service: but rather shadowing out Christs Deity, supporting his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never to be parted from it. Now for the cover of this chest, or Arke, it was made of pure Gold, beaten or formed to the just length and breadth of the Arke, that when it was laid on it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Golden Crowne round about. At either end was made a Cherub, or the forme of an Angell, like a childe, standing bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with wings reaching over the Arke, so that the wings of one Cherub touched the wings of another. They were of Gold, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of the same peece that the cover of the Arke was of. Their faces were one to another, and both toward to the cover of the Arke. This cover both by the Old and New Testament, is called the Propitiatory, vulgarly in our English, the Mercy-seat. So called, because from hence God mercifully spake to his People. View this part well, and you see Christ fully.</p>
            <p>First, the two Cherubims bowed toward the Mercy-seat. So all Angels to Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59066:26"/>
Secondly, They looked each at other, but both toward the Mercy-seat. So both Testaments Old and New, looke each at other, and both at Christ. So doe the two Churches, of Jewes and Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This covered the Law: so doth Christ that it plead not against his people to condemne them.</p>

To separate this from the holy place was hung up a vaile, of the same stuffe and worke that the rich curtaines of the Tabernacle were: The hanging up of this vaile was thus: Just under the golden claspes that linked the curtaines together, were set up foure pillars of Shittim wood gilded over, upon foure Bases of silver, such as the plankes stood upon, and these make up the hundred peeces, or Talents spoken of before: The pillars stood a yard from each other, and the two outmost stood a yard from the walke; at the top of each pillar was fastned a golden hooke, on the which the vaile hung, five yards broad, and five yards high; This vaile represented Christs flesh or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, celebrated by foure Evangelists, the foure Pillars that beare up that story.</p>
            <p>This place without the vaile was ten yards long and five yards broad: Into this might the Priests come, and <hi>Moses</hi> the Prince by a speciall warrant. The furniture of this was, the Shewbread Table, the golden Candlestick, and the gilded Altar.</p>

A Table frame was made two cubits long, and a cubit broad, and a cubit and a halfe high; the matter of it was <hi>Shittim</hi> wood all overlaid with Gold: Equall with the top of the frame was a curious wrought border of gold, of a hand breadth; the higher edge equall with the top of the frame, and the border so broad below; on the higher edge of this border was set a golden Crowne, which went quite about the frame, and within this Crowne was the cover laid; At each corner or foot was fastned a staple or ring of gold, close by the lower edge of the golden bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

            <p>THat <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> should be nothing but the name <hi>Jehovah</hi> written and put into the Breast-plate, as some have held, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avours more of exorcisme than a divine Oracle.</p>
            <p>Or that the lustre, or dimnesse of the twelve stones should be the Oracle, as others, is as strange a fancy as the former, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the particulars of Answers that have beene given: As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, that of <hi>Davids,</hi> Whither shall I goe? the Vrim answered, to Hebron.</p>
            <p>This impossibility others having espyed, have averred that the Vrim consisted of the names of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Twelve Tribes, and that when a question was asked, the letters that served to give the answer, either rose up above the others, or else met strangely together, and made words to give an answer. But if the letter <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th</hi> were to be spelled in the answer, where was it to be had?</p>
            <p>Leaving then these and other conjectures, let us see what light the Scripture will give us concerning these things.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were not two things, but one and the same thing, and for this reason, they are called sometime by by a single name, <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 21. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 6. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the stones in the High Priests breast-plate, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> Exod. 28. 30.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when God answered by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>swer was not given by any appearance in the stones, but by the mouth of the Priest. <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 21.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Priest when he was to receive his answer, was to have the Ephod on, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 9.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Priest when he was to receive an answer, stood b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 27. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59066:31"/>
The manner then of inquiring of the Lord by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> was thus.</p>
            <p>The things to be inquired of must be of weight and generality: for the stones represented the Judgement of all the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 30. therefore the inquiry by them must concerne the generall: Such was the generall question at <hi>Shiloh, Judg.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Who shall first set upon the Canaanites?</hi> Such was that of all <hi>Israel: Shall I goe up against my Brother</hi> Benjamin? <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 23. and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>When such a scruple was to be resolved, it was told to the High Priest what he should aske: So did <hi>David</hi> wish <hi>Abin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tech</hi> the High Priest at <hi>Nob</hi> to enquire whether his journey should prosper, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 10. So did the <hi>Danites</hi> to the fained Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous High Priest, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. 5. The Priest knowing what to aske, put on the Ephod and Breast-plate, which hung unsepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at it. This doe <hi>Davids</hi> words meane, when he saith to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar</hi> the Priest, Bring hither the Ephod, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 9. And for this it was that <hi>Abiathar</hi> made sure of the Ephod, when he fled from bleeding <hi>Nob,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6. Without the stones on his breast, the Priest enquired not: for the stones represented <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and when the Priest brought them before the Lord, he brought as it were <hi>Israel</hi> and their matters before him. To goe without these was to goe without his errand. If <hi>Sauls</hi> conscience could have told him of no other cause whyGod would not answer him, as it might many, yet he might see this to be one reason un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, viz. Because though he had the Arke neare him, yet had he neither High Priest nor Ephod; and seeing his crosse in this that he could not be answered, his conscience might tell him what he did when he slew the Priests of the Lord.</p>
            <p>When the Priest knew what to enquire about, and had put on these habiliments, he went and stood before the Arke of the Lord, and enquired about the matter, and the Lord answered him from off the Propitiatory from betweene the Cherubims, and so the Priest answered the People. Now there was some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Priests manner of inquiring, according to the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Arke, when the Tabernacle was up, the Priest went into the holy Place, and stood close by the vaile which parted the holy from the most holy, and there inquired, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59066:31"/>
God from betweene the Cherubims which were within the vaile, gave him an answer.</p>
            <p>But when the Tabernacle was downe, or the Arke distant from the Tabernacle, travelling up and downe, then did the Priest in his Robes stand before the Arke, as it stood covered with the curtaines, and enquired, and the answer was given him, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>Israel</hi> whom God saw on his breast: For this reason the stones, for whose sakes the <hi>perfect light</hi> of resolution was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are called the <hi>perfect light</hi> or <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and the answer given from the Priests month is called the answer by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> once enquired of the Priest, having the Ephod, but want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arke, and God answered him, and shewed him that God was not bound to meanes. On the contrary <hi>Saul</hi> once enquired of the Arke, wanting the Ephod, and God answered him not, shewing him how God honoured his Priests whom <hi>Saul</hi> had dishonoured, even to the Sword.</p>
            <p>Thus have we seene the Breast-plates forme, richnesse and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Forme, fouresquare a span every way: the richnesse, it was set with twelve precious stones: the glory, that for the sake of these stones, that <hi>is,</hi> for their sakes whose names these stones bare, God revealed secrets to his people. See this breast-plate fastned to the Ephod, and you see <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Priest arrayed in his glorious garments. At each corner of the breast-plate, was a golden ring fastned. On the upper side of the piece, just upon the edge, was layd a little golden chaine, which ran like an edging lace upon the edge, and was brought through the two rings which were at either corner one, and the ends of the chaines were made fast to bosses or loopes of gold which were on the shoulder peeces of the Ephod by the Onyx stones. At the lower edge of the breast-plate was an edging chaine, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried just in the same manner that the other was, through two gold rings, and the chaines tyed to the embroidered girdle of the Ephod, as the other were to the shoulder peeces. Breast-plate and Ephod might not be parted, no more then might the Staves and Arke.</p>

            <p>Hee laid the silver foundations in their rankes, and in them he set up the plankes and strengthened them with the five barres, linking them also together at the top with a golden haspe. He set up the foure Pillars in the house whereon to hang the vaile, and the five pillars at the East end whereon to hang that vaile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. He set the Arke in the most holy place, hanging up the vaile before it. In the holy place he set the Table and Shew-bread on the North side, and the Candlesticke on the South, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of perfume, just in the middle betwixt them: And at the East end he hung up the vaile to keepe these things from vulgar eyes.</p>
            <p>The Altar and Laver he set up before the entrance, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed them, and the Tabernacle it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus was the Sanctuary erected, and was lovely to them that beheld it, being the glory and the strength of <hi>Israel.</hi> Then did the cloud of glory flit from off the Tent of <hi>Moses,</hi> and lighted upon the Sanctuary, and dwelt there more gloriously then on the other.</p>
            <p>
