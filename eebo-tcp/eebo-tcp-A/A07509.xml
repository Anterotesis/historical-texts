         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is the chaine that at firſt tyed Kingdomes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Muſicall ſtring that ſtill maintaines them in Concord, in Leagues and in Unity. The Portugalls haue hereby Crowned themſelues and there Poſterity with garlands of neuer dying honour. The Spaniards
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:26949:6"/>
haue their names (for this) ſo deepely ingrauen in the Chronicles of Fame, that they can neuer bee forgotten. The French likewiſe and the Dutch, haue raiſed their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to a nobler height, onely by theſe Aduentures. In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all whoſe labors, or rather in Emulation of all their Fames, our Engliſhmen haue not onely Stept as farre as any of them Al, but gone beyond the moſt, and the beſt of them. And not to reckon thoſe men of worth (in this kinde) of our owne Nation, whoſe voyages and trauells (by ſea and land) to ſet down, were able to fil whole volumes, I will onely at this time (not with a loud and ſhrill trumpet, as they deſerue, but as it were vppon an inſtrument tuned and directed by another) giue onely a ſoft touch at the Praiſes of this worthy Gentleman (Sir <hi>ROBERT SHERLEY</hi>) of whoſe aduentures, dangers, &amp; various fortunes, both good and bad, to draw a true picture in the right &amp; liuely colors; would as eaſily feed mens eies with gazing admiration, as the large pictured tables of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue filled them with wonder.</p>
            <p>Being therefore contented (at this time) to ſwim but in a ſhallow ſtreame, of his Fame, ſithence greater ſayles are likely héereafter (and that very ſhortly) to ſwell with the true report of his actions, You ſhall vnderſtand that Sir <hi>ROBERT SHERLEY,</hi> after a long, a chargeable, and a dangerous progreſſe through moſt (if not all) the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in <hi>Europe,</hi> receiuing entertainment from the Princes of thoſe Dominions, ſitting to ſuch a ghueſt, deſire of glorie ſtill more and more burning within him. At the length, he left <hi>Europe,</hi> and trauelled into <hi>Aſia,</hi> receiuing noble entertainment at the hands of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> In whoſe Court he ſo well and ſo wiſely bore himſelfe in all his Actions, that the Perſian (with much of his loue, of which hee taſted moſt plenteouſly) heaped on his head many honorable fauours.</p>
            <p>That common enemy of Chriſt and Chriſtians, (the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26949:6"/>
Turke) lifting vp his ſword continually (for the moſt part) not onely againſt the <hi>Polack,</hi> the <hi>Hungarian, Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and other Princes of Chriſtendome, but alſo thirſting after the rich Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſhewing a mortall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to that Kingdome by being euer vp in Armes againſt it; It was thought fit that (the Perſian himſelfe confeſſing and worſhipping Chriſt,) Ayde ſhould bee required at the hands of Chriſtian Princes in the Perſians behalfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo barbarous, ſo ambitious and ſo generall an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Heerupon the honor of ſuch an Embaſſy, was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (by the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>) vpon Sir <hi>Robert Sherley,</hi> as a man worthy and apt to treate with Chriſtian princes in ſo weighty a buſineſſe, hee himſelfe being a Chriſtian born, and a gentleman that had Trauelled, and by experience knew the conditions, State, and pollicies of moſt of their Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore was he imployed into <hi>Poland,</hi> where by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> (the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and of <hi>Suecia</hi>) hee was receiued with great magnificence, and applauſe both of the <hi>Polack</hi> himſelfe and of his people.</p>
