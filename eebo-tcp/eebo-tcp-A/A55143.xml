            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And I heard a voice from Heaven, saying unto me,
Write, Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord,
from henceforth, yea saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labours, and their works do follow

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe more attentively we consider the
Christian Religion in any of its parts,
we find greater grounds for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
both of its Author and excellency; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
does it surpass all those writings of that
nature, which the great Sages of the World,
have, with so much superciliousness on their
part, and admiration from their respective fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
I may add too (all things considered)
not without meriting due praise from us, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their Scholars.</p>
            <p>And this will appear evident and undeniable
if we but parallel them in any of the chief heads;
for instance, in the <hi>principles</hi> upon which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
does proceed, the <hi>precepts</hi> it contains, and
the <hi>rewards</hi> it appoints; which division will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the summ of what we profess: In all which
the great Masters of Heathen wisdom, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover, either a great deal of Ignorance, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100911:3"/>
malice, in prevaricating that light they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
upon them from Jewish tradition, so that
it may be well doubted whether their Symbolick
Divinity were not design'd rather to conceal their
own Ignorance in what they pretended to, than
to secure the rites and mysteries thereof from the
vulgar's profanation. For example:</p>
            <p>1. Take first the <hi>Principles,</hi> those truths that
are the Basis and foundation of our Religion;
such as are the Being and Nature of God, the
Creation of the World, the Fall of man, and
his Redemption by a <hi>Messias,</hi> the Immortality
of the Soul, and the Resurrection; 'tis plain the
whole Philosophick world had none, or but a
very imperfect knowledge of almost all of them;
However some, of their lavish Charity, have
endeavour'd to squeeze as much from their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
Nay, that they were not without some
knowledge of our greatest Mysteries, <hi>viz.</hi> of
a <hi>Messias</hi> under their <hi>Daimono-Latria,</hi> and even of
the Trinity in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Triad, and the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body, under the Indians <hi>Palin-genesis:</hi>
But no body that has any veneration either for
the Scriptures, or but for Truth in general, but
must see and acknowledge that all this is but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
from them.</p>
            <p>Nor may we deny this further, that whatever
Notions of this kind they had, were but traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100911:3"/>
in respect of their Origine, and conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in reference to their ambiguity and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
            <p>2. The like is to be said of their <hi>Rules</hi> and
<hi>Precepts</hi> of virtuous living. For we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
thus much from them, that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
many excellent Institutes to their
Sects. You shall collect among them many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
admirable sayings, such as these;</p>
            <p>To know our selves; to abstain from vice; to bear
afflictions: to do justly, and speak truly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
do as we would be done by; <hi>and many more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed for that kind of Divinity which was
deducible from the Rules of common prudence
and observation, and depended not chiefly or
solely upon Divine Revelation, they have done
extraordinary well: And if they had not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
us with so many famous examples of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
too, it would not reflect so much upon the
Professors of Christianity, which in the spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of its precepts has as far exceeded all that
they have writ, as some of their Lives have most
of ours; though that be not to be imputed to our
Religion, unless it were justly chargeable upon
the vitiosity or defect of its Principles or Rules.</p>
            <p>Thus miserably however do we compensate
the Divine culture; and as if Nature abhorring so
great a disparity betwixt mankind, would thus bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100911:4"/>
the Heathen with the Christian World; by
opposing their Imperfect Knowledge, but severer
Vertue, to our diviner Laws, but greater licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Practice: Many of them having, by as great
proportions exceeded us in their endeavours after
goodness, as we do them in the knowledge and
other means of it.</p>
            <p>3. Last of all (which brings it to our present
subject) Christianity propounds nothing but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fairest and surest <hi>encouragement</hi> imaginable.
For the happiness of our Religion is both tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendently
superiour to their discoveries and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
of it; and then also we are sufficiently
and unquestionably assur'd hereof, <hi>i e.</hi> 'tis not
recommended to us upon plausible perswasions
and inconclusive arguments, but in the genuine
sence of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expressions, 1 Corinth. 2. 4.
<hi>in demonstration of the Spirit and Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we see there is a kind of peculiar excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in the Holy Scriptures, above all the Systems
of the greatest Moralists; the foundation of our
Obedience being laid upon clearer and better
principles, the practice of our obedience being
carried higher by the spirituality of its commands,
and the rewards of our obedience being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
greater, than what we can conceive,
much less could they promise or bestow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100911:4"/>
'Tis the last of these that is contain'd in the
Text, and for which I am to be further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
to ye in the prosecution of the
words I have read. <hi>And I heard a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
saying unto me, Write, Blessed,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have these following particulars principally
to be observed.</p>
            <p>1. The happiness of good men describ'd by
its <hi>general nature,</hi> they are <hi>blessed,</hi> and by its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral
parts, they <hi>rest from their labours, and their works
do follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> upon which this
happiness is promis'd and asserted, <hi>yea saith the
Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>time</hi> of its <hi>perfection</hi> and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
partly in this life, but not fully nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
till death, <hi>saying, Blessed are the dead that
dye in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And lastly, the <hi>Influence</hi> which the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of these premisses ought to have upon us,
both in Life and Death, in reference to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Patience. And</p>
            <p>I. To begin with the <hi>description</hi> of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
those rewards, which are propounded to us
for the encouragement of our Obedience and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
Which are so great, that I am utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
by what measures to describe them to ye.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100911:5"/>
The nature of that Celestial bliss as far transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all our present felicities, by which we should
judge of it; as it does the very capacity of our
meriting it.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> has observ'd, We can have
but a very imperfect accompt of those things,
which receed any whit near those extreams of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
and <hi>Infinity:</hi> because either by their parvity
or immensity, they elude or confound our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>And especially the latter, which choak the
understanding; and is like the beholding of the
Sun, whose light and lustre, by which we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
other objects, marrs, and dimms our
sight.</p>
            <p>Such is the transcendent excellency of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bliss, at once the delight and amazement of
our Intellectuals.</p>
            <p>In the description whereof our highest expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are so far from being hyperbolical, that they
amount but to a <hi>Litotes;</hi> so that after our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
endeavours we must content our selves with
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account of it, in his First and Second
Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ep. c. 2. v. 9. 2 Ep. ch. 12. v. 4.</note> his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and his
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unutterable,</hi> for that I take to be the
meaning (and not as we render it <hi>unlawful</hi>) of
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and also <hi>unconceiveable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100911:5"/>
So inevitably should we diminish the Glory
of Heaven, by any expression, illustration, or
parallel whatever.</p>
            <p>Which happiness of ours consists of, and is
integrated by these two parts.</p>
            <p>The total privation of all evil.</p>
            <p>And the aggregate enjoyment of all good.</p>
            <p>Both which as they are necessarily requisite to
the nature of the thing, so are they contain'd in
the very notion of the word.</p>
            <p>For as the plurality of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
[<hi>Ashrei</hi>] <hi>ostendit omnigenam beatitudinem;</hi> so more
expresly does the Etymology of the Greek word
answer hereunto, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> either from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
from evil, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> extremity of joy;
and accordingly 'tis describ'd in my Text, first
Privatively, and then Positively.</p>
            <p>1. For the <hi>privative</hi> part, <hi>Rest from their labours,</hi> or
which is all one, Immunity from Evil, by which
this happiness is oft-times describ'd: for though
the privation hereof simply and absolutely signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
no part hereof, the absence especially; for by
that reason you might call a stock or stone or any
other insensible creature happy, as by the other
a Horse or Dog might be said to be so when dead:
yet inasmuch as it is more than a negation,
namely the being deliver'd from a world of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
wherewith we are now infested, and more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100911:6"/>
which we had deserved, and were once obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to, which we also then behold in others of
the same make and nature with us; the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
hereof, by which it so widely differs from
both the Instances, must needs fill our mind with
an ineffable delight and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Or at least if this indolency be no part of our
happiness, yet is it so absolutely needful to it,
that we cannot tell well how to conceive of it
without this; and much less can such a thing be
as perfect happiness and degrees of misery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
together.</p>
            <p>Nor did ever any Sect of Philosophers think
otherwise, but those fullen and self-will'd Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks.
That ever any body should be so mad to
cry out in the extremity of pain and misery,
<hi>Quàm suave, quàm dulce hoc est, quàm hoc non curo!</hi>
And I cannot but laugh at <hi>Possidonius</hi> his Rant,
<hi>Nil agis, O Dolor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There are divers instances of such who have
born most exquisite miseries even to admiration,
as well out of a kind of hardiness of nature, as
greatness of mind; and in that they were less mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
than the delicate and impatient: but
whence was it? either from necessity, or hope, or
both; this is Christian-like, but that is bruitish, if
it were sufficient without t'other, but 'tis not, for
perpetuity would certainly render any evil intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100911:6"/>
So that we are so far from being completely
happy as long as any disease or inquietude of
mind or body does attend us; that the hope of
being delivered is the only argument that can
afford us any solid and rational comfort in our
afflictions: For as to fatality, <hi>hoc ipsum est,</hi> said
<hi>Augustus</hi> when one urg'd it; and for the disease of
Impatiency, 'tis (as one has excellently observ'd)
no proper consideration of comfort, but only an
art of managing our trouble; so as not to make
it greater than really it is.</p>
            <p>2. The other part of our happiness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the main, we call <hi>positive,</hi> and consists in
the enjoyment of all good; and is what St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
intends by <hi>their works following them;</hi> i. e. they
shall then receive all those glorious rewards that
God has promis'd to good and righteous men for
all their service and obedience. We should in
vain go about to recount them, they are so many
and so great.</p>
            <p>In two things the Scriptures chiefly place it;
in the <hi>vision,</hi> and in the <hi>fruition</hi> of God. <hi>This
is life Eternal,</hi> saith this very St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<hi>to know thee the only true God, and Iesus Christ;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 3.</note>
and again in his 1 Ep. Ch. 3. v. 2. <hi>It doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what we shall be; but we know that when he doth
appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi>
The other is call'd <hi>the being with Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100911:7"/>
               <hi>united</hi> to him. St. <hi>Iohn 17. 21. That they all
may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that
they also may be one in us.</hi> But this is not to exclude
the other instances of our happiness, indeed it
comprehends all the rest.</p>
            <p>For what are all the pleasures and contentments
of the World, but as so many rays of that Sun
and emanations of that fountain?</p>
            <p>They are all contain'd with much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in God, than they were created in their
own natures: Whereupon it follows that they
which are admitted into his presence, have all
the goodness and perfections of all the creatures
in the world united in God.</p>
            <p>So that whatever can delight either body or
mind, there it is; nor will there be any room to
wish for or imagine more than what we have;
there being in him (as an ingenious man expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it) such a various Identity, that the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him at once satisfies and creates desires,
that without fatiety, this without disquiet.</p>
            <p>3. To which if we add the <hi>eternal duration</hi> of
this state, we attribute unto it a kind of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Infinities, a potential Infinity in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
actual in the object, and eternal in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of it:</p>
            <p>Which single consideration is sufficient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it to an infinite preference above all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100911:7"/>
things imaginable; because these things being
founded in matter, and that being in continual
flux and motion, here can be nothing perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and lasting. Nor indeed would that be any
addition to our present felicity. 'Tis variety
that makes these things appear excellent; their
mutability, is both the life and death of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
delights.</p>
            <p>A few repetitions make us abhor our food;
in less than a night and a day we grow weary of
our Beds; and 'tis so in all the other instances of
our Nature, and 'tis more so in those of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>But 'tis otherwise in the attainment of the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
end, where all our appetites are arrested and
detain'd.</p>
            <p>Indeed we no sooner experience these things in
the fruition, but we straightway nauseate them;
finding them so pitifully allay'd with mixtures
of evil, and prove so miserably short of what we
desire and expect from them. But 'tis otherwise
there, the excellency of those Celestial Objects
will disappoint our expectation by their transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
as much as in all other fruitions their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiness
is wont to do.</p>
            <p>So that Eternity, though but a circumstance
which does only superinduce a kind of extremity
or perfection to what it is conjoyn'd with; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100911:8"/>
may as well be drawn in to enhanse our misery,
(for what more than this makes the condition of
the damn'd so horribly dreadful, whereby they
are excluded from all hope, the very seed and
lowest degree of felicity?) Yet is it so necessary
to what we are speaking of, as that without it
those joys of Heaven, though otherwise absolute
and infinite, would suffer a contradiction, and
become imperfect: And that not only for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but the present, by introducing such passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as must needs debase and allay the highest
delights.</p>
            <p>So that by being thus secur'd in the possession
of our happiness, we receive thereby an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
addition to it.</p>
            <p>II. Proceed we next to shew you the <hi>Security</hi>
and <hi>Evidence,</hi> upon which this happiness is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
and asserted, and whether it bear any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to our duty and the <hi>Rewards</hi> of it, for so
we are allow'd to call them; though not upon
the account of merit, yet by reason of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
connexion with, dependance upon, and
that kind (such a one as 'tis) of proportion they
bear to each other.</p>
            <p>There is a two-fold evidence God Almighty
has given us, for the strengthning of our hope,
and confirming of our faith, in the belief and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100911:8"/>
expectation of the other World. The first <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
grounded upon the testimony of the Spirit;
the other I call <hi>natural,</hi> and is grounded in the
things themselves.</p>
            <p>1. The first evidence of our future bliss, is the
testimony of the Spirit, express in the Text, <hi>Yea,
saith the Spirit.</hi> But then we must have a care of what
kind of Testimony of the Spirit we understand it:
for, understand it as 'tis vulgarly taken, for some
act or operation wrought in and upon us, besides
the Enthusiasm of it, fain would I be satisfy'd,
what validity can there be in such a testimony, as it
self needs something else to confirm it? for so this
testimony of the Spirit is to be tryed by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance
and agreement to the word of God,
nor do I know any other way to distinguish it
from a motion or suggestion of the Devil's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
And though to err thus in this single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
may not be very pernicious, for I am not
mighty solicitous, how it was wrought, so there
be a firm perswasion in us of this truth; yet in
other cases I know how dangerous it is, nor is it
safe in this, for it leaves a passage open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
to down-right Atheism.</p>
            <p>By the testimony of the Spirit therefore I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the word of God; or the Scriptures as
made known and prov'd to us to deriv'd from
this Divine Spirit, which we may call the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100911:9"/>
testimony thereof: for though St. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew
this by the other way, as most certainly all others
did who received any Revelation; yet never
was any other than the person himself assur'd that
way.</p>
            <p>Nor do I make degrees of more or less certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the way or manner of the Spirit's revealing a
thing; for the Apostles were as well assur'd of the
infallibility of their doctrine before they wrought
any miracles, as we are by them: but we were
not nor could be so.</p>
            <p>But this notwithstanding, in respect of us we
must admit of such degrees; for no body I hope
will be so blasphemous to equal such private
dictates they have in their own breast to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
authority of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>So then I make this to be the <hi>moral</hi> evidence of
future happiness: God hath said it in his word.
And this I call a <hi>moral</hi> certainty, not in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to divine and infallible; as they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
contradistinguish'd; but only to natural:
for we can desire no greater evidence, we cannot
have a higher confirmation of any truth, than the
veracity of Heaven to attest it.</p>
            <p>I do not know any proposition that carries
greater self-evidence than this, That God ought
to be believ'd in what he says; and therefore
though we may question the truth of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100911:9"/>
'tis impossible to do so of any thing we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be so revealed.</p>
            <p>So that the stress of this point lyes upon that
great and necessary <hi>praecognitum</hi> in our Religion;
namely, the Divine authority of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
Upon which postulate if we proceed,
there is as great certainty of the truth of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
That good men shall enjoy eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
after this life; as if we should again hear that
Daughter of voice, and God himself should sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
attest it.</p>
            <p>2. But there is another ground or evidence of
our future happiness which I call <hi>natural,</hi> because
it depends upon that Intrinsick Relation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
there is between goodness and it; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them being only in degree, like
the dawning of the Morning to the lustre of the
Noon. For what is it to be happy but to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God? and what does unite us to God but
Love? and what is the love of God but Religion?
And if you remove but all inward imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all outward impediments, there remains
no difference at all. So that Virtue and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do not only dispose and prepare us for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Salvation, but we thereby receive and
experience the very beginnings and anticipations
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100911:10"/>
And though in respect of the mutability of our
will and affections toward God and goodness in
this world, we cannot be infallibly assur'd of it
as to our own particulars; because every alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the one produceth a like answerable effect
as to the other: Yet in the general we may, even
from hence, be very well assur'd hereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is nothing more requir'd to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of our essential happiness, than an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and progression in the same vertuous
tract.</p>
            <p>And however it looks in a Divine, if we will
speak rationally to the thing, we must allow the
love and hatred of God to be the true natural
causes of our salvation and damnation, even
of their very eternity; it being naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be other than happy while we love
God, and contrariwise if we hate him; and this is
the only instant cause of its continuation through
all the durations of Eternity. And to remove
your astonishment, see, how in this lower
world, many stupendous and admirable works
are daily produc'd which were mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
while they lay hid and contain'd in the
seminal beginnings; after the same wonderful
manner by divers minute gradations does this
divine Creature grow up from its first formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our trembling and unstable desires, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100911:10"/>
the stature and perfection of Everlasting Glory.</p>
            <p>And yet there remains less doubt if we
take in the Consideration of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
How else will you vindicate the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God in all the odd and confused oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of this World? Where's your infinite
goodness and bounty, that suffers its servants
always to be neglected? what will become of
an almighty and omniscient Justice if sinners are
never call'd to an accompt? Or one, or t'other
cannot be.</p>
            <p>III. 'Tis true indeed the compleating of this
bliss (which brings us to our next head) is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
promis'd, nor to be had in this life. 'Tis
at <hi>Death</hi> these rewards become due and payable.</p>
            <l>—Dicique beatus</l>
            <l>Ante obitum nemo, supremáque funera possit.</l>
            <p>It has been the constant method of Divine
providence, to cause the most excellent things to
follow and arise from the most uncouth and
unlikely. Thus in the Creation order springs
from confusion, and the Light is made to attend
the darkness.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the methods observ'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where the causes are ever more worthy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100911:11"/>
than their effects from their first beginning down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Now as he is pleas'd to transcend and deviate
from the tracts and capacities of natural Agents,
thereby to assert his Prerogative, and render his
omnipotency more conspicuous to the world:
So is he no less delighted to use the same recesses
in displaying his Grace; evermore ushering in
his mercies with the Black Rod, thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hansing
and endearing our subsequent refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>And though the goodness of those celestial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
and the happiness of their condition,
need neither foyl nor artifice to render that or
their acknowledgements of the Divine favour
greater: Yet however if we consider these things
as a reward and incouragement of our obedience,
the proceeding thus is but regular and necessary;
that we should do our work before we receive our
wages, and finish our undertaking, before we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Earnest and Security Heaven has vouchsaf'd
us, but to deposite the whole in hand, this
were, not to encourage but bribe our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
This were to destroy Morality, and turn
Vertue into Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100911:11"/>
Nor yet is the Divine goodness less communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
in this life, but we are not so capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it.</p>
            <p>For look as in Nature neither the single excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Object or the Agent alone is sufficient
to produce any notable effect, but both are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd:
So likewise in Religion, all the effects
of the divine grace and bounty (though that be
free and infinite) are limited and determin'd by
our capacities and reception.</p>
            <p>So that while our Appetites, those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as they are call'd in Scripture, that are to be the
receptacles of all this Glory, are, either reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with the vain and sinful objects of this
Life, or, are straitned and contracted by the
weakness and imperfection of this dull and lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
matter, they must be rid of the one and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
of the other, and then, we should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
happy.</p>
            <p>You have seen the happiness of the Christian
man; there are indeed encouragements of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature, namely, earthly blessings and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
rewards, our whole present interest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it happen to interfere at any time with the
other. Religion has descended to the securing
of these too, and that not only by moral designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by a proper and natural efficiency; so
that we cannot better prosecute our present inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100911:12"/>
than by the methods of Religion. And by
this gracious and happy complication of the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> together, they are made to
become helpful and assisting to each other, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reciprocally as a means or motive either to
other.</p>
            <p>But this encouragement is neither proper nor
adequate to Christianity; since it may be as well
pursu'd by natural, as by divine rules, better
perhaps by diabolical arts than either, nothing
experimentally so inriching men, as sordidness,
oppression, and other violences and frauds.
The Devil in all likelihood, giving the fairest
prospect, and most likely possession of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and glory of this world.</p>
            <p>But they are things, I have shewn you, of a
nature infinitely more sublime, that Christianity
propounds to its observers; The rewards of
our Religion, exceeding as well the capacities
of our Nature, as all those other things. To
the attainment whereof, as all vicious practices
are extremely contrary; so have all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Philosophick transactions been miserably
vain.</p>
            <p>Some weak and glimmering light the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
had of these things; which it is not certain
whether they collected from some fragments of
tradition, or extracted from the principles of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100911:12"/>
natural reason; but which way ever it came, it
was so weak and imperfect, as serv'd to shadow,
not help to discover, but eclipse the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
excellency of that State; till, as the Great
Apostle of the Gentiles saith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
were brought to light by the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed without this all other proposals
were unsuitable to its professors, and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to the difficulty and severities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <q>None ought to be deem'd
a vertuous or a just man, that will be allur'd
affrighted from his duty, by any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
or disadvantage whatever</q>: But who,
trow ye, would abide both these, upon no
other consideration, than barely to have acted
according to the sentiments of right Reason, or
in hope to acquire an insignificant fame of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
of which they could have no knowledge or
remembrance after death?</p>
            <p>And for this cause I judge the Stoicks more
absurd in their morals, than the Epicureans,
considering the principles that is upon which
they built. For 'tis the premise and not the
inference of theirs, that's so urg'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>Let us eat and drink,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 32. But
now the Christian Religion propunds such
overtures to our Obedience and Patience,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100911:13"/>
as may justly and reasonably encourage us
thereunto.</p>
            <p>IV. For a Conclusion, let us take in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of that Phrase of [<hi>dying in the Lord</hi>]
which relates primarily to Martyrdome; but
must also be extended to as many as live and dye
in the faith of the Holy Jesus.</p>
            <p>The result of all is this: That we would so
consider this happiness, as every of our great
interest, that we forfeit not our propriety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by a vicious and sinful life. There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else can render it hazardous or doubtful,
but that, which indeed in the very nature of
the thing renders it impossible. Let us not
repeat <hi>Esau</hi>'s folly, sell our birth-right for a trifle;
and for the sake of some pitiful lust proscribe our
selves out of our celestial inheritance.</p>
            <p>Neither let us contemn our happiness for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feasible. Were wilful poverty and certain
Martyrdome, part of our duty, and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
appendages of our Religion, there is tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enough in the proposals, to make us conflict
with the greatest difficulties, and overcome them.</p>
            <p>When Christianity was thus attended, and
had nothing else to recommend it self to the
world, besides the reasonableness of its injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100911:13"/>
with what holy violence did those blessed
Saints storm Heaven, and with a strange eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
pursue Martyrdome! But now as if the
fervour of our Devotion were only kindled and
maintain'd by <hi>Antiperistasis:</hi> Now I say the
Impediments are remov'd, and Religion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a part of our Civil obedience, and made
necessary to our secular interests, and guarded
with a great many other temporal Phylacteries,
men are yet more hardly wrought upon to be
Religious, the consideration of a single lust shall
be able to weigh down all.</p>
            <p>And if any would seem to have a greater
zeal for it than ordinary, as if they were in love
with the troubles of Religion, and not the thing;
they suffer their heat to spend it self in little
piques and contentions, and about things of
none or ill moment, in maintaining of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and opposing their Superiours, and not in
Devotion, Obedience, Charity, Humility, and
the like, as they ought.</p>
            <p>In short, Christians, let the thoughts of this
blessedness, excite our affections Heaven-ward,
and quicken our endeavours: Let it animate
us against all difficulties, and buoy us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all adversities; Let it cheer us in our
duty, quiet us in affliction, and comfort us in
death. That so living unto Christ, we may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100911:14"/>
at last dye in him, and in the end be for ever
blessed.</p>
            <p>And now to accommodate all to our present
case. It has pleas'd God to take away this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
man, for such, considering all things,
we must needs allow him; and because 'twas
somewewhat early, I think of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Text, the sooner the better,
the better for him, no doubt.</p>
            <p>I had once thought to have given you his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
but I am not asham'd to tell you, I found
me not able to do it worthy of him. And cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to mind a saying of one of the Roman Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
I soon desisted from any further attempt
of it; who when he was reckoning up some of
the great men of that age, <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid, Livie</hi>
and <hi>Salust,</hi> and going to commend them, stops,
and concludes thus: <q>But of men of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as their admiration is great, so is their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
full of difficulty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to those Relations that are more nearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed
in this solemnity; I would beseech them
to remember, that all Indecency and excess of
Grief, for our deceased friends, must needs reflect
upon the memory of the dead, or the discretion of
the survivers. God enable them to bear it: And
supply this loss to them by his Grace and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
Let me say, and to the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100911:14"/>
by increasing the number of such men, of
no worse Learning, Integrity, and Courage;
that are able, and dare defend her against
the encroachments of Popery and Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme.</p>
            <p>Now to God only wise be Glory through Iesus Christ
for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
