            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A TRUE RELATION OF TWO Prodigious BIRTHS, The like not hapning in many Generations, the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is left to the judicious to contemplate.</head>
            <p>NOt to be troubleſom with a tedious Inſignificant Preamble, irkſom to a curious Reader, and uſually the common Prologue to notorious Lyes. I ſhall here acquaint the Judicious Reader with Two Strange Births as any Age hath produced: And the Knowledge of them came to me on this Account:</p>
            <p>A Friend, (and considerable Citizen of <hi>London</hi> living in <hi>Cheap-ſide</hi> nigh the Nags-head Tavern,) ſending to a near Relation, in <hi>Summerſet</hi> ſhire, an Account of the ſtrange Hail, which fell in <hi>London,</hi> on Tueſday the 18th of <hi>May</hi> 1680. &amp;c. of the which they had not heard in thoſe parts: Anſwered his Kindneſs with a Relation of theſe Admirable Births; as acceptable to him, as his to them <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>On <date>
                     <hi>May</hi> 19. 1680.</date>
               </head>
               <p>IN <hi>Summerſet-ſhire,</hi> near <hi>Taunton Dean,</hi> at a Place called <hi>Eill Brawars</hi> Was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brought to Bed with Two Children: They grow together ſide to ſide from the Arm-pits to the Hip-Bone; They have two Fundaments whereby to avoid their Excrements; They have alſo two Paſſages for their Urine; yet have they but one Navel, by which both were nouriſhed while in the VVomb; both ſuck together, or are both equally deſirous of Nouriſhment together; and as they equally covet Refreſhment, ſo they are equally ſenſible of their Grief and Pain, for they weep and expreſs their Sorrow together: They are both Chriſtned, and called by the Names of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Births being thus with their Bodies ſtrangely united, hath proved very much Advantagious to their Parents, by the numerous Acceſs of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who come to ſee the Children from many Miles round about, and give the Parents conſiderably.</p>
               <p>ALſo, within a few Miles of this Town, which is likewiſe admirable, A Cow was Calving, but dying before ſhe could bring forth, ſhe was Cut open, and in her Body was found two Calves grown together, and were joyned by their Bellies, their Fore-legs clinched about each other: they have two Heads, 8 legs, and two Tails.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This hapned likewiſe about the ſame time when the woman was delivered. And hath beheld to Admirations. The Truth hereof will be certified at Mr.</hi> Jones'<hi>s Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee houſe behind the Exchange in Ship yard, in Bartholomew Lane.</hi>
