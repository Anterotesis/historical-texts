         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing unexpectedly called out of my Obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to the Glory of ſerving your Highneſs,
(and indeed the whole Court) in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
ſo conſiderable as this; my fears
and amazements were ſuch as (I believe) Shepherds and
Herdſmen had of old, when from their Flocks and
Herds they were call'd to Propheſie to Kings. I knew
not how to interpret the meaning of that Command,
which laid on ſuch feeble ſhoulders, a burden too heavy
for the ſtrongeſt to bear. Fain would I have ſhrunk back
again into my former ſhades, and hid my ſelf in my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Obſcurity; but fearing to diſpute with Oracles, and
reſiſt Heavenly Powers, I adventur'd on dangerous Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
knowing that if I muſt periſh, it was better to
periſh a Martyr, than a Criminal. But recollecting my
ſelf, I remembred that Divine Commands were Preſages
rather of Favour, than Ruine; That when Heaven
preſt any to his Wars, he gave 'em Courage, as well as
Pay: This made me hope, that in the glorious Work to
which I was called, I ſhould be inſpired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56508:3"/>
And this I thought it my duty to believe, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
in whoſe Service I was employ'd, in the Service
of a Princeſs, over whoſe great and victorious Father, a
glorious <hi>Genius</hi> alwayes hover'd, aſſiſting the meaneſt
of his Followers, when engaged in Services of his, of
what kind ſoever; and ſure (thought I) he will not
neglect me, now I ſerve ſo fair, ſo excellent, and ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a part of him; now I am under the ſhadow of his
wings, I ſhall partake of his influence. This made me
think it a ſin to deſpair, and thruſt me on with all the
boldneſs and giddineſs (but, to my ſorrow, not with the
exalted Raptures) of one inſpired: For, after all, it
was not with me according to my Faith. This Poem ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
too little of Inſpiration, and too much of my own
weak unaſſiſted ſelf: Nay, as it was firſt written it came
even ſhort of my ſelf, and ſure that muſt be a wretched
thing which wants the perfection I can give it. And
though no man is to blame for having no more Wit than
he has, yet he is an ill-manner'd Churle, who will not
ſpend his whole ſtock to entertain ſuch a Gueſt. For my
defects and inabilities, Nature alone muſt anſwer, (and I
am heartily ſorry for them) but I muſt, with all ſubmiſſion,
charge your Highneſs with being the occaſion of my latter
Offence. If you will invite your Self to the greateſt Table in
<hi>England,</hi> and not give 'em time to prepare, you will not
find an Entertainment fit for you. A Poem, is a thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of many and different Images; and though a Man's
Eſtate be but ſmall, yet if it lies in many hands, it will
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>equire time to get it in. Nature her ſelf proceeds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſlowly, and gradually, to Perfection; nay, we find
<pb facs="tcp:56508:3"/>
Heaven pondering and conſulting, when he was to make
a Creature on which he meant to beſtow Excellence. I
will not pretend, that I have Materials in me, to have
formed a Poem of ſuch perfection, as ſo great an Occaſion
required; but I am certain I could have written ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more worthy of your Highneſſes Favor, and the
great Honor to which this was preferred, had I had time
enough allowed me to ripen my Conceptions. But (Madam)
if your Highneſs did expect, I ſhould have endited
Thoughts fine as your own; and made you ſpeak as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
as you think, you then laid a task on me too great
for any thing but an Angel For none can have Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Thoughts, but they who have Angelical Virtues; and
none do, or ever did, in ſo much Youth, come ſo near the
perfection of Angels as your Self, and your young Princely
Siſter, in whom all thoſe Excellencies ſhine, which the beſt
of us can but rudely paint. But, Madam, what need was
there of that perfection of Wit, the Charms of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Youth, and Meen, the Luſtre of your high Quality,
and the extraordinary Grace that attended every thing
you ſaid and did, ſpoke to the Eyes and Souls of all that
ſaw you, in a Language more Divine than Wit can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
in a Language wherein Nature entertain'd 'em
with her own Ingenuity, and by a thouſand charming Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
ſo took up all their attention, that the beſt of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
could not have made you ſpeak any thing, your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
would have been at leiſure to regard, or for which
they would have deſcended from one moments pleaſure of
admiring you. The foreſight of this, made Fortune, who
alwayes loves to favor the leaſt deſerving, throw the
<pb facs="tcp:56508:4"/>
honour of this ſervice on me: ſhe knew there was no need
of Excellence in a Writer, when there was ſo much in
you; and ſince the beſt of Writers would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
conſiderable, indulged her humor in ſelecting the
worſt: A favor, which in many reſpects exalts me above
all my Contemporaries, and will make the World judge
me, though not the beſt, the happieſt Writer of the
Age.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, as it is the Fate of all things to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to inconſtancy, and neither happineſs nor miſery laſt
long, eſpecially when in Extremes: This Poem, made
like the firſt Man, by the Command, and for the Service
of a Divinity, (almoſt out of nothing too) and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the inſtant of its formation, in a Paradiſe of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
and Honor, now driven from its bleſt Eſtate, and
its ever flouriſhing Gardens, is going to wander round
the World, in a condition of Poverty, Miſery, and Exile;
where, in ſtead of its paſt Felicities, the many Viſions of
Heaven, when the ſoveraign Glories of this Iſle deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
frequently to viſit (and ſeem'd to recreate themſelves
in) its Bowers; inſtead of the extreme Luſtre it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the moſt graceful action of your Highneſs,
of the Princeſs <hi>Anne</hi> your Siſter, and of the other young
Ladies, which like ſo many beautiful Angels attended
you, it is now condemned to Want and Nakedneſs, to
ſtarve under the cold wind of Cenſure, to all the ſufferings
that the Native of a rich and happy Soyle, muſt expect
when baniſht to cold and barbarous Regions. In this
condition, forced by its miſery, and bound by the duty of
a Creature, it makes this humble Sacrifice of it ſelf to
<pb facs="tcp:56508:4"/>
your Highneſs, to beg ſuch a ſhare of your Protection and
Favor, as may enable it to live in a condition, becoming
a Creature which had once the Honor to be ſo near to you,
and to receive ſuch particular Graces from you. Your
Highneſſes Favor will yet make it ſpend its dayes in
Honor, revive with pleaſure the remembrance of the paſt
Glories, and give an immortality, not only to this poor
Poem, but to the (otherwiſe) moſt obſcure name of,</p>

            <p>IF you were ever a Spectator of this following Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when it was Repreſented in its Glory, you will
come (if you come at all) with very dull Appetite, to this cold
lean Carkaſs of it. The Dancing, Singing, Muſick, which
were all in the higheſt Perfection, the moſt graceful Action,
incomparable Beauty, and rich and ſplendid Habit of the
Princeſſes, whoſe Luſtre received no moderate encreaſe
from the Beauties and rich Habits of the Ladies who had
the Honor to accompany 'em, and ſhare in the performance,
muſt needs have afforded you a delight ſo extraordinary,
that this will appear very inſipid. If you have never ſeen
it, then (perhaps) you may receive ſome pleaſure; but
yet (I fear) not ſo much as you expect. You (no doubt)
will imagine, (and you have reaſon) that an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo much honoured and adorned, followed at innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Rehearſals, and all the Repreſentations by throngs of
Perſons of the greateſt Quality, and deſigned for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Divertiſements of Their Majeſties, and Royal
Highneſſes, and accordingly very often Graced with Their
Preſences, ſhould be ſome ſuperlative piece. But you will
be diſappointed, you will find nothing here anſwer thoſe
ſwelling expectations. How it happens to be ſo, it is enough
to tell you, That it was written by me; and it would be
very ſtrange, if a bad Writer ſhould write well: but, which
was as great an unhappineſs, I had not time enough allowed
me, to muſter together, on ſo great an occaſion, thoſe few
Abilities I have; I was invaded, on the ſudden, by a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Command, to prepare an Entertainment for the Court,
<pb facs="tcp:56508:6"/>
which was to be written, learnt, practiſed, and performed,
in leſs time than was neceſſary for the writing alone. True,
it was not performed, till ſome Months after the time firſt
decreed, but that hapned from the diſcretion of thoſe on
whom the Dancing and Muſical parts depended, who found
it required time to do any thing in Perfection; but I not
knowing it would be ſo deferred, finiſhed my Part within
the time firſt alotted me, which was ſcarce a Month: not
only for the <hi>Play,</hi> but the <hi>Prologue,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> the Nature of
which I was wholly a ſtranger to, having never ſeen any
thing of the kind; and by theſe means, I was forced upon
a brisk dullneſs, writing quick, but flat I was alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
in the number of the Perſons; I had but ſeven allow'd
me, neither more nor leſs: thoſe ſeven to be all Ladies, and
of thoſe Ladies, two onely were to appear in Mens Habits.
Next, for my Subject, it was not, I confeſs, impoſed upon
me by Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it was for want of time to find a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For I had but ſome few hours allow'd me to chooſe
one. And as Men who do things in haſte, have commonly
ill Fortune, as well as ill Conduct; I reſolving to chooſe the
firſt tolerable Story I could meet with, unhappily encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
this, where, by my own raſhneſs, and the malice of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
I involved my ſelf, before I was aware, in a difficulty
greater than the invention of the Philoſophers Stone, that
only endeavors to extract Gold out of the courſeſt Metals,
but I employed my ſelf to draw one contrary out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
to write a clean, decent, and inoffenſive Play, on the
Story of a Rape, ſo that I was engaged in this Dilemma, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly to deviate from my Story, and ſo my Story
would be no Story, or by keeping to it, write what would
be unfit for Princeſſes and Ladies to ſpeak, and a Court to
hear. That which tempted me into ſo great a Labyrinth,
was the fair and beautiful Image that ſtood at the Portall, I
mean, the exact and perfect Character of Chaſtity, in the
perſon of <hi>Caliſto,</hi> which I thought a very proper Character
for the Princeſs to repreſent; nor was I miſtaken in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the difficulty lay in the other part of the Story, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb facs="tcp:56508:6"/>
Chaſtity, was eaſie, the danger was in aſſaulting it; I
was to ſtorm it, but not to wound it; to ſhoot at it, but not
offend it; my Arrows were to be inviſible, and without
Piles; my Guns were to be charged with white Powder;
the Bullets were to flie, but give no Report. Theſe were
Niceties required skill to perform, and would have puzled a
finer Invention than mine; and, indeed, I did a little fail in
my firſt attempt; my Arrows (though as fine as I could then
in haſte turn 'em) yet were too courſe for a Court. I often
pared 'em, and much difficulty I found to make 'em thin
enough to paſs through nice and delicate Ears, without
wounding 'em, an Art which with much pains in this Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
I attained. The laſt, and not the leaſt, difficulty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on me in the Entertainment, was in the Choruſſes; I
was obliged to invent proper Occaſions, to introduce all the
Entries; and particularly, for the cloſing of all with an
Entry of <hi>Africans.</hi> How I have ſucceeded in it, I leave the
Reader to judge. Under all theſe difficulties did this poor
Poem labour even before it was an <hi>Embrio,</hi> and when ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in its cauſes; and when in the womb it was ſqueez'd, and
hinder'd of its due growth by intolerable ſtrait lacings; and
laſtly, forced on an immature and haſty birth; by all which
inconveniences, it was impoſſible it ſhould prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than a weak, lean, ricketty, deformed piece, and
as ſuch (notwithſtanding the kindneſs it received from
others,) it was looked on by me; and accordingly I was
impatient till I had ſtrangled it, and in the room produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſomething leſs imperfect, ſomething of a conſtitution
ſtrong enough to endure the blows of its Enemies, and
of a Complexion beautiful enough to delight its Parents
and Friends, and ſuch a thing (in ſome low degree at
leaſt) this is which you ſee. Far be it from me, to ſay
it is as well as it ought to be, or as others of greater
Abilities would have written it. Nor (give me leave to
ſay) ſo well as I my ſelf would have done on a better Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and in leſs haſte; for this was written in a hurry as well
as the former, being finiſhed and learnt between the ſecond
<pb facs="tcp:56508:7"/>
and third Repreſentation; but having the advantage of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and dead Colours laid, it was eaſie to work ſomething
on that foundation better than the former; and I undertook
the trouble, not only to repair my own Reputation, but to
give ſome refreſhment to the Audiences, who would have
been weary of a better Play at the ſecond or third Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,
and therefore muſt needs be weary of that at the
20<hi>th</hi> or 30<hi>th,</hi> for near ſo often it had been Rehearſed and
Acted.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, will expect I ſhould not only Apologize
for not writing better, but daring on ſuch an occaſion to
write at all; but having ſaid it was done by Command,
none can have ſo little manners as to expect I ſhould make
excuſe for Obedience. I muſt confeſs it was great pity,
that in an Entertainment where the Senſe was ſo deliciouſly
feaſted, the Underſtanding ſhould be ſo ſlenderly treated;
and had it been written by him, to whom by the double right
of place and merit, the honour of the employment belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the pleaſure had been in all kinds complete. However
this appeared not ſo contemptible, but it attained the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
for which it was made, to afford ſome delight to His
Royal Mind, to whoſe Pleaſure all our endeavors ought
to be, and this more particularly was devoted. And of
this I have full aſſurance, by the beſt, and to me moſt pleaſing
teſtimony of it, that of His moſt Princely bounty. Having
ſaid this, the devouring Critick muſt ceaſe his purſuit, for
the poor Sinner is out of the reach of his Fangs, and ſafe in
Glory. And now it is at my courteſie to make any farther
Apologies, yet becauſe I know the Criticks will be nibling at
any thing they think they can catch, I muſt now anſwer for
ſome Errors, which I ſuppoſe they hope I have ignorantly,
but I confeſs to have wilfully committed. I have in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
repreſented the River <hi>Thames</hi> by a Woman, and <hi>Europe</hi>
by a Man, contrary to all Authority and Antiquity. To that
I anſwer, I know of no Sexes in Lands and Rivers, nor of
any Laws in Poetry, but the fundamental one to pleaſe; they
who do that, follow the higheſt Authority, and agree with
<pb facs="tcp:56508:7"/>
the beſt Antiquity. The principal part of the <hi>Prologue</hi> being
the River, my buſineſs was not to conſider how the <hi>Latin</hi>
Poets painted it, but how to repreſent it beſt and moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
on our Stage; not to trouble my head with <hi>hic haec hoo,</hi>
to pleaſe the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> but how to have the Part ſung
beſt to delight the Court; and the graceful motions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
ſinging of Mrs. <hi>Davis,</hi> did ſufficiently prove the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of my choice. And <hi>Thames, Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> being
repreſented by Women, I was neceſſitated (in ſpite of the
Lady that beſtrid the Bull) to make <hi>Europe</hi> a Man, and to call
it not <hi>Her</hi> but—<hi>His fair Continent</hi>—Otherwiſe I muſt either
have ſpoiled the Figure, and made three parts of the World
Men, and one a Woman; or worſe, by repreſenting 'em all
by Women, have ſpoiled the Muſick by making it conſiſt all
of Trebles. But theſe are Criticiſms for none but thoſe of
School-boys learning, and School-boys underſtandings.
Some other Faults there are in the Style and Expreſſion,
which, Reader, if you can diſcover, you may inſult over as
you think fit, the whole having obtained the happineſs to
pleaſe, I ſhall not concern my ſelf for every trifling Error
which ſlipt from me unawares, and which I had not leiſure to
mend; perhaps you may find fault with my different Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that I have not kept to one kind of Verſe, but written
part in Pindarique, and part Heroique. To that I anſwer,
the Pindarique is what I left of the old Play uncorrected, as
not needing Emendation; and I choſe that kind of meaſure
at firſt, not as the beſt, and moſt pleaſing to the ear, but as
the readieſt and quickeſt for one that was in haſte; it being
in compariſon of the grave Heroique, a kind of mixt pace,
betwixt ambling and galloping, where the Poet is not bound
to wait the leiſure of a ſtubborn ſyllable to Rime, but to
take the Rime where he can catch it, without any more
trouble. But upon the correction, I choſe the Heroique as
more Majeſtick, Lofty and Muſical, and (as I hope) made
Emendation, both in Senſe and Sound.</p>
            <p>Having made this little vindication of my ſelf, I were now
bound in gratitude (before I conclude) to record the due
<pb facs="tcp:56508:8"/>
praiſes of thoſe whoſe admirable performances in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds, lent this Entertainment much of the praiſe it had;
namely, the Singers, and the Compoſer of all the Muſick both
Vocal and Inſtrumental Mr. <hi>Staggins;</hi> but their excellencies
lying far out of that road my underſtanding travels in, I
ſhould praiſe 'em ſo ignorantly, if I ſhould attempt it, that I
ſhould diſcover my own folly, more than their merit. But
if the judgments of others, and thoſe the moſt skilful too,
be not miſtaken, Mr. <hi>Staggins</hi> has not only delighted us with
his excellent Compoſition, but with the hopes of ſeeing in a
very ſhort time a Maſter of Muſick in <hi>England,</hi> equal to any
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> have produced. No leſs praiſe may be ſaid of
the beſt and choiceſt of the Singers. But Reader, I ſhall
detain you no longer, now take what pleaſure you can find
in the peruſal of the following Pages.</p>

            <l>But I will ſpoil their hopes, and break my vow,</l>
            <l>For I've conſider'd there are Stars enow:</l>
            <l>And this inferiour World can ſcarce diſpence</l>
            <l>With the entire loſs of ſo much Excellence.</l>
            <l>With each of you I can oblige a Throne,</l>

            <l>Will in good manners to a Nymph ſubmit,</l>
            <l>And own whatever Beauty ſpeaks for Wit.</l>
