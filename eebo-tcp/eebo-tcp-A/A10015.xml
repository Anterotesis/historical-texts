         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this whole
context from
the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Chapter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10941:6"/>
to the end of this
verse, the Apostle
doth five things,
first he reproves his
dispersed brethren of
the Iewish nation for
divers of their sinnes.
Secondly, He shewes
the cause of all these
sinnes: Thirdly, The
meanes to avoide
them. Fourthly, The
hinderances and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
hereof that
it takes not effect.
Lastly, The way and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10941:6"/>
course to be taken
for the removall of
these impediments.
The sinnes or vices
here principally taxed
are foure. First, their
contentions, illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the cause of
them, vers, 1. <hi>viz.</hi> Their
lusts which fought in
their members, <hi>from
whence come warres</hi>
saith hee, <hi>and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
among you?
come they not hence
even of your lusts that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10941:7"/>
warre in your members.</hi>
Secondly, Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missenes
in prayer,
set forth by the effect
of it, not obtaining
their desires, verse 2.
<hi>yee lust and have not</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>yee fight and warre
yet yee have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
yee aske not.</hi>
Thirdly, their asking
amisse or not praying
according to the will
of God, declared by
the cause of it verse 3.
<hi>Yee aske amisse, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10941:7"/>
yee may consume it
upon your lusts.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse
or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
affecting
the things of this
earth, aggravated
from the nature of
the vice and Gods
affection to it, its, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with him, vers. 4.
<hi>Yee adulterers and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses,
know yee not that the
friendship of the world is
enmity with God.</hi> For the
second particular the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10941:8"/>
the cause of all these
sinnes and lustes is set
downe vers. 5. <hi>Doe yee
thinke</hi> saith he, <hi>that the
Scripture saith in vaine,
The spirit that dwelleth in
us lusteth to envy.</hi> The
corrupt frame of our
nature alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
&amp; stirs us up to
that which is evill.
The third particular,
the meanes to avoide
these lusts, wee have
expressed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of vers. 6. <hi>But
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10941:8"/>
he giveth more grace.</hi>
Fourthly, the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this grace
that it takes not effect
are two, first, Pride of
heart, a vaine conceit
of a mans owne suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
before God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
yeelding to
temptations &amp; snares,
to each of which in
the last place, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
applies an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
wherein he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10941:9"/>
shewes how these
hinderances may bee
removed, if the <hi>Iewes</hi>
of the dispersion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to remoove the
first, they must submit
themselves to God; if
the latter they must
resist the Devill, <hi>submit
your selves thereefore unto
God, resist the Devil, and he
wil flee from you.</hi> So then
you see what the
words of this text
containe, a double ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
and upon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10941:9"/>
what occasion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>For the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the
first exhortation, wee
may consider these
particulars. First,
what the submission
here required is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what are the
reasons to enforce it.
Thirdly, the uses of
the point. For the
first, this submission
may be thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
it is a gracious
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10941:10"/>
frame of the heart
whereby the whole
man doth submit it
selfe unto the Law of
God, in all things &amp;
in all estates. For the
particulars in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
they may
thus be explained, first
the heart must be
brought into a right
frame and order, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning
this frame &amp;
order of the heart see,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 18. and <hi>Isa.</hi>
43. 21. This frame
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10941:10"/>
must be of the whole
heart, it's called a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
frame to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
it from that evil
frame of heart which
is in wicked men
mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.
the reason why this
gracious disposition
of the heart is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is, because God at
the first did plant his
Image in man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee was set in an
excellent frame, and
this image God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10941:11"/>
to be repaired
againe in man, even
the same image for
substance though not
for degree: the same
for all the parts,
though not for the
perfections of the
parts, and therefore
we finde that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating
of a man
to be the renewing of
Gods image in him.
This gracious frame
of heart God hath
promised to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10941:11"/>
as wee may see,
<hi>Ezek. 36. 26. A new heart
will I give you, and a new
spirit will I put within
you, I will take away the
stony heart out of your
flesh, and will give you an
hart of flesh:</hi> the fulfilling
of this promise we
may see, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. This
image of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be restored
in the soule as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. 49. As
wee have borne the image
of the earthly, so shall we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10941:12"/>
beare the image of the
heavenly,</hi> Ephes. 4. 23, 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it's required that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
should <hi>be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the spirits of their
minde, and that they should
put on the new man which
after God is created in
righteousness and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</hi>
Now in <hi>Adam</hi>
this image was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
in us it's imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
in him it was as
the light in the ayre
at noone day, when
the Sunne shines in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10941:12"/>
his strength, in us it's
as the light in the
aire at the dawning
of the day, then the
light is in every part
of the aire, though
not in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
but it increaseth
more and more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the perfect day.
Hence those words
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prov. 4. 18.
<hi>The path of the iust is as
the shining light, that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
more and more unto
the perfect day.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10941:13"/>
of Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
is also called the
new man, the new
birth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24.
Now we know that
a child in the wombe
hath all the parts that
a man hath, but onely
there wants the
strength of these
parts: so it's likewise
in the new regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man.</p>
            <p>Here it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that no man
is able to come to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10941:13"/>
this perfect renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods image.</p>
            <p>To which I answer,
that a man may, and
every man must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to it, otherwise
all his labour is in
vaine, the heart had
as good never a whit
be changed, as not
wholly; an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unlesse all the
strings be in tune, wil
make no good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
one string out
of tune will marre
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10941:14"/>
the harmonie as well
as more.</p>
            <p>The reason why
there must be this
whole change is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God will either
have the whole heart
or nothing. The holy
Ghost will not dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in the heart unlesse
it be a polished Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the whole
frame set up: No man
will dwell where
there are but a few
postes and studdes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10941:14"/>
set up towardes the
rearing of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If the heart
must be renewed,
how comes it to
passe that there are
many rebellions both
of heart and life in
the best men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There are so
indeed, but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
differ from
the rebellions of the
wicked, for first their
rebellions are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10941:15"/>
the flesh and
the spirit, between
their spirituall reason
and their Carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
betweene Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
affections and
spirituall, which shall
get the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
are between one
lust and another, one
carnall affection and
another, their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
is against the
providence of God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10941:15"/>
and the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which is in
them. Secondly, there
is difference in regard
of the end of their
rebellions; the Godly

The reason hereof

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, because God sees

               </gap>ot as man sees, he

               </gap>udgeth, according to
the sight of the eyes.
God especially looks
to the heart, because
that is the spring-head

heart, then an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
heart with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10941:18"/>
weake performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The first of these
was in <hi>Amasia, 2 Chr.
25.</hi> 2. the latter in
<hi>David,</hi> who though

               </gap>lippes, yet was a man

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fter Gods owne
heart: now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, or of
the heart, are either
in thoughts or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
rebellious
thoughts are either
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aine or such as are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10941:19"/>
wicked. First vaine
thoughts are rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for it's rebellion
as well, not to doe
that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
as to doe
that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
If a Prince
should come to a
subjectes house, and
he instead of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
him, should
continue vainly tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and prating
with some base fel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low,
it would be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10941:19"/>
counted wonderfull
neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
the like offence
doe they commit
who when they
should entertaine <hi>God</hi>
in their hearts have
them filled with vain
thoughts, and so
banish <hi>God</hi> from
them. None indeed
are free from these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
yet we must
continually strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, for here
is the difference; the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10941:20"/>
wicked have them
with delight, or at
least without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy:
the godly
although they have
them, yet it is with
much striving against
them, and continuall
sorrowing for them,
so that they get dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more and more
strength against them</p>
            <p>The second sort of
rebellious thoughts
are such as are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and that either
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10941:20"/>
for substance or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
evill thoughts
for substance are all
those, whose objects
are evill, as when a
man thinkes how he
may fulfill any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
lust. These evil
imaginations are one
of those seven things
that are abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Lord. <hi>Pro.</hi>
6. 16. These six things
doth the Lord hate, yea
seaven are an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto him, a proud

               <hi>looke, a lying tongue,
and hands that shed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
bloud, an heart that
deviseth wicked imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
&amp;c.</hi> Such evill
thoughts have the
covetous man, the
malicious man, the
envious man, for
the fulfilling of their
particular lustes. If
we would have <hi>God</hi>
delight in the beauty
of our soules, wee
must wash our hearts
from wickednesse
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10941:21"/>
according to <hi>Gods</hi>
Counsell, <hi>Ier. 4. 14. O
Ierusalem wash thy heart
from wickednesse that thou
mayst be saved, how long
shall thy vaine thoughts
lodge within thee?</hi> as dirt
cast upon the face
takes away the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it: So the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our soules is
stayned and defiled
by wicked thoughts:
that common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe
was certainly
invented by the divel,

that thoughts are free
for <hi>God</hi> more respects

Rebellious evill
thoughts for the
manner, are such as
having a good object
yet are conversant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that object af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an evill maner:

not perswaded aright
concerning them.
These evill thoughts
againe are two-fold,
either they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
such as men
perceive to be in
themselves: such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
thoughts the
Pharisees had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Christ, and <hi>Simon
Magus,</hi> concering the
buying of the holy
Ghost with money:
or else they are simple
and not reflexed, such
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10941:24"/>
as men perceive not
to be in themselves,
and yet in truth are
in them, as may be
discovered by their
lives and courses. He
that lives a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
life, shewes
that he hath a secret
rebellious opinion of
the mercy of <hi>God:</hi> he
that lives a desperate
life, shewes that hee
conceives amisse,
(though it may be
he sees it not) of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10941:25"/>
justice of <hi>God.</hi> Those
that are of civill
things are of three
kindes, the first is
when a man thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of some civill
thing, thinketh that
he can of himselfe
with his own power
compasse the same,
such the Apostle
blames who say not
with their mouthes
but rather in their
heart <hi>we will go into such
a Citie, and there wee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10941:25"/>
will buy and sell and

that is, in that
which they thought

the man that
hath such rebellious
thoughts, if he misse
of his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The second kind

is when we make

was in <hi>Haman:</hi>
the like was in <hi>Ahab</hi>
after <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard:
the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is worldly griefe
which makes many

they be more secret,
such as are not yet

This secret thirsting
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10941:28"/>
after riches was in
<hi>Balaam,</hi> see <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 18
The like secret affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which the Prophet
told him of, though
he little thought it
to be so, yet it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
proved true, as
appeares 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 12.
that these secret lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings
are rebellious
and therefore odious
in <hi>Gods</hi> sight, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
because his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
never dwelleth in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10941:29"/>
any heart where they
are, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
the heart accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that of our
Saviour, <hi>out of the heart
proceed evill thoughts,
murders &amp;c. these are
the things which defile a
man,</hi> Math 15. 19. 20.
Now the spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
not to dwell in
a polluted heart, and
though wee see not
these secret lusts in
our hearts, yet <hi>Gods</hi>
Spirit sees them, for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10941:29"/>
he sees not as we see.
<hi>God</hi> knowes the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
good motions of
his spirit in our hearts
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
also the secret
corruptions of our
hearts, although we
see them not our
selves. It concernes
us therefore especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to looke to our
hearts, the thoughts
and affections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The hypocrisie of
<hi>Amasia</hi> and <hi>Ioas</hi> was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10941:30"/>
manifest at last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their hearts
were not upright.</p>
            <p>The rebellions of
the outward man
follow; which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in speeches or
actions. Both these
are expressed, <hi>Isa. 3. 8.
Ierusalem is ruined and
Iuda is fallen, because their
tongue and their doings
are against the Lord,
to provoke the eyes of
his glory.</hi> Rebellious
speeches consist ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10941:30"/>
in the vanitie
or rottennesse of
them. First, there
must be no vanitie
in our speeches, we
must as the wise man
speaketh, ponder our
words, not speake
any thing, till ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pondered it, we
find it to be of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
waight, worth
the uttering. Did
we seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that we must
give account of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10941:31"/>
idle word, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
idle word is a
rebellion, we would
surely make more
conscience of idle
words then wee
doe. Secondly, rotten
speeches are such
wherewith there is
joyned some corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 29. the
contrarie to these
are called gracious
speeches, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6.
Now there are two
sorts of either kind;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10941:31"/>
a speech is called gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
either because
it proceedeth from
some inward grace,
that is called a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
speech which
proceeds from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of zeale; or
else because it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
some grace to
the hearers, or stirres
up some grace in them
which lay dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
So those are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
speeches, which
either proceed from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10941:32"/>
some corruption in
the speaker, or stirre
up some corruption
in the hearer. <hi>Our
speeches should be poudered
with Salt. Col.</hi> 4. 6. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they be seasoned
with grace, they are
like unsavoury meate
which for want of
Salt becomes putrified
Pro. 10. 20. <hi>The tongue
of the iust man is as fined
silver,</hi> that is, his
words are preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as silver, and like
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10941:32"/>
fined silver, they have
no corruption joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with them: <hi>but
the heart of the wicked is
little worth,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be gracious.</p>
            <p>Rebellions in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are, either the
omitting of some
good commanded, or
the committing of
some evill forbidden,
the omission of some
good is rebellion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10941:33"/>
not an act of the
will at the same time
for the omission, first
because the will at
the same time doth
concurre with the
doing of some thing
which should not
then be done: that
the doing of evill is
rebellion against <hi>God,</hi>
as the committing of
Murder or Adultery
none will deny.</p>
            <p>Next it followes in
the description, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10941:33"/>
the whole man must
be subject to the law
of <hi>God,</hi> viz. the Law
of righteousnesse, not
the Law of sinne,
which reignes in our
mortal members, and
that in all things, and
in all estates as well
prosperitie as adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.
There are two
sorts of professors,
sometimes the true
professor, the upright
man when he grows
fat, strikes with the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10941:34"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:10941:35"/>
heele, whereas before
in adversity he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
himselfe to the
<hi>Lord;</hi> like an horse
which being kept
low, will easily be
ruled by his rider,
but being pampered
and kept very lusty
and fatte, lifts up the
heele against him, and
will not suffer the
bit. Contrarily others,
so long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in an even and
pleasant course will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10941:35"/>
subject themselves to
<hi>God,</hi> and his service,
but when afflictions
come, when <hi>God</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them through
craggie and thornie
wayes, then they will
goe no further, the
reason is, because
their feete are not
shod with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Gospell
of peace, they have not
that peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which will
make them willing to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10941:36"/>
passe through all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
which is like
shoes to the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
feet. We know he
that is well shod will
easily passe through
Craggy and thorny
wayes, whereas hee
that is not so shod,
dares not. Thus much
for explication of the
point: in the second
place follow the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to enforce the
exhortation, &amp; from
every word a reason
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10941:36"/>
may be gathered.</p>
            <p>First, seeing every
sinne is a rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, let this the
rather move us to
submit our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, that we may
not be so great offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as traitors.</p>
            <p>The Second may
be taken from the
person of <hi>God,</hi> to
whom we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to submit our
selves, first in respect
of his greatnesse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10941:37"/>
us, this reason the
Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> useth
Chap. 1. 6 14. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in respect of his
goodnesse towards
us, who is so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a father to us,
this we may see ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<hi>Isa. 2. 2, 3. Isa. 5. 23,
4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third may be
taken from our selves
who are exhorted to
this duty. First consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that we are all his
Creatures, we hold
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10941:37"/>
our being, and all
that we have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
from him, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it concernes us
to yeeld all homage
to him, the more a
man holdeth of his
Lord, the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
he oweth him
Secondly, we are all
his servants, therefore
we are not to fulfill
our owne lusts, or to
obey Sathan, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to doe our Lords
worke; yea we are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10941:38"/>
not his servants only,
but besides bought
with a deare price,
<hi>even the precious blood of
his onely Sonne, 1 Cor. 6.
20.</hi> when a man hath
bought a servant and
that at an high rate,
he expectes the more
and better service to
be done by him.
Thirdly, we are all his
children, therfore we
must yeeld all duty
&amp; obedience to him,
this reason the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10941:38"/>
useth, 1 Pet. 1. 14,
15. <hi>As obedient children
fashion not your selves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the former lusts
in your ignorance, but as
hee which hath called you
is holy, so be yee holy in
all manner of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Lastly, we are all
the Temple of the
holy Ghost: a Temple
that is consecrated to
holy uses must not
be profaned by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to common
uses, this is sacriledge;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10941:39"/>
so when we are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
consecrated to
the holy Ghost it's sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
to profane
these temples, to put
them to base uses, this
reason the Apostle
useth, 1 Cor. 6. 19.
<hi>What? know yee not that
your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ody is the temple of
the holy Ghost which is in
you, which yee have of
God, and yee are not your
owne? &amp;c.</hi> We now
come to the uses
of that which hath
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10941:39"/>
beene delivered.</p>
            <p>This serves to cleare
the justice of <hi>God</hi> who
punisheth sinne with
eternall death both
of body and soule.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Sinne being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
deserveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
punishment,
but death seemes to
be too severe a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
<hi>Ans.</hi> When
we heare that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
childe is put
to death, we judge
him worthy of it &amp;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10941:40"/>
to have deserved it
of his father, because
the child received
life from the father
his father is so farre
above him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
well at his
hands. By the same
reason may <hi>God</hi> in an
higher degree punish
every sin with death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it seemes
much that <hi>God</hi> should
punish one sin with
eternall death. <hi>Ans.</hi>
The reason hereof is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10941:40"/>
because the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the wicked
are continuall. If
they would cease to
rebell and submit
themselves to <hi>God,</hi> he
would cease to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.
Againe it's just
because <hi>God</hi> set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Adam</hi> life and
death eternal, for him
and his posterity, as
by justice for his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
he should
have had eternall life,
so for transgression
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10941:41"/>
he and all his deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
eternall death.</p>
            <p>This may also serve
to humble us for
our sinnes,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> seeing the
least of them is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against <hi>God.</hi>
The reason why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
goe on quietly in
their course of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, because they
consider not that <hi>God</hi>
is highly provoked to
anger by the same. For
the better working
of this humiliation in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10941:41"/>
us, let us consider a
few meanes. The first
is to make catalogues
of our sinnes, to set
them in order before
the light of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>God</hi> will surely
set them in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the light of his
countenance. By set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in order
before us is meant
that we should set
the greatest in the first
ranke, and so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10941:42"/>
in order, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
we come to the
least, so that it is
needfull to know the
greatnesse &amp; heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of every one of
them. For the better
understanding of the
greatnesse of every
one of them, let us
consider but this; a
traitour, if after his
treason committed,
the King sends out
his Proclamation to
take him, and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10941:42"/>
a third or fourth
Proclamation, will
not yet come in, it
doth much more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the offence,
so often as we have
despised the word &amp;
not hearkned to the
reprehension for our
rebellions commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so often have we
refused to be called
in, when the King of
Heaven hath sent out
his Proclamations
for us; therefore we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10941:43"/>
cannot but conceive
our former rebellion
to be much more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
therby, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our soules should
be humbled for it, for
the multitude of our
rebellions: it will be
objected that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly number
them, yet a speciall
meanes to discover
them unto us will be
to examine our selves
by the word. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10941:43"/>
never so many spots
about him, yet if he
have not a glasse to
looke in, how will he
espie them? If a man
come into an house
in the darke, though
it be all besmeared
with slime and dirt
he cannot discerne it
without bringing a
light with him; the
word is this light
which wil discover to
us the foulenes &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of out soules

and hearts, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because <hi>God</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is able to search
the heart, and find
out the corruptions
thereof, it is he that
made the heart, and
not man, therefore it
is too deepe for him
to search, the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>God</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in his word,
hence the word will
helpe us in the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of our hearts,
here by the way we
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10941:45"/>
may note why so
many suddenly fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
despaire. <hi>God</hi> doth
suddenly kindle a
cleare light within
them, whereby they
come to see the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their sinnes
and the multitude of
them, which having
never looked into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they deeply ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them to
obtaine mercy, and
so despaire. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10941:46"/>
means, after we
have set our sinnes
before us with their
aggravation, is, then
to stay long in
the consideration of
them, many at the
ripping up of their
sinnes will be ready
to say <hi>Lord</hi> have
mercy upon me, but
this is not sufficient.
Hence is that usuall
doctrine, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is a continued
act. A sparke of fire
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10941:46"/>
under wet wood
will not at the first
flame out, yet with
continuall blowing
at length it may
burne: that sparke of
grace which is smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in a mans hart
at the first sight of
his sinnes, will not
kindle his affections,
but at length with
continuall meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it will breake
forth, and may work
much remorse. The
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10941:47"/>
Prophet blames the
people, that in their
humiliation they did
but hang down their
head like a Bulrush, <hi>Isa.
58.</hi> Is it such a fast that
I have chosen? a day
for a man to afflict his
soule? is it to bow
downe his head as a
bulrush &amp;c. they did
wel in humbling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but their fault
was in that they did
not continue the same
but were like the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10941:47"/>
which whilst
the storme or blast of
winde lasteth, hangs
downe it's head, but
after lifts it up againe.
<hi>David</hi> in his repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
had alwayes his sins
before him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 3.
the more he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it the more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
it wrought
in him. The third
means is, we must
have the spirit of <hi>God</hi>
to soften our hearts,
or else all our labour
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10941:48"/>
will doe no good,
an hard stone while
it so continues, will
not be bruised with
a blow, but being
changed into flesh, a
little blow wil bruise
it. Our stonie hearts
must be turned into
flesh, before they
can be broken with
consideration of our
sinnes, which is only
the worke of <hi>Gods</hi>
spirit, this point is
gathered out of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10941:48"/>
               <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. Those
who have had the

in them by the spirit
of <hi>God.</hi> But how shal

our Saviour tells us,
the way is to aske
and pray for it, and
confirmes the same
by an argument, <hi>Luk.
11. 13. If yee being evill

unto you though he

of his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
he will rise

If we continue
constant and fervent
in asking, <hi>God</hi> will at
length heare us for
our importunity, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10941:50"/>
give us as joyfull an
answer as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Canaan</hi> had
after her repulse, this
may the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us, the longer
we expect an answer
with patience, the
better and more
comfortable answer
shall at length be
given us. Many think
that they want not
this humiliation for
sinne, but let such
examine whether
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10941:50"/>
they have left off
their course of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which they
lived in before, this
will be a speciall
signe of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
If a man have
done thee an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and pretend that
he is very sorry for
it, yet if he offer thee
the same wrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe,
thou wilt judge that
he did but dissemble:
So he doth but dis-
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10941:51"/>
dissemble in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that doth
continue in sinne
sorrowed for, that
keepes the same course
of sinning still.</p>
            <p>Another use may
be of exhortation,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> to
our selves, to our
whole man, inward
ond outward, that
we rebell not any
longer, but submit
our selves unto the
<hi>Lord.</hi> For the farther
enforcing hereof let
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10941:51"/>
us consider. First,
some signes of this
our submission. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the motives
to it. Thirdly the
means to attaine it.
For the first,<note place="margin">Signes</note> the signes
of this submission
The first may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>Gods</hi> word,
and delight in it, if
we neglect his word
and are not moved
with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and promises
therein contained,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10941:52"/>
then are we rebells.
That Subject that
heares the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Prince
read, with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
annexed to
be inflicted upon
such as breake it, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectes
the same, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festes
his contempt
of them, shewes that
he will not obey
that law of his
Prince, but rather
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10941:52"/>
rebels against it. That
neglect of <hi>Gods</hi> word
is a signe of rebellion
is most evident, <hi>Isa.
30.</hi> 8, 9. 10. Now
(saith the Lord by
his Prophet) <hi>Goe,
write it before them in a
Table, and note it in a
booke, that it may be for
the time to come, for
ever and ever, that this is
a rebellious people, lying
children, children that wil
not heare the Law of the
Lord, which say to the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10941:53"/>
seers see not, and to the
Prophets prophesie not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us right things, speake
unto us smooth things,
prophecy deceites.</hi> A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
excuse of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
people is, that
they are not booke
learned, though they
delude their owne
consciences, yet <hi>God</hi>
is not mocked, he that
made the eye shal not
he see? he that made
the understanding
shall not he know?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10941:53"/>
               <hi>God</hi> knowes that this
is but an excuse, and
that sloath and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
is the true
cause that they have
no more knowledge
in <hi>Gods</hi> word, these
thinke they have
knowledge enough,
and therfore need no
more; but this will
be tried, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
their desire to
know more, &amp; their
delight in <hi>Gods</hi> word,
which alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10941:54"/>
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
reason stands
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2, 3. If they had
tasted how gracious the
the Lord is, then as new
horne babes they would
desire the sincere milke of
the word, that they might
grow thereby. Act. 20.
Paul</hi> tells them that he
had revealed to them
the whole Counsell
of <hi>God,</hi> intimating
that he had bin in
fault, if he had kept
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10941:54"/>
the least part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
secret: although
the Pastour, if he be
not diligent to teach
be in fault, yet that
excuseth not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
though <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
the blood of
the people at those
Pastours hands, that
doe not feed them,
yet the people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
notwithstanding.
<hi>God</hi> oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
perish for want
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10941:55"/>
of knowledge: but
poore silly people
perswade themselves
that to have much
knowledge is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them, but
of Schollers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
This obstacle
will be taken away
if we compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 5, 27, 28. with
<hi>Heb. 6. 1. and</hi> 5. 12. We
know although a
man take no poyson
nor lay violent hands
upon himselfe, yet if
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10941:55"/>
he refraine the taking
of his meate, he will
soone famish, though
a man abstaine from
murder, adultery, and
such heinous sinnes
as will bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to his soule
yet if he take not the
food of the soule, the
word of <hi>God,</hi> his soule
must needes famish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if we should
spend much time in
getting knowledge
our estates would
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10941:56"/>
decay. <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ
saith the contrary,
Math. 6. 33. <hi>First seeke
the Kingdome of God, and
the righteousnesse thereof,
and all these things shall
be added unto you.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the cause why
many decay in their
estates notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their continuall
toyle, and labour, is,
because they seeke
not the kingdome of
<hi>God</hi> first: because <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
asked wisedom,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10941:56"/>
we see he wanted
not riches &amp; wealth,
but had them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.
Let us
take the Prophets
Counsell in this case
<hi>Mal. 3. 11. Bring yee all
the tithes into the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
that there may bee
meate in my house, and
prove mee now herewith,
saith the Lord of hoastes,
if I will not open you the
windowes of heaven, and
powre you out a blessing,
that there shall not be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10941:57"/>
roome enough to receive it.</hi>
A speciall motive
hereunto should be,
the consideration of
their miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
who wander
not being guided by
the light of the
word. They are like
a traveller who is to
take a great journey
in the night, and
knowes not the way,
yea, that wants a
lanthorne to give
him light. See further
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10941:57"/>
two fearefull judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the people
which profited not
by Gods word, but
were uncapable of
being taught the same
<hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 10. 11, 12. Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
also of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
judgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in <hi>Gods</hi> word
without trembling
at them is fearefull
rebellion, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof we
may see, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 14. So
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10941:58"/>
likewise not to be
moved with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
contained in
<hi>Gods</hi> word, is an evill
signe, that we have
not submitted our
selves, to the Lord, it
is wonderfull that so
few come under
Christs banner, and
fight his battailes,
seeing there are
such excellent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
promised to
such as doe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10941:58"/>
22, 23. Whereas King
<hi>Cyrus</hi> wanted not
Souldiers, after he had
Proclaimed that they
who were Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
should be made
Knights, they that
were Knights Lords;
Surely if Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
had bin of this
kinde, he should have
had more followers
then now he hath.
Another signe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
is to obey Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
and not <hi>God,</hi> his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10941:59"/>
               <hi>His servants wee are whom
wee obey, Rom.</hi> 6. 16.
Here many will say,
they defie Satan, but
let them learne of the
<hi>Centurion,</hi> that they are
surely Satans servants,
if when he bids them
doe this, they doe it
when he bids them
come they come, the
godly indeed may
somtimes be violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lead captive of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
but they are never
his subjects for they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10941:59"/>
never obey him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
nor Confesse
themselves to be his
servants. The wicked
man walkes with his
face towards hell, his
back towards heaven,
yet somtimes he may
looke backe but not
long together: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the righteous man
walkes with his face
towards heaven, &amp; his
backe towards hell:
and although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10941:60"/>
yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
himself quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and goes forward,
like a ship which
sayles from East to
West, which though
it be turned backe
with some storme or
tempest, yet when
that is over, it sayles
forwards, as before.
Another signe of a
rebell is to purchase
goods and lands in
the enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
that shewes he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10941:60"/>
doth not purpose to
returne. The world
may be called the
Devills Countrie and
therfore he who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his affections
upon any thing here,
and labours to pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chase
the same, hath
this signe of a rebell:
<hi>For no man can serve
two Masters,</hi> Luk. 16.
Some will object
that they seeke for
wealth out of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10941:61"/>
for themselves
and those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them, not
because they make
riches their treasure
or set their hearts
upon them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these must thus
examine themselves,
if they esteeme their
riches above any
thing else, care for the
increasing of them
more then for any
thing else, if they do,
they make riches
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10941:61"/>
their treasure A man
ascending upon an
hill, the higher he
ascends, the lesse all
things beneath seeme
unto him. So when
a man is ascending up
to heaven in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
the higher
he goes, the lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
will he have
of all earthly things
here below. That
which a man makes
his treasure he spends
most of his time, if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10941:62"/>
if not all in increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of it, and he who
doth thus with his
riches, makes them
his treasure. The
rich man may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know, whether
he trusts in his riches
by the effectes of his
trusting in them, as by
his feare of loosing
them, by his griefe
for their losse, and his
joy in getting of
them. He trusts in
his riches when his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:10941:62"/>
heart failes, if they
faile, as a Cripple trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Crutches,
when they are taken
away, his legges faile
him, hee can goe no
further. Thus we
have the notes or
signes of tryall: now
follow two or three
motives to perswade
us to this duty of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
            <p>First, Consider that
we shall never have
successe in any thing,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:10941:63"/>
so long as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
rebells against
<hi>God. For the feare of the
wicked shall bee hrought
upon him, Prov.</hi> 10. 24.
an excellent example
hereof see, <hi>Ier.</hi> 42. The
wicked man alwayes
either misseth of his
desire, or if it be
fulfilled, it turneth to
his great hurt. When
<hi>God</hi> suffers the wicked
worldling to grow
rich according to his
desire, he either takes
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:10941:63"/>
from him the use of
his riches, or else suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
him so wholy to
set his affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<hi>God,</hi> which is
worse. Another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
should be the
fearefull judgements
that are every where
denounced against
the wicked &amp; rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<hi>Psal. 11. 6. Isa. 30.
13,</hi> 14. They are very
emphatically compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a swelling wal
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10941:64"/>
and a broken Vessell.
Thirdly, another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
should be the
mercies that <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
upon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
subjectes. He is
as full of Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and bounty unto
them, as the Sunne is
full of light, or the
Sea full of water.
Lastly, another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
should be the
easinesse of Christs
yoake, and compare
herewith how base a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10941:64"/>
master the Devill is,
how hard his yoake
is, and withall how
small his wages, a
little pleasure here &amp;
eternall paine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Now Christs
yoake becomes light
and easie by these
meanes.</p>
            <p>First, they that
take this yoake are
strengthned to beare
it: if a childe had an
heavy burden layd
upon him, and his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10941:65"/>
strength accordingly
increased, he would
beare it with ease. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they who
beare this yoake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in it, it becomes
easie, what will not
become easie to a man
if he delight in it? The
Hunter delightes in
his sport, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endureth winde
and weather to
follow it</p>

the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
hereunto
which may stirre us
up to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the duty,
<hi>and hee will flee from
you.</hi> For the first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
<hi>resist the
Devill;</hi> Surely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there is no need
of motives to stir up
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10941:66"/>
Christians to take up
this exhortation, as a
man being set upon
by a Lyon needs no
perswasion to flee
from him, for that he
will do as fast as he
can, onely desires
to have some way
shewed him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may escape: so
the Christian which
truely sees in what
great danger he is
continually, by the
continuall lying in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10941:67"/>
waite for him of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
needs no exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to flee from
him, &amp; shun him, only
wantes a way to be
shewed him, wherby
he may escape this
great danger. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
passing by all
such motives as might
be here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
let me set down
only three particulars
implyed in the text.
First, the Devill is our
adversary. Secondly,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10941:67"/>
we must be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with strength
and weapons, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him. Thirdly, we
must put in practise
this strength, and use
these weapons, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they wil not
profit us.</p>
            <p>For the first, that
Satan is our adversary
and that we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him, and fight
with him; though
wicked men that are
dead in their sins take
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10941:68"/>
no notice of it, yet it's
evident by Scriptures
Eph. 6. 12. <hi>Wee wrestle
not against flesh and blood,
but against Principalities
and powers, against the
Rulers of the darkenesse
of this world, against
Spirituall wickednesses in
high places.</hi> If the Devill
were not our enemie
why should the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
here exhort
us to resist him? so
that text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. is
most evident for this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10941:68"/>
purpose. <hi>Bee sober and
vigilant, because your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie
the Devill goes
about like a roaring Lyon
seeking whom hee may
devoure.</hi> Here we see
what kinde of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie
he is. First,
his strength appeares
in that he is called a
Lyon. Secondly, his
fiercenesse and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
in that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a roaring Lyon.
Thirdly, his diligence
in that he is said to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10941:69"/>
walke about seeking
whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure.
That Satan is
our professed adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and takes all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
hee can of
tempting us, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
partly by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
partly by
reason. By experience
as <hi>Eve</hi> in <hi>Paradise</hi> was
tempted by Satan, so
at this time we have
many experiences of
the like kinde, in
Witches, to whom
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10941:69"/>
the Divell hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in sundry
shapes, as many of
them have confessed
and others also have
seene, so that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be doubted of.
And surely if Satan
take upon him a
voyce to be heard of
the outward eare, as
he did to <hi>Eve</hi> and
doth now to many
VVitches, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt he being a
spirit can much more
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10941:70"/>
by a mans phantasie
present things to the
minde, and so speake
to the minde. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also it cannot be
doubted, but that he
can make and frame
propositions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
&amp; present them
to the minde, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
by these his
reasons as we see in
<hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3. And this
truth is also evident
by reason, those
which are usually
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10941:70"/>
called <hi>Faedae tentationes</hi>
cannot but be sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
by Satan, as
will appeare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we consider the
manner of the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
or the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them.</p>
            <p>First for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by which they
are cast into a mans
minde, that they
come not accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeares, in that
they come so often,
and continue so long.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10941:71"/>
Many have bin trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with them for
many yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Againe, they
come not by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
as appeares
from the suddennesse
of them, in that they
are cast into a mans
minde without any
former thoughts
which might bring
them in. Againe,
that they come not
by the strength of a
mans affections, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10941:71"/>
in that he doth
presently abhor them,
in many there is no
consent at all given
to them, it remaines
therefore that they
must needes proceed
from Satans suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in the matter
of temptations, as to
instance in that one
for a man to kill
himselfe, seeing it's a
principle deeply graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10941:72"/>
into every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as it cannot be
otherwise) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it selfe its own
life, this thought in a
man to seeke all
meanes to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
cannot come by
any other meanes
then by the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Satan, for we
never knew any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creature willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worke it's owne
destruction, onely
the Swine in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10941:72"/>
Gospell into whom
the Devil had entred.
Therefore surely man
but by the Devills
perswasion (man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be moved
with reason) would
never doe it.</p>
            <p>Here it may be
said that reason will
move a man to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-goe
a lesse danger
to escape a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Obj.</note>
and for this
cause men make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10941:73"/>
themselves.</p>
            <p>With the heathen
indeed,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> who knew
neither heaven nor
hell this might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
but how can
this be true in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
(I meane one
borne in the Church)
who is perswaded
there is a Hell for the
wicked? can any such
man be so fearelesse
and so voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as to cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into hell which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10941:73"/>
he seekes to shunne?
would any man stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by the fire, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into the fire that
he might not be
burnt? or cast himself
into the water, that he
might not be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
the reason is the
same here.</p>
            <p>There are two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
wayes by which
Satan useth to tempt
men, the first by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
the meanes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10941:74"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:10941:74"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:10941:75"/>
               <hi>God</hi> useth to call men
by to himselfe. The
second is, by laying
snares and baites of
his owne. For the
first, there are three
meanes, by which
<hi>God</hi> useth to unite
man unto himselfe.
The first and princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pall
is his word, the
second his mercies,
the third is afflictions.
Which two latter
serve to quicken the
first and make it ef-
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10941:75"/>
effectuall. Concerning
the first his word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
labours to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
it many wayes
either by keeping it
from men so he kept
S <hi>Paul</hi> from comming
to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to
preach the word,
1 <hi>Thess. 2. 18. We would
have come unto you,
even I</hi> Paul <hi>once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but Satan hindered
us.</hi> Or else keeping
men from the word
as in the parable <hi>Luk.</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:10941:76"/>
14. 17, 18. Or if men
come to heare it by
making it unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto them, either
by making them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
only in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse
and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the style
wherein it is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and so neglect
the word: as if a man
should only delight
to behold the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
workmanship of
a peece of cloth he
hath, and never use
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10941:76"/>
the same to cloath
himselfe with, or by
making them delight
in observing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
and infirmities
of him which prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
so that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
being ended
their whole talke is
of the slips and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the preacher
These men are like
a strainer through
which the pure and
good milk runs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stay, only the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10941:77"/>
haires and motes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
behind. Or else
Satan doth it by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
men at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the word to
be senslesse &amp; stupid
either by blinding
their eyes that they
cannot discerne the
truth, thus saith the
Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. The
God of this world hath
blinded the mindes of them
that beleeve not, least the
light of the glorious Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Christ who is the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10941:77"/>
image of God should
shine unto them.</hi> Or by
hindering their assent
that they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the word nor
beleeve it: So that
though the word be
a hammer, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
breake them;
though it be a sword
yet it cannot enter
into them. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if the hearer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
with some good
purposes in him; to
reforme his courses
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10941:78"/>
and lead a new life,
whereas the right
way is now present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to worke them
on his heart; Satan
labours forthwith to
quench them or to
steale them away: if
there be likelihood
of reformation and
turning, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
he presents to
a man his beloved
sinnes which he is
loath to part with,
to see if they will
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10941:78"/>
stay him; and calls to
minde the reproches
&amp; ignomines which
will surely attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that profession: he
suggestes that he wil
never be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
it, in regarde
of the strictnesse and
rigour of it, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other difficulties
By this meanes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes,
the good
motions which were
in a mans minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
but a cloud
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10941:79"/>
which Satan blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
over.</p>
            <p>A second meanes to
quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former are
<hi>Gods</hi> mercies, the good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse
of God is said to
lead us to repentance
Rom. 2. 4. <hi>Despisest thou
the riches of his goodnes, &amp;
forbearance and long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
not knowing that the
goodnes of God leadeth thee
to repentance,</hi> the word
there signifies a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
proper to man.
These mercies of <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:10941:79"/>
often become snares
to that wicked, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Psalmist,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 22. Cited by
the Apostle <hi>Rom. 11. 9.
Let their table be made a
snare, &amp; a trap, a stumbling
blocke &amp; a reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pense unto
them.</hi> Thus, riches are a
great blessing of <hi>God</hi>
and so <hi>Iacob</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of them, yet when
they increase, Satan
tempts men to set
their hearts upon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10941:80"/>
them, and so to make
an Idole of them.
Thus wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
are gifts of <hi>God,</hi>
but when a man
hath them in any
good measure, Satan
temptes him to seeke
his owne praise by
them, and so to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<hi>Gods</hi> honour. So
likewise preferment
which should make
a man more usefull
and profitable both
to <hi>God</hi> and his Church
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10941:80"/>
to how many is it
made a snare, who
make it the end of
their desires? Thus
when a man is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with the Prince
or some great man
whereas he should
make the use of it
which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did,
yet he useth it for his
own turne, for sinister
endes.</p>
            <p>The third meanes
followes, namely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
when a man
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10941:81"/>
will not profit by the
bare word, these open
a mans eares, and seale
to him the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according to that
in <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 16, 17, 18, 19.
Whereas before the
word did fume in
his braine, afflictions
make it sinke downe
into his heart. This
effect especially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in such a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wherein a man
takes deepe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of death. For if
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10941:81"/>
any thing will change
his heart, then in all
likelihood is the time;
but in many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and resolutions at
that time bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
yet afterward
being restored to
health, these good
motions are stollen
out of their hearts by
Satan, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the same men
they were; so that
their sicknesse hath
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10941:82"/>
beene but like a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
showre, which
falling into a great
water makes a sound,
and for the present
doth much trouble
the same, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the force of the
motion being past,
the water returnes to
his former calmnesse.
Their sorrow is but
like the hanging
downe of the head of
the bull-rush for two
or three dayes, in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10941:82"/>
time of a storme or
tempest, which being
over, immediatly it
lifteth up the head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Such sorrow
was that of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
Iewes, tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Isa. 58. 5. Is it such a
fast that I have chosen? a
day for a man to afflict
his soule? Is it to bow
downe his head like a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush,
and to spread sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
and ashes under
him? wilt thou call this a
fast, and an acceptable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10941:83"/>
day to the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Satans first
way of tempting;
now wee come to
speake of the second,
which is his great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
subtiltie in laying
his snares and baites.
Our adversaries dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
appeares in the
innumerable snares
he layes for us; his
snares and baites are
in so many things as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10941:83"/>
any corrupt affection
of man is set upon.
In peace most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
his baites are
pleasure, gaine, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment;
in anger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
in extremity
seeking to unlawfull
meanes; so that his
baites are every
where. Any thing
which is an object
to these filthy Iusts
which are in a mans
heart, he useth as gins
and traps to captivate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10941:84"/>
us in; in all things he
layes some baite or
other to catch us by:
in our affections hee
strives to have us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:
in our thoughts
first vaine, and then
blasphemous: in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
prophane, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of benefits
unthankfnll: in cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
impatient and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull;
as his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
so likewise
must wee know his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10941:84"/>
subtiltie to bee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
many wayes.</p>
            <p>First, by the fitting
of his baites and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
unto a mans
divers Calling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
as the water of
a fountaine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
thither whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it naturally tends
by the Chanell, so
Satan useth our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
dispositions, as
chanels to conveigh
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10941:85"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:10941:85"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:10941:86"/>
the corruption of our
heart that way it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
Thus he fitted
the covetous disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Iudas</hi> with a
baite of thirty peeces.
He inflamed aspiring
<hi>Human</hi> with the baite
of preferment; so
likewise hee fitted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel.</hi>
Thus hee
fits all men tempting
them to such lusts as
he knowes they are
most addicted unto.</p>
            <p>We must therefore<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:10941:86"/>
consider our perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sinnes, wherein
the divell doth most
usually foyle us, and
take heed lest hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
foyle us in
them. Hee which is
subject to anger, let
him take heed of that
passion especially. He
which is given to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse,
let him
especially take heed
to the baites of profit.
Let not the angry
man looke upon the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10941:87"/>
covetous to see his
fault, lest he forget his
owne; nor let the
covetous looke upon
the angry man to see
his fault, lest hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his covetousnesse
But let every one
consider his owne
personall faults, and
take especiall heed lest
he bee overtaken in
them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
subtiltie appeares
by fitting his baites,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10941:87"/>
and tentations to all
occasions and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
offered. Hee
did not alwaies tempt
<hi>David</hi> to murder, but
when opportunitie
was offered to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie:
he tempted <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
upon an occasion
to deny his Master;
that this is most true,
every Christians pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
experience will
tell him. When <hi>Herod</hi>
had made the people
wonder at his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10941:88"/>
the divell
tempted him to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the glory to
himselfe, which
brought that fearfull
judgement upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him
Thus when they are
called to any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
duty, then Satan
tempts them, and tels
them, this is a fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to shew your
selves, to winne esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
among men,
so the true end of
that duty is neglected.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10941:88"/>
As adversitie is the
time of tryall, so is
opportunity. Vpon
all opportunities the
divell tempts men to
some sinne or other.
Hence the Apostle,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. exhorteth
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
person amongst
them, and to comfort
him, lest otherwise
the divell might have
more power over
him, and tempt him
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10941:89"/>
to despaire, or some
such sinne; Ye ought
rather to forgive him,
and comfort him, lest
perhaps such a one
should bee swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
sorrow, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I beseech you,
that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
your love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him.</p>
            <p>Hence it stands e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man in hand,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
when Satan drawes
him into some sinne
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10941:89"/>
by occasion, as by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
company, or the
like, then to consider
and looke what sinne
he is most exposed
unto by that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so to defend
himselfe that Satan
foyle him not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
appeares in the
convenient glosses,
which hee covers sin
withall, whereby he
blinds a mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so that either
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10941:90"/>
he sees it not to be a
sinne, or else he sees
not the punishment
of it. So that as a
blind man knowes
not whether hee goe
aright or no, or when
he is right: no more
doth hee; Hee useth
two meanes to blind
mens judgements in
this manner, first by
stirring up in them
some immoderate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which whiles
it raignes, hinders the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10941:90"/>
judgement from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
aright of
things. As the eye of a
man when it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
sees all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
and not as they
are indeed, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being removed,
it sees things as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
as before: so
when the mind of a
man is distempered
with anger, or some
immoderate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hee judgeth not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10941:91"/>
aright of Kings, but
being carried with
violence of passion
doth many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
afterwards
when his distemper
is ceased he comes to
his right judgement,
and plainly sees how
he was deceived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Secondly, hee
doth it by hindring us
from applying the
rule aright to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Thus in Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
when a man is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10941:91"/>
possessed with the
love of money, and
takes great delight in
it, that man is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to apply the rule
in Scripture to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
whereby this
his sinne is forbidden.
Satan is so crafty, that
he invents sundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
whereby
he perswades him of
the lawfull tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereof. So when
the rule in Scriptures
for Ministers is, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10941:92"/>
they ought to care
and bee solicitous
onely for their flocke
to feed it, yet few can
apply this rule to
their actions, but seek
chiefly their owne
gaine &amp; preferment.
When a man beholds
a thing through his
affection, like as his
affection is, so seemes
the thing to be, like as
a man when hee sees
any thing through a
glasse, the object
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10941:92"/>
seemes to bee of the
same colour that the
glasse is: thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
deceiveth a
man. But these things
though they are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from men here,
yet for the most part
at their death they
are layd open before
them, the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
affection that
hindered judgement
is then taken away,
and Satan also who
blinded men before,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10941:93"/>
makes things appeare
unto them as they
are. Who sees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
thus beset with
his adversary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
not to have
strength and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
wherby he may
resist him? which is
the second point.</p>
            <p>The strength and
meanes whereby we
may resist him, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
these three;</p>
            <p>First, to have our
hearts filled with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10941:93"/>
grace, that so the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell
may find no
roome to enter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to cast
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut our false friends,
which when our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
assailes, will
turne from us and
take his part; these
are our wicked lusts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to seeke
this help from Christ,
we have no strength
of our selves, it is
hee onely which can
helpe and uphold us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:10941:94"/>
For the first, Wee
must have our hearts
filled with grace,
which is an especiall
meanes, the reason
may bee gathered out
of the Parable, <hi>Luk. 11.
24, 25. When he commeth
he findeth it swept, and
garnished;</hi> that is, voide
of goodnesse, empty
of grace: were it not
for this hee could
not have entered, our
hearts therfore must
be filled with grace.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10941:94"/>
The Conscience of
man is like a strong
fortresse, out of
which he casteth this
his enemy who had
possession of it, or
like an house where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the divell dwelt
and tooke delight,
which when hee is
cast out of, hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up and downe
through dry places,
that is seeking to get
in, and enter into
some others; seeking
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10941:95"/>
rest and finding none,
that is not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into any others,
hee returnes againe,
and as an enemy cast
out of a strong hold,
if hee bee not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by a garrison,
gets possession again;
So if Satan returning
findes not a garrison
of graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
fortifying the
man, if there be but
the least roome voide
enters againe into
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10941:95"/>
him, which if the
conscience had been
full of grace he could
not have done. As in
nature, <hi>non datur vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
there is no place
empty; So in the heart
of man there will be
something or other,
if it be not filled with
good thoughts, it will
be filled with bad: if
it bee not filled with
the graces of Gods
Spirit, it will be filled
with Satans temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10941:96"/>
This may rather
be called emptinesse
then fulnesse; a thing
is said to be empty,
when it is voide of
that it should be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
withall. A Well
when there is no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it, is said to be
empty, though it be
full of ayre. So long
as the true fulnesse of
Gods grace tastes in
our hearts, so long the
divell cannot enter,
but when there is not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10941:96"/>
this fulnesse, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of vacuity more
or lesse, Satan entring
into a man doth pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
him. Moreover,
as there is a double
emptinesse, so there
is a double fulnesse.
First, there is an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse
of knowledge,
such was in those
Gentiles of whom
the Apostle speakes,
<hi>Rom. 1. 22. Professing
themselves to be wise, they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10941:97"/>
became fooles:</hi> and <hi>vers. 21
they became vaine in their
imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened.</hi>
Answerable to this
there is a fulnesse of
knowledge, and of
all the graces of Gods
Spirit. Such is that
which the Apostle
prayes for, <hi>Coloss. 1. 9.
Wee cease not to pray for
you, and to desire that yee
might bee filled with the
knowledge of Gods will, in
all wisdome, and spirituall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10941:97"/>
understanding.</hi> Ephes 3.
14. <hi>For this cause I bow
my knees unto the Father
of our Lord Iesus Christ,
that yee may bee able
to comprehend with all
Saints, what is the
breadth, and length, and
depth, and height, and
to know the love of
CHRIST which
passeth knowledge.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
there is an
emptinesse of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
voide and
empty of the duties
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:10941:98"/>
which are performed
in a good Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This is called
vaine Conversation,
1 <hi>Pet 1. 18. Yee were not
redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver and gold,
from your vaine conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
received by tradition
from your fathers.</hi> So
likewise there is a
fulnesse of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
opposed to this
emptinesse, when a
mans whole life is
filled with the fruits
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10941:98"/>
of Gods grace, such
the Apostle prayes for
<hi>Phil. 1. 10, 11. This I
pray, that yee may approve
things that are excellent:
that yee may bee sincere,
and without offence till the
day of Christ, being filled
with the fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee must labour
to have this fulnesse
of grace in our hearts.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
For as inke sinkes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wet paper, and
runnes abroad upon
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10941:99"/>
it, but when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is covered with
oyle, it slideth and
sinkes not: so when
the divell offers his
snares to any empty
heart, they enter in
and foile him, but
when the heart is
fortified with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of grace, Satans
baites cannot take
hold, nor enter in
Wee may discerne
when this fulnesse is,
there is no roome for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10941:99"/>
vaine thoughts, for
unchast desires, for
any immoderate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
One would
think an empty heart
could not bee discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
so well: as wee
know an empty bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
by the sound, so
wee may discerne
whether there be this
emptinesse in men, or
no, by their speeches
and actions.</p>

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:10941:100"/>
wee must
alwayes be exercised
in the fruites of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
never without
some good speeches,
actions, thoughts, or
affections. When we
are not busie in Gods
service, the divell
takes an occasion to
tempt us to serve him
when wee are not
doing some good, the
divell tempts us to
some evill.</p>

man able to have this

here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
            <p>It is sure,<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> every
Christian ought to
have this fulnesse. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it is sure eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true Christian hath
the same in some
measure which may
thus be expressed; all
the actions of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
life may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to these three
heads. Either they are
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:10941:101"/>
actions of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Calling, as he is a
Christian, so they are
all good; or secondly
they are actions of
his particular Calling,
which if not done
for any by-respect,
but all for a good
end in obedience to
God, they are good
also. Or thirdly, they
are such actions as
further a man in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his duty in either
of these Callings,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10941:101"/>
which doe either
strengthen him, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking,
which being used
without excess, make
us fitter for our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
being good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
or else they
are recreations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
us, which also
used as the former
are good actions. If
all these actions may
be good, as wee see
they may, seeing a
Christian may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10941:102"/>
performing
some of them, hee
may alwayes bee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good, (according
to the substance of his
actions) though there
be many imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in them, and so
may have the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of conversation.
VVhen wee are idle
Satan takes hold of
us, and looke how
much we are empty,
so much roome the
divell takes up in our
hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:10941:102"/>
VVe must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed that
we be neither idle
nor ill occupied;<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> we
must put on the
whole armour of
God; we must not
onely put on the
brest-plate of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and leave

spirit, but wee must
put on the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

what sinnes all men
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10941:107"/>
are most given to, by
reason of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Therefore
when hee tempts
them with objects
answerable to their
corruptions, hee
knowes they cannot,
(or if they can, very
hardly) resist them;
Hee tempts the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
with company
which wil draw him
to fall into that sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
because hee knowes
the drunkard cannot
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10941:107"/>
refuse such company
being offered. The
lascivious hee tempts
with an unchast ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which he knows
hee cannot resist.
Thus he makes mens
corruptions betray
them, although some
corruption and lust
may be still, and dead
in a man for a while,
yet when a fit object
is offered, if it be not
fully mortified, it
will take hold, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:10941:108"/>
shew it selfe.</p>

when our
hearts are hardened
and made senslesse
with these corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and with the

can onely
humble the heart, and

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10941:109"/>

the heart enough, it
must be a deepe sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

            <p>The third meanes
whereby we may be

Christ for helpe, of
him onely wee have
spirituall strength;
hence the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
the Ephesians,
besides, <hi>Putting on the

strong in the LORD,
Ephes. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of their rocks, lye
open to bee devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the lyons &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wilde beasts: so
also if wee be out of
our rock, we are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of the roaring ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the divell and his
tentations; it is not
sayd that wee are
stronger then hee is,
but he which is in us,
Christ, is stronger
then he which rules
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10941:111"/>
in the world Let us
learn wisdome of the
conies, which though
they bee very weake,
yet because they
make their houses in
the rocks, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
keepe in them,
no wilde beast can
devour them, though
we be never so weak,
yet if we will flee to
our rock Christ, and
alwayes rely on him,
we need not feare the
divell, and all his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10941:111"/>
if there were
any strength in our
selves, this might not
seeme needfull, but
seeing <hi>Adam</hi> before
hee fell, having such
strength could not
resist the divell in
Paradise, much lesse
can wee now; our
onely strength is by
faith in Christ. As
<hi>Gideon</hi> was to send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a great part of
his hoast by Gods
command before hee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10941:112"/>
could overcome the
<hi>Midianites,</hi> so must
we cast away all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in our selves,
before wee shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to overcome the
divell by relying on
Christ. We must ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cast our selves
wholly upon God,
and relie on him, and
say with <hi>Iehosaphat,
Wee know not what to
doe, O Lord, but our eyes
are upon thee,</hi> 2 Chron.
20. 12. We must take
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:10941:112"/>
heed of assuming any
strength to our selves,
when <hi>God</hi> raiseth <hi>a man</hi>
up, he thinkes that he
rose, partly by his
owne strength, this is
to take away the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which belongs to
God alone, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to dishonour him:
we see that <hi>those</hi> who
trust in their owne
strength, are often
suffered very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
and desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to fall. So <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:10941:113"/>
when in confidence
of his owne strength,
as may appeare <hi>Math.
26. 33. Hee followed
Christ into the high Priests
hall,</hi> then the divell
tempted him and
gave him so fearefull
a foyle. This and the
like examples should
teach us to bee very
thankfull to God, that
hee hath preserved
from such like falls
hitherto, &amp; to cleave
the neerer to him,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:10941:113"/>
that we may not in
the like manner bee
foyled hereafter.</p>
            <p>But some may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,<note place="margin">Object.</note>
that grace is a
very good thing, and
therefore a man may
trust in his owne
grace?</p>
            <p>This is all one to
number the people
with <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ans.</note> and to
make flesh our arme.
To make flesh our
arme, is no more
then to trust in some
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:10941:114"/>
creature, grace is a
creature created in
man by the gracious
worke of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
therefore to trust
in a mans own grace
is to make flesh his
arme.</p>
            <p>VVe must withall
know this Caution,
that there are three
things which will
constraine Christ to
forsake us, and not
help us at need.</p>
            <p>The first is unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,<note place="margin">1. Hindr.</note>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:10941:114"/>
when God
finds not the increase
of his grace, which
he lookes for in us,
the figtree was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because it bare no
fruit when Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to have found
fruit upon it. God
layed waste and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
his vineyard,
because it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull,
after much
cost and labour had
been bestowed upon
it, <hi>God looked it should
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10941:115"/>
have brought forth grates,
and it brought forth wilde
grapes,</hi> Is 5. 4. The same
is expressed in the
Parable, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 26.
The reason hereof is,
because God will not
suffer his name to be
taken in vaine, by
whatsoever God is
knowne, that is his
name, so that the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God, which
after a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
are the names of
God, he will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10941:115"/>
to bee taken in
vaine, he will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that they should
be idle in a man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
daily, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
increased.</p>
            <p>The second Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
is any sin that
lyes in a man unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of,<note place="margin">2. Hindr.</note> as we may
evidently see <hi>Rom 1. 26
2 Thess.</hi> 2. 10. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why this makes
Christ with-hold his
helpe from us, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nne makes
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10941:116"/>
way for another, and
causeth another, not
onely <hi>effectivè,</hi> making
a man the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by custome to
commit sinne againe,
but also <hi>meritoriè,</hi> for
the committing of
one sinne, is often a
punishment for the
committing of some
other sinne before.</p>
            <p>The third Hindrance
is,<note place="margin">3. Hindr.</note> the thrusting of
our selves into battel;
therefore we alwaies
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10941:116"/>
reade that the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
(whensoever
they went out to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
without asking
counsell of the Lord,)
fell before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
As it is with
the head, so it must be
with the members.
Our head Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was tempted of
Satan being led aside
by the spirit into the
desart. Moreover, we
are Gods champions,
and if we goe out to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:10941:117"/>
battell without his
leave, wee are not in
his wayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have no promise
of protection or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
When hee
which is our full
strength doth leave
us, what strength
have we to resist our
adversary. Let us
consider the example
of <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Paul;
Salomon</hi> because hee
tooke a wife of the
Aegiptians contrary
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10941:117"/>
to Gods command,
and so thrust himselfe
into tentation, was
left to himselfe; and
so fell shamefully.
S. <hi>Paul</hi> was led into
tentation, there was
given him a prick in
the flesh the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Satan to buffer
him, therefore Gods
grace was sufficient
for him, and he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the tentation.</p>
            <p>This reproves many<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
who travell for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10941:118"/>
or to see fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that goe to
battell without Gods
sending: therefore
they speed thereafter,
for they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
without some
wound taken, and
that many times mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
This they are to
consider, who thrust
themselves upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of sinning, us
into evill company,
where they have no
promise of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:10941:118"/>
The third generall
thing drawne out of
the text was,<note place="margin">The third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> that we
should put in practise
the strength we had,
and stirre up those
graces which are in
us; This the Apostle
especially aimes at in
this place, exhorting
them to resist the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell;
for all these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will doe us no
good, except we put
them in practise, and
stirre them up in us.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:10941:119"/>
We are therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to watch and
pray; this ward wee
are to keepe over
our selves, is not
easie, no, not then
when any tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is newly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
for then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is ready to enter:
So that wee must be
like the builders of
the Temple, which
held a sword in the
one hand, and built
with the other, being
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:10941:119"/>
in continuall feare of
their enemies: Wee
must watch continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
armed, when we
have least care, then
is Sathan most pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
over us; wee
must have our hearts
both hard and soft,
hard to resist all the
tentations of Satan,
&amp; impressions which
hee would set upon
them: but soft to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any grace, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
from the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10941:120"/>
Spirit of God. VVe
must not quench the
spirit, but the fiery
darts of Satan, that
wee may performe
this, three duties are
required of us.</p>
            <p>First, wee must by
all meanes labour to
bee acquainted with
the policies of Satan,
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> testifies of
himselfe that he was,
and to the end wee
may see his policies,
wee must pray unto
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10941:120"/>
God to open our
eyes, and enlighten
our mindes, that wee
may have a sight of
them, and that is here
worth the observing,
which some Divines
hold concerning the
fall of the Angels,
that it was onely
through the want of
stirring up those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things, and
lights of knowledge
which were in them,
that brought them to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10941:121"/>
their fall; the want of
this was also the
cause of <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are
to runne over all the
tentations wherwith
Satan hath tempted
us, and see his manner
of proceedings, and
what policies hee
hath used, that so
when the like policies
come againe, wee
may be able to resist
him, knowing how
hee did formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10941:121"/>
us. Why should
Satan every day
grow more and more
subti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to tempt us,
and wee not grow
more and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies
to resist him?</p>
            <p>The second duty
is to resist him at the
first, for when wee
give place unto him
at the first, then God
doth in judgement
give us over to him,
and suffers him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10941:122"/>
us: See
this in the example
of <hi>Saul, 1 Sam. 18. 8, 9,
10.</hi> Now for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
to take place in
us, and overcome
us, differ not as may
appeare, <hi>Ephes. 4. 26,
27. Let not the Sunne
goe down upon your wrath,</hi>
that is, let not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
overcome you in
this, <hi>neither give place to
the divell.</hi> Although by
every sinne the divell
doth not take place,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10941:122"/>
yet every sin makes
more roome for the
divell, untill at the
length hee enter.
Marke what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Hosea</hi> saith, <hi>Chap.
7. 6. They have made
their hearts ready like
an oven, whiles they lye
in waite: their baker
sleepeth all the night, in
the morning it burneth
like a flame of fire.</hi> Here
then wee see, that as
an oven if there bee
but little fire left in it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10941:123"/>
over night, yet if the
baker sleep &amp; quench
it not, yet in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the whole oven
is as hot as fire, and
flames as fire: So if
there bee the least
sparke of sinne left in
a mans conscience, if
hee neglect, and doe
not quench it at the
first, it will quickly
get strength and
flame forth, so that it
will bee very hard to
quench it. Many who
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:10941:123"/>
have given way to
vain &amp; idle thoughts,
and have carelesly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
themselves to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenesse
and ease, at
length have become
altogether in Satans
power: like as a soft
thing yeelding at the
first, presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
impression,
their hearts being
once polluted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
all their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
receive the
same impression. It is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10941:124"/>
the heart which set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the seale upon all
the actions, like. as a
seale which alwayes
sets the same impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on the waxe
which it hath it selfe.</p>
            <p>The third duty is,
wee must resist him
in every sinne what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
and not in
some sins onely. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we overcome
many sins whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Satan doth tempt
us, yet wee doe not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10941:124"/>
overcome Satan, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wee overcome
all sins whatsoever.
Every sinne is as it
were a doore into a
mans heart whereby
the divell doth enter;
Now suppose all these
doores were shut but
one onely, the divell
could enter into the
house of our hearts
by that one doore,
and possesse them as
well as if there were
more doores. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10941:125"/>
a mans house
hath many doores,
although all bee shut
but one, a man may
as well take possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by entring at one,
as if all were open:
Also every sinne is a
snare: what matter is
it, whether Satan
hold us fast by many
or one? the divell
hath many weapons
whereby hee playes
with us, and though
we can beate him at
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10941:125"/>
many, yet if hee be
but too hard for us
at one, that is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for him, for hee
can slay us with that
one weapon: and
what matter if hee
slay us with a pen-knife,
or a speare, a
great sinne, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
one, for sure it
is, that the least sinne
seene and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, or delighted
in, is sufficient to
keepe us in the divels
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:10941:126"/>
power, and for the
divell to hold us
fast with.</p>

Christ testifies of

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:10941:130"/>
that hee had not lost
one of those whom
his Father had given
him. Besides, if the
death of Christ was
able to reconcile us
unto God, then much
more his life being
a more powerfull
meanes, shall preserve
us to eternall life, this
is the Apostl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> owne

<hi>Much more, being iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his bloud, wee
shall bee saved from wrath
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:10941:131"/>
through him. For if when
we were enemies, we were
reconciled to God by the
death of his Sonne: much
more being reconciled, wee
shall bee saved by his life.</hi>
And although wee
have not this preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
for our owne
sakes, yet God will
preserve us for his
owne names sake, we
being his portion, <hi>The
Lords portion is his people,
Iacob is the lot of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi>
saith <hi>Moses</hi> in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:10941:131"/>
his most divine songs
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 9. Surely God
will not loss his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore hee
will preserve his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which are his
portion.</p>
            <p>The third reason is
drawne from the
weaknesse of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,<note place="margin">3</note>
with whom
we fight, namely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his deaths-wound,
and over
whom Christ hath
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10941:132"/>
triumphed, as appears
<hi>Col. 2 15. Hee hath spoiled,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
and powers, and
hath made a shew of them
openly, triumphing over
them on his crosse.</hi> Now
the divels strength is
not taken from him,
but he is spoyled of
that liberty which
he had before, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
his power
upon us; for hee had
power as a tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
once over us, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:10941:132"/>
liberty to use that
power, but now all
his liberty is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and therefore
hee onely tempts and
afflicts the children
of God by permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and hee can goe
no further then God
permits. Hee could
not tempt <hi>Iob</hi> at all,
untill hee had permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from God, and
then also hee could
afflict him onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that measure, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:10941:133"/>
by that means which
God suffered him. For
the further clearing
of this truth some
objections that may
be made, and which
use to arise would be
answered.</p>
            <p>If indeed in the
time of tentation I
were perswaded that
I were truly in Christ,<note place="margin">Object.</note>
then I should not
doubt to get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
but in tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I cannot finde
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:10941:133"/>
this perswasion.</p>
            <p>Some men are in the
state of grace,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> others
are not. Now this
promise indeed, as all
of the like kind, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to them that are
in the state of grace;
and for such, in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to beleeve Satan,
nor their owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for a man in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
is like one in a
swound, who hath
no use of his senses, let
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:10941:134"/>
a man therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
his former life,
whether there hath
beene any reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that; whether
he hath felt a change
in his heart, which if
he can find, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he feeles for the
present, he needs not
doubt but hee is in
Christ. Now amongst
other signes this is a
speciall one, if he can
find that hee doth
truly resist the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10941:134"/>
not for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of vexation or
perplexity that doth
accompany it, but for
the avoiding of sinne
which hee is tempted
unto. Otherwise, if
the party bee not in
the state of grace,
then first he must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to himselfe the
promise of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
his engrafting
into Christ, before he
can have the promise,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10941:135"/>
or apply to himselfe
the victory.</p>
            <p>But it may bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,<note place="margin">Obj.</note>
that a man
may beleeve a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which hee is
not bound to doe.</p>
            <p>For answer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we must know
that there is,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
act of faith, the
first is to cast a mans
selfe upon Christ for
the remission of his
sinnes, and this is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10941:135"/>
as appeares, <hi>Rom. 4.
5. To him that worketh
not, but beleeveth on him
that iustifieth the ungodly,
his faith is counted for
righteousnesse.</hi> After this
application truely
made, will follow
love, repentance, and
obedience. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
act is a reflex
act, whereby a man
is perswaded that hee
doth beleeve, from
whence ariseth spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
joy. Hence the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10941:136"/>
Apostle in his prayer
for the Saints at <hi>Rome,
Rom.</hi> 15. 13. phraseth it
thus, <hi>Now the God of
hope fill you with all ioy
and peace in beleeving.</hi>
He that will exercise
this second act of
faith before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
beleeves a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
otherwise if a
man have the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
hee ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
the second, and
then hee needs not
doubt of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:10941:136"/>
in tentation.</p>
            <p>Many have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,<note place="margin">Object.</note>
so that although
they have often and
long resisted Satan,
yet they are still foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by him.</p>
            <p>Though indeed
they be foiled for the
present,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> yet they get
more strength after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
according to
that, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All
things worke for the best
unto those which love God,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10941:137"/>
to them who are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his purpose.</hi>
Yea further, the divell
failes in both his
ends in tempting
them, his first end is
to have his house
swept, the other to
have it garnished, that
is, to empty the heart
of grace, and to
strengthen sinne in
him, now this ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to strengthen
sinne, is frustrated,
both in regard of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10941:137"/>
guilt and power of
it; First, for the guilt
he is not able to make
that plaine against us,
because God accepts
of our persons, and
nothing in the old
man can hinder God
from accepting the
new man in us. And
although upon the
committing of every
sinne there doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow a
guilt, yet repentance
&amp; the righteousnesse
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10941:138"/>
of Christ comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene,
and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the same from
redounding upon the
person of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in regard
of the power of sin,
his tentation makes
not sinne have more
dominion over us, or
more sway in us, but
the contrary, like as
the water of a well
that hath mud at the
bottome, although
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:10941:138"/>
some may thinke it
the fouler for the
mudde, yet it is the
clearer. So the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of a mans
heart being stirred by
tentation, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
lesse, this being
an occasion of their
purging, for hereby a
man sees his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which lay dead
before, and so labours
to purge his heart
from them, see this
evidently in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:10941:139"/>
for his failing, which
is set downe 2. <hi>Chron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
32. 3. he had a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
end of it, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<hi>vers. 26. David</hi>
had a secret trusting
to the multitude of
the people before he
numbred them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he saw it not
in himselfe, but as
soone as he had num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
them, his heart
smote him, and then
he was humbled for
his sinne. Secondly,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:10941:139"/>
tentations are so farre
from emtpying us
of grace, that they
increase it in us divers
wayes. First, because
they drive us neerer
to Christ, to seeke
him, they make us
fitter to receive him,
for wee must be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptyed
of our selves,
before we are fit to
receive Christ. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
because they
increase humility in
us, which is the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10941:140"/>
ground of all Gods
graces, so that there is
no grace but hath his
rooting herein, that
tentations doe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us, and empty us
of all conceit of our
selves, appeares plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the example of
<hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 8. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because grace is
purified by afflictions,
as spotted clothes, are
clensed by washing,
and like as gold is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by the fire; so
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10941:140"/>
then the meanes
which Satan useth to
winnow out the
good corne, and to
leave the chaffe, to
purge out the pure
gold, and leave the
drosse, the same
meanes God turnes to
the contrary, to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
out the chaffe
from the good corne,
and to purge out the
drosse from the pure
gold.</p>

the victory is in truth
though not in shew,
and therefore as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to them But
here this caution
must bee added, that
wee looke not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
whilest we
stand still and remain
idle, wee must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee can expect
that God will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his promise,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10941:142"/>
we must therefore
resist the divell. God
keepes and preserves
us, but it is by means,
as appeares 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5.
God keepeth us through
faith unto salvation,</hi> and
the Apostle S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
saith, <hi>that hee who hath a
true hope, will purifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
as God is pure, 1 Ioh.
3.</hi> 3. Although God be
said to keepe us, yet
wee are said to keepe
our selves, which is
to be done by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10941:143"/>
use of the meanes
which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
If a Patient
should professe that
hee had committed
his life unto the skill
of the Physitian, and
wholly depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, whereas
notwithstanding hee
would neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from the things
which his physitian
told him to bee hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
nor take any
thing which hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:10941:143"/>
were this
man to be beleeved?
The like may be said
of him who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
he desires to get
the victory in ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon God
wholly for it, and
yet never useth the
meanes God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for it. Now
these are especially
three, two whereof
are things to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:10941:144"/>
reasoning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with Satan
and gazing upon the
object, one thing is
to be done to get the
armour of salvation,
to be girt with it, to
have the shield of
faith especially; there
is none which hath
beene overcome in
tentation, but he hath
failed in one or all of
these. <hi>Eve</hi> failed in all,
she conferred with
the Serpent. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10941:144"/>
shee gazed upon
the object, the fruit
of the forbidden
tree. Thirdly, she u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not the shield of
faith, to reject the
lyes of the Serpent,
who said you shall
not dye at all, when
God had said to the
contrary. The like
wee see in <hi>Davids</hi>
tentation, hee gazed
upon the object till
he was taken, neither
did he use the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10941:145"/>
of salvation as
he ought to have
done. <hi>Iob</hi> failed in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, when
as hee said, <hi>Iob 31. 1. I
made a covenant with
mine eyes,</hi> there is his
resolution, for not
reasoning or dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<hi>why then should
I thinke upon a maid?</hi>
there is his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for not staring
upon the object, <hi>For
what portion of God is
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10941:145"/>
there from above?</hi> and
<hi>vers.</hi> 3. it is evident
that it was faith in
beleeving the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the wicked,
whereby he was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
from walking
in their wayes; <hi>Is not
destruction to the wicked?</hi>
saith hee, <hi>and a strange
punishment to workers of
iniquity? Doth not hee see
my wayes, and count all
my steps?</hi>
            </p>

Consectaries or Vses
from the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the first may
be for reproofe of
those who stirre not
up themselves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the divell, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they
have the promise here
made them: Such are
those who by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
and the bad
inclination of their
natures, give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to some lusts
which they never set
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10941:146"/>
themselves against,
and herewithall they
excuse themselves, it
is their weaknesse and
inclination of their
nature, they must be
borne with, their
heart is good, and
their mind is good,
but to these bee it
spoken, their excuses
wil not defend them,
for if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
as they ought, the
promise is made to
them, they should not
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:10941:147"/>
faile to overcome.
This is the excuse u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
made of most
men for some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
lust that raignes
in them. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
there should be
no doubt of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming:
and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
doth not last
out these <hi>Anakims,</hi>
these lusts, which are
his deadly and sworn
enemies betimes, hee
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:10941:147"/>
shall find they will
be pricks to his sides,
and thornes to his
conscience, even all
his life-time, and at
the houre of his
death especially.</p>
            <p>The second Vse is
for tryall.<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> Here<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee
may have a rule to
try whether we have
resisted Satan or no,
and surely most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is their estate,
who have not put Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to flight by resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:10941:148"/>
but are put to
flight by him in yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and of these
there bee two sorts;
First, those who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
resist at all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
those who
after resisting a while
fall away, and give
over. First for those
who never felt any
combat of Satan, and
know not what his
assaults meane, it is
impossible that they
should bee escaped
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10941:148"/>
out of Satans power,
he will never leave
his possession so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
We see when he
was cast out of one,
whose body hee did
but possesse, before
his departure, he rent
and tare him, and will
he so easily leave the
possession of a soule,
which is his more
proper seat? How
then can any man
think he hath gotten
the victory in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10941:149"/>
combate when
he hath not stricken a
stroake, nor felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
blow, none are
Christs souldiers, or
those whom he came
to redeeme, but such
as are described, <hi>Isa.
61.</hi> 1, 2, 3. The Apostle
saith, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Yee have
not received againe the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of bondage to feare, &amp;c.</hi>
intimating that they
received that, before
they <hi>received the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of adoption;</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10941:149"/>
therefore hath
not felt any assault
from Satan, sure it is
that as yet Satan
raignes in him as his
king, and those men
who themselves have
had no skirmish
with Satan, for the
most part censure
rashly of such whom
they observe to bee
more fearefull of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
in lesser mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Yea, indeed they
judge foolishly of the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10941:150"/>
wayes of God, having
had no experience of
them. But the estate
of the second sort
who fall away is
most fearfull, and
those men become
most dangerous of
all, and greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
professors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have had
some knowledge in
the wayes of God;
that the estate of
these men is fearfull
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:10941:150"/>
appeares <hi>Heb. 10. 26.
If wee sinne wilfully after
wee have received the
knowledge of the truth,
there remaineth no more
sacrifice for sinne, but a
certaine fearefull looking
for of iudgement, and fiery
indignation, which shall
devoure the adversaries;</hi>
and verse last, <hi>wee are
not of them who drawe
backe unto perdition.</hi> Here
is implied, that such as
draw back doe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
perdition. Now
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:10941:151"/>
that these men resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
not truely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
because they
fell away, for if they
had they could not
but have gotten the
victory. Men use to
bee deceived in this
kind three wayes, and
when any of these
happen they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
First, when
men thinke they sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and repent for
their sinnes, whereas
indeed it is for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:10941:151"/>
and smart
which they feele for
them, thus did the
people <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 14. it
was for the losse of
their corne and wine
for which they how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
they had onely
an outward humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there was no
crying to God in the
heart; so much the
Lord testifies by the
Prophet, <hi>They have not
cryed to mee with their
heart, when they howled
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:10941:152"/>
upon their beds: they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
themselves for corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and wine, and they rebe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
against me.</hi> The same
people are compare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to a brittle bow,
<hi>vers.</hi> 16. they stood
bent with many faire
promises, but when
they came once to be
proved, they failed of
their pretences, as a
brittle bow that
knaps asunder being
tryed, thus many are
humbled for some
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10941:152"/>
present affliction that
lyes upon them, or
for the avoyding of
some sensible trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when they have
no resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and turne to
God, it is seldome
done, but in passion,
and so continues not.
Evill men never doe
good but in passion,
as good men never
doe evill but in passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but when the
blast of passion is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:10941:153"/>
then every man
goes his owne way,
the good man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to heaven, the
wicked man forward
to hell. This was the
fault of the second
ground, which thogh
it received the Word,
yet brought forth no
fruit, because the seed
had no rooting. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it may be that
the reasons which
perswade a man at
the first to breake off
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10941:153"/>
his sins, are not strong
enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when stronger
reasons are brought
on the other side, hee
is not able to resist,
but is constrained to
yeeld, and so fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
He doth like a
King, which with
ten thousand souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
would goe meet
his adversary with
twentie thousand,
and so is overcome.
Thirdly, a man will
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10941:154"/>
breake off some sins
though not all, and so
thinke hee repents,
whereas there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
some speciall
corruption which he
will not part withall,
and therefore when
religion and this lust
shall stand in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
religion must
give way, and thus he
falls from the truth,
of this sort were <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus</hi>
and <hi>Alexander,
1 Tim.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:10941:154"/>
The third Vse is for
exhortation,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> nor man
ought to faint, bee
Satans temptations
what they will, for
there is a promise of
victory which ought
to sustaine every one.
Now Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are of three
sorts, either against a
mans effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof, or else a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a mans justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or thirdly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:10941:155"/>
a mans sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
First for our
effectuall calling, wee
have the spirit of
God which doth
witnesse the same to
our spirits, and all the
difficulties here arise
from the want of our
full resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
Satan Consider
what Christ saith,
<hi>Math. 11. 30. My yoke is
easie, and my burden light;</hi>
The difficultie hereof,
that Satan would
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:10941:155"/>
make us beleeve to
bee, in leading a
Christian life is not
so. Christs law is
there called a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
because it is so to
our corrupt nature,
and it is also called a
yoke, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
a man within
the bounds of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as the yoke
containes the Oxe in
his ranke, and order,
but as soone as the
burden of sin, which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:10941:156"/>
is truly a burthen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
heavy and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to us, then the
burthen, of Gods law
will bee light, and
when the yoke of
sin is heavy to us,
then the yoke of the
law will be easie and
light. Satan therefore
is a lyer, as he alwaies
hath beene, when he
tells us, of the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christs yoke,
for if we bring with
us a resolution to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:10941:156"/>
beare it, a will and an
endevour, Christ will
make it easie to us.</p>
            <p>Secondly for our
justification, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in this tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
must imitate <hi>Iob,</hi>
who being tempted
very strongly in this
kinde, yet held his
hold, and it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be to his praise
that hee did so; as a
Christian ought not
to conceive his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
to bee lesse
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:10941:157"/>
then they are, so also
hee ought not to
conceive the graces
of God in him, to be
lesse then they are:
his faith ought never
to faile to lay hold
on its object, so that
although God for a
time seeme to hide
his face; yet as wee
doubt not, but the
Sunne shines when it
is under a cloud, so
even then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ought not to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:10941:157"/>
doubt of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
but to beleeve
that the light of his
countenance will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
shine out.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
tentations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
let us take up
the duty commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Apostle,
1 <hi>Cor. 16. 13. Watch yee,
stand fast in the faith,
quit you like men.</hi> The
Apostle himselfe as a
good captaine, leades
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:10941:158"/>
this way which hee
points out to others,
as we may see 1 <hi>Cor. 9.
27. I keepe under my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and bring it into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
left that by any
meanes when I have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to others, I my selfe
should bee a castaway.</hi> It
was the sinne and
ruine of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
in that they
would not beleeve
the victory, which
GOD promised to
them in subduing the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10941:158"/>
Canaanites, and so it
will bee our ruine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
if we beleeve not
the promise of God
for victory over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
We must know
that we are as well to
beleeve the promises
of our sanctification,
as of our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from that of the
Apostle <hi>Iames 1. 5. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man want wisdome, let
him aske of God, and it
shall be given him.</hi> The
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:10941:159"/>
same may bee said of
any other grace, and
it followes <hi>ver. 6. Let

Let us therefore

10.</hi> 39. Here because
some think they have
overcome, when
they have not, it is
necessary to know
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:10941:160"/>
the signes of yeelding
unto Satan, which
are these;</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first signe is,
when wee lay aside
the weapons of our
spirituall warfare, as,
to pray lesse, to
heare the word of
God more seldome,
to forsake religious
company, to avoide
occasions of sin lesse,
and when wee doe
not continue, to use
these weapons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10941:160"/>
Satan is resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
then surely wee
yeeld unto him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
mans griefe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
such as use to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of Satan, are
lesse, and his security
more. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
the one ariseth
from yeelding to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
tentation, after a
man hath beene long
sollicited by him. The
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:10941:161"/>
other ariseth from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
by a constant
resisting: the former
is proper to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
the other to the
godly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when sin
begins to prevaile in
a man more, which is
then, when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to have a fuller
purpose of sinning
afore-hand, lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of it, and
when hee passeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:10941:161"/>
it more steightly,
and with lesse griefe
being committed.
These are the signes
of yeelding unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
Now followes
some helpes against
him to procure the
victory.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, wee must
know that strong
lusts will not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
but by a strong
meanes. Dangerous
diseases are not cured
but by strong poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:10941:162"/>
and more then
ordinary medicines.
Many not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this, have not
gotten the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their lusts, which
otherwise they might
have done. Lusts are
of two sorts, some
are naked and simple,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming onely with
their own force, stirre
up thy selfe, that thou
maist resist these, for
so shalt thou bee sure
to overcome. Others
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:10941:162"/>
are whetted on by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
&amp; his force doth
accompany them,
such a tentation was
that of S. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi>
12. 7. he had a thorne
in the flesh, and the
messenger of Satan to
buffet him; It is most
likely that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
was in his
nature before, but
now it assailed him
more powerfully in
regard of the force of
Satan, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:10941:163"/>
it. These
tentations comming
with more force then
their owne, must bee
resisted by us, with
more power then
our owne; the chiefe
meanes are two, first
prayer, and fasting
joyned with it to
sharpen the duty,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. Secondly,
the Word diligently
read, and meditated
upon, for as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are not carnall,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:10941:163"/>
neither are the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
carnall. This
Word is the wisdome
of God, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
thereof may bee
seene, <hi>Prov. 6. 23. The
Commandement,</hi> Saith
Salomon, <hi>is a lampe, and
the Law is a light: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes
of instruction are
the way of life.</hi> Psal.
19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. <hi>The law of the
Lord is perfect, converting
the soule: the testimony of
the Lord is sure, making
wise the simple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:10941:164"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we must
get strong reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our strong
lusts, the lusts of our
flesh are called deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
lusts, <hi>Ephes. 4. 22.
That yee put off according
to your former conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the old man, which is
corrupt according to the
deceitfull lusts;</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a man, and this
is the reason they
hold a man fast so
long: therefore sinnes
are called errors, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:10941:164"/>
ignorances; Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
the new man is
renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>Col. 3. 10. And
have put on the new man,
which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
after the Image of
God which created him.</hi>
For the removing
therefore of our lusts,
the understanding
which was before
deceived, must bee
rightly informed of
the truth, and then
bee confirmed in it
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:10941:165"/>
by sound reasons:
which being done,
the understanding
will change the will,
and affection. So for
the lust of anger, it is
said to rest in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of a foole, <hi>Eccles.
7. 9. Bee not hasty in thy
spirit to bee angry: for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
resteth in the bosome of
fooles.</hi> Folly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cause of it, the
readiest way to bee
cured of it, is, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the judgement
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:10941:165"/>
rightly informed,
which being streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
with reason,
will move the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
So S. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth
the lusts of the flesh,
the lusts of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these lusts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
they then who
have their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
truly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
will with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
case, overcome a
corruption by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:10941:166"/>
strong reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it: but when a
mans judgement is
inclined to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
then hee hath
lost the victory for
lusts get place.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, wee must
labour to undergoe
willingly the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a tentation,
and patiently expect,
till God send delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
First this makes
many a man weary,
when hee sees, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:10941:166"/>
his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting,
that his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
grow stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and stronger: but
wee must know that
our corruptions are
not alwayes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
when they seeme
so to us: if when we
truly resist them they
seeme stronger, it is a
signe wee have more
spirituall feeling in us
then before; we must
not thinke to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them without
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:10941:167"/>
any trouble, for wee
are commanded to
crucifie our lusts,
which crucifying
necessarily imitates
paine. Secondly, this
makes many wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
under tentation,
when after diligent
use of the meanes,
they find no fruit nor
ease. But this should
not discourage them,
for the meanes will
have their effect in
the end. Like as sinne
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:10941:167"/>
though it lye quiet at
the doore a great
while, yet at length
will call downe some
heavy judgement; if
wee sowe to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
wee shall be sure
to reape of the Spirit.
None of our grones,
none of our teares,
which wee shed in
this case will bee lost
or spent in vaine, for
God will put them in
his bottle, as holy
<hi>David</hi> saith, and will
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:10941:168"/>
surely reward them
see this in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10.
4. <hi>Thy prayers and thy
almes are come up for a
memoriall before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, we must
avoide irksomnesse,
wee must consider,
that it is part of the
obedience, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
at our hands,
patiently to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
a tentation, and
therefore it behoveth
us, of duty to doe it.</p>
