            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Their captivitie was indeed turned, in the grant of libertie or licence to depart by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome faire beginnings in the departure of many, and the forwardlineſſe and activitie of ſome already gone to Jeruſalem: Yea, they beheld a full deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by faith in the promiſes; now all this happening ſuddenly and unexpectedly whilſt the Hebrews were by the waters of Babylon, cauſed them in an holy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment to break forth and ſay, When the Lord turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again the captivitie of Sion, we were like unto them that dream. But alas, the caſe was not ſo with all. Many ſonnes and daughters of Sion were willing to continue in bondage, quite ſenſeleſſe of their own evill condition. Now to ſee this ſtupidneſſe of their fathers children, and behold them frozen in an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable careleſnes of their own or Sions welfare, was no ſmall ſorrow to the departed Iſraelites. Thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that were looſed from Babylon were not free from troubles; their way was hedged with thornes, beset
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124486:5"/>
with difficulties: few friends they had, but many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, very malicious very mad againſt them, and they not able in any meaſure to equall their number, match their power, or vie their policie.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the work they were to undertake ſeemed inſuperable, beyond their ſtrength, above their hopes: the very journey conſidered with the probable incumbrances and oppoſitions, might ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſhearten: but the buſineſſe to be performed appeared infinite; to build again the citie, to reedifie the temple, to repaire the wals, to ſettle the nation, to diſtinguiſh the tribes, to eſtabliſh the throne, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the prieſthood, to reſtore diſcipline, and laws, to conſtitute rightly the whole kingdome, with a multitude of other things which I cannot mention, was imployment of unſpeakable hardſhip. The poor remnant daughter of Sion, but newly freed from the yoke of the proud inſulting Chaldees, being to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this task, <hi>contra gentes,</hi> had need to repaire to their God, ſaying, Turn our captivitie oh Lord! nor is it marvell, that the holy Prophet ſeeing all theſe and much more then I can poſſibly conceive, doth in this Pſalm, point them as well to grief as to mirth: ſhew them joyfull things whereof they might be glad, as intimate heavie preſſures and oppoſitions, which they muſt ſtrive and ſtruggle with, even do teares, teares I ſay, not like thoſe of the Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for their dead, without hope; but ſuch as ſhould be put into Gods bottle, and wiped away in the end with comfort and rejoycing, So ſaith my Text: <hi>They that ſow in teares,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words you ſee are metaphoricall, alluding to the buſineſſe of the field: we muſt a little dive into
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124486:6"/>
the metaphor to finde out their meaning. Now this preſents the husbandmans caſe, in times of great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and dearth, when he hath not enough to ſatisfie his want and ſow his land. His hungry family craves for bread to the full, which if he give, his land will be unſowed, to their further prejudice, and therefore he hath thoughts of deniall, but then the preſent want ſpeaks much; ſad countenances, leane cheeks, lanke bellies, become powerfull oratours to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting heart of the father of the family. Full faine would he ſupply their preſent need, but the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of probable approching famine doth deterre; it would be but ſmall comfort to eat now to the full and the very next yeare, to ſacrifice their lives to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. After the revolutions of many thoughts on both ſides, the wary ſeedſman reſolves to deny himſelf and family for the preſent, to commit his precious ſeed to the breeding wombe of the thankfull earth. But being now on his way to the field, the eccho of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens neceſſitie ſounds in his eare, the ſenſe of their great want afflicts his ſoul: Beſides, it is a long time to harveſt, and many caſualties: theſe thoughts renew ſorrow in his breaſt; which breaks forth into weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way, and whilſt he ſoweth his ſeed, he drops his teares. But obſerve what follows, <hi>he reaps in joy;</hi> he comes again rejoycing, <hi>bringing his ſheaves with him.</hi> In my little reading and small experience, I have found that corn ſowen in dear years and times of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, hath yeelded much more encreaſe then at other times ſo that preſently after much want, there hath fallowed great plentie of grain even beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. Now ſince I have conſidered this Pſalm, me thinks, I apprehend one ſpeciall reaſon more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124486:6"/>
then formerly. Beſides the improvement of mens pains and circumſpection uſuall in ſuch times, I note that they then ſow in prayers and teares, and this doth ſurely increaſe their ſtore: thus for certaine was the caſe in my Text.</p>
            <p>Now the ſpirit of God applyes this to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of thoſe that labour in the work of turning Sions captivitie: they that ſweat in this buſineſſe muſt take notice that their condition is like the caſe of ſuch an husbandman, firſt in the act, then in the iſſue. And of theſe there is intimated a fourefold counter-change in my Text. Firſt, ſowing and reaping. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, teares and joy. Thirdly, mourning on and returning backe. Fourthly, bearing precious ſeed, weeping, and bringing ſheaves with gladneſſe. See here, my Brethren, manifold labour indeed: yet none in vain, each hath an anſwerable recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward attending it: ſowing with reaping; tears with joy; ſad travelling with ſweet returning; bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way precious ſeed, with bringing of ſheaves is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded and rewarded. Who can chooſe to note a much raviſhing elegancy in this language of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in compariſon whereof the higheſt ſtraines of profane rhetoricians are pure barbariſme. I have read a learned Writer admiring why the world for the moſt part is ſo much taken with the fabulous Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and alluſions of heathen Poets, whilſt their minds are no whit affected with theſe ſacred ſongs: but the reaſon is apparent, mens minds moſtly are ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124486:7"/>
more of ſuch obſervation, I onely hint it by the way and proceed.</p>
            <p>The Spirit in penning down this part of the Pſalm, doth call the Iſraelites to a ſerious conſideration of their ſtate in the time of turning their captivitie. It would not for the preſent be better then before; yea it might ſeem to be much worſe. <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſeed in Egypt under-went more heavie endurances after the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer was come then before. In the act and time of reſtauration, it ſhould be like to the man that ploughs; ſowes, ſweats, trudges, travels, parts with his deare grain, and patiently waits for what will follow: Gods people in their return from Babylon, ſhall not preſently or eaſily be reſtored and reformed; but with much difficultie and hazard, many hard enterpriſes muſt be attempted: through much trouble, danger, and oppoſition muſt they run; part they muſt with their eaſe and ſafetie, with their comforts and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contentments. Theſe all as precious ſeed muſt be laid in the duſt and die, in hope of future ſpring.</p>
            <p>In the iſſue alſo Sions deliverance and reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſutable with the metaphor, for when the weeks of harveſt, the due and appointed time is come, the labourers in Sions husbandry ſhall reap according as they have ſowed, or ſparingly, or plentifully: yea they ſhall all reap with joy, and their joy ſhall be as the joy of harveſt. When others ſhall periſh and come to a fearfull end: when their name ſhall vaniſh and go out in naſtineſſe, when their place ſhall know them no more: then ſhall the juſt return, with credit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſhall they return to their own land, for the meek ſhall inherit the earth, ſaith Chriſt: yet more, their cup ſhall overflow, for they ſhall come again with joy, <hi>and bring their ſheaves with them.</hi>

The force of inſtruction, giving the Iſraelites and all Gods people to underſtand how painfull and ſorrowfull the worke and times will be, when the Church is in travaile of deliverance. 2. The words have the force of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, calling the ſonnes and daughters, all the friends of Sion to be up and doing, to be active to their uttermoſt in her behalfe. 3 They have the force of motive or inducement to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Husbandry is the hardeſt reſtleſſe kinde of labour, and that I ſpeak of is like ploughing and ſowing in tears. Doth not Scripture in expreſſe termes call the reſtoring of Iſrael Gods great, Gods ſtrange worke? now that proves it to be difficult in an high degree.</p>

Iſrael was diſcomfired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Philiſtines, the Ark of God was taken; the

Now when we read and ponder the ſtory, we finde what a work it was to reform that State; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is extraordinarily raiſed, and wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed to call the people to Reformation.

Men are naturally wedded to what they have had; and albeit they know things were not ſo well as they ought and might be, yet <hi>Iſſachar</hi>-like, they had rather ſtoop to the burthen, then to be at pains to put it off; ſlaviſhly they think it was well enough, it may ſerve turn, and what will come of change is uncertain—.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A nation or people are with much ado brought to a capacitie, or rendered fit to be delivered and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliſhed: thorowout Reformation is like a new piece not fit to be ſowed in an old garment: and there needs be a new frame of ſpirit in the land before Gods great work can be ſettled and placed in it. Further to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this, give me leave to point out foure things which by conſulting the ſacred Volume, I find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be in a people before they are capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and reformation. Firſt, they muſt be truly and throughoutly ſenſible of their bondage and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and clearly brought off confidence in the arme of fleſh. When the deliverer came at firſt to viſite his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:124486:10"/>
brethren, they put him away, ſaying, Who made thee a Judge? and why was this? becauſe they were not yet ſenſible of their own want, found not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to need a deliverer; by which it was evident they were not ſit, nor as yet capable of ſuch a mercy; but after ſome more years, when another King aroſe which knew not <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and began to make heavier their bondage, then the Hebrews grow fully ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and God ſaith, <hi>The crie of the Children of Iſrael is come up to me; come now therefore and I will ſend thee, that thou maiſt bring them out,</hi> Exod. 3.9, 10. and we may ſee by this when a people is fit for deliverance.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> likewiſe acquiants us, that when <hi>Ephraim</hi> firſt ſaw his wound, he went to the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſent to King <hi>Iareb, Hoſ.</hi> 5.13. and whileſt thus it was with them, they were unſit, uncapable of Gods cure, and ſo continue untill they ſee their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, return to the Lord, and take with them words, ſaying, <hi>We will not ride upon horſes, Aſhur ſhall not ſave us,</hi> Hoſ. 14.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Another propertie is, for a people to be willing to do what they can to help themſelves, to carry on the work to the uttermoſt. If the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> begin to be afraid of the Giants; and declare themſelves unwilling, and loath to fight with the ſuppoſed terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maſtie inhabitants of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they do thereby clearly diſcover themſelves to be unſit or uncapable of ſuch a mercy as ſeemed in probabilitie to be near unto them: God hereupon continued their Pilgrimage in the wilderneſſe forty years, untill all were dead that were thus loath to do what they could to help themſelves.

And gave in of their own more then ſufficient: this bountie and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, argued them to be truly fit and capable of greater Reformation then any was wrought before them. Now conſider my Brethren by theſe notes, how hard a thing, how much ado it will be before a nation or people will be brought to ſuch qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there muſt be ploughing, ſowing, planting and ſupplanting in a nation or kingdome, ere a worke of full Reformation will be brough about.</p>
            <p>My fixt Reaſon of this point, is from the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who will have the buſineſſe I ſpeak of to be thus, for the diſcovery of unfound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere inſtruments, and to take away the glory of his Churches deliverance from them. It is the moſt noble and greateſt honour that ever can come to mortall men on earth, to be inſtruments of publique good to a nation: eſpecially to Gods Church and people, moſtly in the cauſe of reſtauration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Now this being ſo ſpecious and deſireable a thing, all forts, good and bad, pious and profane, are ambitions of the happineſſe of it. If therefore the buſineſſe ſhould go on with a faire gale and a flowing tide, accompanied ſtill with likelihood of ſucceſſe, and evidence of credibilitie; how many <hi>Iehu</hi>-like would ſay, Come ſee my zeal? How many of the old Iſraelites, which came out of Egypt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the golden calfe, and hankered after ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vanities, had carried away the honour of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the children of Iſrael into Canaan, had not the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:124486:13"/>
news of the Spies rendered the worke difficult and dangerous, improbable and impoſſible? The Lord in his ſecret wiſdome ſaw onely <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> fit to carry away that ſame: and therefore ſuffered the buſineſſe to appear ſo unlikely and hazardous, for the diſcovery of unſincere Iſraelites, and preventing them of undue honour. Now the ſame reaſon of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence continueth ſtill, the Lord therefore doth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually obſerve the ſame way of proceedings; the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sions captivitie muſt then be very hard and unlikely to come to paſſe, that unſound men may be diſcovered to their ſhame.</p>
            <p>The reflex of this truth upon our ſelves, doth blame the harbouring of evill ſurmiſes, the entertainment of hard thoughts, the deſpiſing of the proceedings and deſpairing of ſucceſſe in the buſineſſe of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eſtabliſhment of our Church, now (by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God) in agitation: the enormities of this kind are ſecret, but ſore evils under the Sun. The Lord our God is doing us good, he hath raiſed inſtruments, and is acting his great work: why ſhould men thinke evil in their hearts, or entertain hard thoughts of God and his inſtruments; give out evil omens or vent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing ſpeeches? Suppoſe the proceedings go not on ſmoothly, or ſo proſperouſly as men expect, out meet with many rubs, be often at a loſſe. Admit there be crookedneſſe and ſtumbling in the progreſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſhall we preſently ſurmiſe that neither God nor man intend us peace and deliverance? ſhall we ſay with the grumbling Iſraelites, It had been better for us to ſerve the Egyptians, and would we had died in Egypt when we did eat to the full? Think my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what an hainous ſin that was in them, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:124486:13"/>
did it provoke the Lord to anger Search the Scripture thorow, if ever you can finde the holy One of Iſrael ſpeak with more indignation againſt any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that ever was committed by his people: yet this ſinne I ſuppoſe is committed abundantly by many in theſe times, and that without feare, and without feeling. Becauſe men want that peace and ſecuritie, that eaſe and plentie: becauſe they meet with char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and troubles more then formerly, they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thinke evill in their hearts; and oh the hard thoughts which they ſurmiſe of the work and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Reformation! Many whet their tongues, make ready their bows, and ſhoot out their arrows, even bitter words; ſeeing the warre continues, the work is ſlowed little done, (as they ſay) mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations fruſtrated, things fall out croſſe, no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of a ſpeedy end, nor any certainty what will come of it: people for the moſt part take libertie to deſpiſe all that bither to hath been acted as the day of ſmall things, and are ready to cry out with the wicked in the Pſalm, Who will ſhew us any good? What hath the Parliament? What have the Armies? What have the Aſſembly done? Vilde and ungratefull queres are theſe: I may ſay of ſuch perſons, as once <hi>Moſes</hi> in like caſe, they have corrupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods children, they are a perverſe and crooked generation: Do ye thus requite the Lord, oh ye fooliſh people and unwiſe?

fit inſtruments, when we the poor ſilenced Miniſters, as <hi>Elijah</hi> of old, thought there were none left which had not bowed the knee? have theſe inſtruments with ſingular freeneſſe of minde ſet upon the ſervice of God and the Kingdome? have they now for divers years ſpent their own means, their time more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then their means? Their health, their ſtrength, their life they have waſted: tyed themſelves to tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attendance day &amp; night. They have laboured and ſtrove continually with almoſt inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and heavie loads of inſupportable inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Deprived they have been of the comforts of their proper habitations and cloyſtred as it were in hired chambers or borrowed roomes. Wife, children, friends, and gainfull imployments have many of them left, and ſurrendred themſelves wholly to the ſervice of the Publique. By Gods bleſſing alſo they have wrought happy beginnings, and made an hopefull progreſſe, much conducing to the common benefit and publique good. Who can tell the gleanings, or number the fourth part of the glory which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to God in his Churches, and the good which hath and is like to accrue to this kingdome by their endeavours? It were too long but to recapitulate the happy freedoms, and the poſitive advantages which they have wrought for Church and Commonwealth. As for the Armies, I may juſtly ſay they have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally faithfull, and have done and ſuffered ſo much as that few Stories yeeld like precedents in ſo ſhort a time, in ſo plentifull a countrey. For the Aſſembly, their labours, travellings, watchings; their zeal to the cauſe of God and work of Reformation, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to conſidering men. But alas, nothing is more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:124486:14"/>
eaſie, then to detract from publike performances. No doctrin is ſooner beleeved then that which acquaints the people, publique affaires are not ſo well ordered, as they ſhould and might be. Who is ignorant how much a few faire ſpeeches of oyl-mouthed <hi>Abſolon</hi> to that effect prevailed againſt <hi>David</hi> and his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies? But ſhould the people of <hi>England</hi> thus requite the Lord and his inſtruments of Reformation? Or is it a ſmall matter thus to caſt ſoule of unthankfulneſſe as it were into the face of God, whilſt he is turning to us in love? Conſider my Brethren, hath the faire morning of our hopes been clouded? Have our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies prevailed, to put a long day to our troubles? Doth the buſineſſe yet go on ſlowly and untowardly? Sure we may thank our own grumbling, our thinking evil in our hearts, our raſh ungratefull cenſuring, our deſpiſing the day of ſmall things, our deſpairing thoughts, words, actions, all juſtly met with, and much to be blamed from the conſideration of the truth in hand.</p>
            <p>From hence is miniſtred ſhame and rebuke to all ſuch as obſtruct the work, hinder and make more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult the progreſſe of Sions delivery. It is a grievous thing to adde to the heavie burthen or an hard task; in ſuch caſe how bitterly and juſtly will the oppreſſed coplain? Much more hainous is it to adde to the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of whole Kingdoms and Churches. To make Sion ſow in teares one yeare, one moneth, one day longer for us, is a ſinne that no Chriſtian would have his ſoul guiltie of, who rightly ponders the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and heavie conſequence of this ſinne; yet I fear there are many <hi>Sanballats</hi> and <hi>Tobiahs</hi> amongſt us, very guiltie of this horrible crime.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A third ſort of men which I ſhall rebuke hence, perſons willing to thwart and croſſe proceedings; ſo when any buſineſſe generally adjudged hopefull, is propounded, they have ſtill doubts to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>THe third inference with which I will conclude this point <hi>is,</hi> matter of admonition. Since it doth ſo clearly appear, that throughout Reformation, and the well eſtabliſhment of Sion is a work ſo extremely hard, and brought about with ſo much difficultie, we ſhould be all perſwaded to wait for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it with patience and chearfulneſſe Put we all our truſt in the Lord, and be doing good, and he will bring it to paſſe. Our extreme longings to have an end this moneth, this year, that Summer, I beleeve, hath neither pleaſed God, nor done us goeth.

of Gods times, do much trench on the priviledges of heaven: The Prophet tels us, That he which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves will not make haſte: and truely it is a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of much weakneſſe in our faith, to be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant in deſires of a forthwith diſpatch of Gods work. Nothing becomes Chriſtians better then a patient waiting on Chriſt their King, whoſe Office it is to bring down the proud enemies of his Church, and in due time to trample them under his feet. We will allow a ſervant much time to effect a tedious bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, we will give a friend more time to work our preferment, and ſhall we not allow our God time to work the deliverance and advanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Church? Oh! my brethren, let our ſouls ſay with <hi>Iob, All the dayes of my appointed time will I wait till my change come.</hi> And in ſuch our patient waiting of the Lords leiſure, take we heed of preſcribing to God time, or meanes, or what inſtruments he ſhall uſe; it was the ſinne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to limit the holy One of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For Chriſts ſake, let not us be guiltie of it, ſay we not ſo much as in our hearts, that the work ſhall be done by ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> time, or by ſuch men, or ſuch meanes, for this would be preſumptuous preſcribing to God. Let me alſo in our waiting intreat you to take heed of aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to men. Note well what the Apoſtle writeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe, that they are but vaine; therefore let no man glory in men.</hi> We ſhould not expect our deliverance from ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and nought from others; but we ſhould truſt God with all the inſtruments which his good providence hath imployed in his work, and wait on him alone for ſucceſſe in due time. This is our duty, and can we want inducements to ſuch a well-pleaſing, ſweet, Chriſtian-like waiting upon God? Onely two
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:124486:16"/>
conſiderations will I propound; the former; is that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The patient abiding of the meek ſhall not alwayes be forgotten; our fathers hoped and truſted in God, and were not aſhamed.</hi> You cannot produce a man in all the Scripture Story, who was not anſwered in what he faithfully depended on God for. We may therefore well be incouraged in our preſent depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. The other conſideration is, that of all the bleſſings which ever God beſtowed on men, thoſe were the beſt bleſſings which have beene longeſt prayed and waited for. <hi>Abraham</hi> had divers ſonnes, but none ſo good as that he waited ſo long for: and what an happy Childe did <hi>Hannah</hi> obtain by prayer, and long waiting? How fruitfull was the promiſed Land, which came after ſo many ages expectance? Tis moſt certain, that the more we pray, and the longer we wait for our deliverance and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the more joyous and excellent will it be when it comes; ſo it ever hath, ſo it ever will be with Gods people; for <hi>they that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond vertue which this portion of Scripture holds out, is a giving us to underſtand what the people of God ought to doe in times of Reformation, when the Church travelleth with deliverance. In this caſe they muſt not be idle ſpectatours, ſit ſtill and onely wiſh well to the buſineſſe in hand, but as the husbandman in times of dearth and ſcarcitie is much more diligent and plentifull in manuring his land, carefull to provide precious ſeed, and inceſſant for the repelling of famine, and procuring of plentie; ſo muſt Gods people, they muſt be up and doing, put their ſhoulder to the work, their hand to the plough, think nothing too much that they are able to doe;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:124486:17"/>
they muſt labour plough, ſow part with all as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feed, lay it down in the duſt. Let then hence the ſentence of holy doctrine be:</p>
            <p>All the friends of Sion ſhould be much and active in pious and precious endevours, when her cauſe is in agitation.</p>
            <p>The Scripture doth learn us this truth, by a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſſage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. when the brood of profane <hi>Eſau</hi> ſtrove with <hi>Iacobs</hi> Seed, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> being a man of warre, muſt chuſe out fit men for battell; <hi>Moſes, Aaron</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This my brethren, ſignified, that every man ſhould act even to intention, to the higheſt degree of his activity, when Sions buſineſſe is in hand, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Cauſe may be at a loſſe. How are <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Napthali</hi> commended for jeoparding their lives in ſuch a caſe? <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Mordecai</hi> could tell <hi>Eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, If thou holdeſt thy peace at this time, thou and thy fathers houſe ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Eſt. 4.14. I might now produce the vow of <hi>David, Pſal,</hi> 132. the zeal of <hi>Vriah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.11 <hi>Daniels</hi> devotions, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18. ſpeak of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> inceſſant, endeavours, and the peoples building the wall with ſwords in their hand, all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing this truth, and leading us to the dutie. But ſee we two ſpeciall injunctions require this; when the worſhip of God, and the juſtice of the Kingdom was carried well on towards the point of eſtabliſhment in the dayes of <hi>David,</hi> then are all the friends of the Church called upon to be active, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122.6. The prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> likewiſe foreſeeing by faith the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rande of the Church, and flouriſhing condition of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:124486:17"/>
Chriſts Kingdom ready to enſue, doth not onely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for himſelf, that he will not hold his peace for Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſake, but alſo calls upon others; yea, all that be mindefull of the Lord, let him have no reſt untill he hath made Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 62.6, 7.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argument to illuſtrate this Doctrine, is from the high and precious nature of Sions cauſe. It will be eaſily granted, that as all intelligent agents act for ſome end, ſo they act according to the nature of the thing they are imployed about. This cals for more or leſſe carefulneſſe and regard, more or leſſe activity and intention, as the matter under hand is more or leſſe of value. Will not the Refiner be ten times ſo circumſpect and induſtrious, when his gold is in the furnace, as when lead is on the fire? How cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and wary is he, that is to cut rich jewels and pearls? Now can there be any, thing in the world more precious, or of ſuch importance, as the cauſe of the Church ſtanding for pure Religion, and unſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worſhip of God, and juſtice? Me thinks in theſe is the very quinteſſence of all excellencies and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials. The whole world is ſubordinate to the Church her good, that men might know and ſerve God aright was the very end of Creation. Yea more, did not the Lord Chriſt die in the cauſe of his Church? Note then how tranſcendent and incomparable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and precious is that, to which in ſome reſpect the Creation and Redemption of the world is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate: great reaſon then is it, that all who would be thought the friends of Sion, ſhould be very active when her cauſe is in agitation.</p>

was but one <hi>Peter</hi> in priſon, how inceſſant was the Church on his behalfe? If a number of Gods dear ones had their cauſe tranſacting, it behoved all well willers which knew it, to be helping in it, if they could. How deſireable is it to do good to a Citie, or a Nation? What have not meere morall men done and undertaken for their countrey upon this onely ground, that the buſineſſe concerned the whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Now the Churches cauſe concerns not a nation onely, but nations: Her cauſe is like her ſelf, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Hath not the whole body benefit by the free dome and happineſſe which comes to any part? Yea poſteritie and ages to come are ſharers in Sions deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Have not we been much the better for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and Reformation vouchſafed in the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> Thus many, and many are parties concerned; yea more, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his bleſſed Sonne, and holy Spirit are intereſſed in it; or much honoured or diſhonoured by it. If any will object, that if it be Gods buſineſſe, he will look to it himſelf, and we need not then be ſo carefull, not active. I anſwer, that the Lord hath committed his cauſe in part to his people to manage; For he is that Lord that put forth his vineyard to husband men, and ſo he puts his cauſe into the hands of Sions friends to ſolicite and proſecute it. And therefore in ſhould not take off, but quicken their activitie; ſince God and men, nations and people, preſent and after ages, are concerned in it.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In ſuch a time, there is much work to be done; Many grievous ſins to be raſed out of the Regiſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, there are many perſonall iniquities, many nationall offences, the ſinnes of our fathers to be put out of remembrance.

our tranſgreſſions, &amp; cancell the hand-writing which is againſt ourſelves and the land. Love indeed is ſaid to cover a multitude of ſins, and there muſt be much expreſſion of great zeal and love which will doe this work. Second to this, the juſtly provoked ire of the Almightie is to be pacified, that is full diſpleaſure fall not upon us; his countenance, his joyfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is to be ſought. Many mercies, many kinds of great mercies are to be obtained; Men are in ſuch times to make the Lord amends (as I may ſo ſpeake with holy reverence) for former failings and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects. And to all this conſider that Sions friends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God in ſuch times ſhould do great things for them; make bare his Arme, appear in the Mount, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his Elect, make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth; ſhould not they then be active, when ſo much is to be done and expected?</p>

Conſider likewiſe; how <hi>Gebal, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amalek.</hi> with the reſt did conſpire, combine, complot, and conſult to cut off Gods people from being any more a nation, and to put the name of Iſrael out of remembrance. As thus it ever was, ſo it ever will be, with the profane of the world, the ſerpent ſeed. Is it not reaſon then, that the womans ſeed ſhould be active in their zeal? otherwiſe it might be juſt with God, to permit the inſtruments of his cauſe to faile, in regard they ſuffer themſelves to be out-done, and out acted by the devils inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

high tranſcendent applauſe is given to this woman by the mouth of the Spirit of God. The like phraſe is but in one place more ro be found in Holy Writ, and there it's given to the bleſſed Virgine, here it is ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of this woman; by which with the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we may clearly ſee how much true zeale in ſuch kinde of actions doth pleaſe the God of glory. And all this I mention, not to flatter or proud up any heart, but by way of juſt vindication and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that have beene forward for God in our juſt cauſe, for their future encouragement; and have not I good reaſon ſo to do in theſe times, when men of zeal meet with ſo many diſheartenings and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements? Truly it's ſome unhappineſſe to be good amongſt us, eſpecially to be zealous in it: for beſides the trouble, and many inconveniences which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie ſuch undertakings the perſons of men truly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for Gods Cauſe among the people, are obvious to ſoule cenſure, oft doe they gaine reproach, and finde unthankfull dealing from many of our owne ſide. How apt are we to bedew our beſt friends, and to requite ill to thoſe who ſtrive moſt for the publike good? Did not conſciouſneſſe of dutie to God, and the true worth and excellency of the imployment bear up Chriſtian hearts and publike ſpirits, many good inſtruments in this Cauſe had long ago been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to God and man, to have quit them of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. I have cauſe therefore lighting on this ſubject, to ſpeak thus much in ſeaſon, for their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and incouragement. Hereby alſo our pious actions fore mentioned, are to be approved; for why, there are a generation who muſſicate againſt them, whiſper and ſay, By what authoritie doe wee theſe things? ſome are ready to ſay, as <hi>Indas</hi> of the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter

Box of Oyntment, Whereto is this waſte? Now I could quickly ſay enough to theſe men, but bleſſed be God, experience hath ſufficiently taught us, that theſe pious endeavours have not been in waſt: for in no age I think were faſtings, prayers, and the duties of this kinde, ſo often, ſo viſibly anſwered. And this will, or may ſtop ſuch mouthes with ſhame. Moreover, the doctrin which I have proved ſheweth divine authoritie, the Lord requiring, expecting, and in effect calling for the frequent exerciſe of theſe duties, in ſuch times, being a chieſe part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſeed which ſhould be ſown. Yea more by this we may conclude, that it were much ſinne and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe to refuſe or neglect: ſee how irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly angry the Lord is with his people for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch duties in ſuch times, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 22. conſult that place, and I ſhall need ſay no more to juſtifie our ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in teares.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Vſe of this point doth miniſter matter of juſt and ſharp reprofe; Firſt, to neuters, a ſort of men wiſe in their own conceit, ſecretly condemning all others, and juſtly to be condemned of all. I may truly ſay, that neither God nor man loves them, it is onely the devill and themſelves that they pleaſe: And were not theſe a kinde of unteachable creatures, I ſhould ſpeak much to their reproof, but I referre them to two places of Scripture; one in the old Teſtament; <hi>Indg.</hi> 5.23. the other, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
            <p>This truth may diſcover to us, how little thoſe men deſerve of the Church and kingdome, who ſtand in their places like ciphers to ſupply a room and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the number, but neither act, nor in good earneſt deſire to act any thing to purpoſe. I confeſſe if men were to make themſelves their own end, they took a

courſe ſeemingly wiſe. For publique grievances, though eaſily ſeen and complained on; yet are very hard to be dealt with. To ſearch into the true cauſes of them, to finde out the right method of euring them, is a work ſo full of toyle, and ſo beſet with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as that ſelfiſh and wary men may well judge it better to ſit quiet, and enjoy their own caſe, then to entangle and trouble themſelves to ſeek the common good. Now of this temper, I fear me, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, too many, who do bleſſe and applaud themſelves in not acting and judging others for their forwardnes. But I beſeech you to conſider earneſtly; that our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, our Kingdome, our Cauſe hath no need of men of <hi>Gallio's</hi> temper, which care for none of theſe things: and what anignoble propertie it is for men called of God, and entruſted with ſo weightie imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſpend their time in doing nothing, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, and leave Gods Buſineſſe to God himſelf and others to care for. I am not ignorant, that men of this make, have many excuſes to plead: but, alas, they are fig-leaves which will not cover their nakedneſſe; and though the World and themſelves were ſo deluded, as not to ſee their guiltines, yet ſuch men will dearely anſwer it before God, for doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or as good as nothing, in the Cauſe of God and the kingdome.</p>
            <p>It remains now onely, that I call upon every one that would not be counted an enemy, but a friend of Sion, to be up and doing, to be much and active in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and precious endeavour for the perfecting our Sions deliverance, and the eſtabliſhing of our Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in peace and truth.

            <p>The firſt of theſe, is an holy, conſcionable, ſincere obſervance of theſe dayes of humiliation.

Let it be your worke on theſe dayes to ſtrive to mortifies your ſins and ſanctifie your ſouls, to bewaile the iniquities of the land, &amp; for the diviſions of <hi>Reuben</hi> let there be great thoughts of heart. Theſe, my Brethren, are the higheſt ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that we can do, for God, our ſelves, or the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and you being our Worthies, ſhould go before and exceed others in them; if therefore you will not do ſo, but refuſe and fleight, or be ſuperficiall in the performance of them; behold, ye have ſinned againſt the Lord, and be ye ſure your ſinne ſhall finde you out.</p>

And the better to prevail in this my ſuit; I ſhall apply the third vertue or force, which lyeth in the words of my Text, as ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all arguments of inducement to perſwade there unto.</p>
            <p>Conſider then firſt I beſeech you, that thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with that activity I ſpeak of, are by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in my Text, ſignified to be as fruitfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſeed, which dies not in the earth, but lives to yeeld increaſe. And this, me thinks, is aboundantly ſufficient to incite every man to act his uttermoſt! If I could aſſure any husbandman that every graine of ſuch kinde of ſeed ſhould live, and not one corne periſh; I need ſay no more to move him to induſtry; how plentifull would be the in ſowing a how free in coſt and pains-taking. But now, paſt all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I may aſſure the ſeeds-man of Sions Cauſe, that his endeavours are ſuch pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ous ſeed, as that no one grain ſhall be loſt, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
