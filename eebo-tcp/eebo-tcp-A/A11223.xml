            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Iuers Treatiſes haue bene publiſhed heere in England, ſome long ſince, ſome very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all of them inviting to the building and employing of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Fiſhing ſhippes, ſuch as our neighbour <hi>Hollanders</hi> call <hi>Buſſes,</hi> Principally to fiſh for <hi>Herrings,</hi> with which kinde of <hi>Fiſh</hi> (Almighty GOD of his rich bounty, bleſſed be his name therefore) hath abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtored his Maieſties Streames, on the coaſts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> aboue all the knowne parts of the world.</p>
            <p>Foure Bookes I haue ſeene of this Subiect.</p>
            <p>One called the <hi>Brittiſh Monarchy,</hi> written An. Dom. 1576. which is nere 40 yeares paſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond intituled <hi>Hitchcocks New-yeares gift,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about 30 yeares ſince.</p>
            <p>The third, named <hi>Englands way to win wealth,</hi> and to encreaſe Ships and Marriners, publiſhed within theſe 2. yeares, whoſe Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (I haue heard) was trained vppe from his youth: and very expert both in Nauigation and Fiſhing.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſtyled the <hi>Trades Increaſe,</hi> now newly come abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16799:3"/>
In all which foure Bookes, but eſpecially in the two laſt, the Neceſſity, Faculty, Profit, and Vſe of that Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trade is proponed and handled.</p>
            <p>After I had read three of the former Bookes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fourth and laſt came to light, I was much affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the buſineſſe. And the more I conſider it, the more is my affection confirmed and encreaſed. And out of vehement deſire to ſee this worke, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to tend ſo much to Gods glory: To the honour of our noble King: To the generall ſtrength, ſafety, and commodity of all his Maieſties large Kingdomes and Dominions: And to the priuate and peculiar benefite and aduancement of euery priuate <hi>Vndertaker</hi> therein. I ſay out of vehement deſire to ſee this worke in hand, &amp; the proſperity thereof, I enquired as often (as conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently I could) what Buſſes or Fiſhing Ships were in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on our Coaſts, or were bought or vſed by any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</p>
            <p>At length I was informed (and that very truely) that one <hi>Roger Godsdue</hi> Eſquire, of Bucknam Ferry in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> had begun to apply himſelfe to this worthy work, and had on the Stockes at <hi>Yarmoth</hi> fiue Buſſes; whereof I vnderſtand one is ſince that time launched, and that the other foure are in good forwardneſſe. But when vpon enquiry after the Gentleman, I heard him to be a man of ſuch vndoubted honeſty and integrity, beſides his other vertues and worth, Methought I did ſee God beginning this good buſineſſe in a good hand.</p>
            <p>Soone after I heard that another worthy gentleman, namely Sir <hi>William Haruie</hi> Knight had on the Stockes at Lyme-houſe in the yard of M. <hi>Steuens,</hi> Shipwright, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother very faire large Buſſe neere as big as any Flemiſh Buſſe: which Buſſe I did after ſee my ſelfe when ſhe was
<pb facs="tcp:16799:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in launching; and ſhe is now in the Thames before <hi>Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſide theſe two Gentlemen, I haue not yet heard of any Engliſh that haue yet applyed themſelues that way.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe after many conſiderations of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I perceiued that none of the foure Treatiſes before mentioned, had ſet downe in very plaine particulars the exact charge of Building, Manning, Victualling, and furniſhing of ſuch a Buſſe; and of the gaine or profite, which by Gods bleſſing in probability may redounde yearely to the particular Owner and Aduenturer of ſuch a Shippe.</p>
            <p>And conceiuing Hope that the publication of ſuch particulars, might be ſome furtherance of the Action.</p>
            <p>I reſolued to beſtow my beſt labours to get ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; and to that end I trauailed and conferred with ſuch both Ship-wrights, Marriners, Fiſhermen, Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and others, as I thought to bee able to informe me in the Premiſſes, that ſo I alſo might bring Straw or Morter to that noble Building. Or that I might picke or teaze Occam, or do ſomwhat, that am not able to do much.</p>
            <p>And for that vpon conference with ſome experienced in this Herring Fiſhing, I am informed that a Buſſe of thirty fiue Laſt, that is, of ſeauenty Tunne, is of a very good and meete ſize or ſcantling, wherewith in a foure months fiſhing yearely to make the gaine or profite by Herring onely; Heereafter in particular ſet downe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her imployment yearely alſo Cod-fiſhing, &amp;c.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:16799:4"/>
               <head>I haue therefore here imparted ſuch Inſtructions as I could attaine vnto.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIrſt, of the preciſe dimentions or proportions of ſuch a Buſſe of 35 Laſt. That is of 70 Tun.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the particulars of her Carpenters ſtore, and of her Stewards ſtore, and of her weapons, and the charge of them all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, the particulars of her Herring Nets, and of the VVarropes and other Ropes, Cords and lines, Corke, Pynbols or Buyes belonging to thoſe Nets, with the particular charges of them all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fiftly, the particular Tooles and Implements vſed in dreſſing and packing of the ſaide Herrings, and their particular prizes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixtly, the charge of one hundred Laſt of Herring Caskes or Barrels, and of Salt needefull for the pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of C. Laſt of Herrings.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seuenthly, the particular charge of foure months vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals for 16 perſons to ſerue in the ſaide Buſſe: and the particular charge of Phyſicke and Chirurgerie helpes for thoſe xvi. perſons.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16799:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Afterwards is alſo ſet downe the yearely Charges of repayring the ſaide Buſſe: and of her apparrell and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. And alſo of the ſaid Nets, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Together with the reſt of the ſecond yeares <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Gaine.</hi>

               <p>But I would haue none to imagine that I intend theſe particulars to be ſuch as may not be varied.</p>

               <p>Touching Vtterance and Sale of Herrings when we <note place="margin">Vttera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or Sale.</note>ſhall haue them: I am informed that there is yearely vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and ſpent in his Maieſties owne Dominions, at leaſt ten thouſand Laſt of Herrings, which being ſerued by our ſelues, will keep in the Land aboundance of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which the Dutch yearely carry out for the Herrings which they catch on our own coaſts, and ſell to vs. Now, if ſuch a Buſſe as aforeſaide get yearely C.

<pb facs="tcp:16799:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dutch haue for theirs; for I heare that the Dutch could yearely vtter double ſo many as they doe ſell if they had them. But if that ſhould not bee ſo, ſurely it were too great pouerty for Engliſh mindes (like Horſes that know not their owne ſtrength) to feare to ſet foote by the Dutch, or by any other people vnder Heauen, or to feare to ſpeede woorſe in any Market or place then they: and yet not be driuen to beat down the Markets neither, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Dutch ſhould prooue more froward and food then I can yet miſtruſt: but if they ſhould, I will not bee perſwaded to thinke, but that the worſer part would fall out to their ſhare at laſt.</p>
               <p>If there will bee imployment but for 1000.

               <p>I thanke God I neither hate nor enuy the Dutch; nay (for good and due reſpects) I preferre them to all other forraigne Nations in my loue; and they acknowledging vs as they ought, wee ſhall I hope doe them no wrong, and they muſt doe vs right.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, touching the vſe of this famous Fiſher-trade, I will onely commend vnto your conſiderations, that which is written thereof in all the foure Bookes before mentioned: namely, in the <hi>Brittiſh Monarchy,</hi> and <hi>Hitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks New-yeares-guift,</hi> and in <hi>Englands way to win wealth &amp;c.</hi> and in the <hi>Trades increaſe.</hi> The Dutch haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as by their onely or chiefe meanes curbed and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their aduerſaries; what then may wee doe by it, if God pleaſe, we I ſay to whome he hath vouchſafed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of other helpes (which Dutch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>land hath not) to ſecond this; this trade ſets awarke all their idle, it keeps their gold &amp; ſiluer in their dominions and multiplies it.</p>

TO begin withall, if but ſome of our Noblemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome of our Gentry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome Cittizens and others of ability, each man for himſelfe, would ſpeedily prouide and imploy at leaſt one Buſſe a peece, ſo as ſome good ſtore of Buſſes may (amongeſt them in that manner bee ſpeedily prouided and imployed, to ioyne with Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Haruey,</hi> who is already entred the field alone. No doubt but his Maieſty will bee pleaſed (at their humble ſuite) to encourage and incorporate them with priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, immunities, and authority; and ſo they may chooſe amongſt themſelues, ſome meet officers and ouerſeers, and make meete lawes and orders for the due and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable taking, curing, packing, and ſelling of the ſaide Herrings, &amp;c. As the French and Straights Merchants who being ſo incorporated, yet haue euery man his own ſhip, or the ſhip hee hiers: and each man by himſelfe or by his Factor, goes out, returnes, buyes &amp; ſels, not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the priuate lawes and orders of their reſpectiue companies.</p>
               <p>But if at the firſt entrance there will not bee any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Buſſes ſo prouided, and Aduentured as aboueſaid. If his Maieſty will be pleaſed ſo to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate ſome fit for this worke; and (out of that corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) a ſufficient Treaſurer, and other needefull officers be here choſen &amp; made known; then may all that pleaſe, (of whatſoeuer honeſt condition) bring in (by a day to be aſſigned) what ſum of money any ſhal like to Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture herein, from 5. pound, vpwards.</p>
               <p>And when there ſhall be brought in 70. or 80. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, then preſently the ſaid Officers to prouide an hundred Buſſes, which with that money will be roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally built and furniſhed, and all their firſt yeares charge defrayed.</p>

And as more ſtocke ſhal come in, ſo alſo more Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be ſo prouided and added to thoſe former, &amp;c. All which may bee (as in the now Eaſt India company) the ioynt ſtocke and Buſſes of the company.</p>
               <p>Of which Ioynt ſtocke and Buſſes, euery aduenturer according to the proportion of his ſaid Aduenture, may yearely know, giue, and receiue his proportion, as it ſhal pleaſe God to diſpoſe of the whole fleete and buſineſſe. But whereas in the ſaid Eaſt India company, and others ſuch like, as haue a common Treaſury, whereinto euery Aduenture is promiſcuouſly put, the ſaide Aduentures once brought in, are there ſtill continued in banke, and often additions cald for. In this Fiſhing company, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aduenturer ſhall but onely (as it were) lend the mony he aduentureth for one yeare or there abouts, as before is ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now for the good gouernment and ſincere diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Ioynt ſtocke, &amp;c. It would be ſpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided (amongeſt other ordinances and prouiſions) that all Officers be only annuall; and that thoſe be freely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and yearely changed by the more voats of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, yearely to be aſſembled for that purpoſe. And that whatſoeuer gratuities, or rewards, or fees, ſhall be yearly giuen to ſuch Officers, may (not onely in groſſe, but) in particular be diſtributed or ſet down by the more part of voyces of the company ſo aſſembled; and not one groſſe ſum giuen, bee deuided or diſtributed by any one man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo may the company with their owne money arme and enable one man, (firſt thereby made proud) to ouer-rule and keep vnder themſelues, by binding his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low officers to himſelfe, to the neglect of the generality, whoſe proper gifts they be, though by that ill meanes it be not acknowledged, beſides many other miſchiefes &amp;
