            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ch is our blindneſſe, and ignorance, that wee are too ready to judg amiſſe of our ſelves: as may appeare by two extreames, into which the moſt runne. The one is ſelf-conceitedneſſe, or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our ſelves, in, and about our ſpirituall eſtate: perſwading our ſelves that wee are in the eſtate of Grace, and that wee have the love and favor of God, when as it is neither ſo, nor
<pb facs="tcp:15301:9"/>
ſo. For the redreſſing of which miſchiefe, I have heretofore undertaken the diſcoverie of true and ſound grace, from falſe &amp; counterfeit; that ſo we may no longer be deluded by an overweening of our ſelves, and too high an opinion of our goodneſſe, as if we were that which wee are not, or were not that which wee are. The other extream is a diffidence, and diſtruſt of Gods love, and our own happines, through the ſenſe, and ſmart of ſome troubles and afflictions wherewith it pleaſeth the Lord in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and wiſdom to exerciſe and trie us. Whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:15301:9"/>
of Gods deere ones, are ready to ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure themſelves as out-caſts (or at the beſt) as a people, but meanly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, or regarded of God, in that they are ſo ſorely afflicted. For the healing of which error; that there may be no miſtaking, that we neither charge the Lord with any want of love to us ward, or hard dealing with us in afflicting of us, nor ſurcharge our ſelves with unnecſſary, &amp; needles feares, and cares; nor yet cauſeleſly increaſe our griefe, by adding of more ſorrow to our affliction, I have now undertaken this Treatiſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my deſire, and ayme
<pb facs="tcp:15301:10"/>
is to miniſter ſome comfort to ſuch as are in affliction, that ſo they may not caſt off their hope of hapines in Heaven, becauſe they are exerciſed with judgments upon earth: but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the Lord it now refining and polliſhing them, that ſo they may bee the fitter for that glory which is prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I know it is a hard thing to obey in ſuffering: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for our good, we ſhould with the more willingnes, and cheerfulnes, undergo whatſoever afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s it ſhal pleaſe the Lord to exerciſe us with. If our afflictions brought God out of love
<pb facs="tcp:15301:10"/>
with us, or us more in love with that which God hates and is hurtfull unto us: or if our afflictions were ſent unto us as curſes, wee had great cauſe to mourn in them: but ſeeing they make ſo much for our good (being ſanctified unto us) and the word of truth telleth us, that wee are bleſſed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, have wee not great cauſe to bee thankfull to God for them? the Lord ſees how ready we are to plunge our ſelves into perils, if we be but a while exempted from afflictions: therefore that wee may not be too bold with ſin, the Lord wil have us to fall into affliction, leaſt (being let alone) wee

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are a part of that Epiſtle which was written unto the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans.</hi> In which Epiſtle
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15301:24"/>
there is ſet down firſt, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> or, <hi>Superſcription</hi> of the party unto whom it was ſent, to wit, <hi>The Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans,</hi> verſ. 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> of the perſon from whom it was ſent, ſet forth by a twofold property. The firſt is his fidelity and truth, from whence he is intituled <hi>Amen,</hi> or according to the originall, the, or that <hi>Amen;</hi> which is an <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> and ſignifies as much as <hi>Truly,</hi> or <hi>Trueth it ſelfe,</hi> explicated in the next words, <hi>That faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true witneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is his <hi>Eternity</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> noted in theſe words, <hi>The beginning of the Creatures of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is laid down the <hi>Narration</hi> or matter of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15301:24"/>
the Epiſtle, wherein there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt of all a <hi>Conviction of the Angel his ſinnes:</hi> the firſt whereof is <hi>Lukewarmneſſe,</hi> verſe 15. which is ſuch a temper as is neither hot, nor cold. He was (as all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are) good only in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew and appearance; for he wanted both the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and making of zeal, and piety. He had only an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and face of religion, but wanted both the power of Gods word, and the zeal of his Spirit: in this allyed to the <hi>Cretians, who profeſſed that they knew God, but by their works they denied him, being abominable, diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</hi> Titus 1.16.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Then follows a <hi>Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>or the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which the Lord threatned to inflict
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15301:25"/>
upon him for this ſinne of <hi>Lukewarmenes,</hi> and that is <hi>Rejection,</hi> in the end of the 16. verſ. <hi>I ſhall ſpite thee out of my mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond ſinne for which the Angel (and in him the whole <hi>Church of Laodicea</hi>) is taxed, is his <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>For thou ſayeſt I am rich, and increaſed with goods, and have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third ſinne was <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of his wretchedneſſe, and miſery, <hi>And knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable.</hi> Which miſery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in three particulars, <hi>Poverty, Blindneſſe, and Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> in the end of the 17. verſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third thing in the matter of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> is a <hi>Remedy</hi> preſcribed for the

curing of theſe three fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med miſeries; unto each mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery a ſeverall remedy.</p>
            <p>For the bringing of him out of his <hi>Poverty</hi> the Lord counſells him, verſe 18. <hi>To buy of him gold tryed by the fire, that he might be made rich.</hi> For the covering of his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,</hi> he adviſeth him to furniſh himſelf with <hi>White rayment, that he might be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed.</hi> And for the healing of his <hi>Blindneſſe,</hi> he would have him to <hi>Annoint his eyes with eye-ſalve, that he might ſee.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Fervent Zeal what it is.</note>
               <hi>Bee zealous therefore.</hi> Theſe words are in oppoſition to their <hi>luke-warmnes,</hi> and therefore <hi>Beza</hi> well renders it, <hi>be hot. Zeal</hi> or ſpirituall heat, is an affection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two qualities,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15301:27"/>
               <hi>love and hatred.</hi> The love of God and his truth, and the hatred of every evill which tendeth to the diſhonour of God, or to the clouding, or ecliſping of his truth: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which evils when the childe of GOD ſhall any way beſtirre himſelf, hee is ſaid to be zealous for the Lord.</p>
            <p>So that to <hi>be zealous,</hi> is to ſhew love to God, and hatred of error, and falſe wayes; to be grieved at thoſe things which may diſhonour God, or croſſe his truth, to oppoſe them with might and main, and to the utmoſt of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to reſiſt them.</p>

For writing unto the penitent <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> The meaning of the Lord in this place is to exhort the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> to the practice of that duty, which they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neglected, being a lukewarme, a remiſſe, and careleſſe people. Therefore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15301:28"/>
having before reproved them for their ſinne of <hi>Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> he doth now exhort them to be zealous; and not only ſo, but to repent them of their former remiſneſſe. The words of the verſe may be thus metaphraſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe that are my deareſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, my beſt beloved, I do rebuke, and convince of their ſinnes, yea as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving father tendering their good, I do in mercy correct, and chaſtiſe them: therefore ſee you be not ſo Lukewarme as heretofore you have been, but ſhew more love to mee and my word, and more hatred to error and evill wayes, be grieved and ſorry for your olde courſes, and amend your lives.</hi>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:15301:29"/>Come wee now to the rayſing of ſome <hi>Inſtructions</hi> out of the words. In that the Lord telleth the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> that he rebuketh and chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as many as he loveth, wee may in the firſt place from hence learn, that <hi>None, no not the beſt of Gods dear children are without their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als &amp; afflictions.

               <hi>Job.</hi> 5.1. Affliction is the lot and portion of all Gods children. It was a cup which Almighty God did temper and put into the hands of Chriſt his beſt belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sonne. <hi>Shall I not drink of the cup which my father hath given me? John</hi> 18.11. And in this cup Chriſt will have all his members to pledg him, as appeareth, <hi>Mat</hi> 20.23. <hi>Ye ſhall drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15301:29"/>
of my cup, and be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the baptiſme that I am baptized with.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Tryals</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> are by <hi>Paul</hi> called the <hi>marks of the Lord Jeſus. Gal.</hi> 6.17. <hi>I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The croſſe is Chriſt his badge, and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance. <hi>If any man will be my follower, let him denie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his croſſe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and follow me, Luke</hi> 9.23. The way wherein Chriſt went to glory was affliction, and in this path all that ſhall be glorified with him muſt foot it after him, for, <hi>Acts.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Thorow many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wee muſt enter into tho Kingdom of God.</hi>

            <p>The way to heaven, and happineſſe is not ſtrewed with ruſhes, or ſet with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and roſes, but with briars
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15301:30"/>
and thorns; it is not a milky, but a thorny way; not a faire, broad, ſmooth, and eaſie, but a narrow, cragged, crooked and croſſe way, through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties and troubles. As the children of Iſrael were evill intreated in <hi>Egypt,</hi> groaned under heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſighed, and cried for their bondage, before they could be poſſeſſed of that land which flowed with milk and hony; ſo muſt we know what troubles, and ſorrows mean, before we come at our place of reſt, our ſpirituall, and Heavenly Canaan.</p>
            <p>True it is, that ſome have but a few tryals in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of others, yet the moſt have many, and the beſt (yea all) have ſome, <hi>for all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi>

2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. Do you deſire examples for the better ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and confirming you in the trueth of this point? Soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may I find where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, then where, or how to make an end; therefore out of an heap, and a cloud of witneſſes I will take but an handfull, ſome few drops. <hi>Job</hi> was a holy man as the Lord <hi>himſelf hath witneſſed of him. Job</hi> 1.8. <hi>An upright, and juſt man, one that feared God and eſchewed evill.</hi> Yet how great were his tryals; how ſharp and bitter were his afflictions?

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15301:31"/>
time to call and cry for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Wee ſhould take it to be a heavy judgement, and think that the Lord were highly diſpleaſed with us, if out of ten children, ſome two, or three of them, ſhould be made away by an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſudden death; but to be at one blow bereaved of all our children, to loſe ten at one clap, where is the man that would lay his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mouth in ſo great a tentation, and not murmurre againſt the Lord? Beſides, the Lord came neerer to <hi>Job,</hi> fighting againſt him with many perſonall terrors, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting his body with aches, and botches, vexing his ſoul in the day time either with the words of a fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his wife, or with the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and taunting ſpeeches
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15301:31"/>
of ſome which came to viſit him, whereas in truth (like <hi>miſerable comforters, Job</hi> 16.2.) they came to vex, and gall him: And in the night time how was he tumbled, and toſſed up and down? <hi>Job</hi> 7.4. for when he ſaid, <hi>My couch ſhall relieve me, and my bed ſhall bring mee comfort; then was hee feared with dreams; and aſtoniſhed with viſions, Job</hi> 7.13.14. So that he was a burthen to himſelf, grew weary of his life, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the day wherein he was born, wiſhing that he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his birth, that he might not have lived to ſee and feel the miſeries and ſorrows which he ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> alſo was <hi>a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods own heart</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.14. Yet how ſorely did the Lord (almoſt all his life time)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15301:32"/>
exerciſe and afflict him? Hee was daily <hi>puniſhed and chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every morning. Pſal.</hi> 73.14. So as he roared day and night through extremity of grief: his bones were conſumed with ſorrow; and his moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was like the drought in ſummer. Betrayed by his falſe-hearted friends, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and purſued from place to place by <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.20. <hi>As one would hunt a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge in the mountains.</hi> And, which went neerer him then any other troubles (his ſins excepted) what heart-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſorrows did he ſuſtain through the wickedneſſe of his children? defiling each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, murdering each other, yea and (moſt unnaturally) ſeeking to depoſe him from the Kingdom. It would fill a volume to ſet down the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15301:32"/>
manifold afflictions, which are recorded of GODS children. I will therefore ſpeak but of one or two moe, which I cannot omit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their examples will tend much to our ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we will compare our tryals and afflictions with theirs, and conſider how farre theirs have exceeded ours.</p>
            <p>One would think that if any upon earth ſhould ſcape ſcot free (as they ſay) and be without afflictions, the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary,</hi> the mother of our Lord might, ſhe being a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>ſo freely beloved of God, Luke</hi> 1.28. and ſo neere unto Chriſt. But if God would have the mother to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, becauſe a ſinner, yet (mee thinks) her ſonne (<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>Firſt concerning <hi>Mary,</hi> let us conſider what old <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> ſaid unto her, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.35. <hi>A ſword ſhall pierce through thy Soul.</hi> Shee under-went not onely out-ward, and bodily afflictions, but alſo in-ward and ſpirituall tryalls even ſuch as pierced her very Soul. <hi>A ſorrowfull ſpirit drieth up the bones, ſaith Solomon, Pro.</hi> 17.22.

            <p>How did <hi>Jacob</hi> take on when hee beheld but the bloody coat of his ſonne <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph?

How then (thinke we) was <hi>Mary</hi> affected at the ſight of ſo many and ſo great miſeries which befell her ſon? And yet all theſe (as I take it) were but the beginnings, and occaſions of greater internall heart-breakings, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all agonies, with which her ſoul conflicted. For what perplexed thoughts (may we think) did aſſault her ſoul, nay what did not, when ſhe ſaw every thing directly to thwart, and croſſe her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived hopes grounded upon the warrant and truth of Divine <hi>Oracles?</hi> Might not <hi>Mary</hi> have thus complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>What, is this he that

ſhould be the Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Iſrael? the horn of Salvation unto them, to be thus maligned and crucified?</hi> And yet while he lived, there was ſome hope (though no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood) that God might work miraculouſly for his advancement, and by means unknown, make good his promiſes; but now that he is done to death, that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and accurſed death of the croſſe, what hope is left? <hi>I thought that he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the Kingdom again to Iſrael.</hi> But alas how can that bee, he being now dead, and laid in his grave? Surely <hi>Mary</hi> had ſunk under this burthen, her faith, her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had failed her, had ſhe not with <hi>Abraham</hi> (the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull) above hope, beleeved under hope,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15301:36"/>
not regarding the outward miſerable condition of her ſonne, but faſtning the eye of her faith upon the Lord, true of his Word, and juſt of his promiſe; yet for all her faith and patience, behold and ſee if any ſorrow were like unto <hi>Mary</hi> her ſorrow? The mourning of a mother for her ſonne, her only ſonne, the ſonne of her hopes, her hearts delight: nay that ſon, in whom ſhee expected that all the kindreds, and nations of the world ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and yet now dying, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt ignominious, ſhamefull &amp; accurſed death, now periſhing without hope of recovery.

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:15301:37"/>

and terrors which had ſeazed upon him, conflicting with the wrath of God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing the curſe with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt extremity: all which made him (as one rejected and given over of the Lord) in a moſt heavy and dolefull manner to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?

Therefore if thou beeſt now under the rod of God, or hereafter mayſt be, ſay unto thy heart, ſurely there lieth ſome wedge of gold, or Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh garment hid, which the Lord would have me ſearch, and find out, certainly there is ſome <hi>Ionah</hi> that hath ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this ſtorme, there is ſome ſinne or other that hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all this affliction to befall me, which muſt be found out,

yea, and caſt out of my heart, (as <hi>Ionab</hi> was thrown out of the ſhip) before this ſtorm will be calme, before the Lord will take off his hand from afflicting me. Therefore do not repine at the Lords wiſe and righteous dealing, but let thine anget and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation reflect upon thine own vile heart, caſt thy ſelfe with all humilitie, at the feet of God, begge ſome of his eye-ſalve, whereby the eyes of thy underſtanding may be enlightned, that thou mayſt be the more able to gage and ſearch the bottom of thy heart, find out that, or thoſe ſinnes which have provoked the Lord againſt thee, leſt thou periſh through impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.

               <note place="margin">Affliction is phyſick for the ſoul.</note>Afflictions oft times make a bad man good, they always make a good man better.

When the Lord doth afflict us, he is in a courſe of Phyſick with us, to purge out thoſe malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humors, which in the daies of our proſperity wee have contracted unto our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore as wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to receive bitter pils, ſick vomits, and unpleaſing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for our bodily health, ſtriving to take them down,

though they go ſore againſt our ſtomack: As wee endure ſharpe ſalves, and ſtrong eating plaiſters, and powders to be applied to bodily ſores, for the taking down of our proud, and eating out our dead fleſh; ſo muſt wee be patient in the time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing it is a means of helping, and curing our ſick diſtempered ſouls.

The Lord ſees we are ready to caſt our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome perils and dangers, or to run into ſome evils, which would tend to the diſhonor of his name, or the ſcandall of our profeſſion; therefore, by affliction (as with a bit, or bridle put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mouthes) he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us, and ſo, wiſely, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents thoſe ſins, which (if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction were not) we ſhould fall into.

               <hi>Ephraim</hi> was mad upon ſinne, therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. <hi>I will ſtop thy way with thornes, and make an hedge, that ſhe may not find her paths.</hi> Too much ſun-ſhine will dazle our eyes.

The Lord ſees, that proſperity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from affliction blunts the edge of our devotion, cools the fire of our zeal, and dulleth our eager purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heaven and Heavenly things, and therefore he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts us to prevent theſe evils, as hee took away <hi>Jeroboams</hi>

make of Chriſts flock? <hi>entring into every houſe hee drew out both men and women, and put them into priſon, Acts.</hi> 8.3. And being armed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and authority, he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> to put in execution his bloody com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: but the Lord meets him by the way, unhorſeth this perſecutor, ſtrikes him down to the ground, and ſmites him with blindneſſe; and what followed? <hi>Paul</hi> was now a new man: <hi>Act.</hi> 9.6. <hi>He then both trembling, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord what wil thou that I do?</hi> What had become of <hi>Paul,</hi> if affliction had not beene? Which of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted?</hi> Nay, what affliction hath at any time befalne us, which wee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15301:53"/>
could have ſpared? Nay (let me go a little further) is it not beſt with us, when wee are under the rod? Would it not be better with us (thinke you) if the Lord ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us more? If thou beeſt the child of God, I appeale to thy conſcience, whether thy caſe had not been farre worſe, then now it is if affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had not been. Many are like unto thoſe kind of fiſhes which ſeldom or never (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) can be caught but when the water is troubled. So before troubles do befall many, they cannot be caught with the net of the Goſpel, all the coſt that is beſtowed upon them, all the pains that are taken with them, do them little or no good. All the good that the moſt of us learn
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15301:54"/>
is in the ſchool of affliction. So that affliction may ſay (concerning the good wee have) as <hi>Laban</hi> in another caſe ſaid to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31.43 <hi>All that thou ſeeſt is mine.</hi> So in ſome ſence may affliction ſay, Thy humility, thy faith, thy charity, thy obedience, &amp;c. all mine: from whence hadſt thou them? of whom didſt thou learn them, but of me? and therefore mayeſt thank me for them, <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (ſaies <hi>David</hi> to the Lord: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12.) <hi>whom thou chaſtiſeſt and teacheſt him thy Law.</hi> If we can pick no good out of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, learn nothing from them, woe will be unto us, that ever we were corrected.

But, alas ſuch blocks, ſuch non-profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients wee are, that the Lord may juſtly complain of us, as he did of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Amos,</hi> I have thus, and thus corrected you, <hi>Yet have you not returned unto mee ſaith the Lord.

as the old ſaying is, The devill is good while hee is pleaſed. Even the wicked whiles there is nothing to thwart and croſſe them, will carry themſelves temperatly, and ſmoothly; But let the Lord ſet fire upon their hedge of proſperity, let the Lord, but a little, lay his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and you ſhall ſee that verified in them, which Satan maliciouſly, and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly layd unto <hi>Jobs</hi> charge.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15301:56"/>
them, as indeed there is: but affliction, yea ſometime the fear of danger doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it unto us: as appeares in <hi>Peter;</hi> who (hearing Chriſt ſay, that all his <hi>Apoſtles ſhould be offended that night, and flie from him, Matt.</hi> 26.31.) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaimes ſuch unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and therefore tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Chriſt, that whatſoever became of the reſt, he would not forſake him; whereas the very fear of ſome danger or trouble, made him denie, and forſware his maſter, as if he knew him not. Little do wee beleeve what filthy ſtuffe lurketh in theſe wicked hearts of ours, untill ſuch time as the Lord ſtirreth, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us by afflictions.

Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are tentations to try both the truth, and the ſtrength of grace in us: our faith, our patience, our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, our obedience, our love, our courage, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindedneſſe then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, when affliction (which is ſo contrary unto our nature) doth encounter us. For that corruption which dwelleth in us, being exaſperated, and provoked by affliction, will then or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhew it ſelf in its proper colours. Our frowardneſſe, impatience, and infidelity will then appeare, when wee are pained or pinched by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; for then the fleſh begins to kick, and winch, becauſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. <hi>No cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15301:57"/>
though afterward it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe unto them which are thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed.</hi> So that by affliction every one comes to have an experimentall knowledge of the truth, and meaſure of any grace in him. Whence hee may ſay of himſelfe, and others may beleeve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him, as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when hee ſaw how ready and willing he was to offer up his onely ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whom hee ſo dearely loved, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God.</hi> Whiles the Goſpel doth go with a fair, and calme gale, whiles eaſe, liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity doth attend upon the profeſſion thereof, every one will be a Goſpeler, as <hi>Eſter</hi> 8.17. <hi>Many of the people of the land became Jews, when the

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15301:58"/>
them this gift, and grace of patience is exerciſed and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in us; and in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions wee come to make experience of our patience. Hence it is, that our Saviour Chriſt is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. <hi>To have learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> Not that Chriſt was then to learn obedience, but that in the time of his paſſions, himſelf, and others mighr ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his obedience, who preferred the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in drinking of that cup which was given him, though it were never ſo bitter and unpleaſing unto him. Wee are all of us too prone to think better of our ſelves then there is juſt cauſe; wee can promiſe our ſelves great things, and build caſtles in the ayre all the while wee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15301:58"/>
ſtretch our ſelves upon our beds, and drink wine in bowles, live at eaſe and in fulneſſe: but theſe paper buildings, theſe clay walls of ours, are quickly ſhaken, and beaten downe, if the Lord do but ſhoot one arrow of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction out of his quiver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. Therefore the Lord in love, and wiſedome exerciſeth his children, that the truth and ſtrength of grace may be tryed, and ſeen in us, that ſo wee may throughly know our ſelves. The skill of the <hi>Pilot</hi> is then beſt diſcerned, when the windes blow: when the waves &amp; billows riſe, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſhip as it were up to heaven, from whence down it falls again into the deep; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very guſt of winde threatning to turn it over, every wave of

the ſea comming over the ſhip, and gaping to ſwallow it up: In theſe tempeſtuous times, in theſe great perils to keep the ſhip up-right, and to ſave it from drowning, this doth manifeſt, both the knowledge, and the paines of the Pilot: whereas every skuller will be able to croſſe the ſeas in a calme, and when there be no waves to croſſe him. So every one will hold up his head, and be cheerfull whiles proſperity blowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and nothing to croſſe him: but adverſity tryes the man, and the truth and ſtrength of grace in him. For <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.10. <hi>If thou be faint in the day of adverſity, thy ſtrength is ſmall.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> having ſpoken of that warre which the beaſt ſhould make with the Saints, and how they

Whereupon leaſt wee ſhould challenge Gods gifts as our own right, the Lord will let us know of whom wee hold them, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them away from us. To pleaſe, or flatter our ſelves with any outward things, is to reckon without our hoſt: thoſe things are not ours ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fee-tayle, or fee-ſimple;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15301:66"/>
but as tenants at will, we muſt hold them of him, who may every day take them from us, or us from them. If God ſhould let us alone, ſuffer us alwayes to abound and ſwimme in plenty, wee ſhould be ready to take our ſelves to be ſome petty Gods, and wee would not care for any life but this.</p>
            <p>Therefore leſt wee ſhould dote too much upon this world, and take too much content in theſe outward things, as <hi>Jonas</hi> did in his gourd, the Lord will blaſt them, and ſmite them, that ſo wee may ſee the vanity of them. If the things of this life, begin to ſteal away our hearts from beter things, the Lord ſees it is high time, either to truſt us no longer
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15301:67"/>
with them, and therefore takes them from us: as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents take a knife from their childe, leſt he ſhould hurt himſelfe, or others withall. Or elſe (if the Lord ſuffers us ſtill to enjoy them) hee will caſt in ſome bitter thing amongſt them (as nurſes when they would wean their children, rub their nipples with ſome unpleaſing thing) to wean our mindes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from them. If the Lord ſend <hi>Jacob</hi> a <hi>Benjamin,</hi> he will take away a <hi>Rachel.</hi> If there be a <hi>Ziba</hi> to meet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 16.1. <hi>with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred cakes, an hundred bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of raiſins, dryed figgs, and a bottle of wine to comfort him:</hi> there will be a <hi>Shimei</hi> at his heeles to caſt ſtones at <hi>David</hi> and curſe him, and to tell him <hi>that he was taken in his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15301:67"/>
wickedneſſe, becauſe he was a murderer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, if the Lord ſhould not thus remember us with ſome affliction or other, wee would quickly forget both God and our ſelves. For being full, wee be ready <hi>to deny the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Agar</hi> ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Man in proſperity is ſo proud, that hee ſeeketh not for God. Pſal.</hi> 10.4.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Lord complained of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeah, They were filled, and their hearts were exalted;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>they have forgotten me, Hoſ.</hi> 13.6. Proſperity and abundance doth even intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate many, and make them like drunken men: ſo beſotts and befools them, that they have no thoughts of heaven, or heavenly things: no hearts to be thankfull (as they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15301:68"/>
ſhould) to God the giver of every thing they enjoy. Such is the corruption of our wicked nature, that the more of theſe temporall bleſſings wee receive from God, the leſſe wee think, wee need him, and the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer wee think upon him. If once, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 17.10. <hi>wee bee incloſed in our own fat</hi> (twenty to one but) <hi>we ſhall ſpeak proudly with our mouth:</hi> and be ready to aske (as did proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice? Exod.</hi> 5.2. Therefore to prevent the manifold miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which eaſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity (as was formerly ſaid) may bring upon us; to beat us out of our earthly trenches, and to draw up our minds, and affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to better objects: that wee
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15301:68"/>
may ſeek better things then this life can afford us, and make heavenly things our chiefeſt treaſure, and portion; the Lord will have us to feed upon this world, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did eate the Paſſeover, not only with ſowre hearbs, to allay the ſweetneſſe of their bread, but alſo with their ſtaves in their hands, as thoſe that were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to go towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> their place of reſt. <hi>For wee are ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth, here wee have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing citie, Hebr.</hi> 13.14. This world is but a bayting place, as an Inne to reſt our ſelves in for a while. Therefore God will have us ſo to uſe it, as if wee uſed it not, <hi>becauſe the faſhion of this world goeth away,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. They that ſet their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15301:69"/>
on things below, do not live as thoſe that lay up for themſelves treaſures in heaven, ſeeking better and more durable riches, then the world is able to afford them; but as thoſe that make their belly, or their Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon their God. Theſe may well be compared to a ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſot, who travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is content to become an hoſtler in ſome baſe or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Inne, to give content unto the tapſter thereof. Little do wee know, how the Lord takes it (and well hee may) to heart, to ſee us ſo dote upon the things of this world, and ſet our hearts ſo much upon them as wee do. God would have his children to live by faith, to truſt in him, and to reſt and bear
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15301:69"/>

Therefore it is juſt with the Lord to ſtrip us, and ſpoile us of theſe baſe props, that ſo our hope, and confidence, our joy and delight may be chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly in the Lord.

            <p>Which places (with many moe) do teach us how affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction drives people unto prayer; and makes them as well as they can, to lift up hands and eyes toward hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to fall upon their knees, intreat the Lord to ſave them, to ſpare them, or to deliver them from that evill, their fear is comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: in the time of a tempeſt at ſea, when every wave threatens to ſwallow up the ſhip; or in the time of any terrible thunder, and lightning, how godly, how holy, will the prophaneſt be? out of their beds they muſt, and to prayer they will (if they be able) themſelves, if not, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> intreated <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Lord that there be no more mighty thunders and hail.</hi> So they will intreat thoſe that can, to pray for them. But what ſayes holy Job of ſuch hypocrites as theſe are? <hi>Will God hear his cry when trouble commeth upon him? will be ſet his delight on the Almighty? will hee call upon God at all times? Job</hi> 27.9, 10. Is hee like to ſpeed that ſeldome or never goes unto the Lord, but when want, &amp; neceſſity drives him? for if affliction were not, he would not come at God. It fares with many as with young chickins, in á faire, calme, ſun-ſhine day; you may ſee them all ſtragling from the hen, one heere and another there: the hen deſirous to have her young ones neere here, clucks and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15301:74"/>
clucks again for them, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome proviſion for them: but they regard not her call, untill at length the kyte draws neer them, ready to catch one of them up: then they cry and runne with all ſpeed to their dam for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Even ſo the Lord ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to ſtraggle too farre from him, calls us unto him, but wee regard not his call; whereupon he lets flie at us, hee cauſeth ſome affliction or other to terrifie us, and then wee ſpeed it to the Lord, then wee can lay on tongue, Help Lord, &amp;c. So that the Lord deales with us as <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> did with <hi>Joab,</hi> becauſe we deal with the Lord as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> did with <hi>Abſalom. Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom ſends for Ioab, but hee would not come to him.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.29. <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſends again,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15301:74"/>
and <hi>Ioab</hi> was the ſame man ſtill, he ſtirs not a foot, hee would not come. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Abſalom</hi> commandeth his ſervants to ſet fire on a field of barley which <hi>Ioab</hi> had; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> then needs no more meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, hee can then ariſe, and come in haſte to <hi>Abſalom</hi> without any more ſending for. Thus it is with us, the Lord ſends for us by the mouth of his Miniſters, he would have us come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare continually before him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Shew me thy ſight, let me hear thy voice:</hi> but wee have little or no minde this way: he may ſend in haſte, but wee take time, and will goe at our own lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whereupon the Lord ſets on fire ſomething wee have: that is, ſpoiles us of ſome-thing, that is pleaſing,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15301:75"/>
and delightfull unto us, and then wee can run with open mouth, Save us Lord, &amp;c. So that it is meere need drives many unto God by prayer: If they could have helpe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, or by any other wayes be furniſhed, or have their turn ſerved, they would not come at God. <hi>Davids</hi> words may well be applyed unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4, 5. <hi>I looked upon my right hand, and beheld, but there was none that would know me: all refuge fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mee, and none cared for my ſoul: then cried I unto the Lord, and ſaid, Thou art my hope and my portion.</hi> When other refuge and helpe failes, then they can runne unto the Lord for help, and ſuccour. Theſe do in a manner tell the Lord, as many rogues do anſwere us at our doores.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15301:75"/>
Truely they never asked any thing of us before: and if they could ſhift it, or if great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie did not compell them to begge, they would not now have troubled us. Therefore the Lord deales with theſe, as many a wiſe, and diſcreet tradeſman doth with ſome pedling chapman, whoſe cuſtome he never had before, neither now ſhould have it, if hee could elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where have furniſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with wares and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for his turne; If any wares be worſe then other, the tradeſman will put them off to ſuch a fellow, becauſe he knows it is not love, but neceſſitie that brought him unto his ſhop. As for his choyce and beſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thoſe he will reſerve for his beſt chapmen: whoſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15301:76"/>
cuſtome he hath alwayes had, and who will not leave his ſhop to go to another. Even ſo will the Lord deal with the wicked, who do not continually trade with the Lord in prayer, but now and then when they are at ſome pinch. Haply the Lord, (who is <hi>good unto all, and his mercies are over all his works. Pſal.</hi> 145.9.) may put them off with ſome of his refuſe wares, helping them at their need with ſome outward worldly commodity: but as for his choice, and rich wares, his love, his grace, his Chriſt, his ſalvation, theſe ſhall thoſe have who ſeeke him continually.</p>

            <p>The Lord holds us many times at the ſtaves end, and ſeemeth to turn away from our prayers, that ſo our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may grow more fervent: for though God knows our wants, and takes no delight in our ſorrows, yet oft times hee ſeems not to heare us, till our cries be loud, and ſtrong. God ſees it beſt to let his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ones dwell for a time under their affliction, and when he ſees them ſinking, he lets them alone till they be at the bottome, that out of the deep they may fetch deep ſighes, and cry louder to the Lord, and ſo prevail. For a vehement ſuiter cannot but ſpeed with God, whatſoever he askes. If our prayers want ſucceſſe, it is becauſe they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15301:77"/>
want mettall and heart, their bleſſing is according to their faith and fervencie. In this behalfe affliction is very needfull for the beſt of Gods children: for too many of them (too often) ſeek the living God, with dead affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Oh the perfunctory, cold, drowſie, lifeleſſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are made by ſome! Many (which make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the duty, and dare no day omit it) do pray ſo cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with ſo little zeal, and devotion, all the while they are full and at eaſe, that the Lord is even compelled to laſh them, to ſharpen their fervency, and to ſhake off that lytherneſſe, and luskiſhneſſe wherewith they were wont to come before him. Our God that heareth prayers, knoweth how cold, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15301:77"/>
feeble, how ſlight, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory oft times wee be when wee are in proſperity, and the rod of God is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, ſo as little or no life, and power appeareth in them; do wee not find by our own experience, that trouble and affliction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not onely drives us to prayer, but cauſeth us to ſet all our might, and ſtrength, when wee are wreſtling with the Lord, that ſo wee may be the more able to prevaile with his Majeſtie. Affliction will faſhion and forme the floweſt tongue unto this holy duty; and doth oft times furniſh us with ſighs and grones which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. If ever a Chriſtian will tugge and wreſtle with the Lord; it ſhall be when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction

lieth ſore upon him. All the while the childe feels the rod, or the ſtick, hee cries out, hee layes on tongue, hee doth with all eagerneſſe, and earneſtneſſe intreat for pardon, or no moe ſtripes: even ſo when wee feel the ſmart of Gods rod whipping of us, there is an edge ſet upon our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wee pray not in that drowſie and ſleepy manner wee did before. This appears by that which <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.9. <hi>Mine eye mourneth by reaſon of affliction, Lord, I have called upon thee, I have ſtretched out my hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto thee.

Thus the Lord by affliction awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens his children, ſo as they call upon him in a more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner then formerly they have done. If you peruſe the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> you ſhall find that very many (if not moſt) of them were penned in the time of triall and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

This evill day, is the time of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and affliction, which that wee may be the better able to encounter, wee muſt bee well appointed, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Chriſtian fortitude, and courage, that ſo affliction although it may at the firſt daunt us, yet it may neither vanquiſh, nor foil us. To this purpoſe firſt of all, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thee to be oft and ſerious in this meditation, Whoſe thou art, and whoſe all thou haſt is, Art thou not the worke of Gods hands? hath
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15301:93"/>
he not formed and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee? and may not hee alter, and change thee at his pleaſure? So the things of this life, health, wealth, honor, libertie and the like, doe they not hold all in chiefe? is not the earth the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof? Is it not lawfull for the Lord to do with his own as ſeemeth good in his eyes: Do not wee hold theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things with condition of the croſſe and with a limitation of Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</p>
            <p>Secondly, know (as after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward you ſhall hear) that Gods love is immutable, though our outward eſtate and condition be change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Gods love never chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15301:94"/>
he is the ſame God, and his love as entire and great when wee are in affliction, as when wee are out of it. He may, and doth (as you have heard) for ſpeciall ends change our eſtate, yet for his own glory ſake, and our comfort, hee continues ſtill the ſame. A loving father (to all that love, and fear him) before affliction, a tender and loving father in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo for ever after; for whom once he loves, unto the end hee loves. Theſe things ſetled in our hearts, by the help and aſſiſtance of the Lord, wee ſhall be armed to encounter affliction, <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all might through his glorious power, unto all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſſe. Col.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>Which words do teach
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15301:94"/>
us, that the power and ſtrength by which wee ſtand upright in time of trouble, and bear with patience any affliction, is not of our ſelves, but from the Lord: It is God that doth ſtabliſh our hearts with his grace, hee it is that worketh faith in us, and a feeling perſwaſion of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love, and a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and cheerfull reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our ſelves, and all wee have to be ordered, and diſpoſed of by God as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good in his eyes. Whereupon ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, I can be abaſed, and I can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: every where in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, and to abound, and to have want; I am able to doe all things through the helpe of Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth mee.

Phillippians.</hi> 4.12, 13.</p>
            <p>Wee ſay fore-warned fore-armed. Bee warned therefore betimes to prepare for thy triall, that when it comes, thou mayſt be the better armed againſt it. Evils the more ſuddenly they come upon us, the more grievous they prove unto us, and we are the leſſe able to grapple with them, and encounter them. Whereas prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth as it were, pull out the ſting, or beat out the teeth of affliction, that either it bites us not at all, or elſe doth not ſo deadly wound, and hurt us. When <hi>Agabus.</hi> had told S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> what wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and entertainment hee ſhould find at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> how they would <hi>manacle him, and deliver him over into the hands of the Gentiles, Acts</hi> 21.11.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15301:95"/>
Some of his friends beſought him that hee would not go up to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> unto whom he anſwered, <hi>What do yee weeping and breaking mine heart? for I am ready, not to be bound onely, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the name of the Lord Jeſus, verſ.</hi> 13. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being thus prepared for his triall could chearefully, and joyfully undergoe it. Hee is like to look his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the face, and not like a daſtard to turn his back upon him, and betake himſelfe to his leggs, that armes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and prepares for the encounter. The life of a Chriſtian is a continuall warrefare, and wee are ſouldiers. <hi>Thou therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer affliction as a good ſouldier,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. A good ſouldier in garriſon, or in the field,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15301:96"/>
is every day armed, at all ſeaſons ready for the aſſault which may ſuddenly come, the enemie being at hand. Affliction is our common enemie, which as it hath foyled many for want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; ſo hath it been vanquiſhed of many of the Lords worthies, being ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more armed againſt it. <hi>For thy ſake are wee killed all the day long, wee are counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter;</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in all theſe things we are more then Conquerors. What bee killed! and yet be a conqueror? This may ſeem a paradox, a thing contrary to common reaſon; but it is a divine truth.<note place="margin">How are we ſaid to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers when conquered</note> Would you know how Gods children do conquer trials and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? it is thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when troubles, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15301:96"/>
afflictions cannot vanquiſh or overcome them: cannot ſpoyle them of their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and inward peace: cannot batter down their comfort, but that they ſtill <hi>rejoyce in tribulation, Rom.</hi> 15.3. A Chriſtian is then beaten when his heart, and minde is beaten. A man is then overcome when his heart failes, when his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, joy, and peace is vanquiſhed and put to flight. But if theſe hold it out, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever tribulation, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may vanquiſh, yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the outward man, yet the heart and minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not overcome, wee are conquerers, though outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conquered.</p>

But experience hath proved the Devill a lyer, both in <hi>Job,</hi> and other of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15301:98"/>
Gods children. For (as we have formerly heard) afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not onely exerciſe the graces of the ſpirit in their hearts, but puts more life and vigor into them: as fire in an oven is the hotter, becauſe it is reſtrained, and kept under. Therefore the Devill and his inſtruments, vexing and troubling of Gods faithful ſervants, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to drive them out of their pious practice, and to deſiſt godly courſes, do miſtake the marke they ayme at, and miſſe of their miſchievous purpoſe. It is not their ſubtilty or policie; their rage or cruelty, that can make the godly to ſhrink from their holy profeſſion, and grow weary of well-doing: nay rather it doth more and mere confirme
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:15301:98"/>
them in their courſes, and makes them lay faſter hold of the truth, even as a paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the ſtronger the winde blows upon him, the cloſer he ſets his hat to his head, the faſter he tyeth or wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his cloke about him, leſt through the rage and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the winde, either of them be blown from him. So that a Chriſtian is then a conqueror, and gets the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over affliction, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, when he is chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, patient, and conſtant in the bearing of them: which we ſhall hardly be, if we do not daily provide againſt them, and look for them. But alas, it is a trouble unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to heare of troubles, a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment unto them, to heare of affliction: but how are theſe like to ſpeed when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:15301:99"/>For affliction may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly be likened unto the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilisk, of whom it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if it ſees a man before it be ſeene of him, the man dyeth; and ſo of the contrary. It is in ſome ſort true of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; if it ſeize upon us before we ſee it, we are in danger of being wounded by it, but if we look for it afore hand, and arme our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, we ſhall more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt it, and thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are hard unto ſome in ſuffering, will prove eaſie unto us by fore-ſeeing them, &amp; preparing for them. Therfore in proſperity, look for adverſity. In health, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for ſickneſſe. In times of plenty, and fulneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think your ſelves of a dearth and ſcarcity. In our beſt eſtate we ſhould learne to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15301:100"/>
put our ſelves in readineſſe to ſuffer adverſitie: when we are well and at eaſe, if we were wiſe, we would looke for worſe times, keeping ſuch a watch, that in plentie we may thinke of want; and in proſperitie fore-ſee ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. We muſt not thinke alwayes to reſt in our neſt, alwayes to enjoy outward comforts, and know no croſſe: but think ſometimes to receive frowns, and ſtripes as well as ſmiles, and kiſſes from the Lord; eſpecially when our ſinnes offer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall occaſions to the Lord, to exerciſe us with ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, he having roddes enough in ſtore to beate us for, and from our ſinnes. Therefore let us look daily to be aſſaulted, daily to be humbled, and caſt downe,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15301:100"/>
that ſo we may be the better prepared, and alſo the more willing to ſuffer affliction, to partake of adverſity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to glorifie God, then to ſleepe in a whole skinne, to live in eaſe and proſperitie to our owne wo and ſhame. Force thy ſelf daily to mind tryals, and betake thy ſelfe to ſome ſerious thoughts of changes, even when proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and eaſe would moſt divorce thee from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof. If peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be thus wiſe, they ſhould quit themſelves better then they do in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Hence it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods children do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo their afflictions ſo chearfully above others. They can ſay (I thank God) it is no other then I have waited for. I have a long
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15301:101"/>
time looked for this, or ſome other tryall. And thus they are able with more alacrity, and chearfulneſſe to beare their affliction. Whereas ſuch, as could not endure to heare of theſe things, are even diſmayed by them, and at their wits end: oh what ſhall they do? Whither ſhall they go? they ſcarce know which way to winde themſelves: or where to fetch a thought, that may adminiſter any ſound comfort unto them. Therefore make account ſooner or later, to meet with the croſſe, if thou belongeſt unto the Lord, or makeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to come at heaven. We muſt not look to go to heaven (as the ſaying is) in a feather-bed: that is, to live in fulneſſe, eaſe, pleaſure, and worldly delights here, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15301:101"/>
then to heaven after. <hi>No, no: thorow many afflictions we muſt enter into the kingdome of God, Act.</hi> 14.22. God will have all thoſe that ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of joy, and glory with him; now and then here to partake of ſorrow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. God will have thoſe that ſhall hereafter dwell in light; now and then to know what it is to be in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death. This is the way (as we have heard) wherein Chriſt went before us, and all the godly have (hitherto) walked in the ſame path after him: then let not us thinke to make a ſhorter cut, or to chalk out ſome eaſier, or ſmoother way, then that which the Lord himſelf hath layed out for us.</p>

A ſtocke of true holineſſe lying by us, will alay the heat, eaſe the ſmart, and ſweeten the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of any affliction that can befall us.

He had wiſely layed in ſtore of faith, and holineſſe, and uprightneſſe, upon which his ſoul did feed in the dayes of his affliction: So as no afflictions which befell him could beat him from his hold; he reſolves to truſt in God though he ſlay him, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his former grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and righteous carriage towards great and ſmall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially towards the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the poore, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, did furniſh him with ſtrength to undergo the

            <p>Whiles means and liberty is afforded, be wiſe now to ſtore thy ſelf with heavenly proviſion (that is to ſay) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort out of Gods Word, to cheare up thy ſoul, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh thy drooping ſpirits in the day of affliction. <hi>If thy law had not beene my delight, I ſhould now have periſhed in mine affliction,</hi> ſaies <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.92. My affliction would have deſtroyed me, and made me periſh from the right way, if it had not beene lenified, and ſanctified by thy Word. The Word of God teacheth us in all times of tryall to reſt upon the Lord: aſſuring us that there is hope in Iſrael, that there is balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> to aſſwage all griefs, to cure all ſores. The Word of God teacheth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15301:107"/>
us how to conſtrue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in all his dealings with us, and to wait for promiſed ſalvation, which in due time ſhall come, when it ſhall be moſt for Gods glory, and beſt for us. How eaſily would afflictions batter down our confidence, and over-turn our faith, if it were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſupported, and ſtrengthned by the Word? Satan will be ready to buzze into our eares, that God in wrath afflicteth us, that thoſe are moſt beloved, which are leaſt afflicted: but the ſheep of Chriſt will not know, nor follow the voice of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that is, they will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, nor yeeld to any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which tendeth to the withdrawing of their hearts, and hopes from God, but ſet their ſeal to the Word of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15301:108"/>
and ſo through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scriptures reſt in hope. For the more plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the Word of God, in the love and evidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, doth dwell in any man, and enable him to prove all things, the more ſtedfaſtly will he hold that which is good, and ſtand immoveable in the mids of all afflictions, and temptations that ſhall aſſault him. Though thy bones ſhould be vexed, and dryed like a pot-ſheard, and turned into the drought of Summer; though thou wert powred out like water, all thy bones out of joynt, and thy heart melted like wax in the middeſt of thy bowels; though Gods arrows ſhould ſtick faſt in thee, and his hand preſſe thee ſore; though there ſhould be no ſoundneſſe in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:15301:108"/>
thy fleſh, nothing but ſtinch and corruption; yea though innumerable evils ſhould compaſſe thee about, and thou not able to look up; though fearfulneſſe &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſhould come upon thee, and horror be ready to over-whelme thee, yet if thou wilt have recourſe unto the Word of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve what is there promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thou mayeſt <hi>with joy draw waters</hi> (to refreſh thy ſoul) <hi>out of the wells of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Iſa.</hi> 12.3. If thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſound and ſolid comfort, ſuch as will give true content to thy ſoul, thou muſt pick it out of the Scripture: <hi>Thou ſhalt never be truly ſatisfied, unleſſe it be with the breaſts of her conſolation. Iſa.</hi> 66.11. Thou muſt ſuck ſweetneſſe out of the Word to uphold
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:15301:109"/>
thee, <hi>It is my comfort in my trouble</hi> (ſaies <hi>David</hi>) <hi>for thy promiſe hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mee, Pſalme</hi> 119.50. When affliction commeth, whether wilt thou run for comfort? to thy honors, thy revenews, thy poſſeſſions? thy friends? I may ſay of them, in this reſpect, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks to his friends, <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comforters are ye all, Job</hi> 16.2. Thou maieſt as well fetch water out of thy brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls, as draw ſound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from thoſe outward things, which are worſe then vanitie, for <hi>they are vexation of ſpirit. Eccl.</hi> 1.14. Theſe outward things can afford thee no comfort, for <hi>they are nothing. Prov.</hi> 23.5. He is a very ſimple and ſilly <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metician,</hi> who knows not that of nothing comes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15301:109"/>
If thou placeſt thy comfort, or putteſt thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the beſt of earthly things, thou buildeſt upon the ſands, every little blaſt, and tempeſt will overthrow thy building. The ground of all our comfort, the onely anchor to ſtay our ſouls in any ſpirituall tempeſt, the only ſtaffe we have to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the time of afflictions, are thoſe ſweet and precious promiſes made known unto us in the word.</p>
            <p>What ever other carnall comforts men may for a while rejoyce in, they will prove but a flame of ſtubble, or as a blaze of thorns, which can yeeld no ſolid, or abiding light unto the ſoul. A man may as ſoon drink up the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſea with ſpunges, or remove mountaines with one

of his fingers, as be able (by vain ſports, youthfull recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and paſtimes, ſongs and muſick, though hee adde to theſe, the conſideration of his honors, greatneſſe, and riches) to alay thoſe ſorrows and paines, which ſinne and affliction may bring upon him, All theſe vanities will but reſpite them for a little time, that they may return the fiercer. I ſay it again, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and laſting comfort muſt be fetcht out of the word, or no where, if thou expect comfort from other things, thou wilt be deceived. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry toy and trifle, a bable, a thing of nothing, will cut the throat of thy comfort, if thou joyeſt eſpecially in earthly things. <hi>Haman</hi> was ſecond to a mighty Monarch, and wanted nothing that the

The more libertie that any of Gods children ſhall take to ſinne, the more liable are they to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

For if a man

They are the people, by whom his name is called upon, of his houſhold, his ſervants, friends, ſonnes, yea, his beloved ſpouſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not only ſhame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſinning, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

diſhonour God, their Lord, their father. The lewd prankes, which rogues commit in ſtreets, or vagrant perſons by high-way ſides, do not redound to the reproach of the houſholder: but if any of his family, eſpecially ſon, or daughter, do grow out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, hee thinkes his credit is neerly touched and it is a matter which much concerns him to look unto. Even ſo the prophane and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious lives of open and notorious ſinners do not ſo much diſhonor God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many times he lets them have their ſwinge, and take their courſe: but if ſuch as make profeſſion of piety and truth, will be bold with ſinne whereby the mouthes of the wicked are opened, and the name of God blaſphemed,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15301:118"/>
the Lord (if he love ſuch, and purpoſe to ſave them) will not ſuffer them to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For as the Lord is zealous of maintaining his own glory, and will have it known to men and Angels, that he is no patron of ſinne, or ſinners: but will puniſh the wicked, ſinning, be they never ſo great: neither will he give alowance unto ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie in the godly, be they never ſo good: ſo alſo is he tender of the good of his children, and therefore muſt not ſuffer them to go on in ſinne, which they would do, if the Lord ſhould nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them; being ſo ready to caſt themſelves into perils, if they be but a while exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from affliction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſay, I am ſafe, and farre

If thou beeſt bold with ſinne, thou maieſt fall into ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in this life, though thou beeſt in a ſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the life to come.

No doubt, but <hi>Eli</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him of his ſinne, but this might not quit him from temporall judgement. The chaſtiſements of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are (many times) deadly, though the ſinne be remitted,

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:15301:133"/>
us? is there any cauſe of mourning? Vnleſſe it be for our rebellion, and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which puts the Lord as it were out of his courſe, beſides himſelf (if wee may ſo ſay, with reverence to his Majeſtie) <hi>to do his work, his ſtrange work, his act, his ſtrange act, Eſay.</hi> 28.21. Have wee then any cauſe to bee angry: or <hi>do wee well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry?</hi> as the Lord asked <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> 4.9. When as the Lord hath more cauſe to bee angry with us, for putting him to that trouble, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him with out ſinnes.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:15301:134"/>
by the comfort wherewith wee our ſelves are comforted of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. Bee cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full therefore in thine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſay as <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 42.11. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> Think not the worſe, but the better of thy ſelf for the Lords correcting of thee; Thy caſe is no other then the caſe of Gods deare children; yea of Chriſt himſelfe. <hi>There hath no tentation taken hold of thee, but ſuch as appertaineth to man.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>
            <p>Affliction is the beaten path of all the Lords people. Which of the godly, and faithfull before us have not drunk of this cup, and been baptized with this bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme?</p>
            <p>This being a common
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:15301:134"/>
caſe, me thinks it ſhould be a common comfort. Why ſhould any man that loves, or feares God, or is any way deſirous to honor God in that condition the Lord hath ſet him, ſeek, and with a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge above all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God that ever were? yea above Chriſt Jeſus the ſonne of God himſelfe. Is it not a favor, is it not a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, nay, is it not an honor to be uſed and to be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as Chriſt and all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been before us? And ſhould not the conſideration of this comfort us? It may be the Lord hath taken away thy goods, thy plenty from thee, and brought thee to a morſell of bread. It may be he hath taken away thy health, and welfare, and doth afflict thee with deſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:15301:135"/>
and ſores, and aches, ſo as thou haſt no reſt, day nor night. Was not this <hi>Jobs</hi> condition, who loſt more goods and ſubſtance in one day, then thou haſt in all thy life? beſides hee had painfull dayes, and long nights of ſorrow. And art thou better then he was? It may bee, the Lord hath caſt thee into priſon, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee of thy liberty. Was not faithfull <hi>Joſeph,</hi> (unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) kept divers yeares in priſon, where they <hi>held his feet in the ſtocks; and he was laid in Iron, untill his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time came, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Lotd had tried him, Pſalm.</hi> 105.18, 19.</p>
            <p>It may be thou haſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt cauſe of thine,

who doe backbite thee, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee, ſpeake all manner of evill of thee, and with (more then Vatinian) hatred doe perſecute thee.

will he not utterly take away from us, nor ſuffer his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to faile.</hi> Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of charging the Lord with any hardneſſe or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable dealing with us; as if he marred his gold by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it into the fornace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it. But let us rather look into our own hearts, and mourne for our own ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnes and rebellion, which hath moved the Lord thus to ſhackle and hamper us, that he might take down our proud hearts (O proud hearts of ours) ſubdue our ſtubborn and rebellious wils and make us vile and nothing in our own eyes. And be we thankfull unto our good God and loving Father, that he will be at theſe paines to refine and purge us: that ſo he may make choice of us

for his glory before others. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Lord <hi>Eſay</hi> 48.10. <hi>I have fined thee, but not as ſilver; I have choſen thee in the fornace of affliction.</hi> When God doth caſt thee into the fornace to refine thee, take heed thou doſt not ſay or think, I am caſt out of his eyes; the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and forſaken me; for this were to bring an evill report upon the waies of God, and to turn his truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ly. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. <hi>I will cauſe you to paſſe under the rod, and will bring you into the bond of the covenant.</hi> Yet ſuch is the peeviſhneſſe of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſuch is our unbeliefe, that if any extraordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction doth befall us, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be ſuch as tarrieth and ſticks by us, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to mutter and murmur:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:15301:138"/>
yea ready to feare that God hath forſaken us. Whereas we ſhould rather gather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of comfort to our ſelves; that the more he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth us, the better he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us; in that he carrieth ſuch a ſtraite hand and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye over us, that we ſhal no ſooner ſtep aſide, but he will be ready to fetch us in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The Lord might give us over to our own hearts luſt, even unto hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, to a reprobate minde: giving us leave to <hi>eate of the fruit of our own way, and be filled with our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, Pro.</hi> 1.31.

Whereupon one of the antient Fathers prayed
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:15301:139"/>
Lord, ſeare me here, that thou maiſt ſave me hereafter: cut and wound me here, that thou maiſt for ever heale and ſpare me. Conſider what the wiſeman ſaith, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>My ſonne, refuſe not the chaſtening of the Lord; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be grieved with his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; for the Lord cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth him whom he loveth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a father doth the child in whom he delighteth.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will hardly be brought to beleeve thus much: and therefore they are ready to meaſure their parents affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by their correction: and to think there is moſt love, where ther is leaſt correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this is their error, for wiſedome telleth us <hi>Pr.</hi> 13.24. that <hi>Hee which ſpareth the rod, hateth his ſonne, but hee that loveth him, chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:15301:139"/>
him betimes.</hi> Leaſt if he let him alone with out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (as too many fooliſh indulgent parents do) he go to Hell in the end. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt ſmite him with the rod, and ſhalt deliver his ſoul from Hell. Pro.</hi> 23.14.</p>
            <p>So wee are ready to think wee might do well without affliction: but the Lord knowes us better then wee know our ſelves: and hee ſeeth we would to hell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if hee ſhould not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us here. I am ſure it had been wo with ſome of us, if the Lord had not afflicted us. Nay ſome of us can ſay (bleſſed bee God for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercie) that there never did befall us any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which we could have ſpared, either for the nature and kinde, or for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:15301:140"/>
and quantity thereof.</p>
            <p>And may we not all ſay, that, wee are then in the beſt temper, when we are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Even the wicked will be ſomewhat good in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pharaohs</hi> proud heart will ſtoope and yeeld a little: then the <hi>Iſraelites ſhall go and ſacrifice to their God, Exod.</hi> 10.14. But their goodneſſe laſteth no longer then their troubles laſt. When afflictions end, their goodneſſe ends: <hi>And they returne with the dog to their old vomit,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.</p>
            <p>Their hard heart will be a little ſoftned, whiles they are in the fire; as iron bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as the Smith would have it, all the while the fire is in it. But as their affliction abateth, ſo their hardnes and wickedneſſe returneth: as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15301:140"/>
iron growing cold, grows as hard as it was before, nay oft times harder: as water waxeth colder after heating, then it was at firſt.</p>
            <p>Therfore we have more cauſe to be thankfull to God for afflictions, then for meate and drinke; ſeeing the Lord doth us more good by them, then by theſe.</p>
            <p>Which good, though at the firſt thou ſeeſt not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy phyſick is now but in working; yet, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, thou ſhalt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after both ſee it and feele it too. And thou wilt juſtify the goodneſſe of God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular, and ſay, I could not have ſpared any of Gods rods: I would not have been without this or that affliction for all the world: None could have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15301:141"/>
been invented to doe me more good, ſo to hit me in the right veine: I had been undone, I had periſhed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if the Lord had not thus and thus afflicted me. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py art thou who canſt thus ſay. But this is a leſſon which fleſh and blood can hardly be brought to learne, and ſome are more dull then others; that is, more proud, more ſtubborn, more carnall, more earthly minded then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and therfore the Lord keeps thoſe longer in the ſchoole of affliction then thoſe his children that are more tractable and teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But (as I ſaid) it is a hard taske for the beſt; and therfore, if we might be chooſers we would be no ſufferers: if we could ſhift it, wee would not be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:15301:141"/>
How hardly are we brought to beleeve, that the Lord intendeth or will do us good by this evill of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction? What? meate to come out of the eater? ſweet out of the ſowre? this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry riddle unto us. But faith makes it plaine and eaſie to be underſtood: for faith will ſhew us one contrary in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: good in evill: health in ſickneſſe: eaſe in paine: glory in ſhame, and life in death.</p>
            <p>Without this eye of faith, thou canſt not poſſibly ſee the Lords goodnes towards thee in afflicting thee: nor yet reap that good by thine afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">M.

In the meane time, let this which I have ſpoken ſerve to comfort thee in thine afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Howſoever they may be tart and ſharp for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: bitter and grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature: as if the print of every ſtroke did pierce thy fleſh, and fetch blood from thee; yet God is where he was; yet God loves thee as much as ever he did, if not more; and loving thee will lay no more upon thee, <hi>nor ſuffer thee to be tempted above that which thou ſhall be able to beare</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Some the Lord doth chaſtiſe with rods: otherſome he doth whip with ſcorpions (as it were;) laying on greateſt loade, where he hath given greateſt ſtrength to beare: as a father will lay thoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens upon the ſhoulders of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15301:142"/>
his elder, and ſtronger ſons, which will go neere to break the backs of his little ones. Or as a wiſe Phyſitian, who tempereth and preſcribeth Phyſick anſwerable to the conſtitution and ſtrength of his ſick patient. How ſhould this comfort us in our trials: when we know they be no other then our good God will make us able to beare? And not onely ſo, but <hi>he will give iſſue with the tentation,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. We ſay all is well that endeth well: then muſt it needs goe well with the afflicted children of God; becauſe all their trials end in peace and glory. <hi>Marke the upright man, and behold the juſt: for the end of that man is peace, Pſal.</hi> 37.37. And <hi>if wee ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reigne, and be glorified with

Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. By which, and and many moe places it appeares, that, howſoever afflictions bee painefull and grievous to our nature, in the bearing of them, yet the iſſue and end of them, will be the moſt happy and comfortable. The conſideration whereof <hi>hath cauſed ſome to ſuffer with joy the ſpoile of their goods; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in heaven, they have a better, and more induring ſubſtance. Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>This was that which put a ſong of praiſe and thanks giving in the mouthes of the bleſſed Mrrtyrs:</hi> that the Lord would honor them ſo highly as to bring them to ſuffer for him.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15301:143"/>
Heb.</hi> 11.35. Seeing then ſuch a cloud of witneſſes have gone before us, whoſe trials and afflictions have been as ſmart, and tart, as ours can be: let us become <hi>followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes, Heb.</hi> 6.12. be not too much taken up with the ſence and ſmart of thy preſent afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But let thy thoughts be occupied about the good which thereby is like to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue unto thee. And aſſure thy ſelf <hi>that all ſhall worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for thy weale. Rom.</hi> 8.28. Yea that the Lord takes much delight in thee, in that he is ever, and anon pruning of thee.

them: cutting, and pruning all ſuperfluous branches or ſlips. Whereas if it be a place hee takes no content in he careth not what rubbige, or baggage do overgrow it. If the Lord takes delight in thee, there ſhall not a weed ſpring up in thee, but with the pruning knife of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he will cut it off; whereas if he regarded thee not, he would lay the reines upon thy neck, and let thee have thine own ſwinge, to fill up the meaſure of thy ſinne, that ſo in juſtice he may mete un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee a ful cup of his wrath and vengeance.</p>

thou art angry, for we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Yet we are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire death, that we may be rid of ſinne in theſe reſpects, only becauſe it worketh our woe, but rather becauſe God is diſhonored by it: and it is diſpleaſing unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie. For the glory of God ſhould be more deare unto us, then our own lives. Sin is that which clouds the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. And death is that which freeth us from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that we may be freed from the temptations and malice of the Devill. Whiles we abide in the fleſh, he will never leave ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of us unto evill. <hi>He goeth up and down like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devoure</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. And the longer we live, the more
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:15301:146"/>
will his rage and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us increaſe, becauſe of the ſhortneſſe of his and our time. The neerer the childe of God is to heaven, the more Satan and his accurſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments will rage: and the fiercer will their aſſaults be; as it was with the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the neerer the time was, that they ſhould bee delivered out of Aegypt and go to Canaan: the more cruell did their taskmaſters grow, and the heavier bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens were laid upon them.</p>
            <p>And laſt of all, we ſhall by death be freed from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vexations and griefes of mind and ſpirit. So many ſorrows and feares do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe about many of Gods children, that it makes them <hi>weary of their life, at Rebekah ſaid to Iſaac, Geneſ.</hi> 27.46.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:15301:147"/>But our deſire of death muſt not bee ſo much for the avoyding of evill, as for the injoying of good. For there we ſhall have a crown of <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and immortality,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4.</p>
            <p>There we ſhall be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.4. <hi>There we ſhall have joy unſpeakable,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Yea ſuch joy as if we could but conceive the ſweetneſſe, the greatneſſe thereof, we would deſpiſe the joyes and pleaſures of the world, in hope of aſſurance to enjoy them. Yea there we ſhall for ever be with the Lord Chriſt. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>In whoſe preſence is fullneſſe of joy, at whoſe right hand, there are pleaſures for evermore. Pſal.</hi> 16.11.

And ſome things the Lord ſuffers to be done by his permiſſive will, yet ſo as (if hee pleaſed) he could eaſily prevent and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or alter the doing of them; thus the Lord may be ſaid to have a finger in every ſinne, not as it is a breach of his revealed will, but that it may be an occaſion of the manifeſtation of his power, and juſtice in puniſhing and revenging of it. Theſe truths the heathen which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </label> The Lord hath many ends in dealing thus with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

            <p>Many hard and ſtony hearts will not be broken with little and ſhort afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſome kinde of mettles muſt be kept a great while longer in the furnace then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or elſe they will never be diſſolved, even ſo it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with ſome natures; little and ſhort afflictions work not upon them, no whit at all molifie nor ſoften their hard and ſtony hearts; therfore the Lord is forced to keep them down the longer. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, when any trouble befals them, think to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:15301:176"/>
it, or to beare it off by head and ſhoulders, and to make as good a ſhift as they can, never looking up to God whom they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and provoked by their ſinnes: but let theſe know that God will bow them, or elſe he will breake them. The Lord is the Lord of hoſts, he can ſend croſſes thick and three-fold upon us to abate our lofty and proud ſpirits, to break our rocky and ſtony hearts. Gods wrath is anſwerable to his power, as this is infinite, ſo he can make the other inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. Many are ſtiffe and ſtubborn, as the Lord complaines, <hi>They obeyed not, neither inclined their eares, but made their necks ſtiffe, and would not heare, nor receive correction, Ier.</hi> 17.23. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:15301:177"/>
and ſhort afflictions will not ſerve to reclaime ſuch as theſe are; therefore the Lord keeps them longer under his hand.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Lord doth thus deale with many of his children to work their hearts to a greater diſlike of their ſinne as that which hath brought upon them all thoſe troubles which now lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; therfore in the time of our affliction we ſhould fall upon our ſinne, upbraiding it, and charging it with all our croſſes. Ah thou vile and loathſom ſinne, I may thank thee for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for this reproach and ſhame; Ah curſed ſin, how haſt thou heretofore doma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niered over me? Thou haſt hitherto been too ſtrong for me, but God by this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:15301:177"/>
(I trowe) will tame and hamper thee. Is this the fruit I reape by entertaining thee? Oh curſed be the time that ever I knew thee, that ever I was ruled by thee. The more grievous our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is, the greater hatred we ſhould beare our ſinnes, the cauſes of them; and the more fearfull ſhould we be for time to come of medling any more with them. We ſay, The burnt child dreads the fire. <hi>Ephraim</hi> had been a long time polluted with idolatry: The Lord ſtops <hi>her way with thorns, and makes a wall, that ſhe may not finde her pathes, Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. exerciſeth her with long affliction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhee come to ſay, <hi>What have I any more to do with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, Hoſ.</hi> 14.9. If I muſt buy my ſinne at ſo deare a
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:15301:178"/>

            <p>Theirdly, the Lord doth oft-times keepe the rod long upon his children for their greater and deeper humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Great ſinnes, muſt bee greatly repented of. Great tranſgreſſions require great and long humiliation. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> ſinnes of adultry and murder, killing the husband with the ſword, that he might injoy his wife, were great ſinnes, and thoſe which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme: therefore the Lord threatned him with long affliction, <hi>The ſword ſhall never depart from thine houſe.</hi> 2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 12.10. Neither will the Lord give us over, or

            <p>Fourthly, the Lord by continuing his hand of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction long upon his children doth hereby make known the ſtrength of his Grace, which is ſufficient to ſupport his children under long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious

afflictions, A wiſe builder will lay the heavieſt burden upon that peece of timber which is moſt heart, and moſt able to beare it: Greateſt peeces are put to greateſt ſtreſſe, becauſe little peeces would warpe and yeeld, if not break aſunder. Even ſo, where there is moſt ſtrength of Grace, there the Lord oft times laies on the greateſt load of affliction; which, as it makes for the praiſe and glory of his Grace ſo doth it ſerve much for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample unto all that are neer unto them; that they may live by faith, and hope that (if ever they come into the like trial) the Lord, as he is able to ſupport and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them, ſo he will doe it, and graciouſly ſtand by them even in long and ſharpe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

as he hath upheld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the like caſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and laſtly, the Lord doth this, that ſo he may afterward repleniſh the hearts of his children with aboundance of inward and ſpiritual joy. After they have taſted of more gall then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they ſhall eate of more hony then others. Heavines hath ſome long time ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their hearts; but joy and gladneſſe followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to inhabit in them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon mee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi>) <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort all that mourne, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point unto them that mourne in Sion, and to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the garment of gladnes for the ſpirit of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that they may bee called trees of righteouſneſſe, the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Lord; that he might

            <p>The leaſt ſinne wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, makes us liable to the vengeance of eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How grear a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:15301:181"/>
of puniſhment do wee then deſerve, for our many, for our grievous ſinnes? our ſinnes being like unto the ſand by the ſea ſhore which is innumerable. What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our afflictions are, or may be, they come ſhort of our ſinnes; they fall ſhort of that which wee have deſerved: and that which the Lord may juſtly (without any wrong to us) lay upon us. Amongſt many other, one maine cauſe why we are ſo troubled and vexed with affliction is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo little galled with our ſinnes; a true ſenſe of theſe would make our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to be more eaſie, and us leſſe ſenſible of them then many times we are. Do we not ſee it by experience that when the ſtone and the gout, or ſome other bodily
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:15301:181"/>
malady meet together, the paine of the ſtone being the more grievous, alaies, if not takes away, the ſenſe &amp; pain of the gout; even ſo would it be here, when ſinne and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction are both upon us at once, the conſideration of our ſinnes (deſerving farre greater puniſhment then we beare) ſhould ſo grieve us, that the puniſhment it ſelfe ſhould not move us, much leſſe ſtirre us up to impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Is there not then great cauſe that we ſhould willingly and patiently bear Gods chaſtiſements? as the Church reſolved, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I will beare the wrath of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</hi> And confeſſe with the good theef in the Goſpell, <hi>We indeed are juſtly here, for we receive the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:15301:182"/>
of our deeds, Luke</hi> 23.41 And thus did that Emperor <hi>Mauritius,</hi> who beholding his wife and children mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered before his face, cried out. <hi>juſt art thou o Lord, and juſt are thy judgements.</hi> And thus <hi>David</hi> confeſſed, <hi>I know O Lord that thy judgements are right, and that thou haſt afflicted me juſtly, Pſ.</hi> 119.75.</p>
            <p>Secondly, compare thine afflictions with the ſufferings of many of the Lords Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, and thou haſt great cauſe to be patient. Looke but into the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Heb. ver.</hi> 35, 36, 37. and tell mee if thine afflictions be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, or ſutable to their fiery trials. Looke into the ſufferings of Chriſt. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>him, that indured ſuch ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt of ſinners, leſt you ſhould be wearied and faint in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:15301:182"/>
your mindes: ye have not yet reſiſted unto blood, Heb.</hi> 12.3, 4. If the Lord deal ſo ſharply with many of his deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and with thee ſo mildly, ſo gently, wonder at Gods clemency and lenity; lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and bee patient.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider how ſhort thine affliction will bee in compariſon of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torment, the Lord might lay upon thee. <hi>our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are but light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any, as Paul</hi> calls them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. The Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.8. <hi>For a moment, in mine anger, I hid my face from thee for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſeaſon, but with everlaſting love have I had compaſſion on thee.</hi> Who would not bee content with a courſe of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, for a few daies, though
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:15301:183"/>
the phyſick be untoothſome, and very bitter, in hope of health for ever after? What if thou haſt indured months of ſorrow, and painfull nights have beene appointed unto thee? as they were to <hi>Job,</hi> 7.3. What are they in compariſon of thoſe eternall torments the Lord might throw thee into, in which there will be no eaſe, out of which there ſhall be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe?</p>
            <p>A great cauſe of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſtorming at afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is the ignorance of our ſelves, and of the deſert of our ſinnes, which if we knew aright, we would confeſſe with <hi>Ezra,</hi> let our miſeries and troubles be what they will, that the Lord hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us leſſe then our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have deſerved, <hi>Ezra</hi>

After they have endured any great fight in affliction, he doth uſually beſtow ſome ſpeciall favor or other upon them, yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the meaſure of the affliction hath the recompence and the bleſſing been; ſuch as have had the bittereſt croſſes, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſweeteſt comforts, <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and what end the Lord made Jam.</hi> 5.11.

This
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:15301:184"/>
hope of future mercy kept <hi>David</hi> from fainting in his affliction. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.20, 21. <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed we great troubles and adverſities, but thou wilt return and revive me, and wilt come againe and take me from the depth of the earth.

            <p>They are occaſions (as hath been formerly proved) of purging our corruption, and bringing of us neerer God, and into more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with Chriſt: and ſhould not this comfort us?</p>

            <p>There muſt be a time for thee to ſow thy prayers in,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:15301:185"/>
and a time for thee to water them with the teares of true repentance, and then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes the joyfull harveſt, <hi>in due ſeaſon thou ſhalt reape, if thou thou bee patient, if thou faint not, Gal.</hi> 6.10. What made <hi>Steven</hi> in his martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to bee ſo patient and chearefull, but the ſight of Heaven? What was it that carried thoſe bleſſed Martyrs ſo joyfully thorow flames of fire, but hope of glory? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſharp break-faſt, they were aſſured of a ſweet and Royall ſupper.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are but the Lords rods to whip us.</note> wee are to be patient, in reſpect of our enemies, whom the Lord is pleaſed to uſe as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to afflict and ſcourge us. Whoſoever they bee that trouble us, they are but the Lords inſtruments,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:15301:186"/>
whom he ſets on work for the execution of his will and purpoſe. If we conſider <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions, wee ſhal find three Agents in them, <hi>God; Satan,</hi> and the <hi>Sabeans:</hi> and all theſe three had their ſeverall end in afflicting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Job.</hi> The Devill ſtirres up the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and God permits both. The <hi>Sabeans</hi> ſpoile <hi>Job</hi> of his ſubſtance that ſo they might inrich themſelves. The Devill ſets upon <hi>Job</hi> to provoke him to impatience, and to ſtirre him up to blaſpheme the Lord. And God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits all; firſt, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> wronging, and robbing his ſervants; ſecondly, to prove the devill a malicious lier; thirdly, to juſtifie the innocency and patience of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:15301:186"/>
his ſervant <hi>Job;</hi> and laſt of all, to crown his patience, and conſtancy with greater honor and glory, both in this life and in the world to come. But of all theſe three Agents, whoſe hand was <hi>Jobs</hi> eye upon? did he curſe the <hi>Sabeans?</hi> did he raile upon the Devill? no ſuch matter. As the by-word is, he ſet the ſaddle upon the right horſe. Hee lookes up to the hand of God. <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken it: bleſſed by the name of the Lord, Job</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p>So in that moſt bloody and nefarious fact which ever was under the ſunne commited, I meane the murthering of the Lord of life &amp; glory? there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curred, the Jewes malice, <hi>Judas</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:15301:187"/>
his treaſon, and <hi>Pilate</hi> in his injuſtice. And yet all theſe were ordered by a ſuperior power, the Lord uſing theſe as his inſtruments for the execution of his purpoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>To do whatſoever thine hand, &amp; thy counſell had determined before to bee done.</hi> Now then if the Lord inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to afflict thee, who ſhall let him from uſing what inſtruments hee pleaſeth? Looke not then upon ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary cauſes, leſt thou ſwell againſt them, and grow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient. Look up to the hand of God, that thou maiſt be quiet, whatſoever, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the inſtruments be.</p>
            <p>As <hi>David</hi> asked the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Tekoa, Is not the hand of Joab, in all this?</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.19. So bee thou aſſured the hand of the Lord
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:15301:187"/>
is in all thine afflictions. And yet alas, in trouble and affliction, wee can ſee any thing before, and more then the hand of God that ſmiteth us, and our ſinnes which have drawne forth the hand of God againſt us. The want of which ſpirituall eye to behold Gods hand, is the ground of that impatience, which is too often ſeen in our afflictions, and bewrayes it ſelfe in our uncharitable ſpeeches; I may thanke ſuch a villain for this trouble: I am beholden to ſuch a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this croſſe: ſuch a one hath done me thus much wrong, theſe injuries: I will therefore be revenged of him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Many there be which ſet down by that affliction which comes immediately
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:15301:188"/>
from God, but can not be ſo ſtill &amp; quiet in thoſe wrongs and injuries which come from man. They know there is no ſtriving againſt the ſtreame, a vaine thing for man to contend with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and therefore fret not, loſt there impatience ſhould open a new gappe, or make the old breach wider, to let in more, if not, greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. But why they ſhould be thus dealt withall by man, it may be their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, one that they can ſhift withall, one that (it may be) they thinke they can cruſh; to put up ſuch a wrong, this goes againſt the haire, they can not beare it, no wiſe man (they ſay) would put it up at his hands. Theſe words argue too much ſelfe, too much pride, and too
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:15301:188"/>
little grace, too little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It will be our glory to paſſe by offences, from whomſoever they come. The greater the injurie is, or the more able thou art to avenge thy ſelfe of thine enemie, the greater will be thy glory to paſſe it by. No wiſe man will fight againſt an enemie with his own weapon: Chriſtian wiſdome teacheth us, not to render evill for evill, and rebuke for rebuke. If thine enemie provoke thee either by his words, or by his deeds, and thou through impatience be ſtirred up to revenge, what difference is there in both your faults, and folly? Only this: Hee ſinnes firſt, and thou art ſecond in evill. Hee ſinnes by provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thee, and thou by being provoked by him.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:15301:189"/>
Hee ſinnes in offering the wrong, and thou by revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>Are thou angry with thine enemie for troubling thee? He may anſwere thee as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did his brethren, when they were angry with him, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28, 29. <hi>What have I now done? Is there not a cauſe?</hi> What hath thine enemy done unto thee which the Lord did not ſee cauſe to ſet him about? Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that how malicious, and potent ſoever thine enemies are, they can do no more unto thee, or againſt thee, nay they ſhall do no leſſe, then the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to do. There is not ſo much as one poiſoned arrow ſhot at thee, but the hand of the Lord doth nock it: not one bitter, taunting
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:15301:189"/>
or reproachfull word utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt thee, but the Lord wills it: <hi>Suffer him to curſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Shimei</hi>) <hi>for the Lord hath bidden him,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. And yet how ſoon is our blood up? How ready are our hearts to riſe againſt any of the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments? like dogges run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the ſtone, which was caſt at them, never loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the hand that threw it. Common humanity teacheth us, not to flie in the face, or fall about the eares of that mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which doth only bring us a meſſage from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
            <p>The enemies of Gods Church and people, are but the Lords ſervants. The Lord calls <hi>Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babell, his ſervant,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:15301:190"/>
Jere.</hi> 27.6. Our enemies doe but bring us a meſſage from the Lord, as <hi>Ehad</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Eglon, Judg.</hi> 3.20. <hi>I have a meſſage vnto thee from God.</hi> If they doe but their errand, why ſhould wee be offended with them? Were it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not madneſſe, for him that is beatten with a wand, to rent and teare it; The wicked of the World are but Gods wands or rods, to beat and laſh his children withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſhur, the rod of my wrath: and the ſtaffe in their hands, is my indignation, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> 10.5. A rod (you know) can do nothing of it ſelfe, any further then that hand which holdeth it doth put force unto it: it falls heavier, or lighter, according to the ſtrength of the hand that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:15301:190"/>Bee patient then, and fret not, ſwell not againſt thine enemies. It may bee they revile thee, raile upon thee: they backbite and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee; be patient, for the Lord hath bidden them, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. It may bee they hinder thee in thine eſtate, they offer violence to thy perſon: in all theſe, or any other wrong they can do unto thee, they are but the Lords rods to whip thee withall. Seeke not revenge againſt them, but leave them to the Lord, and hee will one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence them for their malice and cruelty againſt thee.</p>
            <p>Implacable is the malice and rage of the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the godly; ſo furious, that if the Lord ſhould not
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:15301:191"/>
curbe and reſtrain them, as <hi>Jezebel</hi> vowed to take away the life of <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.2. So they would not ſuffer a ſoul to breath amongſt them, which feareth God, and walketh not after the courſe of the World. But bleſſed be our good God, that giveth not up his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as a prey into their teeth, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 124.6. but <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth the afflicted, Pſalme</hi> 140.12. And <hi>will recompence the wicked according to their deeds, Pſal.</hi> 28.4.

            <p>Hee did it not in zeal of Gods glory, as he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, but hee did it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance himſelfe, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the crown more ſurely upon the head of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

            <p>Therefore when our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have done their worſt: ſpit out all their malice, and ſpewed out all their venom againſt us; which they can diſgorge, then will the Lord take them to taske, then will hee recompence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for their malice and miſchiefe. <hi>Behold thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> (unto the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi>) <hi>becauſe thou haſt

Nay a father may ſomtime bee tranſported with paſſion, and correct his childe above meaſure, laying on that in his heat, which in his cool blood he doth heartily wiſh were off againe; Whereas our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is ſo wiſe as he puts not in one dramme of any ingredient more then
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:15301:198"/>
ſhall ſerve the turne, and need requireth.</p>
            <p>A third and laſt helpe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to patience, is Heavenly-mindedneſſe, or the ſetting our <hi>affection on things that are above, and not on things which are on the earth, Col.</hi> 3.2. For he that immoderately, and inordinately loves the world and earthly things, will bee impatient at the loſſe of them. How waſpiſh and impatient was <hi>Ionah</hi> for the withering of his Gourd? even ſo much, that hee durſt tell the Lord to his face, <hi>that he did well to be angry unto the death. Ion.</hi> 4.9. Our blinde judgements making a falſe report unto our affections of theſe outward things, wee come to ſet them at too high a rate, and ſo grow impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at the loſſe of them;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:15301:199"/>
Whereas, if wee did eſteem them, as the wiſe man reports them to be, and as they are in truth, that is nothing, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.5. wee would be leſſe moved with the loſſe of them. There is a kind of venom in worldly things, to puffe up, and ſwell the heart of a man. <hi>By thy wiſdome, and by thine occupying haſt thou increaſed thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up becauſe of thy riches. Ezek.</hi> 28.5. Now when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliction comes to encounter with a proud heart, every veine ſwells, and the heart rebells, and breaks out into impatience, and they can not beare it. And the greater their tryalls are, the more do they fret, and fume, as a running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the greater the flood, and ſtream is, the more doth it
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:15301:199"/>
foame and roare, where there be any arches to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
            <p>And now that wee may be willing to take the more paines to be furniſhed with patience; I will lay down a few priviledges which wee ſhall partake of through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; every one of them a ſtrong motive to ſtirre us up to labour for pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt by the helpe of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wee ſhall be the better able to manage thoſe gifts, and graces which God ſhall endow us withall. Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence keeps the mind in ſuch a ſtayed and ſetled temper, that wee ſhall be able to manage and direct our ſelves in all our ſtraights, and adviſe and counſell others in their doubts, and difficulties: <hi>By
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:15301:200"/>
our patience wee poſſeſſe our ſoules. Luk.</hi> 21.19. Wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and command our ſelves; for impatience puts a man out, and makes to be beſide himſelfe. By faith wee poſſeſſe Chriſt, by love wee poſſeſſe our neighbor, yea our enemie, and by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience wee poſſeſſe our ſelves. He hath but a weak hold of Chriſt, or of his neighbor, that hath no hold, or command of himſelfe. An impatient perſon is as one out of the way, or as a bone diſlocated, and out of joynt. What ſtabilitie can be, where Patience ſits not at the ſtern to direct and govern? A ſhip that rides at ſea well ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is ſteddy, and ſo proves comfortable unto the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that bee abord her: whereas an unballanced veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:15301:200"/>
reels (like a drunken man) and tumbles too and fro with every little gale, and blaſt of wind, and ſo make thoſe weary, if not ſick, that be in her.</p>
            <p>How ſick muſt that ſoul needs be, whom troubles, and afflictions (the waves, and billows of this world, a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and tempeſtuous ſea) through the want of patience the ſtearſman, do tumble up and down, and are diſquiet? Where patience is, there is quietneſſe; becauſe patience brings a Chriſtians minde unto his eſtate, when his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and condition cannot ſuite with his minde.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Patience will conforme thee unto Chriſt, and make thee a compleat Chriſtian; <hi>Let patience have her perfect worke, that ye may
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:15301:201"/>
be perfect, and entire, lacking nothing. Jam.</hi> 1.4. That ſoul which wants no patience, wants nothing; for patience is able to ſupply all wants, and make up all defects. A patient, and contented mind is rich; and hee that is rich cannot want, unleſſe he will.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, patience will make thee to be a profitable entertainer of Gods Word, it will make thee fruitfull in Chriſtianitie, <hi>the honeſt and good heart brings forth fruit with patience. Luk.</hi> 8.15.</p>
            <p>So many evills there bee to encounter goodneſſe, ſo many oppoſitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to nip, if not blaſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

wickedneſſe in high places, to ſtop our courſe, and to interrupt us in our holy profeſſion, that without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, little or no fruit will appeare in our lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, patience wil make thy life comfortable, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy afflictions be, Thou art armed with mettall of proof: no dart of Satan, no malice of the world can wound thy ſoul, if patience have got the keeping of it. Outward calamities and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may make a great noiſe about thine eares, as hailſtones falling thick upon the tyles over thy head keep a great ratling, but cannot come neere to hurt thee: So afflictions may rattle about thine eares, but patience ſhelters thee from receiving
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:15301:202"/>
any hurt by them. Let thy afflictions be never ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, and noxious in themſelves, they ſhall not prove ſo to thee, If patience poſſeſſe thy ſoul, ſo many afflictions as befall thee, will fall out to be ſo many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods love, ſo many conſolations unto thee; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be ſuch as wee undergoe for Chriſt. <hi>For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us: ſo our conſolation aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth through Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. Miſery it ſelfe ſhall not be able to make thee miſerable, for patience is a moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne antidote and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative againſt the venom of any affliction which can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide thee.</p>

               <note place="margin">Comfort for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</note> Fourthly, is it ſo, that all our afflictions come from God, then here is a ground
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:15301:202"/>
of comfort, and matter of rejoycing in affliction; not that we have miniſtred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and occaſion unto the Lord to chaſtiſe us, but in that (having ſinned againſt the Lord) hee will take the rod into his hand, and have the ordering of that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which befalls us. For nothing (as hath been ſaid) can bee, in which our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father hath not a chiefe ſtroke, before it can be brought to paſſe. The conſideration whereof, as it ſhould ſettle and quiet us, ſo ſhould it miniſter much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto us, becauſe our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety and ſecurity lieth in it. As God loveth a cheerfull doer, ſo hee loveth a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſufferer. A childe that is willing to kiſſe the rod, wherewith it was beaten,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:15301:203"/>
gives great content unto the parent which corrected it, and makes halfe amends, for the fault it hath committed. Chriſt will have every one of his <hi>to take up his Croſſe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Luk.</hi> 9.23. the taking up of our croſſe implyeth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe, and cheerfulneſſe in the bearing of it. Many a childe of God is content to beare his croſſe when the Lord hath laied it upon his ſhoulders, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeakeath, <hi>Woe is me for my deſtruction, and my grievous plague: But I thought, yet it is my ſorrow, and I will beare it, Jerem.</hi> 10.19. Hee dares not mutter, or repine at the Lords doing: but here was no rejoycing in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Whereas <hi>James</hi> tells us, that wee muſt <hi>count it exceeding joy, when wee fall
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:15301:203"/>
into divers afflictions, Jam.</hi> 1.2. When the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (as it were) in open hoſtilitie againſt us, muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his forces towards us; when one affliction comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of another, when wee fall into divers afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even then we have cauſe of rejoycing. For our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions comming from the hand of our loving Father, cannot be hurtfull, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto us. <hi>Hee chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us for our profit, that wee might he partakers of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Hebr,</hi> 12.10. Indeed if our afflictions brought God out of love with us; or us more in love with ſinne, which God hates, and is hurtfull unto us: if our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were ſent unto us as curſes, wee had cauſe to mourn in them; But when
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:15301:204"/>
the Word of truth ſo often pronounceth us bleſſed in them, as <hi>Pſalme</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whom thou cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeſt, O Lord.</hi> Have wee not then great cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in them? eſpecially ſeeing our Heavenly Father hath the ordering, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all our afflictions, both in reſpect of their kinde, and nature, and alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their meaſure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of quantity or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of their kind.<note place="margin">God doth order our affliction.</note> If you would know why this affliction befalls thee rather then another, it is becauſe the Lord (the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe and ſoveraign Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian) knows how to ſtrike thee in the right veine: hee knowes thy heart, and the nature of thy corruption, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:15301:204"/>
therefore applieth ſuch mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines unto thee, as will bee moſt available for thy cure. Which thing <hi>Job</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Behold, hee will break down, and it cannot be built, he ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a man up, and hee cannot be looſed. Behold hee withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the waters, and they drie up, but when he ſendeth them out, they deſtroy the earth, with him is ſtrength and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Job</hi> 12.14, 15, 16. <hi>Yea hee is mighty in ſtrength and wiſedom, Job</hi> 36.5. Which he could not be ſaid to be, if any other courſe were better for us, then that which he taketh with us. The Lord is perfect wiſedom, and therefore will not, cannot but go the beſt, the ſafeſt and wiſeſt way to worke for the good of his children. Some peradventure may think, that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:15301:205"/>
ſome other kind of affliction might have been better for them, then the preſent; ſome other they thinke, would have done them more good, then this can do. But they ſpeak they know not what. And I may ſay unto them, as Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.55. <hi>Yee know not of what ſpirit yee are.</hi> The chooſing of the rod belongeth unto him, that is to give the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, not to him that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it. Indeed the Lord did once put <hi>David</hi> to his choice, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.12. <hi>I offer unto thee three things, chuſe thee which of them I ſhall do unto thee.</hi> But this was an extraordinary favor, ſhewed unto <hi>David,</hi> firſt to make triall of his Faith, whether he had rather fall into the hand of the Lord, then into
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:15301:205"/>
the hand of man; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to let him know that the Lord would correct him in mercy, in that hee gave him libertie to make choiſe of the puniſhment. The Lord knew that either of thoſe rods would bee ſufficient to ſcourge <hi>David</hi> withall. And none knows ſo well as the Lord, how to meet with our corruptions, or what afflictions are meet for us. If thou canſt not profit by that affliction which the Lord appointeth unto thee, thou wilt profit by none.<note place="margin">Note.</note> To ſay ſome other kind were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee, were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll the judgement of the wiſe God, as if hee knew not better then our ſelves to order and diſpoſe of us. Is it fit the patient ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his Phyſitian, what
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:15301:206"/>
courſe to take with him? wilt thou teach him what he ſhall adminiſter unto thee? this were to diſhonor the Phyſitian: therefore thou ſubmitteſt to his judgement, and takeſt what hee preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth thee, reſting upon his skill: And wilt thou dare ſo highly to diſhonor God, as to queſtion his wiſedome and knowledge: as if ſome other affliction were better for thee then this which hee is pleaſed to adminiſter unto thee? No, no; ſay as <hi>Ely</hi> did, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lord hath the diſpoſing of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for quantitie: for hee doth order all things in their meaſure, number and weight; but eſpecially the afflictions
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:15301:206"/>
of his children, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 30.11. <hi>I will not utterly deſtroy thee, but correct thee in judgement;</hi> or, <hi>in meaſure:</hi> as the new tranſlation hath it. God therefore metes out unto his children, not according to their merit, but in mercy according to their ſtrength, looking more what they are able to undergoe, then what they do deſerve to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>Hee correcteth in judgement,</hi> that is, wiſely proportioning our affliction to our <hi>ſtrength, and not in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leaſt he bring us to nothing, Jere.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Feare not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O Jacob my ſervant, ſaith the Lord, for I am with thee, I will not utterly deſtroy thee, but correct thee by judgement, and not utterly cut thee off, Jerem.</hi> 46.28. Comfort thy ſelfe therefore in this, that <hi>God
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:15301:207"/>
is faithfull, who will not ſuffer thee to be tempted above that thou art able to beare, but will with the tentation make a way to eſcape, that thou maiſt be able to beare it,</hi> as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, the Lord diſpoſeth of all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in reſpect of their time and continuance, which he hath promiſed ſhall be but ſhort? <hi>For the rod of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall not reſt on the lot of the righteous, Pſal.</hi> 105.3. <hi>Hee indureth but a while in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Weeping may abide at the evening, but joy commeth in the morning, Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi>) <hi>that taketh away iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and paſſeth by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the remnant of his heritage. He retaineth not his wrath for ever, becauſe mercy
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:15301:207"/>
pleaſeth him, Mic.</hi> 7.18. Therefore wait patiently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord for iſſue out of thine affliction, which in due time thou ſhalt bee ſure of. For the Lord deals not with his children, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill doth with his ſervants, bringing them into the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, and there leave them to ſcratch and rent, and teare themſelves: but the Lord, as he bringeth afflictions upon us, ſo will hee alſo in due ſeaſon bring us out of them. <hi>Great and many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. Pſalm.</hi> 34.19.</p>

As if any hand could take off that affliction
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:15301:208"/>
which the Lord layeth upon us. Deliverance out of trouble is a prerogative roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and belongs wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord: <hi>For hee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>will take away from thee all infirmities.

Whereupon the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> ſet his eyes towards the Lord, <hi>Thou art my force and ſtrength, O Lord, and my refuge in the day of affliction, Jerem.</hi> 16.19.</p>

abilitie and ſtrength to beare thine afflictions, go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord for it, <hi>Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto God, Pſalm.</hi> 62.11. <hi>The God of Iſrael is hee that giveth ſtrength and power unto his people.

            <p>Hereupon they call one to another. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Come, let us return to the Lord, for he hath ſpoiled us, and hee will heale us: hee hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and hee will bind us up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Lord took his time to bring thee into trouble, ſo hath he his time ſet for thy deliverance. <hi>To all things there is an appointed time, and a time to every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe under heaven, Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1.

            </p>
            <p>This time thou canſt not ſhorten, but lengthen it thou mayſt, through thy impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. As an earthly father correcting his childe for ſome fault, doth reſolve with himſelf to give him but a laſh, or two; to keep him but a while under the rod, if hee take his correction pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; but if he kicke or murmurre, hee reſolves to hold him down the longer, and give him the more ſtripes. Even ſo our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father deales with his children: the more patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee take our affliction, the ſooner wee are like to come

The longer the Lord delaies our deliverance, the ſweeter will it bee when it comes. Wait therefore with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſeeing the Lord by his writing, ſeal, and oath, hath promiſed to deliver us out of all our troubles. And what hee hath promiſed, hee will moſt certainly perform; for though God may bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with us for our ſinnes, yet he cannot be unfaithfull, though he may, like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> conceale his affection for a time, yet impoſſible it is that he ſhould ſhut up his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and renounce the protection of ſuch as depend upon him, or denie delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

Beware of making more haſte then good ſpeed to procure free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of troubles by unlawfull and ſinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Wee rob the Lord of a great deal of honor, and our ſelves of a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which wee ſhould reap by waiting upon the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:15301:214"/>
Lord. Too many are ready to thinke, that if they have ſome little time beſought the Lord, that hee (forſooth) is bound preſently to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them. As thoſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.3. expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter with the Lord ſaying, <hi>Wherefore have wee faſted, and thou ſeeſt it not? wee have puniſhed our ſelves, and thou regardeſt it not.</hi> Some are ready to cry with <hi>David, How long, how long Lord, wilt thou forget me for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? how long wilt thou hide thy face from mee? Pſal.</hi> 13.1. Againe, <hi>Have mercy upon mee O Lord, for I am weake, O Lord heal me, for my bones are vexed. My ſoul is alſo ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but Lord how long wilt thou delay? Pſal.</hi> 6.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Beware of meaſuring the Lord by thine own line and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:15301:215"/>
plummet; let not thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon, or fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeem to direct or limit Gods Providence, thou maieſt not joyn thine own fantaſies to Gods will, but what thou ſeekeſt at his hands, thou muſt commend it to his good pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying to thy ſelfe, Let it be thus, or ſo. God doth many times delay his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not by and by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them that helpe, and comfort which he intendeth them: yea, ſometimes he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to be ready to ſink, before he ſaves them. As he dealt with his Diſciples, who were toſſed up and down of the waves, the ſhip reeling too and fro, and ready to be overwhelmed before hee would awake, and bid the tempeſt be ſtill: yet when he
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:15301:215"/>
ſaw time, hee rebuked the winde, and ſeas, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Diſciples from their danger, and feare: Know and beleeve that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and iſſue of any tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belongeth unto God. Therefore howſoever the caſe ſtandeth with thee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate not with God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain no hard conceits of him. The Lord in wiſdom may delay our deliverance out of affliction, becauſe haply hee ſees that it hath not as yet throughly wrought upon us, nor done us that good he intendeth us. Do Goldſmiths uſe to take their mettall out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace before it be fined from the droſſe? There be ſome kind of plaiſters applied to the bellies of children, which will ſticke faſt ſo long as the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:15301:216"/>
wormes bee alive, but if the bed of them be broken, and they killed, the plaiſter will fall off: and ſo of many ſores. If affliction ſtill cleave unto thee, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſinne is not yet killed in thee. This plaiſter lieth on us no longer then till the ſore be whole, and the diſeaſe be cured in us. It may be the Lord ſees wee are not fit for deliverance, wee would too quickly forget the rod, and return to our own byas, if hee ſhould by and by eaſe us, as ſoon as wee cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. It may be the Lord ſees wee would not be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if it ſhould bee granted upon the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>Things lightly attained unto, are oft times ſlightly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:15301:216"/>
regarded. Whereas thoſe things which we get through the pikes, wee prize at a high rate. Therefore thou forgetteſt thy ſelfe, and the Word of truth, in ſaying, God hath forgotten to be mercifull and gracious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not by and by anſwere thee. Can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forget <hi>her childe, and not have compaſſion on the ſon of her wombe?</hi> Peradventure there may bee ſome ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall monſters, that caſt off all naturall affection, and lay violent hands upon their children; but though they <hi>forget, yet will I not forget thee, ſaith the Lord,</hi> and for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance hereof, <hi>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palmes of my hands, Eſay.</hi> 49.15, 16. When wee are afraid, wee ſhall forget a thing, we tye
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:15301:217"/>
a thred about our finger, for our better remembring thereof; but when wee tie threds upon both hands, wee then make ſure wee will not forget it; thus doth the Lord ſet down his children, in the palmes of both hands, that they may not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Therefore ſtill wait, and deliverance will come, when thou doſt leaſt think of it.</p>

Wherein as wee bewray much weakneſſe, ſo do wee expreſſe great incredulity: for hereby we do manifeſtly ſhew that wee thinke that God in afflicting doth not love us, and that therefore hee cannot or will not helpe us to beare them, that hee cannot or will not bring us fairely off them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not give way to carnall reaſon, nor heare
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:15301:224"/>
what fleſh and blood ſhall ſuggeſt unto us, but what is delivered from the Word of truth, which tels us, that <hi>the Lord correcteth him whom he loveth, even as the father doth the childe in whom hee delighteth, Prov.</hi> 3.12. If wee give eare to carnall wiſdome it will tell us, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if God loved us, he would not thus afflict us. As if our afflictions were a wall of ſeparation twixt Gods love and us. But what ſaies <hi>Paul, Ro.</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> This ſtrong perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:15301:225"/>
of Gods love; carried <hi>Paul</hi> on cheerfully in his troubleſome pilgrimage, and made him joyfull in all his ſorrowes and afflictions. Thus ſtrongly ſhould wee bee perſwaded of Gods love; for hath not the Lord ſaid, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.10. <hi>The mountaines ſhall remove and the hils ſhall fall downe, but my mercy, and love ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the covenant of my peace fall away:</hi> as if hee ſhould have ſaid, though the whole world be turned topſy tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and heaven, and earth do meet together, yet ſtandeth ſtill my love and affection firm to theewards. The change and alteration of our outward eſtate and condition cauſeth no change of Gods love; for hee is ſtill
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:15301:225"/>
the ſame unto us and with us, though the face and faſhion <hi>of the world goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. The things of this life are muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and our condition is ſubject to daily change and alteration. Times have their viciſſitudes, to day it is well with us, to morrow ill; to day at eaſe, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in paine: to day we have ſomething, to morrow leſſe, it may be nothing; to day in honor, to morow in diſgrace, ſeldome continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one ſtay. In which variable condition of ours, and amids all changes and chances of this life, here is comfort to the child of God, that God is the ſame and changeth not, but as he now loveth him ſo hee will for ever continue loving and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:15301:226"/>
gracious to him, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. And hoſoever we cannot tell what ſhall bee to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>James</hi> 4.14. wee know our beginning (as the old ſaying is) but we know not what our end ſhall be; as <hi>Paul went up to Jeruſalem but knew not what things ſhould come unto him there, Acts</hi> 20.22. Yet ſuch is our happineſſe and comfort; that come what will come, no event whatſoever can keepe back, or turne away Gods love from us: and though our ſtate be changed, yet Gods love to us is not changed, but ſtill the ſame, as true, and as intyre as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was. My enemies may take away my liberty, my goods, my good name, my deare friends, and that which of all other things is
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:15301:226"/>
moſt deare unto me, even my life; but I have one Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, all the devils in hell, all the powers of darkenes, all the rage and malice of the world can never ſpoile me of, they cannot rob me of the love of my God. This confidence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Gods love and favor beares up the godly from ſinking under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their affliction, and makes them cheerfull, when as the wicked wanting this aſſurance are either ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, or elſe faithleſſe and impatient under the croſſe. The faithfull making God and his favor their portion and happineſſe, enjoy this priviledge in time of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as well as in the day of proſperity, and therefore their hearts (or their deſire
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:15301:227"/>
is to) bee as joyfull when they are in trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions as if they were moſt free from them: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the wicked placing their whol felicity in theſe earthly things their profits, pleaſures, &amp;c. When their wealth, and worldly things faile, their joy, their hope and comfort ends with them: Theſe have nothing but nature to helpe them beare their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: Whence it commeth to paſſe that infidelity and impatience do make them more grievous and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; whereas the faithfull having the perſwaſion of Gods love, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Spirit to ſupport them, take comfort in their troubles during the time of their tryall, and wait for a ſeaſonable and cumfortable
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:15301:227"/>
iſſue and deliverance out of them. So that it is a truth not to be queſtioned, that the perſwaſion of Gods love in afflicting of us, is a great help to keepe us from ſinking under afflictions, and to enable us with patience, and cheerfullneſſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go them: this perſwaſion will carry us on comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in our pilgrimage, it will make us willing to beare whatſoever the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to lay upon us, and to want that which wee ſee, hee is not willing wee ſhould injoy. <hi>Wee rejoyce in tribulations,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt which is given us, verſe,</hi> 5.</p>

            <p>What greater indignity can bee offered to an honeſt and godly man, then to

Howſoever croſſes and afflictions do oft times preſent themſelves to the apprehenſion of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men with much terorr, &amp; horror, yet even in the very bitterneſſe, and extremity of them, thou (by the helpe of faith) maiſt draw a great deal of joy and comfort from them; if thou wouldſt fix thy minde upon ſuch places, and promiſes as theſe are <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. and 63.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6.

Let thine eye bee upon that love which will one day change thy eſtate, and give thee a plentifull croppe of good, out of this ſorrowfull ſeed time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

            <p>Somtimes the Lord is pleaſed to withdraw the ſweet comforts of his ſpirit, from the hearts of his deare children, and to ſtrike them with inward terrors, and feares of his wrath, and vengeance; which condition of theirs, although it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable for the preſent, yet it proves profitable in the

Of all afflictions inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the ſoul of man, there is none ſo grievous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, as a wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; this tranſcends all other malladies, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries whatſoever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> asketh, <hi>Who can be are it?

            <p>No favor of man, no love of friends, no preferment of the world, no outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, nor abundance of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

will be able to quench the fire, or alay the heat of a tormented conſcience. As may apeare by that memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtory of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who being upon the rack of a guilty and accuſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, oft wiſhed himſelfe (as is reported) in <hi>Cains</hi> caſe, and in <hi>Judas</hi> his place, and that his ſoul might exchange with theirs; wiſhing, and deſiring rather to be in hell torments, then to be racked and rent with ſuch helliſh horrors, and raging feares, as did continually affright his poore ſoul.

What warrant have any (as ſome have done) to judge him to bee a deſperate caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? They will ſay, that God might condemne him out of his own mouth.

and tyed up his tongue from prayer.

our unworthineſſe; the Lord (at length) ſhewes us his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving countenance, tells us by his Spirit, that he is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto us, and that through Chriſt wee are freed from the guilt, and ſo from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our ſinnes. For though wee have been pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſtained with all manner of iniquitie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, even from top to toe; though our ſinnes have been of a crimſon and skarlet hue, as great and grievous as may be, ſo as peradventure, in our conceit there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity of being cleanſed from them, yet God is able to <hi>make them as white as ſnow, and wool.

For you muſt know, that where ſinne is pardoned, it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. If thou canſt truely mourne for thy ſinne, thou art forthwith disburdened of the guilt, and freed from the eternal puniſhment of all thy former wickedneſſe.

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:15301:270"/>
juſtifying his former ſinne; which in effect, and before God, was all one to have committed the ſame ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? yet the Lord forgave theſe, and received them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to mercie.

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:15301:270"/>
will receive hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinners, as often as they returne unto him.</p>
            <p>There is no ſinne, but blaſphemie againſt the holy Ghoſt, which upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall not be pardoned. If reſidnation, and relapſing into the ſame ſinne may bee repented of, queſtionleſſe it may, it ſhall be pardoned at Gods hand. And whereas ſome may think that true grace will preſerve any from falling into the ſame ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whereof hee hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly repented, it is a fond error: for if the Lord leave any unto themſelves, they will be as ready, nay more ready, to fall into the old ſin, then into a new; the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and naturall temper being more inclinable to that evill then any other; and
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:15301:271"/>
Satan knowing which way the poore ſinner hath been moſt foiled, will that way moſt ſtrongly againe aſſault him. It is therefore a bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords hands, a confining, and limiting of his boundleſſe mercie, and compaſſion, yea, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valewing of the all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of Chriſt, his merit and paſſion, to ſay that relapſing into former ſinnes is a thing unpardonable; or that a perſon ſo offending was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the ſtate of grace, or can be a true member of the Lord Chriſt. The covenant of grace excludes none, but impenitent and unbeleeving perſons. Truth it is, that the burnt child dreads the fire; and it is not an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for the childe of God, in the ſtate of grace, to
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:15301:271"/>
fall back againe to his old byas; but that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him (it God leave him) ſo to fall, or that true grace will not admit of any ſuch falls, is more then can be warranted, or proved by the Word of God. I ſpeak not this (God knowes) to countenance, or bolſter any in their ſinne; but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to magnifie the boundleſſe and unlimited patience, and mercy of our good God, and partly to underlay and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that poore afflicted ſoul, &amp; wounded conſcience, who through his owne pride, ſelfe confidence, or ſecuritie, and Satans pollicie, hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine intangled in that ſnare, out of which, by former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hee hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.

Impudent, and impenitent ſinners can claim no intereſt in this comfort: it is baulme to heale onely wounded conſciences; whom I would not have to be ſo ſtrongly deluded by ſatan, as to be beat off from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the throne of grace, or to think that they never had any true grace, or that their former repentance was ever ſound, becauſe old ſores are againe broke out in them, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed into old ſinnes. The worke of grace doth not wholly take away all ſinne, nor free us from it, but only weakens it, and workes the heart to a hatred and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.

Yet even then <hi>Job</hi> wondred at the goodneſſe and favor of God that he would think him worthy the melting and trying. <hi>What is man that thou doſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, and that thou ſetteſt thine heart upon him? And doſt viſit him every morning, and trieſt him every moment. Job</hi> 7.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Being then undoubtedly perſwaded, that when God comes neer thee with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he is neer thee in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that when he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects thee, he loves thee, for until the heart of man be thorowly perſwaded hereof, hee ſhall never take comfort in, nor pick any good out of his affliction. Imagine with me a man who hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day his full feed of the beſt and what outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:15301:277"/>
he will call for; what true content can hee take in theſe things when hee knows that hee is under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of his Prince, and ſo in danger every day of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt into priſon? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if (through the rage and malice of ſome of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) hee were caſt into priſon, if he were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Kings love, hee would reſt contented, knowing and beleeving that the King will honor him for his reproach, and ere it be long ſet him free againe. Even ſo it is with every one that is perſwaded of Gods love in his affliction.</p>
            <p>Therefore as at all times, ſo eſpecially in the time of affliction, Gods children ſhould live by faith. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is like to do us

little good, if it be not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with faith.

Faith ſtilleth the heart even in our ſoreſt, and greateſt afflictions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us of Gods love in correcting us, and that the Lord intendeth our great good by this affliction which lyeth upon us, the love and care which parents have of their childrens good and wellfare, doth not wholy conſiſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of meat, drink and apparel for them, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in correcting of them for their good, and partly in

providing of phyſick for them when they are any way diſtempered. Even ſo almighty God our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and loving father, doth no leſſe love us when he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects &amp; afflicts us, which (as you have heard) is the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicking of our ſoules then when he provideth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward neceſſaries for us; and this faith doth perſwade the heart of. For faith judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of things by ſenſe or outward appearance, but as the truth is in Jeſus Chriſt, juſtifying the Lord in all his waies, alway magnify<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the wiſe and holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of our good God, as the only beſt, and moſt profitable for us. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the apprehenſion of ſome loſſe, the feare of ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or the ſenſe of Gods
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:15301:279"/>
wrath, and diſpleaſure in our affliction, which makes the heart ſo ſad, and the ſpirits ſo lumpiſh in the time of affliction: then ſet thy faith on work, and it will blow over all theſe clouds, it will anſwer all carnall doubts and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſo ſettle the heart in a conſtant perſwaſion of Gods love, that we ſhall rejoyce, and be thankfull for our afflictions, becauſe we know and beleeve that God in afflicting of us, loves us. And to put the matter out of all doubting, I will lay down a few (but ſure and certain) evidences of Gods love in correcting of us</p>
            <p>Doſt thou deſire to know whether God in afflicting of thee loveth thee?<note place="margin">Tokens of Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of us in love.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:15301:280"/>
his ſtripes bee the blowes of an enemy, or the chaſtiſement of a loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? thou mayeſt know it by theſe tokens.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when God gives thee a heart to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and a minde to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beare whatſoever he ſhall lay upon thee, and to want whatſoever thou ſeeſt the Lord is not willing thou ſhouldſt injoy. Hee that doth not reſt content with the love and favor of God in the want of outward, yea the beſt of outward things, doth not rightly prize the love of God; in that the want of other things doth more affect him and take up his minde, then the conſideration of Gods love, and he more diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in the miſſing of the
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:15301:280"/>
one, then contented with the poſſeſſion of the other. He that cannot be content to part with any earthly benefit when God ſhall call for it, it is to be feared, that man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt the ſweetnes of Gods love in the aſſurance of the pardon and forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that ever a man hath will he give for his life, Job.</hi> 2.4. Then much more will hee part with all that hee hath, ſo be it he may have his part in Gods love, <hi>for thy loving kindneſſe is better then life, Pſal.</hi> 63.3. for what is life but death, if it be not upheld by the love of God? Art thou then heartily content with the Lords handling of thee? Doſt thou with all cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe take up thy croſſe and beare thine affliction?
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:15301:281"/>
Canſt thou truely ſay, <hi>Behold here am I, let him do to mee, as ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. I dare be bold to ſay, thou art an happy man, God in afflicting thee, loveth thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if God loves thee, hee will fetch thee neerer unto him by thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. See what the Church profeſſed, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 26.8, 9. <hi>Alſo wee, O Lord, have waited for thee in the way of thy judgements, the deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, and with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee in the morning.</hi> By which words it appeares that Gods people, thoſe that are belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him, are ſo farre from being driven from God by
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:15301:281"/>
affliction, that they are brought thereby neerer unto him. Afflictions are ſo farre from extinguiſhing grace in Gods people, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it rather; as water caſt upon the ſmiths fire doth not put it out, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the flame thereof. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions drive us unto the Lord in prayer, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 26.16. <hi>In trouble have they viſited thee, they powred out a prayer when thy chaſtning was upon them.</hi> Affliction will ſend us to the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and make us more diligent in hearing the Word, more conſcionable in the practiſe of good dueties. So that as judgements lighting upon the wicked do come from Gods avenging wrath and juſtice, and ſo are as pikes and clubs, to beat them
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:15301:282"/>
further off from God, even ſo thoſe afflictions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall his people, proceeding from his love, are as cords to draw them neerer unto him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou mayeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy ſelfe of Gods love in afflicting of thee, if thine afflictions do raiſe up godly ſorrow in thy heart, cauſing thee to grieve, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted that thou ſhouldeſt by thy wickedneſſe thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord, and put him as it were out of his courſe, forcing him to do that which he goeth unwillingly about, for <hi>Hee doth not puniſh wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, nor afflict the children of men, Lam.</hi> 3.33. This was that which did break the heart of <hi>David,</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how hee had offended the Lord, who had been ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:15301:282"/>
and bountifull unto him. <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee only have I ſinned, and done evill in thy ſight, that thou mayeſt be juſt when thou ſpeakeſt, and pure when thou judgeſt, Pſalme,</hi> 51.4.</p>
            <p>A good heart grieves more that by his ſinnes hee hath grieved God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then that God hath grieved him by ſome affliction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had rather the Lord would take away his ſinne then his affliction. And therefore when the Lord had ſo ſeverely threatned <hi>David,</hi> by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Nathan, David</hi> cries not out through feare of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) as ſome would have done upon ſo hard tydings, Alas, I am undone, how ſhall I ever be able to hold up
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:15301:283"/>
my head, if Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come ſo thick upon mee, &amp;c. No, no, the ſword which pierced <hi>Davids</hi> heart, was his ſinne againſt God, and therefore hee praies, <hi>Waſh mee throughly from mine iniquitie, and cleanſe me from my ſinne, Pſal.</hi> 51.2. Hee that in the time of affliction can find his ſinne the greateſt cauſe of his humiliation, may aſſure himſelfe of a ſanctified uſe of his affliction, and of Gods love in ſo dealing with him. Wee ſhall find little fruit, and leſſe comfort to grow out of our griefe, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and humiliation, if it be for outward things, and not for ſinne. Grieve wee never ſo much, never ſo long for our outward afflictions and croſſes, our griefes can neither abate them, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:15301:283"/>
them: whereas godly ſorrow, ſorrow for ſinne, if it doth not batter our croſſe, it weakens it, and in the meane time, procureth much eaſe to the minde, and peace to the conſcience.</p>
            <p>Aſſure thy ſelfe, that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is no where ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, as upon ſinne: God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow is the ſalve appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to heale, and cure ſinne; now to apply this ſalve to a wrong ſore (to affliction) is loſt labor. Learn therefore to turn thy ſorrow againſt thy ſinne, and then thou wilt ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.75. <hi>I know O Lord, that thy judgements are right, and that thou haſt afflicted me juſtly,</hi> as the old tranſlation hath it. And ſo ſaying, thou mayſt boldly proceed with <hi>David,</hi> and pray, <hi>Let thy mercy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:15301:284"/>
mee according to thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto thy ſervant, Let thy tender mercies come unto me that I may live,</hi> verſ. 76.77. Therefore whenſoever the Lord entereth into judgment with thee, fall thou to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy ſelfe. Accuſe thy ſelfe, that God may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And let thine own heart ſpeak unto thee in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelfe, becauſe thou haſt forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Lord thy God? Jere.</hi> 2.17. This is a good ſigne that God will do thee good by thine affliction, which hee would not, if hee did not love thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, thou maieſt bee aſſured that God afflicteth thee in love, if hee gives thee a heart to be thankfull to him for thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:15301:284"/>
Canſt thou bleſſe God, taking from thee as well as giving unto thee? I dare then confidently avouch that thine afflictions are ſanctified unto thee, and that in love he hath afflicted thee. Thus did <hi>Job, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken it, bleſſed be the name of the Lord. Job</hi> 1.21. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, and good things many wicked men will (in their manner) be thankfull to God; but for adverſitie, and ſuch things as are in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance evill, to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, this is the property onely of good men. Wee can eaſily bee brought to praiſe the Lord when hee pleaſeth us, but when hee croſſeth us, when he cuts us ſhort, and keeps us to hard meat, then to bleſſe and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:15301:285"/>
praiſe his name, this is clean againſt our nature; it is onely the worke of grace in us, for grace will make thoſe things eaſie which are very hard and difficult un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature. And therefore there cannot be a better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a gracious and ſanctified heart, then to praiſe and glorifie God for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. For in ſo doing, a man doth juſtifie the Lord in his dealing; yea by our thankfulneſſe for afflictions, we magnifie the glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his juſtice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75. <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy judgements are right, and that thou haſt afflicted me juſtly.</hi> Wee acknowledge his truth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19.9. <hi>The judgements of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.</hi>
               <pb n="505" facs="tcp:15301:285"/>
Wee acknowledge his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 25.10. <hi>All the pathes of the Lord, are mercy and truth.</hi> Therefore moſt true it is, that whoſoever in affliction, <hi>offereth praiſe, doth glorifie God, Pſalm.</hi> 5.23. Men may be thankfull for peace, plenty, ſeaſonable times, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, and the like, in ſelfe-love: but for troubles, and afflictions, croſſes, and loſſes to bee thankfull, this manifeſteth our love to God, which none can ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee bee beloved of God.</p>
            <p>Thankfulneſſe in affliction is a notable ſoule of faith, for faith will tell as, that nothing can befall us, which ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſen Gods love, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our hurt; yea faith perſwades us that God in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of us, loveth us,

            <p>Now lay all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Art thou willing to kiſſe that rod wherewith thou art beaten?

Is thy heart diſſolved into teares of contrition for thy ſinnes and tranſgreſſions?</p>
            <p>Doſt thou cordially, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly bleſſe God that ever hee took thee to do, that ever he laid his hand upon thee? then is it as evident as the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:15301:287"/>
Sun at noon day, that God in afflicting of thee, loves thee; becauſe hee hath taught thee to make ſo good and holy uſe of thy affliction. For afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of themſelves, and in their own nature, are fruits of the curſe, and ſuch as (being unſanctified) will make us ſtorm and rage, and beat us further off from God; but when wee feel, and find them to worke contrary to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their nature altered, and changed, this is a moſt evident and infallible ſigne of Gods love and mercie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Treacle out of this ranck poiſon, and good out of this evill.

               <hi>The chiefe, and ſpeciall end of Gods afflicting us, is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and amending of us.</hi> The Lord knows that grace is beter for us then great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and a healthfull ſoul is more to be deſired then a

them more fruitfull? So deals the Lord with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, hee breaks, and cuts off many ſuperfluous evils with the pruning knife of Affliction, that ſo they may grow more fruitfull in well doing. The end of Gods correcting of us, is not (as ſome may think) to avenge himſelfe upon us, for thoſe evils which wee have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him; nor yet to pleaſe himſelfe in our ſmart, as if hee took delight in our punniſhment and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but it is for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that the Lord was their guid in the great and terrible wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, <hi>to humble them, and to prove them, that he might do them good at their latter end. Deut.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Hee chaſteneth us
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:15301:291"/>
for our profit, that wee might be partakers of his holineſſe. Heb.</hi> 12.10. Hee woundeth us, that hee may heale us. A legge that is crooked, and groweth awrye, muſt bee broken before it can be made right and ſtreight. If the Lord ſhould not break thoſe crooked and perverſe wills of ours, they would never be rectified. The Lord uſeth to beat out one evill with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the evill of ſinne, with the evill of puniſhment. There is a great deal of folly in the hearts of his wiſeſt children; they are ſlow of heart to beleeve, and practiſe that which will make for their good; this folly, the Lord (in wiſdom) drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them by the rod of correction. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquitie of Jacob be purged,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:15301:292"/>
and this is all the fruit, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of his ſinne. Eſa.</hi> 27.9.</p>
            <p>Naturally wee ſport with ſinne, and make it a paſtime to do evill. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Many drink iniquitie like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Job,</hi> 15.16. Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſweet in our mouths, and wee are loth to part with it untill the Lord (in love) doth adminiſter unto us ſome affliction or other, which (like unto Stibium) ſhall make us to vomit up theſe ſweet morſells, and make us out of love with our former evill wayes and courſes, as things, not only unpleaſing, and diſtaſtfull unto the Lord, but ſuch as are noxious, and hurtfull unto us.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that evill which ſinne may bring upon us, and for
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:15301:292"/>
the beſtowing upon us that good which the love and practiſe of ſinne would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us of, the Lord doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and chaſtiſe us. How did his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> go a whoring from him? they were ſet upon gadding, yea madding after ſinne; and therefore the Lord was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to fetch them back againe by his judgements. Wee are as ready to wander out of the way, as ſheep go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtray, ſo that the Lord muſt ſend ſome affliction or other after us to call us back again, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray.</hi> The prodigall in the Goſpel turnes his back upon his father, and takes his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into a farre countrey, where he conſumed and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his goods with riotous

The like may be ſaid of many moe, who (for ought wee know to the contrary) had periſhed if they had not been afflicted.

It is that which will make ſinne as heinous, and odious in our own view, as it is in its own nature. Did not the God of this world caſt a miſt before our eyes, or elſe ſhew us our ſinnes in falſe glaſſes, wee would be ſo farre from pleaſing our ſelves with any ſinne, that upon the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, wee would cry out with the leper in the law, <hi>I am unclean, I am unclean.

cleere, and cauſe us more heedfully to follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Word. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction makes us to heed that which before wee regarded not. As our eares are opened by correction, which were formerly ſealed, <hi>Job</hi> 33.16. ſo alſo our eyes are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which were formerly darkned.

If the Lord ſhould alwayes ſit ſtill, and never come forth to judge us for our ſinnes, many

Pſal.</hi> 50.21. Impunity, and proſperity makes many think, that ſinne is not ſo dangerous a thing, nor ſo foul an evill, as many Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers would beare them in hand it is, whereupon they take heart, and are embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the committing of ſin, and continuing in it, as the Preacher ſaith, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

worke is not executed ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully ſet in them to do evill.</hi> Whereupon to beat us out of theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conceits, the Lord ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſome affliction or other home unto us, to be an eye-ſalve to anoint our eyes, that wee may ſee both the nature, and the danger of our ſinnes, how odious and hateful they are unto the Lord: How noxious and hurtfull they will one day prove unto us, if by ſpeedy repentance we do not turn away from them, eſpecially from thoſe ſinnes for which chiefly the Lord doth afflict us.</p>
            <p>Naturally wee are all children of darkneſſe, ſo blind and blockiſh, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny know not (like blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded people) who ſmote

               </label> Firſt of all, look upon thine affliction, and weigh well with thy ſelfe the nature, and quality of the ſame; for oft times the Lord meets with us in our own kind, and paies us home with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſutable unto our ſins. <hi>Adonibezek</hi> had cut of the thumbs of the hands, and feet of divers Kings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God rewarded him as hee had done to others.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> with the ſword, <hi>the ſword ſhall never depart from his houſe.</hi> 1. <hi>Samu.</hi> 12.9, 10. Thus wee ſee how the Lord oft times meets with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the ſame kind where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have ſinned: what (may wee ſay) is the cauſe of this ſore and baiting famine,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:15301:298"/>
which thus rageth amongſt us? Surely our great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe, and our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible abuſe of Gods good creatures. Doth the Lord puniſh thee with loſſes, or with povertie? Conſider whether theſe outward things did not make thee proud, or elſe were occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of imboldening thee to the committing of ſome ſin or other. Are thy children ſtubborne, and diſobedient? Twenty to one, but it is to puniſh thy diſobedient, and undutifull carriage (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) towards thy parents. Thus might I inſtance in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particulars, by which it is evident, that the Lord doth oft times proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate puniſhments to our ſins; ſo as by our affliction, wee may eaſily gueſſe at what ſin
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:15301:299"/>
the Lord aimeth, and of which hee would have us moſt heartily repent us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, look into the book of God, whither thou canſt there find any that have formerly drunk of thy cup, have been exerciſed, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed with the ſame rod that thou art: if thou doſt not find any ſuch example there, aske and enquire of thy friends whether they have knowne any to be puniſhed as thou art; now if thou find any upon record in Gods booke, or by report from others canſt heare of any that have been in thy condition, then ſeek and enquire what their ſinnes have been, what manner of perſons they have been, and think with thy ſelfe thus; ſurely I am ſick of their diſeaſe, in that my Phyſitian
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:15301:299"/>
takes the ſame courſe with me, which he did with them; I have committed their ſins, in that I partake of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if thou wouldeſt faine find out that ſinne for which eſpecially thou art afflicted, conſider (when thou art under the rod) what ſinne lieth heavieſt upon thy conſcience; very probable it is, that, that ſinne which now cries loudeſt in thine eares from the voice of thy conſcience, cried loudeſt in the eares of God for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Too many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſinne with delight, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they ſhall never heare more, or worſe of it. But when affliction commeth, the conſciencc begins to tell tales, and lay open things done in ſecret. Doſt thou
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:15301:300"/>
not remember how at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place thou didſt commit ſuch a villany? Doſt thou not know how once in ſuch a kind thou didſt highly diſhonor God? Haſt thou forgot how thou didſt once wrong thy neighbor in ſuch a thing? Thus (in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) the conſcience many times brings to mind that ſinne of ours which wee had buried in forgetfulneſſe (as appeares by <hi>Joſeph</hi> his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) and ſo ſhould never have repented of it, if the Lord (by affliction) had not made our conſcience to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it unto us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if the Lord doth not meet with thy ſinne in its kind, or if thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, do not reveal unto thee all thy wickedneſſe, or that ſinne for which thou
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:15301:300"/>
art puniſhed; then bee earneſt with the Lord in prayer, that hee would bee pleaſed to inlighten thine underſtanding, and helpe thee to make a narrow ſearch, and tryall of thy wayes, or elſe that hee would diſcover unto thee that or thoſe ſins for which his hand doth now lye ſo heavily upon thee.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Job, I will ſay unto God condemne mee not; ſhew me wherefore thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt with mee. Iob</hi> 10.2. Before <hi>Ezekiel</hi> could behold the wicked abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord taught him to digge in the wall. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.8, 9.

untill affliction enlightned them, and then they could ſay, <hi>Wee have verily ſinned againſt our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul when he beſought us and we would not heare him, Gen.</hi> 41, 21. Now if once we come to ſee ſinne in its proper colours, and to be perſwaded of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and danger of it, then we are in the broad way to repentance: and this will worke our hearts not only to a loathing, but to the leaving, and forſaking of our former evils.

He that wilfully &amp; wittingly lives in ſinne, doth a great deale more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the ſafety and good of his ſoul, then any man by the Plague or any other meanes doth the welfare of his body. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en mine eyes</hi> (ſaith <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 13.3.) <hi>that I ſleep not in death.</hi> Proſperity thickens theſe eyes of ours or elſe doth caſt ſuch a miſt before them, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee ſinne in its coulours: yea the worſe and more wicked any man is, the leſſe doth he ſee his evill, the leſſe is hee perſwaded of the danger of ſinne. <hi>All the wayes of a man are clean
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:15301:304"/>
in his own eyes, Prov.</hi> 16.2. Through Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and mans infidelity, it comes to paſſe that thoſe which commit the groſſeſt ſinnes, and greateſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, imagine that their faults bee the ſmalleſt: and thoſe that are plunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deepeſt dangers do dreame of greateſt ſafety and ſecurity: as many who have their hands dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt in the troubles and perſecutions, yea in the blood of Gods ſervants, <hi>will thinke that they do God beſt ſervice, Ioh.</hi> 16.2.

If then affliction is the means of working this feare in us, it muſt needs be, that God in-intendeth our great good, by afflicting of us, for <hi>no good thing ſhall be wanting to thoſe that feare him, Pſal.</hi> 34.9.
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:15301:309"/>
The feare of God may bee compared unto the needle, which makes way for the thred, and drawes it after it; even ſo the feare of the Lord makes way for much good, and as it were draws it along withall.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The feare of Gods is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</note>Firſt, it is a means of our humiliation, it will take downe our high thoughts, and abate, and abaſe our lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirits. <hi>Jacobs</hi> feare of <hi>Eſau,</hi> made him to bow ſeven times unto his brother <hi>Eſau.</hi> High-mindedneſſe and feare are oppoſite one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hence <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Be not high-minded, but feare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the feare of God is, as a bridle unto our unruly wills, and as a curbe unto our diſordered affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to repreſſe ſinne. This
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:15301:309"/>

This kept <hi>Joſeph</hi> from yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the luſt of his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Miſtris, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt God? Geneſ.</hi> 39.9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the feare of the Lord will make us couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Gods cauſe; ſo as wee ſhall not feare the face of man. <hi>Say not a confederacy, neither feare you their feare, nor be afraid of them, ſanctifie the Lord of hoſts, and let him be your feare, and your dread, Eſa.</hi> 8.12, 13. There be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us too many face-fearers, who had rather ſinne againſt the Lord, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe ſinfull men; theſe I may compare unto little children, which are afraid

Therefore let us feare the Lord, and this will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all needleſſe feare of men, as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the rod of the inchanters; for the feare of the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth a good conſcience, and where a good conſcience is, there is holy courage and boldneſſe, <hi>the righteous are bold as a Lyon. Prov.</hi> 28.1.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the feare of God, keeps the heart and conſcience waking and watchfull; it leaves no place for ſecurity. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exhorts the <hi>Philipians,</hi>

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:15301:311"/>
for wonderfull are the benefits, both temporall and ſpirituall, which the feare of God procureth to us and ours. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be bleſſed, riches and treaſure ſhall be in his houſe, Pſalm.</hi> 112.1, 2, 3.

and mercies of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, are ſo great, as wee are no way able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them.

Not that afflictions of themſelves do work this good in any, for they only make the wound, they do not heal: they only caſt us down, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not raiſe us up againe: they are as a Schoolmaſter, to bring us unto Chriſt, they bring not Chriſt into the

heart within them was as heavie as lead, yea even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to break with ſighs, and ſobs, was a thing unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, even adding of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to their miſery. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſaith the Lord unto thoſe <hi>Babylonians, Eſay</hi> 47.9. <hi>I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand, thou didſt ſhew them no mercy, but thou didſt lay thy very heavie yoke upon the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, therefore now ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction come upon thee.</hi> Though God doth afflict his children for their good, yet hee will not give their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies leave to trample them underneath their feet, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully to triumph, and inſult over them, becauſe he hath brought them under. When <hi>Jobs</hi> miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:15301:322"/>
began to crow over him, and to cenſure him for his great afflictions, <hi>Job</hi> tells them, that hee <hi>that is in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ought to be comforted of his neighbour, but men have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the feare of God, Job.</hi> 9.14. What doſt thou know to the contrary, but that the Lord hath brought thy neighbor into miſery, to be the object of thy mercie? that thou ſhouldeſt exerciſe thy chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie upon him, releeve and comfort him; which if thou doſt not, it is an argument that thou wanteſt the true feare of the Lord, for the Lord hath commanded us to relieve the oppreſſed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.17. It is a ſervice moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and refreſh our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren when they are in any trouble, or diſtreſſe, and ſuch
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:15301:323"/>
a ſervice as ſeldome or never goes without a bleſſing. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is hee that conſidereth the poore, the Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble. Pſalm.</hi> 41.1.</p>
            <p>Therefore as thou deſireſt that God ſhould bleſſe thee, be thou as willing, as thou art able to ſuccor and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe that are in adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If thou wanteſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of helping and relieving of them, let them have a word of comfort from thee to ſupport them; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, counſell and direct them as thou art able: if not, yet pittie them, pray for them, that God would ſanctifie their croſſes, give them faith and patience to beare their croſſes, and to give them (in good time) a good iſſue out of them: and in the
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:15301:323"/>
mean time, do thou enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a charitable opinion of them, do not ſay, or think that they are greater ſinners then others, becauſe (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture) their afflictions and croſſes are greater, but that the Lord is pleaſed to prove them more then others, for their greater good. This wiſe judging, and mercifull conſidering of the poore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, even when ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie and ſtrange calamities do befall them, is a thing which God much reſpecteth, yea, and will certainly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with ſome bleſſing or other. But if thou beeſt cenſorious, or regardleſſe of others woe, and miserie, it is a ſigne that thou wanteſt bowells of pitty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, thou wanteſt true charity; for this would
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:15301:324"/>
teach thee to remember them that are in affliction, <hi>as if yee were alſo affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the body. Hebr.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with Chriſt the head of the body, hee is touched and affected with all their afflictions, hee hath a feeling of every evill that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them, as if it did befall himſelfe. They may be brought unto a low ebbe, and pittifull plight by reaſon of afflictions, yet doth not Chriſt eſteem them the worſe, neither is he then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to call them, and take them for his brethren; yea hee eſteems of poore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Chriſtians, as a part of himſelfe; though they be vile and contemptible in the e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of the world, yet are they honorable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:15301:324"/>
in his ſight; though they be hated of the world, yet are they beloved of him. Thus ſhould it bee with all true and ſound members of the body of Chriſt: we muſt have a fellow-feeling of the afflictions of our brethren: <hi>to weep with them that weep, and to be of like affection one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, Rom.</hi> 12.15, 16. So full of pitty and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was <hi>Paul,</hi> that hee was touched with the miſery of all his brethren. <hi>Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was a man in favor, and credit with King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> hee enjoyed the pleaſures of the Court, and felt no want, yet when he underſtood of the affliction of his brethren, and in what contempt, and
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:15301:325"/>
miſerie the people of God were; it is ſaid, that <hi>hee fell down and wept, and mourned certain dayes. Nehe.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah wiſhed that his head were full of water, and his eyes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of teares, that hee might weep day and night, for the miſeries of the people, Jerem.</hi> 9.1. But alas! how few are they that do lay to heart the afflictions of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors? <hi>They ſing to the ſound of the violl, they drink wine in bowles, and anoint themſelves with the chiefe ointment, but no man is ſorry for the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Joſeph, Amos,</hi> 9.5, 6. Thus too many Chriſtians ſhew themſelves to be Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, or rather ſtocks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any charitable affection, without any bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:15301:325"/>
Many will be kind unto their friends, all the while they are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite their love with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againe, but in the day of adverſitie (as was touched before) they are ready to turn their backs upon their neighbors: whereas <hi>a true friend loveth it all times, and a brother is borne for adverſitie, Pro.</hi> 17.17. Theſe are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-hearted, and falſe friends, who like many a dog, will fawn upon a man, and follow him all the while hee hath ſomthing to give him, but when all is gone, hee is gone alſo. So that it is true, which the Wiſe man ſpeakes, <hi>Wealth maketh many friends, but the poore is ſeparated from his neighbor, Prov,</hi> 16.4. Take wee heed therefore, that wee be not ſo taken up
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:15301:326"/>
with our own fulneſſe, and proſperity, that wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the wants and miſeries of others, ſo as there is left no place in our hearts to grieve for them: for if wee be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compaſſion, God will one day ſmite theſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate hearts of ours, that wee ſhall ſtand in need of, and be glad to have pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from others, but it ſhall be denied us. <hi>For there ſhall be judgement mercileſſe, to him that ſheweth no mercie, Jam.</hi> 2.13. Therefore let us beare <hi>one anothers burthen, and ſo fulfill the law of Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 6.2. Thou helpeſt to beare thy neighbors burthen, when thou laboureſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him in the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for it is a great eaſe and comfort unto him, that is in any diſtreſſe to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:15301:326"/>
to condole with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have companions of our ſorrow, to have thoſe that fellow-feele with us, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a comfort to any that are in miſery.</p>
            <p>Little do you think what refreſhing (if not eaſe) it is to one in affliction, to heare, or ſee another to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his caſe: to weep with thoſe that weep, and mourn with thoſe that mourn, doth excedingly abate, though not remove and take away the ſmart of their affliction. We ſhall be the more ready and willing to put forth our hand of comfort, to lift our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor out of the ditch, if wee conſider how ſoone his caſe may be ours, and our ſelves (before it be long) may ſtand in as much need of pitty and comfort as our neighbor
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:15301:327"/>
now doth. What meaſure you meat, it ſhall be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you againe. <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.2. Therefore denie not unto the afflicted any comfort which thou art able to afford him. But above all, beware (as I ſaid before) of inſulting over thoſe that are afflicted. This was the ſinne of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi> which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth, and threatneth by the Prophet <hi>Obadiah, Thou ſhouldeſt not have rejoyced over the children of Judah, in the day of their deſtruction, neither ſhouldeſt thou have ſpoken proudly in the day of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. As thou haſt done, it ſhall be done to thee, thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall returne upon thine head. Obadiah,</hi> verſ. 15. The Lord will not have any to ſolace themſelves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſorrow; nor make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:15301:327"/>
merry at others miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; though hee were our enemie. <hi>Bee not thou glad when thine enemie falleth, and let not thine heart rejoyce when hee ſtumbleth, leaſt the Lord ſee it, and it diſpleaſeth him, and hee turn his wrath from him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, Prov.</hi> 24.17, 18. But rather pitty thoſe that are afflicted, and then no doubt, but the Lord will ſtirre up the hearts of others to extend mercy, and bowels of compaſſion towards thee, when thou art in affliction. And if there be no man to pittie thee here, the Lord himſelfe will moſt certainly remember and recompenſe thy kindneſſe hereafter, in that day, wherein hee will reward every one according to his workes, and will ſay unto the mercifull, <hi>Come yee

You ſhall heare a new cart in the ſtreet which will ſqueak and make a noiſe, if the leaſt load that can be, lie upon it,

whereas an old ſeaſoned cart will go under a great weight, and make no noiſe; even ſo many a Chriſtian (not uſed to beare affliction) will ſqueak, and cry out upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little trouble, whereas hee that hath been ſeaſoned long, and exerciſed with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, undergoes many great and grievous ones cheerfully, and contentedly. Wert thou never in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untiil now? then look up to the promiſes of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſelfe with them, and they will make thee cheerfull and thankfull for thy affliction.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>It is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in my trouble, for thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe hath quickened me, Pſal.</hi> 119.50. Say as <hi>Sydrac, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhac</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> ſaid, <hi>our God whom wee ſerve is able to deliver us, and hee will
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:15301:337"/>
deliver us.</hi> Haſt thou been formerly afflicted, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, let former deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces confirm and ſtrengthen thy faith in this preſent, or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture afflictions, as it did <hi>Paul,</hi> wee ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God, <hi>Who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from ſo great a death, in whom we truſt that yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after hee will deliver us,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. In the mean time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to tarry the Lords lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, conſider not what now thou feeleſt, but what good hereafter thou art like to find by thine afflictions. Bleſſe God that hee will take this courſe with thee, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>What is man, that thou doſt magnifie him, and thou ſetteſt thine heart upon him, And doſt viſit him every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and trieſt him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> We would take it as a
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:15301:338"/>
great grace and honor, if the King ſhould every day ſend to know how we do: but if hee ſhould daily come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to viſit us, how highly ſhould wee think our ſelves honored? It is thy caſe that art afflicted. The King of Kings hath ſent his ſervant, nay comes with his ſervant to viſite thee, when he ſendeth affliction unto thee. Aſſure thy ſelfe he mindes thee, nay, ſets his heart upon thee: if he regarded not thy good and welfare, hee would ſuffer thee to take thy ſwinge in ſin; but becauſe he loveth thee he correcteth thee. It is a truth, the Lord hath ſpoken it; <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten; bee zealous therefore and amend.</hi> So be it.</p>
