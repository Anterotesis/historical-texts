            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Good people you are come to ſee the ſad end of a miſerable woman. I have been a ſcandalous liver ever ſince I was fifteen years old, and now God almighty has taken this time to puniſh me for all my wickedneſs; I cannot but acknowledge the murder of my dear Husband, though I muſt needs ſay, I never intended it, but did it in my paſſion, and it is well known among my Neighbours how dearly I loved him, <hi>I</hi> pray God I may be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to you all, and that though I ſuffer this cruel Death here, I may be delivered from the pains of hell fire for ever.</p>
            <p>And after ſome private prayer by the Miniſter, ſhe kneeled down her ſelf and pray'd very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which much affected the ſtanders by, and after went cheerfully to the Stake where ſhe ſuffer'd.</p>

between that and <hi>Goodman's-fields</hi> in the ſad time of <hi>Londons</hi> Calamity, by the terrible Sickneſs, 1665. She was very buſie a Nurſe-keeping, or tending perſons Viſited with the Plague, and as 'tis ſuppoſed, got then enough to help maintain her ſince: for though ſhe were from thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards generally called Nurſe, &amp; pretended ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to take in Cloaths to Waſh, yet ſhe did not do any conſiderable matter of work, but lived a life ſomewhat extravagant and expenſive for one of her condition; This man, on whom ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this horrid murther, being the ſixth that ſhe had had.</p>
            <p>She was Married to him ſomewhat above a year laſt paſt, who was a civil honeſt laborious perſon, by name <hi>William Lilly-man,</hi> and by profeſsion a Cooper belonging to a Brew-houſe, a luſty comely man, and not above thirty years of age or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, which made her at firſt extreamly dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but being her ſelf near threeſcore ſhe was not a little tainted with the poiſon of jealouſie, which often is the diſturber of the diſcreeteſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and therefore might without matter of wonder prove the bane of this laſcivious heart.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107452:4"/>
ſaid to her: Ah Miſtris <hi>Lillyman,</hi> little do you think that your Husband and I have been together and that he gave me a bottle of Ale at your houſe, or vvords to that effect, and indeed there vvas lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon for her to think ſo, for in truth there was no ſuch thing done, nor any thing like it.</p>
            <p>However the woman according to the nature of jealouſie, takeing it in the worſt ſenſe, fell into an angry paſsion, poſsibly the ſooner raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that ſhe was before elevated with drink, ſo that coming into the room where her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was, ſhe was heard to ſay, <hi>Do you ſend for me to ſupper, you Raſcal</hi>; (or ſome other ill name) I will give you a Supper; and preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being all alone with him (the Woman of the houſe being gone for a pot of drink, and the Maid for a Loaf for him) the ſaid Elizabeth his Wife took up the aforeſaid long knife which he had borrowed of the Cobler, and therewith ſtab'd him under the leſt papp, ſo that as the Surgeons afterwards teſtified, it pierced his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart, and the Maid immediately returning he told her his Wife had ſtab'd him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to call in his countrey-man the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; ſhe hearing him talk of being ſtab'd, thought at firſt he had been but in jeſt, but ſeeing him look ill, with his hand faſt on his breaſt began to be afraid, and called the Cobler, but before he could get in, the wounded man was got up from his ſeat, and coming out met him, ſaying, Ah Countrey-man! this wicked Woman my Wife has ſtab'd me with the knife which I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107452:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thee; all this while his Wife ſtood by, and hearing this came up to him, and ſaid, I ſtab thee Love? why wilt thou ſay ſo? I have not toucht thee? and thereupon proffered to kiſs him, but he with his hand putting her back ſaid again: Ah wicked woman thou haſt kill'd me: By this time, he fainting, the Cobler taking him in his arms had put him into one of the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rooms, and askt him where his hurt was, for as yet they ſaw it not; Whereupon he point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his left, and ſaid, Here, here my Wife hath kill'd me; which was the laſt Words he was heard to utter in this world, for preſently after he fainted quite away, and in ſhort time dyed; his Wife when ſhe ſaw him ſo very bad would have made her eſcape and gone out at the back door, but neighbours ſtopt her and ſent for a conſtable, who carried her before a juſtice of peace.</p>
            <p>At her Examinati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>on there, ſhe behaved her ſelf very ſtrangely, ſeeming altogether unconcerned at what ſhe had done, and laughing at it: amongſt many other her ſilly anſwers, this was one, <hi>I wiſh my hands may never ſee my eyes, if I killed my husband</hi>; the Magiſtrate gravely admoniſhed her to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſo ſad a caſe, but ſhe took little notice of it, but ſtiffly denyed that ſhe murthered him, however the perſon being then quite dead, ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate</hi> in order to her Tryal.</p>
            <p>And accordingly at the laſt ſeſsions held at the <hi>Old Bayly</hi> begining on the 7<hi>th.</hi> of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> 1675. She was Arraigned for Petty Treaſon, for Killing her Husband: After the Endictment was

read, and ſhe required to plead to it, ſhe fell into a kind of raveing, crying out, <hi>ſhe muſt ſee her Husband, and ſhe would not plead till ſhe had him there:</hi> But this vvas but a faigned Artifice or piece of Diſsimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhe vvas at laſt brought to plead in form: vvhich ſhe did, by ſaying, <hi>Not Guilty</hi>: The VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt her, vvere the before-mentioned Cobler, the VVoman of the houſe, and the Maid, at the ſight of vvhich laſt ſhe fell into another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate fit, calling her, many baſe, ſcurrilous names in open Court; The Evidence vvas plain, as you have heard in all Circumſtances, and the Priſoner had nothing to ſay for her ſelf, but impudent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials of the Fact, and yet confeſſed that ſhe had a vvicked intention to have done the ſaid Maid a Miſchief at the ſame time vvhen her Husband vvas Killed. So that the matter being evident, the Jury brought her in, <hi>Guilty of the Endictment</hi>: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſhe received the uſual Sentence for perſons of her Sex, in Caſes of petty Treaſon, that is to ſay, <hi>To be Burned until ſhe be Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt night after her Condemnation, ſhe ſeemed ſcarce at all ſenſible of her condition, but on the next day, being the Lords day, ſhe began to have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, confeſſing then to ſome friends that came to viſit her, that ſhe had been a grievous ſinner for many years, naming ſeveral particular ſins that ſhe had been guilty of; yet ſtill denyed her ſelf to have ever been guilty of Murther or Theft; nor would confeſs the killing of her husband; ſince that ſeveral Miniſters have viſited her, and have at laſt brought her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Fact, and now ſhe ſeems exceeding Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent for the ſame, being come to the place appointed for her execution on <hi>Towerhill,</hi> on <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
