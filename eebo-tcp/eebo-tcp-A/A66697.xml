         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>William</hi> will prove faithful, though all men ſhould prove falſe, yet

               <p>Arabella though ſhe judged her ſelf deceived before in <hi>Ralph,</hi> yet was
by theſe words brought into ſuch a confidence of <hi>Williams</hi> integrity,
that ſhe had almoſt yielded up the Fort, and revealed the affection ſhe

further tryal of his loyalty, and by a moderate delay have a ſure proof of

gave him no great denyall, ſo did it not any ways aſſure him of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

Maids are many times beguil'd by your willy ſnares, and whereas men
accuſe our Sex of fickleneſs, the fault is in them, for we only change
our loves as men change their conditions; and are conſtant to them
ſo long as they are true to themſelves, yet am not I ſo out of Love

               <p>There was living in the ſame houſe a Maid-ſervant named <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>

               <p>And now ſhe began to look on <hi>William</hi> with a ſquint eye, her ſmiles
were turned to frowns, diſcontent ſat on her forehead, and all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

how to draw his affection unto her, loath ſhe was to diſcover her love
to him in plain terms, yet willing ſhe was he ſhould know ſhe loved
him; many haits ſhe uſed, and ſeveral Engines ſhe ſet on work for
that purpoſe, but all would not do, <hi>William</hi> either knew not, or at leaſt

perſon, to this purpoſe ſhe acquainted a truſty friend of hers with the
Project, giving him inſtructions how to procéed therein, who in a little
ſpace found a fit opportunity to ſpeak unto <hi>William</hi> thereof, but ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly,
and in ſuch fit words, that the device was not in the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
for having galned from <hi>William</hi> by his diſcourſe that when his
time was out he intended to go from his Maſter, he then perſwaded
him to take upon him a Marriage life, extolling it highly, and ſetting
forth all the priviledges that a Married man injoys above a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and having as he thought wrought him into a good opinion of that
kind of life, he then comended <hi>Dorothy</hi> to him as a fit perſon to make
a wife on, highly commending and extolling her rare perfections both of
body and mind, but <hi>Williams</hi> thoughts were fixed upon another object,
and though he gave him the hearing, yet minded not to follow his
counſel however he thanked him for his advice, but told him Marriage
was a matter of ſo high a concernment as required ſome deliberation,
that for his part he intended to do nothing raſhly, ſince haſty Marriages
were moſt commonly ſoon repented of, yet he would take time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
thereof, and therefore for the preſent deſired him to make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

In the mean time Sir <hi>John Hawkwoods</hi> name grew famous in
<hi>France,</hi> for like a true <hi>Hawk</hi> he ſeldom miſt of his prey, nor did the
Taylors ſheirs clip the wings of his fame, but by his valour he made
his Trade renowned, ſo that the moſt noble perſons in the Army deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his acquaintance, for by his ingenuity he attained to ſuch perfeai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Arms, that his rules were held for Maximes in the art mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.
The King alſo to honor him the more gave him a Coat of Arms
ſignificant to his name, which was a <hi>Hawk flying in a Wood,</hi> with a
Lyon and Griffen for the ſupporters. <hi>Ralph</hi> alſo was for his deferts
raized from a Serjant to be a Leiutenant, who by his courteous and
deboneyre carriage purchaſed to himſelf the love of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and other inferior officers.</p>
               <p>But the fair <hi>Arabella</hi> was much perplexed with the thoughts of the
wrong ſhe had done unto <hi>Ralph,</hi> ſo that the grief thereof brought her
into a ſickneſs, and that ſo deadly, that notwithſtanding all means u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for her recovery, her Parents began to deſpair of her life; for the
Doctors were ignorant in her diſeaſe, and therefore the leſs able to
preſcribe her a Remedy, and though ſhe were often urged by her
friends <hi>if Love were not the cauſe of her diſtemper,</hi> yet would ſhe
confeſs nothing, but kept all to her ſelf, and to blind them from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Original of her malady, ſhe imputed it to an exceſſive cold, ſhe
had gotten by walking late in the fields, and now her ſickneſſ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſhe indeavour'd all ſhe could to put the remembrance of <hi>Ralph</hi>
out of her mind, but the more ſhe indeavour'd it, the more did it come
into her memory, and now that Love which a while ago, was in a
manner quite quencht, begun to burn more then ever before; no reſt
could ſhe take, it being now a ſtranger unto her, her chief companion
was ſorrow and trouble. In this languiſhing condition ſhe reſolved to
ſend a Letter to <hi>Ralph,</hi> to eaſe her heart, and to clear the miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

downwards, the parts of a French-woman from the girdle to the

<hi>Holland</hi> then <hi>France,</hi> where (if the ſaying be true) the women are

               <p>But ſuppoſe <hi>William</hi> you could light of a Maid to your mind, one

and now feeling the near approach of death, becauſe of the great love

earneſtly deſired and perſwaded me to think of no otherwiſe but you,
as the only maid in the world worthy to be beloved, for your noble

himſelf to be a hater of virtue; and therefore by that former af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

to make ſure work he never left till he had backt of the Boars two
Fore-legs, and then ſetting his Monmouth cap aſide, he ſaid, now let
her ſee whether her can run after her again. The Company by this
time were come in and laughed heartily at Sir <hi>Taffies</hi> valor, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applauding <hi>Williams</hi> fortunate ſucceſs, each of them yellding the
palm of victory to him and aſcribing the honor thereof alone to his
victorious arm.</p>
               <p>Great was the wonderment of the people at the vaſt proporſion of
this Boar, which upon meaſure they found to be nine foot and a half
in length, from his ſnout to his Tayl, and five foot and two inches in
height his eyes were as big as Saucers, and his tusks of a ſpans length
as ſharp as Spaniſh néedles. The King of <hi>France</hi> in reward of this
vallant ſervice, conferied on <hi>William</hi> the Honor of Knighthood, in the
ſame place where he had killed the Boar, and with his own hands
gave him a Golden Spear, the prize of his Conqueſt. Then cut they
off the Boars head, and fixing it on the Truncheon of a Spear, it was
carried in tryumph before them all the way in their return to <hi>Paris,</hi>
whether being come they were welcomed in moſt Royal manner, with
ringing of Bells, Feaſtings Pageants, and other coſtly devices; the
people from all quarters flocking about to behold <hi>William,</hi> who had
delivered their Country, from their much feared enemy, the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Boar.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> having tarried ſome few dayes at <hi>Paris,</hi> growing
quickly weary of Court delights, and longing to behold his Native
Country again, he took his ſolemn leave of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
embarking with the reſt of the Engliſh in a gallant Ship, they cut the
briney face of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and in few daies arrived in the delightful ſoil
of England, at the town of <hi>Dover,</hi> where he made no tarriance, but
taking Horſe, never ſtayed till he came to his beloved <hi>Dorothy,</hi> who
entertained him with theſe loving expreſſions.</p>

King of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> of whoſe praiſe ſufficiently to ſpeak, would wear a

The Kingthough loath to part with his company, yet it being upon
ſo honorable an account, moſt willingly condeſcended, rewarding him
very liverally for his noble atcheivements, and to the reſt of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Officers he gave Iewels, and ſtore of money, yea the

rich Diamond King, of ſo great price, that it was eſteemed to be worth
