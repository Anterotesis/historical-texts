            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

confesse it to be a meer toy, not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any iudicial mans view: If it haue
found any friends, so it is, you knowe
very wel that it was abroad a fortnight ere I knewe of it, &amp;
vncorrected and vnfinished, it hath offred it selfe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
scorne of the world. Had you not beene so forward in
the republishing of it, you shold haue had certayne Epistles
to Orators and Poets, to insert to the later end; As namely,
to the Ghost of <hi>Macheuill,</hi> of <hi>Tully,</hi> of <hi>Ouid,</hi> of <hi>Roscius,</hi> of <hi>Pace</hi>
the Duke of Norfolks Iester; and lastly, to the Ghost of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Greene,</hi> telling him, what a coyle there is with pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on him after his death. These were prepared for <hi>Pierce
Penilesse</hi> first setting foorth, had not the feare of infection
detained mee with my Lord in the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Now this is that I woulde haue you to do in this second e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
First, cut off that long-tayld Title, and let mee not

Oration to the Reader, when in the whole there is nothing

            <p>I heare say there bee obscure imitators, that goe about to
frame a second part to it, and offer it to sell in Paules Church-yard,
and elsewhere, as from mee. Let mee request you (as
euer you will expect any fauour at my hands) to get some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to write an Epistle before it, ere you set it to sale againe,
importing thus much; that if any such lewde deuise intrude
it selfe to their hands, it is a coseanage and plaine knauery of
him that sels it to get mony, and that I haue no manner of
interest or acquaintance with it. Indeed if my leysure were,
such as I could wish, I might haps (halfe a yeare hence) write

am growne at length to see into the vanity of the world more
than euer I did, and now I condemne my selfe for nothing so
much, as playing the dolt in Print. Outvpon it, it is odious,
specially, in this moralizing age, wherein euery one seeks to
shew himselfe a Polititian by mis-interpreting. In one place
of my Booke <hi>Pierce Penilesse</hi> saith, but to the Knight of the
Post, <hi>I pray how might I call you,</hi> &amp; they say I meant one <hi>Howe,</hi>
a Knaue of that trade that I neuer heard of before. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti

to detract from that excellent profession, when (God is my
witnesse) I reuerence it as much as any of them all, and had
no manner of allusion to them that stumble at it. I hope they
wil giue me leaue to think there be fooles of that Art as well
as of al other; but to say I vtterly condemne it as an vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>This is the lamentable condition of our Times, that men of
Arte must seeke almes of Cormorantes, and those that deserue
best, be kept vnder by Dunces, who count it a policie to keepe
them bare, because they should follow their bookes the better:
thinking belike, that as preferment hath made themselues idle,
that were earst painefull in meaner places, so it would likewise
slacken the endeuours of those Students that as yet striue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,

<hi>Sicprobo</hi> and his pennilesse companions prate, whilest we haue

a Politician in purchasing, that Hel (which at the beginning was
but an obscure Uillage) is now become a huge Cittie, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Countries are tributary.</p>
            <p>These manifest coniectures of Plentic, assembled in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place

till his full belly gaue mee a full hande, and lette him bloud
with my penne (if it might be) in the veyne of liberalitie: and so (in
short time) was this Paper-monster <hi>Pierce Penilesse</hi> begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>But written and all, here lies the question; where shal I finde
this olde Asse, that I may deliuer it. Masse thats true, they say the
Lawyers haue the Diuell and all; and it is like enough he is play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ambodexter amongst them. Fie, fie, the Diuell a driuer in
Westminster hall, it can neuer be.</p>
            <p>Now I pray what doe you imagine him to bee? Perhaps you
thinke it is not possible he should bee so graue. Oh then you are in
an errour, for hee is as formall as the best Scriuener of them all.
Marry he doth not vse to weare a night-cap, for his hornes will
not let him: and yet I know a hundred as well he aded as he, that
will make a iolly shift with a Court-cup on their crownes if the
weather be colde.</p>
            <p>To proceede with my tale, to Westminster hall I went, and
made a search of Enquiry, from the blacke gown to the buckram
bagge, if there were any such Sergeant, Bencher, Counsellor,
Attorney, or Pettifogger, as <hi>Signior Cornuto Diabolo,</hi> with the

marry whether he were at the Exchaunge or no, amongst the rich
Merchantes, that they could not tell: but it was likelier of the
two, that I should meet with him, or heare of him at the least in
those quarters I faith, and say you so quoth I, and Ile bestowe a
little labour more but Ile hunt him out.</p>
            <p>Without more circumstance, thither came I; and thrusting my
<pb facs="tcp:10631:6"/>
selfe, as the manner is, amongst the confusion of languages, I
asked (as before) whether he were there extant or no? But from
one to another, <hi>Non noui Damonem</hi> was all the answer I could
get. At length (as Fortune serued) I lighted vpon on old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

with a gray beard cut short to the stumps, as though it were
grimde, and a huge woorme-eaten nose, like a cluster of grapes
hanging downe-wardes. Of him I demaunded if hee could tell
me any tidings of the partie I sought for.</p>
            <p>By my troth quoth he stripling, (and then he cought) I saw
him not lately, nor know I certainely where he keepes: but thus
much I heard by a Broker a friend of mine, that hath had some
dealings with him in his time, that he is at home sicke of the gout
and will not bee spoken withal. vnder more than thou art able to
giue, some two or three hundred angels at least, if thou hast anie
sute to him: &amp; then parhapes hele straine curtesie with his legges

<hi>Non est domi,</hi> hee is busie with <hi>Mammon,</hi> and the prince of the
North, how to build vp his kingdome, or sending his spirites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to vndermine the maligners of his gouernment.</p>
            <p>I hearing of this cold comfort, tooke me leaue of him verie
faintly, and like a carelesse malecontent that knew not which way
to turne, retired me to Paules to seeke my dinner with Duke
<hi>Humfrey:</hi> but when I came there, the olde souldier was not vp:
he is long a rising thought I, but thats all one: for he that hath no

daily vse had worne out of mens mouthes, and he himselfe had so
customablie practised, that often exercise had quite abrogated the
opinion of sinne, and impudencie throughlie confirmed an vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
defiance of vertue in his face. Yet newfangled lust, that in
time is wearie of welfare, and will bee as soone cloyed with too

            <p>For one daie, as these two Deuisers were plotting by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
how to driue all the Bées from their Honny combs, by
putting wormwood in their Hyues, and strewing Henbane and

            <p>Yes very well (quoth I) but I would gladly haue you returne
to your first subiect, since you haue mooued doubts in my mind,
which you haue not yet discust.</p>
            <p>Of the sundrie opinions of the Diuill thou meanest, and them
that imagin him to haue no existence, of which sort are they that
first inuented the prouerbe, <hi>Homo bomini Daemon:</hi> meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that that power which we call the Diuill, and the ministring
Spirits belonging to him and to his kingdom, are tales and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and meere bugge bearers to scarre boies: and that there is
no such essence at all, but only it is a terme of large content, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the rancor, grudg, and bad dealing of one man toward
another: as namely, when one friend talkes with another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly,
and séeks to diue into his commoditie, that he may depriue
him of it craftelie: when the sonne seeks the death of the father,
that he maie be infeoffed in his welth: and the stepdame goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to make awaie her sonne in-law, that her children may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit:
when brothers fall at iarres for portions, and shall by open
murther or priuie conspiracie, attempt the confusion of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
only to ioine house to house, and vnite two Liuelihoods in
one: when the seruant shall rob his master, and Men put in trust
start away from their oathes and vowes they care not how.</p>
            <p>Iu such cases and manie more, may one man be said to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
to another, and this is the second opinion. The third is that
of <hi>Plato,</hi> who not onely affirmeth that there are diuels, but deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them into thrée sorts, euerie one a degree of dignitie aboue
the other; the first are those, whose bodies are compact of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
airie Element, combined with such transparant thréeds;
that neither they doo partake so much fire as should make them
visible to sight, or haue anie such astinitie with the earth, as they
are able to be prest or toucht: and these he setteth in the hiest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
degrée of heauen. The second, he maketh these
whom <hi>Apuleius</hi> doth call reasonable creatures, passiue in mind
and eternall in time, being those <hi>Apostata</hi> spirits that rebelled
with <hi>Belzebub:</hi> whose bodies, before their fall, were bright and
pure all like to the former: but after their transgression, they
were obscured with a thick ayrie matter &amp; euer after assigned
to darknes, The third, he attributes to those men, that by some
<pb facs="tcp:10631:32"/>
diuine knowledge or vnderstanding, séeming to aspire aboue
mortalitie, are called <hi>Daemona,</hi> (that is) <hi>Gods:</hi> for this word <hi>Daemon</hi>
contayueth either, and <hi>Homer</hi> in euery place doth vse it, both
for that omnipotent power that was before al things, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
spirit that leadeth men to error: so doth <hi>Syrianus</hi> testifie, that
<hi>Plato</hi> was called <hi>Daemon,</hi> because he disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

matters, greatly auailable to the benefite of his
Countrye: and also <hi>Aristotle</hi> because he wrote at large of all
things subiect to moouing and sence. Then belike (quoth I)
you make this word <hi>Daemon,</hi> a capeable name of Gods, of men
and of diuels, which is farre distant from the scope of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
for I doo onlie inquire of the diuel, as this common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
of the Diuel, signifieth a malignant spirit, enimie to
mankind, and a hater of God and all goodnes. Those are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
kinde said he, vsuallie termed detractors or accusers that
are in knowledge infinit, insomuch as by the quicknes of their
wits, and agréeable mixtures of the Elements, they so compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

which in course of time, or by growing degrées Nature of

works of nature, can contriue and compas in a moment, as the
Magitians of <hi>Pharao,</hi> who wheras nature not without some in

if a man speak to them, they flee awaie and will not abide. Such
a spirit <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> telleth of, that vsed to haunt a goodlie

he meruelouslie disturbed the owners of the garden, &amp; woulde
not let them rest in their beds, till by his Sisters returned from

auoucheth (amongst other experiments) that a certain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
called <hi>Zazilus</hi> doth feed vpon dead mens corses, that are not
déeplie interred in the earth as they ought: which to confirme,
there is a inonderfull accident set downe in the Danish history
of <hi>Asuitus</hi> and <hi>Asmundus,</hi> who being two famous friends (well
knowne in those parts) vowd one to another, that which of them
two out liued the other, should be buried aliue with his friende

<hi>Asmundus</hi> compelled by the oath of his friendship, tooke
none but his horsse and his dog with him, and transported the

these terms. Why stand you astonisht at my vnusual deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
when no liuing man conuerseth with the dead, but is thus
disfigured. But other causes haue effected this change in mee:
for I know not what audacious spirit sent by <hi>Gorgon</hi> from the

dog, but also hath laid his hungrie pawes vpon me, and tering
downe my chéekes as you see, hath like wise rent awaie one of
mine eares. Hense is it that my mangled shape séeme so mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strous,
and my humane image obscured with gore in this wise.
Yet scaped not this fell Harpie from me vnreuenged: for as he
assailde me, I caught his head from his shoulders, and sheashd
my sword in his bodie. Haue spirits their visible bodies saide
I, that may be toucht, wounded, or pierst? Beléeue me, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
heard that in my life before this. Why quoth he, although
in their proper essence they are creatures incorporall, yet can
they take on them the induments of anie liuing bodie what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,

list. <hi>Socrates</hi> affirmeth that his <hi>Damon</hi> did oftentimes talke
with him, and that he saw him and felt him manie times. But
<hi>Marcus Cherronesius</hi> (a wonderfull discouerer of Diuels) wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
that those bodies which they assume, are distinguisht by no
difference of sex, bicause they are simple, and the discernance of
sex belongs to bodies compound: yet are they flexible, motiue,
and apt for any configuration, but not all of them alike: for the
spirits of the Fire and Aire haue this power aboue the rest. The
spirits of the water haue slow bodies resembling birdes &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of which kind the <hi>Naiades</hi> &amp; <hi>Nereieds</hi> are much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongst Poete. Neuerthelesse, how euer they are restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

is the neerest representation to God, insomuch as the scripture
saith, <hi>He made man after his own likenesse and image:</hi> and they
affecting by reason of their pride, to be as like God as they may,
contend most seriouslie to shroud themselues vnder that habit.

genus</hi> to vs all, is called <hi>Diabolus quafi deorsum ruens,</hi> that is to say
falling downeward, as he that aspiring too high, was thrown
from the top of felicitie to the lowest pit of despaire: and sathan,
that is to saie, an Aduersarie, who for the corruption of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
opposeth himselfe euer against God, whoe is the chiefest
good. In <hi>Iob, Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> and in the 9. of the
<hi>Apocalips, Apolyon,</hi> that is to saie, a Subuerter: bicause the
foundation of those vertues, which our high Maker hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our soules; he vndermineth and subuerteth. A serpent
for his poisoning, a Lyon for his deuouring: a furnace, for that
by his malice the Elect are tried, who are vessels of wrath and
saluation. In <hi>Esay,</hi> a Syren, a Lamia, a Scrich-oule, an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge.
In the Psalmes, an Adder, a Basiliske, a Dragon. And
lastlie, in the Gospell, Mammon, Prince of this world, and the
Gouernour of darknes: so that by the whole course of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
names that are giuen vs, and no one instance of anie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
tytle bestowed vpon vs, I positiuelie set downe that
all spirits are euill. Now, whereas the Diuines attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs these good and euill spirits, the good to guide vs from euil,
and the euill to draw vs from goodnesse, they are not called spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
but Angels, of which sort was <hi>Raphaell,</hi> the good Angell of
<hi>Tobias,</hi> who exilde the euill spirit <hi>Asmodius</hi> into the desart of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he might be the more secure from his temptation.
Since we haue entred thus far into the diuels common wealth.
I beséech you certifie me thus much, whether haue they power
to hurt granted them from God, or from themselues; can they
hurt as much as they wil. Not so quoth hee, for although that
diuels be most mightie spiries, yet can they not hurt but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiuelie,
or by some speciall dispensation: as when a man is
fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into the state of an out-law, the Law dispenseth with them
that kill him, &amp; the Prince excludes him from the protection of
a subiect, so, when a man is a relaps from GOD and his
Lawes, God withdrawes his prouidence from watching ouer
him, and authoriseth the deuil as his instrument, to assault him
and torment him, so that whatsoeuer he dooth, is <hi>Limitata pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
as one saithe: insomuche as a haire cannot fall from our
<pb facs="tcp:10631:36"/>
heades, without the will of our heauenlie Father. The Diuell
could not deceiue <hi>Achabs</hi> prophets til, he was licensed by God,
nor exercise his tyranie ouer <hi>Iob</hi> till he had giuen him commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor enter into the heard of swine til Christ bad them goe.
Therefore need you not feare the diuell any whit as long as you
are in the fauor of God, who raineth him so straight, that except
he let him loose he can doo nothing. This man like proportion
which I now retaine, is but a thinge of suffrance granted vnto
me to plague such men as hunt after strife, and are delighted
with variance. It may be so very well, but whether haue you
that skill to foretell thinges to come, that is ascribed vnto you?
We haue (quoth he) sometimes, not that we are priuie to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
counsell of god, but for that by the sense of our ayrie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
we haue a more refined faculty of for seeing, than men pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
can haue, that are chained to such heauie earthlie moulder;
or else for that by the incomporable pernicitie of those ayrie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
we not onely out strip the swiftnes of men, beasts &amp; birds,
whereby we may be able to attain to the knowledge of thinges
sooner, than those that by the dulnes of their earthlie sense come
a great waie behind vs. Hervnto may we adioine our long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the course of things from the begining of the world,
which men want and therfore cannot haue that déepe coniecture
that we haue. Nor is our knowledge any more than coniecture:
for prescience only belongeth to God, &amp; that gesse that we haue,
procéedeth from the compared disposition of heauenly and earth
lie bodies, by whose long obserued temperature, we doo diuine
manie times, as it happens, &amp; therefore doo we take vpon vs to
prophecy, that we may purchase estimation to our names, and
bringe men in admiration with that we doo, and so be counted
for Gods. The myracles wée work, are partly contriued by il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion,
and partly assisted by that supernatural skil we haue in
the experience of nature aboue all other Creatures. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these illusions of your subtletie &amp; vain terrors youinflict,
what is our chéefe refuge? I shall be accounted a foolishe Diuell
anon, if I bewray the secretes of our kingdome, as I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun:
yet speak I no more than learned Clarkes haue written,
and asmuch as they haue set downe will I shew thée. <hi>Origin</hi> in
his treatise against <hi>Celsus</hi> saith, there is nothing better for him
<pb facs="tcp:10631:36"/>
that is vexed with spirites, then the naming of <hi>Iesu,</hi> the true
God, for he auoucheth, he hath séene diuers driuen out of mens
bodies by that means. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his booke <hi>De variis questioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
saith, The presentest remedie againste the inuasion of euill
spirits, is the beginning of the 67. Psalme, <hi>Exurgat Deus, &amp;
dissipentun inimici eius. Cyprian</hi> counsels men to adiure spirites
only by the name of the true God. Some hold that fire is a pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruatiue
for this purpose, because when any spirit appeareth,
the lights by little and little, go out as it were of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
