            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Ver. II.</hi> But Marie, stood by the Sepulchre, weeping,
and as she wept she stouped, and looked into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,</p>
                  <p>12. And saw two angels, in white, sitting, the one at
the head, the other at the feete, where the body of
Iesus had Iyen.</p>
                  <p>13. And they said to her, Woman, why weepest thou?
She said to them, They have taken away my Lord,
and I know not where they haue laid Him.</p>
                  <p>14. When she had thus said, she turned herselfe about,
and saw Iesus standing, and knew not that it was
Iesus.</p>
                  <p>15. Iesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom
seekest thou? She (supposing He had beene the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner)
said to him, Sir if thou have borne Him hence,
tell mee where thou hast laid Him, and I will take
Him thence.</p>
                  <p>16. Iesus saith to her, Marie: She turned herselfe, and
said to Him, Rabboni; that is to say, Master.</p>
                  <p>17. Iesus saith to her, Touch me not, for I am not yet
ascended to my Father, But, goe to my brethren, and
say to them, I ascend to my Father and to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to my God and your God.</p>

            <p>The summe of it is, 1. The seeking

            <p>The Maner of it is, That <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi>

notice of this. As hee, to the Shepherds;
so shee, to the Apostles, the Pastours of
<hi>Christs</hi> flock, by them to be spred abroad
to the ends of the world.</p>
            <p>To looke a little into it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mary</hi> is the name of a woman:</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of a sinfull woman.</p>

came the first newes of death; So, by
a woman also might come the first notice
of the Resurrection from the dead. And
the place fits well: for, in a garden, they
came, both.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That, to a sinfull woman first; that
also agrees well. To her first that most

needed it: most needed it, and so first
sought it. And it agrees well; <hi>He</hi> be first
found of her, that first sought <hi>Him:</hi> Euen
in that respect she was to be respected.</p>
            <p>In which two, there is opened vnto vs

               <p>But, to take her as wee finde her in the
Text, and to looke no whither else. There
are, in the Text, no lesse then ten, all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of her great loue, all, as it were,
a commentarie vpon <hi>dilexit multùm.</hi> And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:272:5"/>
euen in this first verse, there are fiue of
them.</p>
               <p>The first, in these words; <hi>stabat inxta mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentum,</hi>
that she stood by the graue. A
place, where faint loue loues not to stand.
Bring <hi>Him</hi> to the graue, and lay <hi>Him</hi> in the
graue, and there leaue him: but come no
more at it, nor stand not long by it. Stand
by <hi>Him,</hi> while <hi>He</hi> is aliue, So did many,
stand, and goe, and sit by <hi>Him.</hi> But, <hi>stans

Magdalen,</hi> she did it, and she onely did it,
and none but she. <hi>Amor stans iuxta monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is in these, <hi>Maria autem stabat.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
But Marie stood.</hi> In the <hi>autem,</hi> the <hi>but</hi> (that,
helpes vs to another.) <hi>But Mary stood</hi> (that
is asmuch to say, as) others did not, <hi>But,</hi>
she did.<note place="margin">ver. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were there but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
now. Thither they came, but not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Him,</hi> away they went. They went:
<hi>But Marie</hi> went not, she <hi>stood still.</hi> Their
<hi>going away</hi> commends her <hi>staying behinde.</hi>
To the graue <hi>she came</hi> before them, From
the graue <hi>she went</hi> to tell them, To the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:272:6"/>
graue <hi>she returnes</hi> with them, At the graue
<hi>she stayes</hi> behind them. <hi>Fortior eam figebat
affectus,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> a stronger affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fixed her, so fixed her, that she had not
the power to remoue thence. Goe, who
would, she would not, but <hi>stay, still. To
stay</hi> while others doe so, while company
stayes, that is the worlds loue: But <hi>Peter</hi> is
gone, and <hi>Iohn</hi> too: all are gone, and we
left alone; then to <hi>stay,</hi> is loue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
loue. <hi>Amor manens, alijs recedentibus,</hi>
Loue, that when others shrinke and giue
ouer, holds out still.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third in these, <hi>she stood, and she wept;</hi>
And, not a teare or two: but <hi>she wept</hi> a
good (as we say;) That the Angels, That
<hi>Christ</hi> himselfe pitie her, and both of them,
the first thing they doe, they aske her, <hi>Why
she wept so?</hi> Both of them begin with that
question. And, in this, is loue. For, if,
when <hi>Christ stood at Lazarus graues side and
wept,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 36.</note> the Iewes said, <hi>See how be loued him:</hi>
may not we say the very same, when <hi>Mary
stood at Christs graue and wept, See, how she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him?</hi> Whose presence she wished for,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:272:6"/>
                  <hi>His</hi> misse she wept for; whom she dearely
loued, while she had <hi>Him,</hi> she bitterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed,
when she lost <hi>Him. Amor amare
flens,</hi> Loue running downe the cheekes.</p>
               <p>The fourth in these, <hi>And as she wept, shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
stouped, and looked in,</hi> euer and anon. That
is, she did so <hi>weepe,</hi> as, she did <hi>seeke</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
<hi>Weeping</hi> without <hi>seeking,</hi> is but to small
purpose. But, her <hi>weeping</hi> hindered not
her <hi>seeking;</hi> Her sorrow dulled not her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
And, diligence is a character of
loue, comes from the same root, <hi>dilectio &amp;
diligentia</hi> from <hi>diligo,</hi> both. <hi>Amor diligenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am diligens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>seeke,</hi> is one thing: not to giue ouer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <hi>seeking,</hi> is another. For, I aske, why should
she now looke in? <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
there before, nay had beene in the
graue, (they.)<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> It makes no matter: Shee
wil not trust <hi>Peters</hi> eyes, nor <hi>Iohns,</hi> neither.
But, she her selfe had before this, looked in,
(too.) No force, she will not trust her selfe,
she will suspect her owne eyes, she will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinke, she <hi>looked</hi> not well before, then
leaue off her <hi>looking.</hi> It is not enough for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:272:7"/>
loue, to <hi>looke</hi> in once. Thus we vse, this
is our manner when we seeke a thing seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
where we haue sought already, there
to seeke againe, thinking wee did it not
well, but, if wenow looke againe, better,
we shall surely find it, then. <hi>Amor quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
vbi quaesiuit.</hi> Loue, that neuer thinkes,
it hath looked enough. These fiue.</p>
               <p>And, by these fiue, we may take measure
of our loue, and of the true <hi>multum</hi> of it.
<hi>Vt profit nobis ejus stare, ejus plorare, &amp; quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere</hi>
(faith Origen) that her <hi>standing,</hi> her
<hi>weeping,</hi> and <hi>seeking,</hi> wee may take some
good by them.</p>
               <p>I doubt, ours will fall short. <hi>Stay</hi> by
<hi>Him</hi> aliue, that we can, <hi>juxtamensam:</hi> but
<hi>juxta monumentum,</hi> who takes vp his stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
there? And our loue, it is dry eyed,
it cannot <hi>weepe;</hi> it is stiffe-ioynted, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stoupe to <hi>secke.</hi> If it doe, and wee hit
not on <hi>Him</hi> at first, away wee goe, with
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> wee stay it not out with
<hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> A signe, our loue is little,
and light, and our <hi>seeking</hi> sutable, and so,
it is without successe. We find not <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:272:7"/>
no meruaile: but <hi>seeke Him</hi> as shee <hi>sought

               <p>The trueth is,<note place="margin">Her errour.</note> none had <hi>taken away Her
Lord,</hi> for all this: for, all this while <hi>Her
Lord</hi> was well, was, as shee would haue

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:272:12"/>
for want of beliefe <hi>He was risen,</hi> shee
beleeued, <hi>He was caried away.</hi> Shee erred in

verse (to make vp eight, towards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>1. The very title shee giues <hi>Him</hi> of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum
meum,</hi> is one, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that she giues
<hi>Him</hi> that terme. For, it shewes her loue
and respect was no whit abated, by the
scandall of His death. It was a most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious,
ignominious, shamefull death
Hee suffered, such, as in the eyes of the
world, any would haue been ashamed to
own <hi>Him,</hi> (or say of <hi>Him, Meum:)</hi> But, any
would haue beene afraid to honour Him
with that title, to style Him, <hi>Dominum.</hi>
Shee was neither. <hi>Meum,</hi> for hers, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
meum,</hi> for her <hi>Lord,</hi> shee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
Him, is neither ashamed, nor afraid
to continue that title still. <hi>Amor scandalo

this) That, shee hauing looked into
the graue a little before, and seene neuer
an <hi>Angel</hi> there; and of a sudden looking in
now, and seeing <hi>two,</hi> (a sight, able to haue
amazed any; any, but her) It mooues not
her at all. The suddennesse, the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the gloriousnesse of the sight, yea
euen of <hi>Angels,</hi> mooue her not at all. Shee
seemes to haue no sense of it, and so to be
in a kinde of extasie all the while. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,

<hi>Angel,</hi> if she finde not <hi>her Lord,</hi> it will not
serue. She had rather finde his dead body,
then them in all their glory. No man in

               <p>Not onely not knew <hi>Him,</hi> but misknew
<hi>Him, tooke Him for the Gardiner.</hi> Teares, wil
dim the sight, and it was yet scarse day,
and shee, seeing one, and not knowing
what any one should make in the ground
so early, but he that dressed it, she might
well mistake. But it was more then so:
<hi>Her eyes were not holden</hi> onely,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>that shee did
not know Him,</hi> but ouer and beside,<note place="margin">Mar. 16. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>He did

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in some such shape as might
resemble the <hi>Gardiner,</hi> whom shee tooke
<hi>Him</hi> for.</p>
               <p>Proper enough it was, it fitted well the
time and place (this person.) The time,
It was the Spring: The place, It was a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:272:15"/>
garden (that place is most in request at that
time) for that place and time, a <hi>Gardiner</hi>
doth well.</p>
               <p>Of which her so taking <hi>Him,</hi> Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>
saith well, <hi>Profectò errando non errauit.</hi>
She did not mistake in taking <hi>Him</hi> for a
<hi>Gardiner:</hi> though she might seeme to erre,
in some sense, yet in some other she was in
the right. For, in a sense, and a good sense,
CHRIST may well be said to be a <hi>Gardiner,</hi>
and indeed is one. For, our rule is, <hi>Christ,</hi>
as <hi>He</hi> appeares, so <hi>He</hi> is, euer: No false
semblant in <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 A <hi>Gardiner He</hi> is then. The first, the
fairest garden that euer was (Paradise) <hi>He</hi>
was the <hi>Gardiner,</hi> it was of <hi>His</hi> planting.
So, a <hi>Gardiner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 And euer since it is <hi>He</hi> that (as God)
makes all our gardens greene, sends vs
yearely the Spring, and all the hearbs and
flowers we then gather; and neither <hi>Paul</hi>
with his planting, nor <hi>Apollo</hi> with his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
could doe any good without him.
So a <hi>Gardiner</hi> in that sense.</p>
               <p>3 But not in that alone; But <hi>He</hi> it is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:272:15"/>
that gardens our soules too, and makes
them, as the Prophet saith,<note place="margin">Iere. 31. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Like a well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
garden,</hi> weedes out of them whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is noysome or vnsauoury, sowes and
plants them with true rootes and seedes of
righteousnesse, waters them with the dew
of <hi>His</hi> grace, and makes them bring forth
fruit to eternall life.</p>
               <p>But it is none of all these, but besides all
these, nay ouer and aboue all these, this
day (if euer) most properly <hi>He</hi> was a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner.</hi>
Was one, and so after a more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
manner, might take this likenesse on
<hi>Him. Christ</hi> rising was indeed a <hi>Gardiner,</hi>
and that a strange one, who made such an
hearbe grow out of the ground this day,
as the like was neuer seene before, a dead
body, to shoote foorth aliue out of the
graue.</p>
               <p>I aske, was <hi>He</hi> so this day alone? No,
but this profession of <hi>His,</hi> this day begun,
<hi>He</hi> will follow to the end. For, <hi>He</hi> it is,
that by vertue of this mornings act, shall
garden our bodies, too: turne all our
graues into garden plots: Yea, shall one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:272:16"/>
day turne land and Sea and all into a great
garden, and so husband them, as they shal
in due time bring forth liue bodies, euen
all our bodies aliue againe.</p>
               <p>Long before did <hi>Esai</hi> see this and sing
of it, in his song <hi>Esa.</hi> 26. 19. resembling the
Resurrection to a Spring garden. <hi>Awake
and sing</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye that dwell for a time are
as it were sowen in the dust, for His dew shall
be as the dew of hearbs, and the earth shall shoot
forth her dead.</hi> So then: He appeared no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then <hi>He</hi> was: A <hi>Gardiner He</hi> was,
not in shew alone, but <hi>opere &amp; veritate,</hi>
and so came in <hi>His</hi> owne likeness. This
for <hi>Christs appearing.</hi> Now to <hi>His speech</hi>

               <p>This <hi>quid ploras,</hi> it comes now twise.
The Angels asked it, wee stood not on it,
then. Now, seeing <hi>Christ</hi> askes it againe,
the second time, wee will thinke there is
something in it, and stay a little at it. The
rather, for that it is the very opening of
His mouth, the very first words that euer
came from Him, that He spake first of all,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:272:17"/>
after His rising againe from death. There
is sure some more then ordinary matter in
this <hi>quid ploras,</hi> if it be, but euen for that.</p>
               <p>Thus say the Fathers; <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                  <hi>That Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen
standing by the graue side,</hi> and there
<hi>weeping,</hi> is thus brought in, to represent
vnto vs, the state of all mankind before
this day, the day of <hi>Christs</hi> rising againe,
<hi>weeping over the dead, as doe the heathen that
haue no hope:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Thess. 4. 13.</note> comes <hi>Christ</hi> with His <hi>quid plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Why doe you weepe?</hi> As much to say, as
<hi>ne plores, Weepe not; why should you weepe?</hi>
There is no cause of <hi>weeping</hi> now. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
none shall need to <hi>stand by the graue
to weepe</hi> there any more. A question very
proper for <hi>Easter-day,</hi> for the day of the
<hi>Resurrection.</hi> For, if there be a rising again,
<hi>quid ploras,</hi> is right, <hi>why</hi> should shee, <hi>why</hi>
should any <hi>weepe,</hi> then?</p>
               <p>So that this <hi>quid ploras</hi> of <hi>Christs,</hi> wipes
away teares from all eyes, and as we sing
in the 30 <hi>Psalme</hi> (whose title is, the <hi>Psalme
of the Resurrection) puts off our sackcloth,</hi>
that is, our mourning weeds, <hi>girds vs with
gladnesse,</hi> puts vs all <hi>in white</hi> with the <hi>Angels.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:272:17"/>
Ploras</hi> then: leaue that for <hi>Good-Friday,</hi>
for His Passion: <hi>Weepe</hi> then, and spare not.
But, <hi>quid ploras,</hi> for <hi>Easter-day,</hi> is in kinde
(the Feast of the <hi>Resurrection)</hi> why should
there be any <hi>weeping</hi> vpon it? Is not <hi>Christ</hi>
risen? Shall not He raise vs with Him? Is
He not a <hi>Gardiner,</hi> to make our bodies
sowen, to grow againe? <hi>Ploras,</hi> leaue that
to the <hi>heathen, that are without all hope;</hi> but
to the Christian man, <hi>quid ploras? Why should
he weepe?</hi> he <hi>hath hope:</hi> the Head is already
risen, the members shall in their due time
follow Him.</p>
               <p>I observe, that foure times this day, at
foure seuerall appearings, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> at the first (at
this heere) He askes her, <hi>quid ploras? Why

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Of them that went to <hi>Emaus,

Christ</hi> she seemes to charge, at least to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the fact, as if He looked like one
that had beene a breaker vp of graues,
a carrier away of corses out of their place
of rest. Her (<hi>if</hi>) implies as much. But
pardon loue: as it feares where it needs
not, so it suspects oft where it hath no
cause. He, or any that comes in our way,
hath done it, <hi>hath taken Him away,</hi> when
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:272:18"/>
loue is at a losse. But <hi>Bernard</hi> speakes to

the loue she bare to Him, the sorrow shee
had for Him, may excuse her with Him,
if she were in any error concerning Him,
in her saying, <hi>Si tu sustulisti.</hi>

               <p>And yet,<note place="margin">Origen.</note> see how God shall direct the

For indeed, if any <hi>tooke Him away,</hi> it
was He did it. So, she was not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse.
Her <hi>situ,</hi> was true, though not in
her sense. For, <hi>quod de ipso factum est, ipse

No other mans iniurie it was, but His
owne glorie, that shee found Him not
there. This was true, but this was no part
of her meaning.</p>
               <p>I cannot here passe ouer two more Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters

it selfe. In <hi>Christ</hi> specially, and in such in

neither men nor <hi>Angels,</hi> nor <hi>Himselfe</hi> (so

And discloses <hi>Himselfe</hi> by <hi>His</hi> voice.</p>
               <p>For, it should seeme, before, with His
shape, Hee had changed that also. But
now, Hee speakes to her in His knowen
voice, in the wonted accent of it, does but
name her name, <hi>Mary,</hi> no more, and that
was enough. That was as much to say,
<hi>Recognosce à quo recognosceris,<note place="margin">Augustine.</note>
                  </hi> she would at
least take notice of Him, that shewed He
was no stranger by calling her by her
name. For, whom we call by their names,
we take particular notice of. So God sayes
to <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 33. 17.</note>

<hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this indeede is the right way to
know <hi>Christ;</hi> to be knowen of <hi>Him</hi> first.
Gal. 4. 9. the Apostle saith, <hi>Now wee haue
knowen God</hi> (and then correcteth himselfe)
<hi>or rather haue beene knowen of God.</hi> For, till
<hi>Hee</hi> know vs, wee shall neuer know <hi>Him</hi>
aright.</p>
               <p>And now, loe, <hi>Christ</hi> is found, found
aliue that was sought dead. A cloude
may be so thick, we shal not see the Sunne
through it. The Sunne must scatter that
cloud, and then wee may. Here is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of it. It is strange, a thicke cloude
of heauinesse had so couered her, as, see
<hi>Him</hi> shee could not, through it; this one
word, these two syllables [<hi>Mary</hi>] from <hi>His</hi>
mouth, scatters it, all. No sooner had <hi>His</hi>
voice sounded in her eares, but it driues
away all the mist, dries vp her teares,
lightens her eyes, that shee knew <hi>Him</hi>
straight, and answeres <hi>Him</hi> with her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
salutation,<note place="margin">Her answere.</note> 
                  <hi>Rabboni.</hi> If it had lien in
her power to haue raised <hi>Him</hi> from the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:272:21"/>
dead, shee would not haue failed, but
done it (I dare say.) Now it is done to her
hands.</p>
               <p>And with this, all is turned out and
in. A new world, now. Away with <hi>sustu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerunt;
His taking away,</hi> is taken away quite.
For, if <hi>His taking away</hi> were her sorrow;
<hi>Contrariorum contraria consequentia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Augustine.</note> 
                  <hi>Si de sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato

be sure; If sad for His death, For <hi>His taking
away;</hi> then glad for his rising, for His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
againe. Surely, if she would haue
bene glad but to haue found but His dead
body; now she findes it, and Him, aliue,
what was her ioy, how great, may wee
thinke? So that, by this she saw <hi>Quid plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
was not asked her for nought, that it
was no impertinent question, as it fell out.
Well now, He that was thought lost, is
found againe, and found, not, as He was
sought for, not a dead body, but a liuing
soule, nay, <hi>a quickening Spirit,</hi> then.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 45.</note> And
that might <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> well say. Hee
shewed it, for He quickened her and her
Spirits, that were as good as dead. You
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:272:21"/>
thought you should haue come to <hi>Christs</hi>
Resurrection to day, and so you doe. But,
not to His alone, but euen to <hi>Marie Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalens</hi>
resurrection, too. For, in very deed,
a kind of resurrection it was, was wrought
in her, reuiued, as it were, and raised from
a dead &amp; drowping, to a liuely and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
estate. The <hi>Gardiner</hi> had done his
part, made her all greene, on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine.</p>
               <p>And all this, by a word of His mouth.
Such power is there in euery word of His,
so easily are they called, whom <hi>Christ</hi> will
but speake to.</p>
               <p>But, by this we see, when He would be
made knowen to her after his rising, Hee
did choose to be made knowen by the eare
rather then by the eye. By hearing rather
then by appearing. Opens her eares first,
and her eyes after. <hi>Her eyes were holden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 24. 16.</note> till
her eares were opened;<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 6.</note> comes <hi>aures autem
aperuistimihi,</hi> and that opens them.</p>
               <p>With the Philosophers, <hi>hearing</hi> is the
sense of wisedome. With vs, in diuinitie,
it is the sense of faith. So most meet. <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:272:22"/>
is the <hi>Word;</hi> hearing then (that sense) is
<hi>Christs</hi> sense; <hi>voce quàm visu,</hi> more proper
to the <hi>Word.</hi> So,<note place="margin">Pasl. 48. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>sicut audiuimus</hi> goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and then, <hi>sic vidimus</hi> comes after. In
matters of faith the eare goes first, euer,
and is of more vse, and to bee trusted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eye. For, in many cases faith hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
where sightfaileth.</p>
               <p>This then is a good way to come to the
knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> by <hi>Hodie si vocem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 95. 7.</note> to
<hi>heare His voice.</hi> Howbeit, it is not the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way. There is another way to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Him by besides, and we to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it. On this very day we haue them
both.</p>
               <p>For, twise this day came <hi>Christ,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
first, and then knowen, after. To
<hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> here: and to them at <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus.
Luc. c.</hi> 24. To <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
in the <hi>shape</hi> of a <hi>Gardiner.</hi> To those
that went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> vnknowen, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a <hi>Trauailer</hi> by the way side. Came
to be knowen to her by His voice, by the
word of His mouth. Not so to them. For,
many words He spake to them, and they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:272:22"/>
felt them <hi>warme at their hearts,</hi> but,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 32. 35.</note> knew
Him not for all that. But, <hi>He was knowen
to them in the breaking of the bread.</hi> Her eyes
opened by speaking a word: Their eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
by the breaking of bread. There is
the one and the other way, and so now you
haue both. And now you haue them, I
pray you make vse of them. (I see I shall
not be able to goe further then this verse.)</p>
               <p>It were a folly to fall to comparisons,
<hi>Committere inter se,</hi> to set them at oddes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,
these two waies: as the fond fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
now adaies is, whether is better, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or Preaching: The <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
What needs this? Seeing we haue
both, both are ready for vs; the one now,
the other by and by. VVee may end this
question, soone. And this is the best and
surest way to end it, to esteeme of them
both, to thanke Him for both, to make
vse of both, hauing now done with one,
to make triall of the other. It may be (who
knowes) if the one will not worke, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may. And if by the one or by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by either, or by both, it be wrought,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:272:23"/>
what harme haue we? In case it bee not;
yet haue we offered to God our serice in
both, and committed the successe of both
to Him. He will see they shall haue suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and in His good time (as shalbe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for vs) vouchsafe euery one of vs as
Hee did <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> in the Text, to
<hi>know Him and the vertue of His Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 3. 10.</note>
and make vs partakers of both, by
both the meanes before remembred, by
His blessed Word, by His holy mysteries;
the meanes to raise our soules heere, the
pledges of the raising vp of our bodies
hereafter. Of both which <hi>He</hi> make vs
partakers, who is the Author of
both, IESVS CHRIST
<hi>the Righteous, &amp;c.</hi>
