            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough His Majeſtie is aſſured, that His having ſo ſuddenly paſſed theſe two Bills, being of ſo great importance, and ſo earneſtly deſired by both Houſes, will ſerve to aſſure His Parliament, that He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing more then the ſatiſfaction of His Kingdom; yet that He may further manifeſt to both Houſes, how impatient He is till He finde out a full remedie to compoſe the preſent Diſtempers, He is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſignifie:</p>
            <p>That His Majeſtie will by Proclamation require, That all Statutes made concerning Recuſants, be with all Care, Diligence, and Severity put in execution.</p>
            <p>That His Majeſtie is reſolved, That the ſeven Condemned Prieſts ſhall be immediately Baniſhed (if His Parliament ſhall conſent therunto:) And His Majeſtie will give present Order (if it ſhall be held fit by both Houſes) that a Proclamation iſſue, to require all Romiſh Prieſts within twenty dayes to depart the Kingdom; and if any ſhall be Apprehended after that time, His Majeſtie aſſures both Houſes, in the Word of a King, That He will grant no pardon to any ſuch, without conſent of His Parliament.</p>
            <p>And becauſe His Majeſtie obſerves great and different Troubles to ariſe in the hearts of His People, concerning the Goverment and Liturgie of the Church, His Majeſtie is willing to declare, That He will refer that whole Conſideration to the Wiſdom of His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which He deſires them to enter into ſpeedily, that the preſent Diſtraction about the ſame may be compoſed: But deſires not to be preſſed to any ſingle Act on His part, till the whole be ſo digeſted and ſetled by both Houſes, that His Majeſtie may cleerly ſee what is fit to be left, as well as what is ſit to be taken away.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Ireland</hi> (in behalf of which His Majeſties heart bleeds) as His Majeſtie hath concurred with all Propoſitions made for that Service by His Parliament, ſo He is reſolved to leave nothing undone for their Relief, which ſhall fall within His poſſible Power, nor will refuſe to venter His owne Perſon in that War, if His Parliament ſhall think it convenient for the reduction of that miſerable Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, His Majeſtie taking notice by ſeverall Petitions of the great and generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Trade in this Kingdom, and more particularly of that of Clothing, and new Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (concerning which He received lately at <hi>Greenwich</hi> a modeſt, but earneſt Petition from the Clothiers of <hi>Suffolk</hi>) of which decay of Trade, His Majeſtie hath a very deep ſence, both in reſpect of the extream want and poverty it hath brought, and muſt bring upon many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of His loving Subjects, and of the influence it muſt have in a very ſhort time upon the very ſubſiſtence of this Nation, Doth earneſtly recommend the conſideraton of that great and weighty Buſineſſe to both Houſes; Promiſing them, that He will moſt readily concur in any Reſolution their Wiſdoms ſhall finde out, which may conduce to ſo neceſſary a Work.</p>
