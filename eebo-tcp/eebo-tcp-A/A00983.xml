            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

expected our felicity (as ſometimes it hath fallen out,
that ſuch as haue bene authors of great miſchiefes,
haue alſo bene miniſters of great remedies) ſith I ſay
that in liew of acknowledging their lawfull king, they

            <p>O Innocent poſterity, who in ſecret ſhall read theſe
laſt lamentations of your dying mother, euer-more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that your ſelues are diſcended of the race of
thoſe who time out of minde, haue made other nations
of the earth to tremble, who haue paſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and
the <hi>Pirinean</hi> mountaines, who haue ſayled ouer euery

theſe ſerpents who hauing once wrethed you within

            <p>Neuer thinke deere children that thoſe ſhamefull

is not to be thought that any ſo infamous or wretched
<pb facs="tcp:16496:2"/>
cogitation could euer penetrate the harte of any man
diſcended of a perfect french race. I will not heere
bring into conſideration the horrible cruelties that
haue diſpeopled the Indians, in putting to death more

neither will I ſet before you the inſatiable couetize
that hath dried vp the minds of <hi>Peru,</hi> and baniſhed the
welthieſt houſes in <hi>Portugall</hi> and the Low countryes,
all this beſeemeth thoſe that ſeeke to haue a ſtranger
to their maiſter, yet will they haue one that is tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
France hath no skill in ſuch a choyce: France
acknowledgeth none but her owne children, thoſe
whome ſhe hath ſuckled, nourſed and brought vp in
her boſome, ouer whome ſhee commandeth, her king
onely excepted, whome God hath made to be borne
the eldeſt of the moſt ancient, greateſt and moſt flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing

ſcepter ſo many yeares. France giueth eare to that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
child whome ſhe cheriſheth, and loueth moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
to whome ſhe beareth an extraordinary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as accompting nothing difficult or dangerous that
may tende to the exalting of him aboue all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

her glory and maieſtie are ſhadowed and

ſtirre her benummed armes, in how ſhort ſpace ſhall
we ſee all theſe ſpaniſh forces cut in pieces? all theſe
<pb facs="tcp:16496:3"/>
garriſons of moores died in their owne bloud, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
countenance of France changed into ioy and mirth,
and all theſe ſtormes driuen away by the beautifull
beames of the ſonne which ſhall reſtore vnto vs the
light-ſome day of contentation and perfect liberty?
our churches ſhall not (as they ſeeke to perſwade) be
deſolate, but contrariwiſe they ſhall bee repleniſhed
with that ancient multitude which vſually we haue
ſeene among vs. We all together ſhall render praiſe
to God for the felicity vnto vs graunted, when round
about vs we ſhall behould not the ſpaniſh inſolencie
full of pompe and vanity, but the ſweetneſſe of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

complained hereof? and yet now euen at once he that
intituleth himſelfe the pretector and liutenant of the
crowne, of the mightieneſſe and maieſtie of France,
hath ſhewed himſelfe ſuch a coward, or rather ſuch a
traytor, to terme the king of Spaine <hi>the great king,</hi> and
in what compariſon; but that the king of France muſt
be little</p>
            <p>Why Charles of Lorraine, canſt thou find any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
that by letters patents ſealed with the Flower
de Luce the title of <hi>Great</hi> was euer attributed to any
forreine kings, nay but contrariwiſe many times haue
the fields flowed with blood for the preſeruation of the
title of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to the kings of France, the firſt, the
ancienteſt and the moſt mighty princes in Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
who doe inioy the crowne of liberty and glory
aboue all other kings, yet now aloud publiquely in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
patents ſealed with the Flower de Luce by thee
falſified, thou calleſt the Spanyard, <hi>the great king,</hi> a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

ſtrike, I ſay ſo great a ſtroke, to extinguiſh the blood
royall, and to ſtepe into their place, it is requiſite to haue
great ſupport and a woonderfull plauſible pretence:
this fortereſſe is not to be aſſaulted with weake bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
conſidering that in ſuch actions the leſt errors are
ſo perilous. The ſupport hath bene the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
the ancient enemie to France, and one who by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
purpoſeth to become Monarck ouer all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andome.
The onely pretence any way to be taken,
was for religion, all others being farre to weake. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ground haue they long ſince hired thoſe whoſe
tounges haue bene ſaleable in the pulpits dedicated to

deuotion of the French nation, whom by ſeceret othes
they haue bound to their league. Who alſo in liew of
inſtructing our people in the Catholike religion, are
become trumpets of warre, firebrands of ſedition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors

briefe, who are waxen forein leuine to ſower the dowe

haue too euidently declared this pretence of religion to
be vtterly falſe and of no apparance. This cruell and
horrible murder of their king hauing brought them
into execration with all courageous perſons, now to
couer their ſubtilties vſed in the compaſſing thereof,
they doe in their declarations giue out this impreſſion
to the people, that the kings death was a blow from
heauen. Oh abhominable impiety? Oh mightie king,
whome all the ſubtilties of thy enemies, who abuſing
thy authority and too much lenity were become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of thy beſt townes, could neuer ſtop from inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them in the capitall city of thy realme, where they
found themſelues brought into ſuch extreamity, that
without that knife forged in hell, the had bene already
chaſtized for all their notable treazons, Oh mightie
king, who couldeſt not haue any fuller confeſſion of
the victory, euen at thy enemies hands then the kinde
of thy death, is it poſſible that thy ſubiectes, euen thy
children who yet do ſpeake the french language ſhould
endure this cruell parricide, the like whereof was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſeene, neither any thing ſo deteſtable? which hath
repleniſhed all men with ſorrow and teares, to bee
termed a blow from heauen? O God who neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
puniſhment, ſuffereſt thy holy name to be abuſed in
ſuch and ſo horrible tranſgraſſions, canſt thou permit
<pb facs="tcp:16496:5"/>
the inuention, euen a blow of the diuel who tormenteth
mankind to be attributed vnto thee, and that thou
who art protector of kings ſhouldeſt be proclaimed
their murderer? Suffer not O Lord ſuch blaſphemies,
but with a ſtripe of thy mightie arme, euen a blow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
from heauen, breake the curſed head of theſe
traytors to their king, of theſe bloody paricides who
ſeeke to couer their deteſtable coniuration and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
vnder the vayle of thy holy name.</p>
            <p>What an indignity is this, O ye french nation, that
they, who impudent and ſhameleſſe dare yet, though
falſey, cauſe themſelues to be called as you, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle
the death of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> whome they
intitle <hi>of happy memorie,</hi> a title neuer publickely attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to other but kings, and contrariwiſe wiſh vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
our deceaſed king to haue bene ſuch a one: that
God who is all good, yea the fountaine of all goodnes
hath cauſed the throat of his annointed to be cut, euen
his who vpon his head did beare the chiefe crowne of
all the nations that are baptized in his name. So that
a petty forrein Prince, the vſurper of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
is not onely compared with the king of
France, with the king of the Flower de Luce, but is
alſo magnified by the ſame tongue that blaſphemeth
againſt the memory of our deceaſed king. Yet were
this tongue ſpaniſh in ſound as it is in affection, it
were the more tollerable, but a french tongue to be
polluted with ſuch impure ſpeaches. Oh what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity?
what a ſorrow.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of theſe ſo contrarie ſpeaches is very
apparant. The death of this <hi>Farneſe</hi> who ſigned no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
but <hi>Alexander,</hi> haue giuen a great blow at
<pb facs="tcp:16496:6"/>
the affaires of this warre, as finding no ſucceſſor that
can approch to his reputation, ſo that for want of all
others Don <hi>Philip</hi> hath bene conſtrained to ſet in ſuch
a Captaine as is not otherwiſe knowne but onely that
he hath bene the chiefe executioner of the poore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
by him murdred without reſiſtance, whome alſo
the inhabitants of the country will not receiue as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his extreame cruelty. On the other ſide the <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſardes</hi>
imagined that the death of the late king ſhould
haue brought them to the royalty, and that by their
pollicies they ſhould ſoone diſunite vs each from other,
making vs to beleeue that no man can be a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
vnleſſe he be a ſpanyard or a Lorraine, vnleſſe
he weare the red croſſe or the duble croſſe. They haue
aboue two yeares deteyned the people in Paris vpon
an opinion that there was no maſſe ſaid at <hi>Tours</hi> and
haue drowned thoſe that durſt teſtefy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary. But
ſith all their purpoſes are grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſhood, they
be to be excuſed for the cruell puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by them inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon thoſe that teſtifie the trueth, their capitall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>Many who ſince the death of our late king neuer
liued in this city of <hi>Paris,</hi> may perhaps geue credite to
this declaration by them publiſhed, namely that they
haue labored to bring his Maieſty now raigning into
the boſome of the Church: But we who for theſe foure
yeares haue continually heard their Sermons doe
know the contrary, alſo that they neuer preached vnto
vs any thing ſo much, as that albeit hee ſhould become
as good a Catholike as <hi>S. Lewes</hi> (theſe bee their very
woordes) the Curate of <hi>S. Bennets</hi> ſaide in <hi>S. Mederickes,
<hi>as good a Catholicke as I take him to be,</hi>
               </hi> yet is hee by no
<pb facs="tcp:16496:6"/>
meanes to be receiued, as being a Relaps and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Such as would ſeeme the mildeſt, ſaid. that hee
might be admitted into the Church, but it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
for pennance of his fault, that he ſhould reſigne his
crowne to thoſe that had reclaimed him. That hee
might bee a Catholicke, but no king. Thirty thouſand
perſons not onely haue heard but do daily heare theſe
ſpeeches from the mouthes of <hi>Boucher</hi> and <hi>Comolet</hi> the
Ieſwiſtes, and yet would they faine perſwade the reſt
of all France y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue endeuoured to conuert him.
O ye hipocrites as you are, know you not in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
that you neuer deſired his conuerſion, but his
eſtate, that you care not whether he haue a crowne in
heauen, ſo you may get y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath vpon earth? do
not your conſciences beare you witneſſe that you could
wiſh that tumulteouſly at his returne from ſome war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
exploit, he ſhould enter into our church, to the end
for euer hereafter he might be though an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> vſing
religion as a cloake to play his perſonage in, and ſo
loſe his credit with all Chriſtian people. In your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
doe you not know that of all things in this
world, you muſt feare leaſt in ſome lawfull counſell by
the working of the holy ghoſt, his errors ſhould be laid
open before him? If you ſtand not in wonderfull feare
therof, why do you ſo ſhrinke away? why had you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſee all France on a flame and ſhortly brought into
combuſtion, and ſo many miſerable perſons ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with the intollerable burden of theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
warres, and brought into ſuch pouerty, that
their miſery hath farre ſurmounted the miſery of their
frendes deceaſed? why I ſay had you not rather trie
this remedie which only is proper, and hath bene prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
<pb facs="tcp:16496:7"/>
by the ancient fathers in the cure of ſuch diſeazes.
A remedy often times reiterated for one ſelfe error, for
the truth which is alwaies like it ſelfe in all places, and
at all times, is neuer tyed to one onely counſell: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
that might ſerue not him onely, but all other of
his religion. Why I ſay had you not rather vſe this
gentle and holeſome medecine, then fire and ſworde
whereto mans conſcience is no way ſubiect, weapons
doe neuer breed any conuerts, but rather deniers of
their faith. To bodely vlcers bodely matters, and to the
wounds of the ſpirite, ſpirituall remedies doe agree.
To ſeeke by maine force to plucke vp error in religion,
is to ſeeke to cure the ſoule by the body, nay rather to
kil then to cure: by darkeneſſe to ſhew light, and by
cruelty to teach clemency. If yee liſt to deſtroy error, it
is requiſite you ſhould inſtruct the man, and the way
to inſtruct is in a free counſell to heare his reaſons, and
to let him vnderſtand yours.</p>
            <p>Yet if God by the ſucceſſe of your armies, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to be acceptable in his ſight: If he would
graunt you great aduantages ouer our king, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
hope to force ſo many mightie townes, which do
daily encreaſe and fortefie with the ruine and ſpoyles
of our poore <hi>Paris,</hi> your heat to proſecute your warres
might ſome way be excuſable. But hauing vtterly
loſt a great and notable battaile, euen when yee were
aſſiſted with the power of <hi>Spaine, Germany, Switzerland
Lorraine,</hi> yea &amp; the ſelfe ſame day as it were miraculoſly
hauing alſo loſt a ſecond battaile in <hi>Anuergne.</hi> Againe
this laſt yeare the Duke of <hi>Ioieuſe</hi> one of the principall
pillers of the Spaniſh faction, beeing defeated and
ſlaine in a pitched field with the loſſe of three thouſand
<pb facs="tcp:16496:7"/>
men, either drowned or left dead in the field, among
whome were found all the Capteines of the rebells
throughout the whole country, wherevpon they were
forced to vncoule frier Angell, who in the end ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
like recompence for breaking his vowe ſolemnly
made vnto God, as his brother had for violating his
faith to his king, who had ſo highly cheriſhed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
his ingratefull famely. Likewiſe in the ſame
moneth of October the generall of the armie of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi>
hauing loſt both his owne life and his maſters
armie, who were ouercome by a handfull of men, who
for 10000 accompted the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> for their
head, of whoſe good fortune and aduancement, I
meruel not though the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> his neighbour
maketh ſo many complaints, conſidering that in ſo
ſhort ſpace he hath already defeated him of two ſtrong
townes &amp; cut in peeces the flower of his men of war,
who now might haue ſtood him in ſome ſteed for the
defence of other his ſtrong holds againſt 12000 men,
and 20 canons that doe lay ſore to them. After I ſay
ſo many great loſſes, and all your great townes ſo
ſtraightly beſeeged, what hope can there remaine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
this Alexander of <hi>Parma</hi> being no longer a
worlds man? True it is that hereafter we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
haue ſome ſuccour from the <hi>Sauoyan,</hi> who
will bring his great forces to aſſiſt his cunning to bee
crowned in our citie of <hi>Paris:</hi> for he hath maryed one
of the daughters of <hi>Spaine:</hi> and ſith that by the aduice
of the Doctors of <hi>Millan,</hi> the Salicke law ought to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,
he hath no doubt a part in the ſucceſſion: for at
<hi>Paris</hi> there is no prerogatiue of Elderſhip amonge the
daughters, and therefore the towne may well enough
<pb facs="tcp:16496:8"/>
be deuided. Let the eldeſt choſe either the Loure or the
Pallace, the one ſhall hold for <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the other for <hi>Spaine.</hi>
But I doubt he hath other matters to thinke vppon,
he ſeeth already the french ancients ſo forward toward
the mideſt of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> that thirty thouſand canon ſhot
will hardly roote them out, and yet before he come to
that, he muſt winne the field againſt thoſe that haue
profered him battaile any time theſe ſix monethes,
whome he dare not encounter in the plaine field with
al his owne power and the power of his father in law.
This is a very <hi>Scipios</hi> policie. Our king hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the warre to be tranſported into <hi>Affrica,</hi> and the
firebrand thereof into the dominions of the Spanyard
and of his ſonne in law, who already intituled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
Earle of <hi>Prouence,</hi> from whence he hath found one
of the heires of <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> &amp; of the valeant <hi>Nogaret,</hi>
that ſhall not onely expell him but alſo proceed further,
&amp; euidently giue him notice of the old prouerbe which
ſaith. That <hi>France</hi> was neuer ſo weake but a man
might ſtill find ſome cauſe of earneſt fight, and that
either ſoone or late ſhe will giue him to wit that it is
dangerous dealing with her.</p>
            <p>Oh Ingratefull <hi>Sauoyan,</hi> among all earthly people
the moſt vnthankfull. <hi>France</hi> reſtored to thy mother,
that which with the ſwordes point and vppon good
cauſe ſhe had taken from thy grandfather, and thou in
liew of acknowledging this magnificence, and in all
manner of good duety, reuerencing the maieſtie of the
french empire, doſt by notable treaſons endeuour to
rent and diſmember the ſame, ſtill conſpiring with
her Capitall enemies. Remember that I doe progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate
vnto thee, that a Spaniſh wife ſhall procure to
<pb facs="tcp:16496:8"/>
thee the loſſe of that which a French wife brought to
thy father, nothing can defend thee. All the cunning
ſpeech of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> together with the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
of all the ſeditious libells and orations, ſpued out
againſt our kings, &amp; by theſe pentioners of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
vnder the title of a declaration, can no whit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
with this valeant nobility, whoſe eares and harts
are ſtopped againſt ſuch Mermaids as ſeeke to plonge
them in the goulfe of all miſery. All theſe latter poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
they take as aſſured arguments that the ſtrength
of this deteſtable conſpiracy draweth to decay. Your
ſelues doe now know that this buſy and ſeditious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty
is not able to vanquiſh the French nobility,
cannot beare the firſt puſh of their horſes, neither may
any way abide the glims of their gliſtering armour.
What will yee then doe, ſeeke ſome meanes by faire
words to deuide theſe gallant ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlemen among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and in a pitcht field procure them to cut each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
throats. Oh what a happy day would that be
vnto you, wherein there ſhould be neuer a blow ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in vaine: where the loſſe either of the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhould be an equall gaine, and like aduancement
of your drifts, which can haue no ſucceſſe ſo long as
there be any gentlemen in <hi>France.</hi> They are borne to
liberty, to glory: They can brooke no forrein dominion
or commandement. Any ſpeeches of the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
of the <hi>Sauoyan,</hi> or of the <hi>Lorraines,</hi> they cannot heare but
that needes they muſt enter into choller, into indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
into threats, yea and into armes to the end to
exalt the name and honour of <hi>France</hi> aboue all things
in the world. They ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abide to heare any king but
their owne, intituled the great king, without ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
<pb facs="tcp:16496:9"/>
of thoſe that dare giue out ſuch ſeruile, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
and baſe ſpeeches. They are not acquainted
with this tytle Vniuerſall king, in whatſoeuer lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
it be diſguized: They knowe not that ould ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
otherwiſe then by the name of kinge of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
which no man dare now pronounce in their preſence
for feare leaſt at that onely worde they ſhould call to
mind that it is the name of their capitall enemie, the
ſworne enemie to their fathers, the ſame who wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deteyneth from <hi>France</hi> the one halfe of her prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
who procured the death of his owne ſonne, and
of his wife the daughter of king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and
ſince holpe forward the deathes of his two brother in
lawes, the late <hi>Monſieur</hi> and our laſt king. Likewiſe
to the end yee may the better know him, he was ſon
to <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, the poyſoner of the french <hi>Dolphine:</hi>
who by treaſons ſtole y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt riches of this realme:
who layd the foundations of his tiranny on the citie of
<hi>Rome</hi> which his ſonne hath ſince perfectly eſtabliſhed &amp;
layd faſt, purchaſing with coyne the voyce of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie
and ſo bringing into the holy ſea his nurcelings
and pentioners, according to the degrees of their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Spayne.</hi> Doe you then meruell that their bulles
forged in <hi>Madrlt</hi> which tooke only their edge at <hi>Rome,</hi>
wherwith they indeuor to make <hi>France</hi> through her
diuiſion, tributarie to them, haue beene condemned by
this imperial and ſacred Senate of our king. A ſenate
gouerned by a <hi>Cato,</hi> repleniſhed with <hi>Phocions,</hi> and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
accuſtomed to reuenge the iniuries of the crowne.</p>
            <p>The french nobility hath ſent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Marquize</hi> of <hi>Pizani,</hi> to
be aſſured of the truth. If it appeare that <hi>Rome</hi> is as
ſurely tyed to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> as <hi>Siuill,</hi> and that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
<pb facs="tcp:16496:9"/>
can not be well enterteyned, they will well
enough prouide remedies neceſſarie. This is not the
firſt time that the holy ſea hath beene tranſferred to
this ſide of the mountes, albeit I be very well aſſured
there ſhall be no ſuch neceſſitie: For the French ſworde
is ſtrong enough yet once againe to deliuer Rome out
of the hands of this <hi>Gothik</hi> and <hi>Sarrazin</hi> ſtocke. Neither
doe we beleeue that all that is beyond the Alpes doth
loue this vniuerſal king, but that contrariwiſe the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
that their ſight is naturally, the more they doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the effectes of his inſupportable dominion and
the execution of the hereditarie purpoſes of his father
<hi>Charles.</hi> This French Cath. Nobilitie is of force ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to preſerue both the Eſtate and their Religion, neither
neede they the helpe of theſe ſoueraignes of Spaine, of

Lordes and Gentlemen were no longer Catholickes,
becauſe they would not ſtoope to the commandements
of this great Catholicke king, and the letters patents

but one onely Gentleman, whoſe name will remaine
infamous among all poſteritie, vnleſſe by ſome notable
ſeruice he waſh away ſo ſhamefull a blot of treaſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
immediatly after the ſlaughter of his king, his
good maiſter and one who had ſo highly fauored him.
Is it poſſible, <hi>Vitry</hi> that the tall, pale, and fearefull i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of this great king, ſhould not continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in thy ſight or follow thee whereſoeuer thou
goeſt? doeſt thou not ſee him with one hand houlding
his bloudie wound, and with the other the red gore
knife, continually following thee to be reuendged of
thy notable trecherie? Is it poſſible that thou canſt
without tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling and ſighing heare him with a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
voyce obiect vnto thee thy treſpas in theſe wordes?
Oh traitor, while I liued thou diddeſt honor me, but
the next day after my death thou haſt worſhipped my
murderers: thou haſt bowed thy knee in thoſe places
where they deified that monſter more cruell then the
Tygers: thou haſt accompanied thoſe that triumphed
and publickly reioyced in my death? yet doe I more
maruell how our Lieutenant general of the Spaniſh
crowne in France, who ſeeth that in liew of ſo many
Gentlemen that haue habandoned his rebellion and
<pb facs="tcp:16496:11"/>
ranged them ſelues vnder the flower de Luce, he could
not winne paſt two or three in foure yeares, how I ſay
he is now perſwaded that he may deuide the Princes
of the bloud of France, and draw them to his partie. O
ambitious Lorraine, haſt thou dared to thincke that
thou ſhouldeſt haue ſuch ſubiectes to ſtoope to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes,
or to obey to thy letters patentes, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
they muſt, if they had taken thy ſide? or wilt
thou habandon to them thy Lieutenancie, and ſubmit
thy ſelfe vnder the lawes and Magiſtrats, ouer whom
thou now doeſt ſo proudly commaund in thoſe townes
whcih thy tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie doth poſſeſſe? If thou wilt why haſt
thou not ſpoken the word? why haſt thou not ſaid that
thou wert ready to lay away all thy power and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
them aboue thy ſelfe, and aboue all thy ſtocke of
Lorraine? Thou haſt bene warie inough for proceeding
ſo farre, not that thou art not aſſured that they all are
too magnanimous &amp; too vertuous Princes to League
them ſelues with thoſe that are yet beſprinckeled with
the bloud of the ſlaughter of the eldeſt of their familie
Royall, who loued them as his children: whoſe cruell
and barbarous death all lawes of God and man doe
binde them to reuendge, ſo long as their valiant ſoules
ſhall be encloſed within their bodies: but by ſuch offers,
though fained, thou diddeſt feare to prouoke the ould
tyraunt of Spaine, who abhorreth the whole name of
Bourbon. And indeede what apparance is there of
diuiſion among perſons ſo well vnited? you Lorrains
haue long time directed the heades of your ſpeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the whole race of Bourbon, and with fire and
ſword doe proſecute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rooting out of their familie Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
When fortune moſt ſmiled vpon you &amp; that you ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:16496:12"/>
to be vpon the higheſt ſteppe to climbe to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
then did they togither reſiſt you: And now that
all true Frenchmen vpon the opening of their eyes doe

               </gap>tes with ſuch dexteritie
conducted that whereas your grandfather came into
France weake in goodes, poore in honor, naked in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
who in the yeare 1522. following the warres
in Picardie vnder the Duke of <hi>Vandoſme</hi> commanded
onely ouer one companie of men of armes, you in our
adge finde your ſelues among you ſeazed of the moſt
important gouernments of this Eſtate, yea and had it
not bene for the 23. of December 1588. had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the rule of all France, vnder the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of your maiſter the king of Spaine. Now I ſay
that euery one that is of any calling or courage tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
this Realme, is gathered to his Maieſtie to
chaſtiſe your ambition, the cauſe of ſo many miſeries,
what ground can ye take, to imagine that the Princes
of the bloud ſhould deuide them ſelues, and purchaſe
the ruine and death each of other, to the end to leaue
their roome to the vpſtartes of Lorraine? Well if you
cannot thruſt in the ſpirite of diuiſion into Bourbon,
yet at the leaſt ye will draw vnto you thoſe mighty me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who within theſe foure yeares, haue ſo often put you ſo
ſhamefully to flight. I thincke the Duke of Aumale
looketh by meanes of this declaration, that this braue
and couragious Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gueuille, who with leſſe then 1200.
Frenchmen, who ſtanding not vpon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vpon their valour in a pitcht field, ouerthrew him and
all his armie conſiſting of 8000. men and 10. canons
and purſued him euen to S. Denis, ſhall one of theſe
dayes ſend to offer him his ſeruice, deſiring pardon for
<pb facs="tcp:16496:12"/>
his former faultes and craue to be reconciled with his
high and mightie coſin, Lieutenant generall to this
great king the Monarcke of Spaine, France and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie.
Oh miſerable Leaguers, into what frenſie are
ye entred, when ye thinke with your goodly figures of
Rhetoricke to perſwade thoſe, who in one moneth doe
heare more Maſſes then you do in a yeare: who vnder
the kings auctoritie next to the Princes of his bloud
are the very pillers of the ſtate and of our Religion: to
perſwade them I ſay, that they all are heretickes, and
that none but you onely, who are conſpired with theſe
new Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as yet for the moſt part in hart Iewes
and Sarazins, are true Catholiques: to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may yeeld themſelues bound into your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
ſo that without labour ye may in ſhort time roote out
all theſe great and noble houſes, all theſe families fatal
for expulſion of ſtrangers out of France. No, no, if your
Spaniſh remembrances import no other matter, I do
well ſee that this ould dotard is at an end with all his
ſleights, ſith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to ſubdue France to him ſelfe he craueth
the helpe of the French Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one ſelfe banner ſeamed of Flower de Luces, haue
ſo often chaſed his Spaniſh troupes, and who as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of one belly, crowned with like garlands atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in ſo many battailes, ſhall for euer be vnited to
maintaine their liberties, franchiſes and preeminences,
which with ſuch woundes and ſo many hazards their
predeceſſors haue left vnto them inſeperably conioyned
with the preſeruation of the crowne vpon the head of
the lawfull heire.</p>
            <p>Courage therfore oh Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the victory is yours,
<hi>Parma</hi> is dead, <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> and all his power are layd along,

            <p>Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the publicke treaſure be employed to this

Frenchmen, ſet their hands earneſtly to this worke, ſo
excellent, &amp; ſo neceſſarie for the reeſtabliſhment of this
