            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This labour of mine was thought to be very expedient for these times, and not before enterprised by any, that men not learned, might in one volume finde all the controuersies of religion, which their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure would not suffer them to collect them selues. Many of our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned countrimen haue in some choise &amp; principal controuersies, as the Lords valiant champions, maintained the truth strongly against the common aduersarie: but this small labour, as it pleased the Lord, was left for me: they haue borne the heate of the day, the coole euenings worke is cast vpon me. They haue built with hewen stones,<note place="margin">Isa. 9.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> the brick-worke is my lot; they haue squared the tall cedar trees, the wilde figge trees must be hewen out by my hand.</p>
            <p>This simple worke I haue presumed to present to your Maiestie, as a token of my dutie and seruice, a poore scholers gift, as a signe of my thankfulnes to God and your Maiestie, by whom we haue both lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and maintenance to follow our studies: for as the Poet saith, <hi>Deus

And I was emboldened the rather to offer this simple labor to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, remembring your Princely &amp; gracious disposition, which hath bene wont to accept with great fauour and regard, the meanest gifts of your subiects, yea hath not refused to receiue posies and nosegaies at their hands: With the same Princely countenance, I beseech your grace to receiue this posie of mine,<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 2093.</note> 
               <hi>Non florum, sed foliorum.</hi> A prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minde your Highnesse knoweth, is as well seene in accepting of small giftes, as giuing of great: as <hi>Alexander</hi> said to a souldier, vpon whom he bestowed a citie: <hi>Si tu non es dignus tanta recipere, ego ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men dignus tanta donare:</hi> so the speech somewhat altered, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth I heare your Maiestie thus saying to me: <hi>Licet non tu dignus tantula donare, ego tamen digna tantula accipere:</hi> though it be not fit for thee to offer so small a gift, yet it standeth with my Princely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to receiue it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Christian Reader, thinke not the time long, nor the labour lost, if I shall in a few words open my mind further vnto thee: and as leading thee by the hand, shew thee the way &amp; entrance into this treatise following. We are not ignorant how this famous Church of England the mother of vs all, hath been these many yeeres molested and troubled with hollow hearted brethren, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of corrupt doctrine, deuisers of mischiefe, enemies to our peace, and in one word, Romish Catholikes and Papists. They haue been from time to time, as prickes to our sides, and thornes in our eyes,<note place="margin">Canticl. 2.15. Math. 3.</note> as the Cananites were to Israel: they are the Foxes that destroy the Lords vineyard, the progenie of the Pharisees, a generation of vipers, whose propertie is to gnaw out the sides of their damme when they are brought forth: euen so haue these vipers sought the destruction of their countrey. They are the serpent by the way, that byteth the horse heeles, &amp; causeth the rider to fall backward: that is,<note place="margin">Gene. 49.17. Ezech. 39.18.</note> subtilly do vndermine and hinder the prosperous successe of religion. Of such prophecied Ezechiel, They do eate the good pasture, and tread downe the rest with their feete: they haue drunke of the deepe waters, &amp; troubled the residue with their feet. They are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to eate the fat, &amp; drinke the sweet of the land, but some of them haue laboured &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to disturbe our peace, and to trouble the quiet state of the land. But let not vs (good bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) be offended at these things. First let vs not be astonished, as though some strange thing had befallen vs:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.19.</note> for S. Paul hath said, That heresies must be among vs, that they which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued may be knowne: in time of persecution <hi>exercebant patientiam Ecclesiae,</hi> they did proue the patience of the Church: but now as Augustine saith, <hi>exercent sapientiam,</hi> they doe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the wisedome of the Church. Let not the number and multitude offend vs of those, which doe band themselues against the Church: for so it must be, Christs flocke is but a little flocke. Let vs not be afrayd of their wisedome,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.32.</note> power or strength: the scripture teacheth vs, that they in their generation are wiser then the children of light: yet the Lord our God, that is with vs, and fighteth for vs, is wiser and stronger then they. Let them not deceiue vs with a shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.14. 1. Pet. 4.15. In Psalm. 34.

Peter saith, That men may suffer as euill doers, and so doe these. And S. Augustine saith, <hi>Si poenae martyres faceret, omnes carceres martyribus pleni essent, omnes catenae martyres traherent:</hi> If the punishment onely, and not the cause made Martyrs, al prisons should be full of Martyrs, and all that are bound with fetters and chaines should be Martyrs. But let vs (not stumbling at any of these stones) be constant in the faith, and go forward in the profession of the Gospel, which is grounded vpon the Scripture, sealed with the blood of Martyrs, waited and attended vpon these many yeeres, as the mistresse with the handmaid, with peace, prosperitie, and abundance of all blessings. With them there is no peace to be had:<note place="margin">Bellarm. de laicis. lib. 3. cap. 19. Deut. 22.10</note> their owne Doctors teach, that no reconciliation can be made betweene vs: And indeed so it is, for there is no fellowship betweene light and darknesse. The Israelites were commanded, not to sow their ground with diuers seedes, nor to plough with an oxe &amp; an asse. What is this els, but that the Church of God cannot consist of beleeuers &amp; Idolaters of true Christians and hypocrites, Catholikes and Heretikes, Protestants and Papists? Their seede and ours is diuers: they sow the doctrine of men, and humane traditions: we sow the seede of Gods word. The oxe is onely fit for the Lords plough, that chaweth the cud, and deuideth the hoofe, the asse doth neither: Who is he that deuideth the hoofe, &amp; chaweth the cud <hi>Augustine</hi> telleth vs,<note place="margin">Homil. 35.</note>

There is no agreement therefore to be looked for at their hands: no more then yron or clay can be tempred together: Their old vessels cannot receiue the new liquor of the Gospell: but they must first become new themselues: they must first put off their beggerly ragges of Popish ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and superstitions, or els they shall neuer put on Christ: And to be short, <hi>Reuertantur illi ad te, ne tu reuertaris ad illos:</hi> Let them returne vnto vs, we will not returne to them, as the Lord saith to <hi>Ieremie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest now we should be thought to speake without booke, deepely charging our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with heresie, lyes, false doctrine, and prouing nothing: we will take some paynes of set downe some principall opinions of the Papists, which haue in the purer ages of the Church been condemned for heresies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcellina</hi> the companion of <hi>Carpocrates</hi> the archheretike, worshipped the Images of Iesus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and Paul, and offered incense vnto them, <hi>August. heres.</hi> 7. So the Papists do worship the Images of Saints, and in the second Nicene Councel it was decreed, that the Image of God should be worshipped with the same honour that God himselfe was.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heracleonites</hi> did anoynt their sicke which lay a dying, with oyle and balme, <hi>Heres.</hi> 16.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> So the Papists haue found out extreme vnction and made it a Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caians</hi> did hold, that the sinne of <hi>Iudas</hi> in betraying Christ, was a benefite to mankind,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>Heres.</hi> 18. The Papists come somewhat neere: One of them affirmeth, that the Iewes had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mortallie, if they had not crucified Christ: <hi>Ex Iuell. defens. Apolog. p.</hi> 676.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pepuzians</hi> iudged heretikes, because they permitted women to be Priests, <hi>Heres.</hi> 27.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> So it was decreed in the Florentine Councel among the Papists, that in the case of necessitie, not only a lay man, but an heretike, pagan, and a woman to, may baptize.</p>
            <p>The heretikes called <hi>Angelici</hi> were condemned, because they worshipped Angels, <hi>Heres.</hi> 39.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> So the <hi>Rhemists</hi> teach, that Angels may be worshipped, <hi>Annot. in Apocal.</hi> 3 <hi>sect.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>There was a sect of heretikes that walked with bare feete, because God sayd to <hi>Moses,</hi> put off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> thy shooes, &amp;c. <hi>Heres.</hi> 68. And so are there of Friers that goe barefoote, as the Friers Flagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, and Franciscanes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Priscillianists</hi> did make the Apocrypha, that is, bookes not Canonicall of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> with Scripture, <hi>Heres.</hi> 70. So doe the Papists, the bookes of <hi>Tobie, Iudith, Machabees,</hi> and others, which are not found in the Canon of the Hebrue, they make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bookes of Canonical Scripture, and part of the word of God: yea, they say, that whatsoeuer the Pastors of the Church doe teach beside Scripture in the vnitie of the Church, is to be taken for the word of God, <hi>Rhemist. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Thessal. cap.</hi> 2 <hi>sect.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>An Archheretike called <hi>Marcus,</hi> did hold that Christ did not verily suffer and indeed, but in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> shew onely and appearance, <hi>Heres.</hi> 14 The <hi>Appollinarists</hi> also affirmed, that Christ tooke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane flesh without a soule, <hi>Heres.</hi> 55. I pray you, how farre are the Papists from these heresies? for they affirme that Christ suffered not in soule: Nay the <hi>Rhemists</hi> hold, that it is a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous assertion so to say, <hi>Annot. Hebr.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7. What is this els, but either with <hi>Marcus</hi> to say, that Christ suffered but in shewe, and that he felt nothing in soule, when he cryed out vpon the Crosse, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? for if there were no such matter indeed, Christ must haue vttered those words only in outward shew and pretense. Againe, they cannot shift off handsomely from them the <hi>Appollinarists</hi> heresie: for why did Christ take vpon him our flesh and soule, but to redeeme man, that was lost both in bodie and soule? and therefore he must needes haue suffered both in bodie and soule: for if there were no vse of the humane soule in the worke of our redemption,<note place="margin">Cont. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lician. cap. 13.</note> you might as wel say with the <hi>Appollinarists</hi> that Christ had no soule at all. Thus <hi>Augustine</hi> reasoneth: <hi>Si totus homo perijt, totus beneficio saluatoris in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diguit, sitotut beneficio saluatoris indigebat, totum Christus veniendo saluabit:</hi> If the whole man
<pb facs="tcp:20636:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both in bodie and soule were lost, he wholly had need of a Sauiour: and if he wholly needed a Sauiour; Christ by his comming did wholly saue him. <hi>Ergo</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it followeth that Christ must whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue died &amp; suffred in bodie &amp; soule to redeeme man, that was wholly lost in bodie &amp; soule.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> The <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> did imagine, that God was in shape and proportion like a man, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> 50.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> The <hi>Pelagian</hi> heretikes did hold three pernicious opinions. First, that a man may be perfect in this life, and keepe all the Commandements, <hi>Heres.</hi> 88. So the <hi>Rhemists</hi> say, it is possible to keepe all the precepts of the law, <hi>Annot.

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>4. <hi>sect.</hi> 1. Secondly, the <hi>Pelagians</hi> say, that grace is giuen vnto men onely to this end, that they may more easily doe those things which they are commanded to doe by their owne free will, <hi>Heres.</hi> 88. So the <hi>Rhemists</hi> say, that man was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without free will, but hauing the grace of Christ, it is truely made free, <hi>Annot. Ioan.</hi> 8. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. What is this els, but that his free will is made more free, and that grace helpeth him not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to worke, but more easily onely? Thirdly, the <hi>Pelagians</hi> hold, <hi>Gratiam Dei non ad singulos actus dari:</hi> That the grace of God is not needfull to be giuen at euery assay, but that their free will in most things is sufficient, <hi>August. Epist.</hi> 106. So the <hi>Rhemists</hi> say, that though the Gentiles beleeued specially by Gods grace, yet they beleeued also of their owne free will, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. What say they els, but that a man may beleeue by his owne free will without grace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Manichees</hi> condemned the eating of flesh, as being vncleane and impure, <hi>Heres.</hi> 46. So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> the Papists also forbid at certaine times the eating of flesh: And herein they perhaps differ from the <hi>Manichees:</hi> They held that flesh was vncleane by creation. The Papists by reason of the curse: for God cursed the earth, and not the waters (say they) and therefore vpon fasting daies fish is preferred before flesh, <hi>Durand. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>capit. de alijs ieiunijs.</hi> So they both agree in this, that flesh is a thing impure and vncleane: for if they had not so thought, why did not that popish Bishop of London <hi>Stokeslie,</hi> rather suffer the pigge to be eaten, which was found in one <hi>Frebarnes</hi> house in Lent time,<note place="margin">Frebarn. Fox. pag. 1585.</note> his wife being great with child longing for a peece thereof, then command it, as an vncleane thing to be buried in Finsburie fields, and so the good creature of God to be spoyled and lost?</p>
            <p>There was also another most blasphemous opinion of the <hi>Manichees:</hi> for they held that the parts and members of Christ were dispersed euery where, and that in their meates &amp; drinkes, they did deliuer the members of Christ, which were tyed and bound in the creatures. <hi>Tales</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unt electi eorum. vt non sint saluandi à Deo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. in Psal. 104.</note> 
               <hi>sed saluatores Dei, liberant enim membra Christi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cum manducant:</hi> The elect amongst them for so they call their principals) do make themselues the sauiours and redeemers of God, for they doe set at libertie (as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) the members of Christ, he is not their sauiour. Compare now the opinion of the Papists with these heretikes: see if they be not cosin germanes: for as they made themselues, <hi>saluato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Christi,</hi> sauiours of Christ: so is it a saying amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Papists, that <hi>Sacerdos est creator create<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris sui:</hi> the Priest at Masse, which by fiue words speaking maketh the body of Christ, is a maker, say they, of his maker, a creator of his creator, <hi>Ex Iuell. lib. artic. p.</hi> 615. But herein the Papists go beyond the <hi>Manichees:</hi> for they deliuered the bodie &amp; members of Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prison of the creatures, and sent them vp to heauen: the Papists bring them downe from heauen, and close them in the creature, vnder the shape of bread and wine.</p>
            <p>Thus farre we thought good to shew, how neere the Papists come to the heretikes of olde time: that it might appeare to the world, that we doe not vniustly charge them with heresie, and that we haue good cause to shunne and abhorre their poysoned doctrine. Many other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies I could haue produced; which are reuiued by our aduersaries, &amp; raked againe as it were out of their graues, where they did quietly rest. But that I am not of purpose now to deale in
<pb facs="tcp:20636:6"/>
this matter: which may in a seuerall Treatise (God willing) hereafter as time and opportunitie shall serue, be handled more at large.</p>
            <p>I haue onely by the way giuen a tast of the bitter and sower doctrine of Poperie: that our countrymen, which haue been any thing that way infected, may take warning, that if they haue sipped of the whore of Babylons cup of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they should leaue of, before they haue drunke more deepely, lest they in the end be constrained, to draw out the very dregges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to be drunken with their intoxicate cup. If they will in time be warned, they may: a word to a wise man is sufficient: and if they be wise, they will also take heed in time, I say vnto them as <hi>Augustine</hi> did sometime to the Donatists: <hi>Si sapitis, bene &amp; rectè, si autem non sapitis, nos vestri curam gessisse non poenitebit, quia et si cor vestrum ad pacem non conuertitur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cont. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilianum. 3.59.</note> 
               <hi>pax nostra tamen ad nos reuertitur:</hi> If you will be learned it is well, and as we wish: but if you will not, it repenteth vs not, that we haue had some care of you: for although your hart be not conuerted to the peace of the Gospell, yet our peace returneth to vs againe.</p>
            <p>Here by the way, I must remember my selfe of one thing, which I had almost ouerslipped. Euery where both in this Preface and in this whole booke, speaking of our aduersaries, I call them Papists, as we are knowne by the name of Protestants: I suppose our English Romanists will take no offence or griefe hereby so to be called: although I haue heard, that some of them hold great scorne to be named Papists, yet I see no reason, why they should so doe. The Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists like this name well enough, because it is not deriued from any one man,<note place="margin">Anno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Act. 11. sect. 4.</note> but from their Popes and chiefe Bishops, to whom (say they) we are bound to cleaue in Religion, and obey in all things: So to be a Papist (say they) is to be a Christian man, a child of the Church, and a subiect to Christs Vicar. Seeing then this name pleaseth their ghostly fathers of Rhemes so well, there is no reason why they should mislike it: and therefore we will vse it still, as best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing their profession, who are pinned vpon the Popes sleeue for their faith and Religion: As likewise the name of Protestants we refuse not: which name I thinke tooke beginning in England in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eights daies: when there was a generall protestation made in the name of the King, the whole Councel and Clergie of England against the Pope:<note place="margin">See Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan. Fox pag. 1083.</note> In the which protestation, thus we finde: England hath taken her leaue of popish crafts for euer, neuer to be deluded with them hereafter: Romane Bishops haue nothing to doe with English people: the one doth not traffique with the other: at the least, though they will haue to deale with vs, we will none of their marchandise, none of their stuffe. Thus we see how a Papist and a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant are defined: A Papist is he that cleaueth to the Pope in Religion, and is obedient to him in all things: A Protestant is he, that professeth the Gospell of Iesus Christ, and hath renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the iurisdiction of the sea of Rome, and the forced and vnnaturall obedience to the Pope. These names therefore as best fitting both our professions, seeing no cause to the contrary, I purpose euery where to vse and retaine throughout this Treatise.</p>
            <p>I would here finish and make an end of this Preface, but that first I must make the Reader acquainted, with the order and methode, which I haue followed in setting downe the controuersies: The whole bodie therefore of the controuersies betweene the Papists and vs, our worthie and learned countriman <hi>D. Whitakers</hi> hath digested and disposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a singular Methode, the which I haue propounded to my selfe throughout this discourse to obserue.</p>
            <p>The heresies and errours therefore of Poperie, doe either impugne the offices of Christ, with his benefites and merites, or his person: the most of them are of the first kinde, some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours they maintaine against his person, but not many.</p>
            <p>First, the name of Christ sheweth his offices: for it signifieth annointed: he was annointed to be our Prophet, King and Priest: Iesus betokeneth a Sauiour, and setteth forth the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of our redemption and saluation. First then of his offices, and then of the benefites, that do arise and spring thereof.</p>
            <p>The first office of our Sauiour Christ, is to be our heauenly teacher and Prophet. His hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly doctrine is conteined no where els but in the Scriptures. The first generall contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie then must be of the Scriptures: where there arise many questions: as of the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb facs="tcp:20636:7"/>
bookes of the Scripture, of the vulgare translation of Scripture, of the perspicuitie, and plainenesse, authoritie, interpretation and perfection of Scripture, with such other.</p>
            <p>The second office of Christ is to be our King: and because his kingdome is his Church: here we are to handle the controuersies about the Church: Which is either the Church Militant vpon earth, or the Church Triumphant in heauen.</p>
            <p>The Church militant is to be considered, either in generall, where these questions are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, what the Church is, whether it be visible or not, by what markes it is knowen, whether it may erre, what authoritie it hath. Then the parts of the Church, which are either assembled and gathered together, as in generall Councels: where these doubts must be discussed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generall Councels be necessary, by whom they ought to be summoned, whether they can erre, whether the Pope be aboue Councels or not, and such like. Or els the parts of the church are seuerally to be considered, and they are of three sortes, either the chiefe parts, the middle and meane parts, the lowest and basest parts of the Church: The chiefe member they make to be the Pope: where there are many questions and of great waight, as whether the regiment of the Church be Monarchicall, whether <hi>Peter</hi> were appointed head of the Church, whether the Pope be <hi>Peters</hi> successour, whether he may erre, whether the Pope be Antichrist, with such other. The middle parts, are their Clerkes, which are either secular, as they call them, which haue any Ecclesiasticall function, where we must enquire of their election &amp; degrees of their single life, and such like, the Regular Clerkes are their Monkes, and other of that profession, where we must entreat, of vowes, of their solitarie life, their habite, their Canonicall houres, with other matters. The lowest members are the lay men: where the questions about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magistrate must be handled: as whether he may put heretikes to death, whether he haue any power and authoritie in Ecclesiasticall matters, and hetherto of the Militant Church.</p>
            <p>The triumphant Church consisteth either of Angels, or other Saints departed: Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Angels, we dissent about the orders and degrees of them, about their ministerie and office, and whether they are to be prayed vnto.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Saints departed, there are many questions in controuersie, as of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lymbus Patrum, whether they are to be praied vnto, of their Reliques, Images, Temples, Holie daies, and such like.</p>
            <p>The third office of Christ is his Priesthood, whereof there are two parts, his intercession, where we must enquire, whether Christ be the onely Mediatour of intercession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, where the maine and great controuersie concerning the Sacraments doth offer it selfe: for by the Sacraments the power and efficacie of the death of Christ is deriued vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Here first we must entreate of the Sacraments in generall, as of their number, their effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the difference betweene the Sacraments of the olde and new Testament: then in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as of Baptisme, and the seuerall questions thereto belonging, of the Lords Supper, where also the great controuersie about their Idolatrous sacrifice of the Masse, and other necessary questions must be handled. Then follow in order fiue other popish Sacraments to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, confirmation, penaunce, extreme vnction, orders, matrimony. And these are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies concerning the offices of Christ.</p>
            <p>The controuersies which concerne the benefits of our redemption, with other seuerall questions, are these, as of predestination, of sin, of the law, of free will, of faith, of good workes, the particular questions are set forth at large in other places.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there remaine some questions, about the person of Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whether he be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, God of himselfe, whether he encreased in wisedome, whether he suffered in soule, whether he merited for himselfe, with such other.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we the summe &amp; body of Antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine, which we purpose by the grace of God to goe through, beginning at the first, and so prosecuting euery particular questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, till we are come to the last. My purpose is not to set down all the heresies, which impugne the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, but onely those which are maintained by the Church of Rome this day; who are the chief troublers &amp; disquieters of the peace of our Church: I say therefore with <hi>Augustine, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Christianus Catholicus ista no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debes credere, sed no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omnis, qui ista no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> credit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequenter se debet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianum

                  </gap>utare vel dicere.</hi> Euery true Catholike Christian is bound not to beleeue any of these errors set down in this book: but it foloweth not, that whosoeuer beleeueth not these, is a true Catholike: for there are other heresies in the world, which destroy the faith, as the heresies of the Anabaptistes, Familie of Loue, Libertines, and such like. But our speciall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and drift is, to weed out the Popish cockle and darnell, that troubleth our field. Neither haue I set forth at large the controuersies betweene vs: for that laborious worke other of our learned countrymen haue taken in hand, as <hi>D. Whitakers</hi> in Cambridge, <hi>D. Reynoldes</hi> in Oxford, and besides, it farre exceedeth my strength and habilitie: I haue onely brieflie set downe the grounds of Poperie, as I haue collected them out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the stoutest champion of their side, our English Rhemistes, <hi>Eckius, Canisius,</hi> and other Papistes, as also out of the late Chapter of Trent, for it deserueth not the name of a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell. And with all as an Antidotum or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyson, I haue opposed and set against them, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of the Protestants and Church of God: with reasons and Arguments of both sides, and places of Scripture annexed: adding also throughout the iudgement of <hi>Augustine,</hi> who of all the fathers, is most plentifull in these matters, which fall in question in our dayes.</p>
            <p>The benefite, which the Christian Reader shall reape in some measure (I trust) by this sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple labour of mine, is threefold. First the knowledge of all Popish errours, which much auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: <hi>Multum adiuuat cor fidele nosce, quid credendum non sit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. de heresib. epilog.</note> 
               <hi>etiamsi disputandi facultate id refutare non possit:</hi> It much helpeth a Christian toward beleefe, to know what is not to be beleeued, though he can not refell it by Argument. Secondlie he shall vnderstand both their principall Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which they do entangle simple men withall, as also he shall learne how to defend and maintayne the truth. Thirdly the chief places of Scripture, which make for them or against them, are briefly euery where expounded and opened.</p>
            <p>This whole worke I haue deuided into three partes or bookes: the first conteineth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of the Scriptures and the Militant Church: the second the controuersies of the Triumphant Church: and of the Sacraments: the third the questions, concerning the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of our redemption, and as touching the person of Christ: Which bookes I haue thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, not so much in respect of the matter which they conteine: for then the controuersies of the Militant and Triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phant Church ought not to haue bene sundred: but that there might be some equalitie &amp; indifferent proportion in the Volumes, euery one of them comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Centurie that is an hundred of Popish errours either vnder or ouer.</p>
            <p>But the rather I haue so done, because I had proceeded no further, then to the end of the controuersies of the Militant Church when this first booke went out of my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: the which I was moued vpon some occasion to publish, before the rest were finished, which shall not stay long after, God assisting me. Wherein I doe also folow the counsell and example of <hi>Augustine,</hi> who writing of the like argument of heresies, doth thus conclude his booke: <hi>Hunc librum,</hi>

                     <p>WE haue not any thing in this place to deale with those heretikes, which denie either the whole Scripture, or any part thereof: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our aduersaries the Papistes, that holding all those bookes to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we do acknowledge, doe adde vnto them other bookes which are not canonicall: so that they offend not as other heretikes, in denying any part of the Scripture, but, which is as bad in adding vnto it, for both these are accursed. Reuel. 22.18.</p>
                     <p>First of all breifly before we proceed, let vs see who they were that offend in the first kind. Some heretikes generally reiected the whole Scripture, some certaine partes thereof. The <hi>Sadducees</hi> receiued no Scripture, beside the fiue bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Maniches</hi> condemned the whole old testament, and so did wicked <hi>Marcion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The bookes of <hi>Moses</hi> the <hi>Ptolemaites</hi> refused, the booke of the Psalmes the <hi>Nicolaitanes,</hi> and the <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> in our dayes: there wanted not which condemned the booke of the Preacher and the Canticles as wanton and lasciuious bookes: and the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are not here behind with their partes. The holy and excellent booke of Iob hath also found enimies, and some of the Rabbins which do thinke that the storie is but fained: which heresie is confuted Ezech 14.14. for there <hi>Noah, Iob, Daniel</hi> are named together: so that it is manifest, that such a man there was.</p>
                     <p>The new testament the <hi>Maniches</hi> most impiously affirmed to be full of lies. <hi>Cerdon</hi> the heretike condemned all but <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel. The <hi>Valentinians</hi> could away with none but <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell. The <hi>Alogians</hi> of all other hated <hi>Iohns</hi> writings. The <hi>Ebionites</hi> onely admitted <hi>Matthewes</hi> Gospell. The Acts of the Apostles the <hi>Seuerian</hi> heretikes contemned. The <hi>Marcionites</hi> the Epistles to <hi>Timothie,</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> to the Hebrues. The <hi>Ebionites</hi> could not away with any of S. <hi>Paules</hi> workes. <hi>ex Whitakero, cont.</hi> 1. <hi>de Script. cap.</hi> 3.

Take but a litle paines to peruse that worthy learned mans and reuerent fathers defence of the Apologie p. 521. there you shall find how that <hi>Lodouicus</hi> a Canon Lateran in Rome, said in the Councell of Trent, that the Scripture is but <hi>mortuum atramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> dead inke. The Bishop of Poitiers sayd, that it was, but <hi>res mammis &amp; muta,</hi> a dead and dumbe thing. <hi>Albertus Pigghius,</hi> that the Scriptures were but <hi>muti Iudices,</hi> dumbe Iudges. <hi>Eckius</hi> calleth it <hi>Euangelium nigrum, &amp; theologiam atramentariam,</hi> the blacke Gospell and inkie diuinitie: and it is <hi>nasus cereus,</hi> a nose of wax saith he. And now in cometh <hi>Hosius</hi> with his part: that it is but lost labor which is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture: for the Scripture is a creature, and a certaine bare letter.

                     <p>I pray you now how much do these Papists differ from the Libertines and Zuinkfeldians, vnlesse it be in this, that the Libertins cleaue to secret reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Papistes are pinned vpon the Popes sleeue, affirming that it is no Scripture nor Gospel without the determination of the Church. Nay one of them saith, <hi>determinatio Ecclesiae appellatur Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelium,</hi> the determination of the Church is called the Gospell. <hi>Iohannes Maria!</hi> will you yet heare of greater impietie? <hi>Anno Domini</hi> .1240. or thereabout there was a booke set forth by the Friers, called <hi>Euangelium aeternum,</hi> full of their owne fables, and abominable errors: they taught that Christes Gospell was not to be compared vnto it, and that the Gospel of Christ should be preached but fifty years. This booke with much a do was condemned by the Pope, (but after long disputation) and it was burnt secretely, lest the fryers should haue bene discredited: and withall the booke of <hi>Guilielmus de S. amore,</hi> which he had written against the Friers, and disputed against their Gospell, was commanded to be burned with the other. Besides these heresies, their opinion also is to be reiected, that thynke that the holy writers might in some things be deceiued, as mistaking one thing for another, or fayling in their memorie.

                     <p>So then all the question is about the Apocrypha of the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: they are called Apocrypha, because they are hid and obscure, not because their authours are vnknowne: for as I sayd, we knowe not by whom certaine Canonical bookes were written: neither are they so called because of some vntruthes conteined in them contrary to Scripture, as the most of them haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it foloweth not, that euerie booke which hath no vntruth or lye, should straight wayes be taken for Scripture, but they are therfore iudged and called Apocrypha, because they were not in former time receiued into publike and

authentick authoritie in the Church, neither to be alledged as grounds of our faith though they may be read for example of life, and may haue other profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vse. But the Canonicall Scripture onely hath this priuiledge to geue rules of faith, and thereupon it hath the name, that we may be bold to beleeue and ground our faith vpon the canonicall &amp; holy Scripture, which is the onely word of God. Wherefore out of this number of Canonicall Scripture we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all the books afore named, &amp; therfore let not the reader be deceiued, that although they be ioyned in one volume with the Scripture; to think that they are for that of the same authoritie and credit with the rest: first we will shew one reason in general, and afterward come vnto the particular books in order.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 All canonical scripture in the old Testament was written by Prophets: we haue a sure word of the prophetes, saith <hi>S. Peter</hi> 2.1.19. and <hi>S. Paule, Rom.</hi> 16.26. calleth them the Scriptures of the Prophets. But none of those bookes aforenamed, of <hi>Tobias, Iudith</hi> and the rest, were written by the Prophets: for they were all written since <hi>Malachies</hi> time, who was the last Prophete, as the Church complaineth, Psal. 74.9. There is not one Prophete; nor any that can tell vs how long. <hi>Ergo</hi> none of these bookes are canonicall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 All the canonicall bookes of the old Testament, were acknowledged of the Iewes and Hebrues, for they were then onely the Church of God, and where should Scripture be found but in the Church? to them, sayth <hi>S. Paule,</hi> were committed the oracles of God, Rom. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>3.2. But the Iewes receiued none of these books: for none of them are written in the Hebrue toung, neither did they receiue them with the like authoritie as other bookes of Scripture; and this some of the Papists can not denie. <hi>Ergo</hi> thy are not Canonicall.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is no Scripture of the old Testament, but it hath approbation of the new: for as the Prophetes beare witnesse to Christ, so he againe doth witnesse for the Prophets, and therefore it is a true proposition of <hi>Caietane,</hi> though he be controlled and checked of <hi>Catharinus</hi> an other Papist for it, that there is no Scripture, which was not either written or approued by the Apostles: but in the whole new Testament you shall not find one testimony cited either in the Gospel or the Epistles out of any of the Apocrypha, as out of other bookes of Scripture: therefore hauing no approbation of the new Testament, we conclude they are none of the old.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It shall appeare in the seuerall discourse of the particular bookes, that there is somewhat euen in the bookes themselues to be found, that barreth them from being Canonicall.</p>

                        <p>THe most of our reasons against the authoritie of the 7. Chapters added to <hi>Esther</hi> (for of the 10 first Chapters, which are found in the Hebrue, we make no doubt at all) are drawen from the matter of the booke it selfe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 In the second of the Canonicall <hi>Esther. ver.</hi> 16. it is said that the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie of the two Eunuches against the king, was in the 7. yeare of <hi>Assuerus</hi>: but in the 11. Chap. ver. 2. of the Apocryphall <hi>Esther,</hi> we read that <hi>Mardocheus</hi> did dreame of this conspiracie in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeare. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aunswereth, that both are true, for the dreame was in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeare, &amp; the conspiracie in the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th; so belike, there was fiue yeares betweene. But in the 11. Chapter, it is said that <hi>Mardocheus</hi> was much troubled about that dreame, and the next night after his dreame the conspiracie was enterprised.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The true history of <hi>Esther</hi> saith that <hi>Mardocheus</hi> had no reward at that time of the king. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.3. but the forged storie saith, that at the same time the king gaue him great gifts, which can not be meant, of that great honor which afterward was bestowed vpon <hi>Mardoche:</hi> for then <hi>Haman</hi> (being hanged the same day) could worke him no despite, wheras the forged story saith, that after the king had rewarded him, then <hi>Haman</hi> began to stomach him, because of those two Eunuches.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:20636:11"/>3 Againe the storie which is added, was written many yeares after <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doches</hi> &amp; <hi>Esthers</hi> death, vnder the raigne of <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> &amp; <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.1. it is not like therefore to be a true storie: <hi>Bellarmins</hi> ridiculous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture is this, that there were two stories writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Hebrue of <hi>Esther,</hi> the one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pendious &amp; short, which we now haue: the other more large, which might be translated by <hi>Lisimachus</hi> there spoken of <hi>cap.</hi> 11. whose translation we now onely haue, the originall being perished. What goodly gesses here be, to make Canonicall Scripture? what neede two bookes of one thing? If the first were written by the spirite of God and so were Canonicall, what neede a seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? the spirite of God vseth not to correct his own writings: and this can not be that ample and large storie imagined, being shorter, and not so full as the first.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Besides the false storie saith, that <hi>Haman</hi> was a Macedonian. Cap. 16. v. 10. the true storie saith, he was an Agagite or Amalekite. cap. 8.3. how can these two agree? Nay the forged booke saith, that <hi>Haman</hi> would haue destroyed the king, &amp; so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed the kimgdome of the Persians to the Macedonians: which could in no wise be: for the kingdome of the Macedonians was not yet spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: and so it continued in small or no reputation till <hi>Phillippus</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was many yeares after. <hi>Vide plura<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whitach. quaest.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>De Scripturis.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 It appeareth that this story could not be after the captiuitie for we read not of any <hi>Nabuchadneser</hi> afterwards, for the kingdome was translated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Assirians to the Persians and Meedes. Againe it could not be before either in <hi>Iosias</hi> time, <hi>Sedechias,</hi> or <hi>Manasses,</hi> first because in the 5. Chap. v. 18. it is said that the temple had bene destroyed and cast downe, which could not be in any of those kings raignes.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly <hi>Iudith</hi> being at this time in the flower of her age, and liuing afterward many yeares till she was 105. yeare old, all which time, and many yeares after her death, the booke saith in the last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the land had rest: this can not agree with <hi>Manasses</hi> time: for within 40. yeares or not much aboue, the land fell into great trouble, straight after <hi>Iosias</hi> death.

                        <p n="1">1 The author in the Preface saith, that he tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slateth in this booke such things, as before were collected by his grandfather in Hebrue, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him selfe, because that things translated out of the Hebrue do loose the grace, and haue not the same force: so then it appeareth that this booke can not be Canonicall being imperfect: neither was his grandfathers worke (which is now lost) to be thought any part of the Scripture, seeing he was no Prophet him selfe, but a compiler and a collector of certaine things out of the Prophetes.</p>

                     <p>OVr Argumentes against the authoritie of this booke are these ensuing, for our aduersaries bring nothing on their part, but such Argumentes drawen from testimonies &amp; authorities, as do generally serue for all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, which are aunswered afore.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Iudas</hi> is commended. 2. booke. chap. 12. for offring sacrifice for the dead: which was not commanded by the law, neither is it the custome of the Iewes so to do to this day: &amp; againe they were manifest Idolaters: for there were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iewels vnder their coates consecrate to the Idols of the Iamnites. And our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries graunt them selues, that prayer is not to be made, for open malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors dying impenitently.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. many things are reported of the arke, the holy fire, the altar the tabernacle, which should be hid by <hi>Ieremie</hi> in a caue, and that the Lord would shew the people these things at their returne. Here are many things vnlikely and vntrue. First, it is found, saith the text in the writings of <hi>Ieremie:</hi> but no such storie is there found. Secondly <hi>Ieremie</hi> was in prison till the very taking of the Citie: and the Citie being taken the temple was spoyled, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things defaced and carried away, how could they then be conueyed by <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>? Thirdly in their returne, they found neither arke nor fire, nor any such thing: but saith the Iesuite, the Iewes in their conuersion to God in the end of the world, may haue them againe: as though, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shal beleeue in Christ, they will any more looke backe to the ceremonies or rites of the law, for what vse then I pray you shall they haue of altar or sacrifice or any such like.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is a great disagreeing in the storie betweene the two bookes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of <hi>Antiochus. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 6.16. It is said that <hi>Antiochus</hi> dyed for grief in Babylon, hearing of the good successe of the Iewes. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.1. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Antiochus</hi> was with the rest of his souldiers slayne in the temple of Nanea, and his head cut of &amp; throwen forth. Chap. 9. the same <hi>Antiochus</hi> falling sicke by the way dyed with a most filthie and stincking smell, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed of wormes: How could this man dye thrise, in Babylon, in Nanea, and by the way in a straunge cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. It is confessed by the Iesuite, that it was the same <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who saith he lost his armie in the temple, and sickned by the way and dyed at Babylon. But the storie saith that their heads were cut of: I thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could not liue, and that he dyed in a straunge country, therefore not at Babylon in his bed. These things hang not together.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Further the author of these bookes saith, that he abridgeth the story of one <hi>Iason</hi> a Syrenean. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 23. Who was an Heathen: but the spirite of God vseth not, neither needeth to borow of prophane writers.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20636:14"/>
                        <hi>v.</hi> 26. But to the holy writers of Scripture, though their own labour and diligence was not wanting, yet was not the worke hard or molestious vnto them. Lastly the author faith he writeth for pleasure &amp; recreation of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and craueth pardon, if he haue not done well. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.15.39. But to read for pleasure is no end of Scripture, neither doth the spirit of God vse any excuse either for matter or manner.</p>
                     <p>Our aduersaries say that <hi>S. Paule</hi> likewise confesseth, that he was rude in speaking. 1. Cor. 11.6. We aunswere, he so saith, because the false Apostles so gaue out of him, not that he was so indeed: and yet in that place <hi>S. Paule</hi> doth not excuse him selfe, for his not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling of his matter, as this author doth: neither is that speach of <hi>S. Luke</hi> any thing like: for there the Euangelist doubteth not to say, that he had attained to an exact knowledge of all things. Vpon these premises we conclude, that these bookes of the Machabees are not Canonicall, nor to be taken for any part of holy Scripture, though we denie not, but that there may be some profitable vse of them for the storie.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 THe Latin Church hath vsed the vulgare Latin translation for the space of 800. or 900. yeares, and it is not like that the Church all this while was without the true Edition of the Scriptures. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is onely authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. We aunswere. First, by this Argument it foloweth that this vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin being generally vsed, was preferred before other Latin translations, which were at the first in great number, not that therefore it is more authentike then the Hebrue in the old, and the Geeeke in the new Testaments. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there were other Churches besides the Latin all this while, as amongest the Greekes famous congregations and Churches: that be it in the Latin Church, the vulgar translation was reteined being erroneous, yet the whole Church continued not in that errour, which were not so tyed and bound to the Latin translation.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20636:15"/>
in Latin. We aunswere. First, it is no good reason, because the Lord did consecrate the Hebrue and Greeke toung, and therein would haue his word written, that therefore he would or should also haue made the Latin as well authenticall, as they. Secondly, if the Latin Church must haue an authentike translation, why should not other countrys likewise haue their authenticals? The Armenians had the Scriptures of old translated by <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> the Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonians by <hi>Hierome,</hi> the Gothes by <hi>Vlphilas,</hi> why should not these also as well be authenticall? and so looke into how many toungs the Scriptures should be translated so many authenticall translations should there be.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They say that all other translations, which are come forth since are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious, and much differ amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest them selues. Aunswere. First, this is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to prefere it before the Hebrue and Greeke, though it were better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slations. Secondly, they charge vs falsly, that our tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slations are disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and erronious: for their disagreement is not in such substantiall points, &amp; where any of them do swarue from the originall, we allow them not: and yet there is not the meanest of them, but may iustly compare with theirs, yea and be preferred before it. Thirdly, if their tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slation were so pure, as they say <hi>Beza</hi> him selfe maketh it, he would not haue set forth a new Edition: and he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it in some places before other translations, but is farre of from making it authenticall, and so are we: these are the Iesuites arguments. <hi>De verb. Dei lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and some of our Rhemists in their Preface to the new Testament. Some of our Argumentes are these, for it is not necessarie to repeat all, and it were to long.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 If the Latin translation be authenticall, as it was decreed in the Councel of Trent, then it must haue bene so from the beginning, so soone as there was any Latin translation: for the Councell had not authoritie to make that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, which was not, but onely to declare it so to be. But the Latin trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for the space of 600. yeares after Christ was not receiued as authenticall: for we finde that the Latin writers as <hi>Lactantius, Hilarius, Ambrosius, Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Augustinus,</hi> and others did not vse the same Latin translation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this vulgare Latin hauing not bene alwayes, since it was extant authenticall, why should it now begin?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That Edition, which was made, and framed, and first writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles, Euangelistes, is to be preferred before that, which was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by any Prophet or Apostle. But such are the Hebrue in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Greeke Edition in the new, by the confession of our aduersaries, <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. Such is not the Latin, for it is vncertaine, by whom it was written: for the Iesuite confesseth, that it is not all of <hi>Hieromes</hi> Edition: as the booke of the Psalmes, Wisedome, Ecclesiasticus, the Machabees, which they thinke were not translated by <hi>Hierome:</hi> But let vs graunt that the whole was of <hi>Hieromes</hi> doing, yet was he no Prophet nor Apostle, saith he, <hi>Aliud est va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem esse, aliud interpretem,</hi> it is one thing to be a Prophet, another to be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter. Wherefore it is no reason, that <hi>Hieromes,</hi> or whose translation els soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20636:15"/>
should be receiued before the writings of Prophets and Apostles.</p>
                     <p>But say our aduersaries, if we had a perfect copie of the Hebrue &amp; Greeke editions, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse they were to be preferred: but now they are full of faults, and greatly corrupted. We aunswere. First, the Iesuite him selfe disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Canus</hi> and <hi>Lindanus</hi> two Archpapistes, that though there may be some scapes in the translations by the fault of some Libraries and imperfect copies, yet concerning the doctrine of faith and manners, saith, there is no corruption in them. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Secondly, though there may be and are some wordes falsly written, and by errour thrust into the text, yet they shall neuer proue that they are more corrupt, the Hebrue and Greeke, then the Latin: for it foloweth no more, that because of some scapes the Latin is to be preferred before them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that a cloake altogether patched and ragged is better then a cloake of veluet that hath but one peece.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Iesuite him selfe, and other Papistes confesse, that in some cases it is very necessary to haue recourse to the originall: as when some word seemeth to be mistaken by the writer, as where <hi>cecinit</hi> is read for <hi>cecidit: dorix,</hi> for <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, cor</hi> for <hi>coram,</hi> or when the Latin copies do varie, or if the sentence in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin be ambiguous, and lastly, the force and propertie of the wordes is better vnderstood in the originall. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Ergo</hi> by the Iesuites confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the originall or fountaines are more certaine and sure without doubtfulnesse and ambiguitie, therefore more authenticall then the Latin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 There are many &amp; great errors in the vulgare translation, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the originall, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tike. Some of the places we will quote, as <hi>Genes.</hi> 3. <hi>ipsa conteret,</hi> for <hi>ipsum,</hi> she shall breake the Serpents head, where we do read, that not the woman, but her seede shall breake his head. <hi>Genes.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. for <hi>figmentum cordis malum:</hi> the thoughtes of mans hart are euill, they read, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta ad malum cogitatio,</hi> enclined to euill: and so extenuate originall sinne. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> 14.18. for <hi>protulit panem &amp; vinum, Melchisedech</hi> brought forth bread and wine: they read, <hi>obtulit</hi> he offred, or made an oblation of bread and wine, and would hereby establish the sacrifice of their Masse. <hi>Ecclesiasticus.</hi> 16.14. for <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum opera,</hi> a man shall receiue according to his workes: they read after the merite of his workes. In their Latin translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Psalmes there are many corruptions.

                     <head>The Papistes.</head>
                     <p>THey do not absolutely condemne the translation of the Scriptures into the vulgare toung, what soeuer they haue thought in times past: neither would they generally haue euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> permitted to read the Scripture, but such onely as haue especiall licence from their ordinarie, hauing the testimonie of their Curates that they be humble and deuout persons, <hi>Rhenens. praefat. sect.</hi> 6. So then they hold it daungerous for all men to read Scripture, and they would not willingly licence any, but their Pope holie deuout Catholikes; they are like to make a mad peece of worke, that go about to picke their faith out of Scripture, say the Rhemists, <hi>annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. This then is their opinion, that it is neither necessarie nor conuenient for all men to haue accesse to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: we will see some of their reasons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 From the time of <hi>Esdras</hi> till Christ, and in our Sauiours time, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were not in the vulgare toung, but onely in the Hebrue, which the Iewes vnderstood not after the captiuitie: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not now necessary to haue them in the vulgare tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. That the people vnderstood not Hebrue, the Iesuite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out of the 8. of <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> where it is said, that <hi>Esdras</hi> did expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the law to the people, because they vnderstood it not. We answere, that the text saith cleane contrary, that he read the law before the people that vnderstood it. v. 3. and they might geue the sense, though the people vnderstood the language. Concerning the places obiected out of the Gospell, to proue the Iewes spake another language the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hebrue, as it appeareth by those speaches <hi>Marc.</hi> 5. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litha cumi, Math.</hi> 27. <hi>Golgotha,</hi> which sauour not of the Hebrue toung, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that although they spake not pure Hebrue, but many straunge wordes were vsed, yet they vnderstood the Hebrue, for why els doth Christ bid the people to search the Scriptures? And they were not the Iewes, but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane souldiers that vnderstood not the voyce of Christ vpon the Crosse, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he called for <hi>Elias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Apostles (saith the Iesuite) wrote their Epistles onely in Hebrue or Greeke, and not in the vulgare tounges of the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to whom they preached,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20636:16"/>
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not necessary that the scriptures should be in the vulgare toung. We answere. First, it had bene an infinite labour for the Apostles, to haue left their writings in euery language, neither was it necessary, seeing out of the original they might be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into euery language. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, they preached the same things vnto the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles in their own tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, which they afterward left in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Thirdly, the Greeke tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, wherein they wrote, was vniuersally knowen, and few countryes were ignorant of it, especially in the East parts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is no cause (say they) why the Scriptures should be translated: if it be for the vnderstanding of the people, they vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them not being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated neither. We aunswere: many things they may easely vnderstand: and for the harder places, they are nearer the vnderstanding of them being translated, then before: for then they haue two great lets, the toung vnknowen, and the obscure and hid sense; now they need not to labour for the toung, but onely for the sense.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Scriptures are occasion of offence and heresie, being not right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>Ergo.</hi> First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because many surfet of meats and drinkes, it is no reason that sober men should be forbidden the vse of them: no more for heretikes &amp; wicked mens sakes ought the people of God to be barred from Scripture. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, more haue perished by ignorance in Scripture, then by misunderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it: and the Scripture, was ordained of God to meete with offences, and to confute heresies. 2. Tim. 3.15. Wherefore these men make them selues wiser then God, that thinke the Scripture is an occasion of those diseases, for the which it is apppointed a remedie.</p>

                     <p>WE do beleeue and hold that it is requisite, expedient and necessarie for the Scriptures to be vttered and set forth in the vulgare and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speach, and that none vpon any occasion ought to be prohibited the reading thereof for knowledge and instructions sake: and that Christian Magistrates ought to prouide, that the people may haue the Scriptures in their mother &amp; knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toung. Wherefore great wrong was offered to the people of England that diuerse 100. yeares, till king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, could not be suffred to haue the Scriptures in English. And how I pray you did the Papistes storme, when as <hi>Tindals</hi> translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came forth? some affirming that it was impossible to haue the Scriptures tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into English, some that it would make the people he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes: others that it would cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to rebell. <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 117. <hi>col.</hi> 1. What fowle and shamefull slaunders were these? For the vulgare translations of Scripture we reason thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It is Gods commandement, that the Scriptures should be read before the people, that they may learne to feare God, Deut. 31. vers. 11.12. The people are commanded to write the law vpon their gates, and in their houses to conferre and talke with their children and teach them the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deut. 6.6.7.8. And our Sauiour biddeth the people search the Scripture, Iohn. 5. v. 39. <hi>Ergo</hi> what God hath commaunded, no man ought to prohibite or forbid: the people therfore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20636:17"/>
must not be kept from reading of Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Without Scripture there is no faith, faith is necessarie for all people, <hi>Ergo</hi> the knowledge of the Scripture: that faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by the scriptures, read Iohn. 20.31. these things are written, that ye might beleeue Iesus Christ to be the sonne of God. Againe the weapons of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, are not denied to any, whereby they should fight against their spirituall enemies, but the word of God is a speciall part of our harnesse,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.</note> and a principall weapon, euen the sword of the spirite <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Gospell may be preached in the vulgare toung, as our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and the holy Apostles taught the people: <hi>Ergo</hi> the word of God may be read and writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the vulgare toung. The proposition our aduersaries graunt, that Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be made in the vulgare toung: but it foloweth not, say they, that therefore Scripture should be in the mother toung. <hi>Rhem.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.8. But I pray you how can the preacher alledge Scripture in his Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnlesse it be recited in the vulgare toung? or how should the people know they preach the word, vnlesse they may compare their doctrine, with Scripture as the Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rheans did? Act. 17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 We haue the practise of the Church of God in times past for our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: for in <hi>Chrisostomes</hi> time the people had vulgare translations: whereupon he exhorteth them to get them Bibles, or at the least the new Testament, the Actes of the Apostles, the Gospels. <hi>Homil.</hi> 9. <hi>Epist. ad Coloss.</hi> We heard before that the Armenians, Sclauonians, Gothes had the Scripture in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: so many hundred yeares ago in England king <hi>Alured</hi> translated the Psalter: a copie whereof was found in Crowland Abbey, called <hi>S.

                     <p n="1">1 Thus they argue: the maiestie and grauitie of the sacred businesse, doe require also to be vttered in a sage, sanctified and graue language, <hi>Ergo</hi> not in the vulgare. We aunswere, the grauitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reuerence, and holynesse consisteth not in words, phrases, and soundes, though neuer so eloquent, but in the things them selues: neither is any toung that is vnderstood, before the Lord counted barbarous: for <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith, that he is a barbaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and speaketh barbarously in the Church, that can not be vnderstood. 1. Cor. 14.11. And Actes. 2.11. the verie straungers and barbarians heard the Apostles vtter in their languages the wonderfull things of God: they thought the toung no disgrace to those holy mysteries they vttered.</p>

Secondly, they vnderstood not the priest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they heard him not: but they can not proue that the Priest vttered any thing in their hearing at any time, which they vnderstood not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 We must onely vse those toungs in holy affaires, which were sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Crosse: that is Hebrue, Greeke, Latin.

                     <p n="2">2 There are certaine writings of the Prophetes not canonicall, and other writings of some that were no Prophetes, made canonicall, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Church hath authoritie to iudge of Scripture, <hi>sic Stapleton.</hi> For the first, where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth that there are many writings of the Prophetes as of <hi>Solomon, Nathan, Ahiia, Ieedo.</hi> 2.

                     <p>To the second, that bookes not made by Prophets are iudged canonicall, as of <hi>Tobie, Iudith.</hi> We aunswere, that these bookes ought not to be canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, neither that euer they were so taken, till of late it was decreed by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of no great antiquitie: for in the Laodicene Councell and other auncient Councels, they were deemed not to be canonicall.</p>

We answere. First, we deny not but that the Church is to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the true Scriptures &amp; forged bookes, but this she doth not of her own authoritie, but folowing the direction of Gods spirite speaking in those wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: for the Church looking into the sacred and diuine matter of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles writings was moued to acknowledge them for the word of God, though of some they were doubted of: &amp; finding the other to be fabulous bookes did by the direction of the same spirite reiect them. Secondly, <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> thinke that the Canon of Scripture might be confirmed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time, <hi>Iohn</hi> being the suruiuer of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, who both acknowledged the true writings of the Apostles, and condemned the contrarie.

Our Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistes say, it is all one to affirme some things to be hard in a writer, and the writer to be hard: so they conclude, that the scriptures are both in respect of the matter and manner, very hard, and therfore daungerous for the ignoraunt to read them. <hi>Rhemens. annot. in.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>

We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20636:20"/>
First, he saith not that <hi>Paules</hi> Epistles are hard, but many things, which he entreateth of. Secondly, they are hard not to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the vnstable and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do peruert them. Thirdly, We denie not, but that some places in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are obscure, and haue neede of interpretation: but it foloweth not, that therefore the whole scripture is obscure: and because of some hard places, that the people should be forbidden the reading of all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The scriptures are obscure both in the respect of the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: first the matter is high and mysticall: as of the Trinitie, of the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word, of the nature of Angels, &amp; such like. We aunswere, these mysteries may be said to be obscure three diuerse wayes. First, in their owne nature: so are they hard indeed, for by humane reason, we can not attaine to the depth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Secondly, in respect of their handling in the scripture: so are they not obscure, for all these things are plainly declared in the word, as the nature of such deepe mysteries will afoord. Thirdly, in respect of vs: so must they needs be obscure, if men be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with the knowledge in the word, but curiously search further. <hi>Luther</hi> therefore doth aptly distinguish of these things, he saith that, <hi>res Dei,</hi> the things of God are obscure, the very depth of his mysteries can not be comprehended of vs, but, <hi>res Scripturae,</hi> these things, as they are opened in scripture, are plaine, if we will content our selues with that knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) the maner of handling is hard and obscure: there are many tropes, metaphores, allegories, Hebraismes, which can not easily be vnderstood. We aunswere. First, many of these are rather ornamentes of the scripture, as tropes, metaphores, then impediments to the reader. Secondly, though the phrase of scripture seeme hard at the first, yet by further trauell in the scriptures it may become easie and plaine: for all things are not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood at the first. Thirdly, we denie not but that some places are obscure, and had neede to be opened.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 If the scriptures be not hard, what need so many Comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. <hi>Rhemist.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 16.

We confesse, that the Lord in the Scriptures hath tempered hard things and easie together, that we might be exercised in the Scriptures, and might knocke &amp; labour by prayer and studie, for the opening of the sense: and that there might be order kept in the Church, some to be hearers, some teachers &amp; expounders, by whose diligent search and trauell, the harder places may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the people. But this we affirme against our aduersaries: first that all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20636:20"/>
points of faith necessarie to saluation, are plainely set forth in the Scriptures: secondly that the Scriptures may with great profit be read of the simple and vnlearned, notwithstanding the hardnesse of some places, which in time also vsing the meanes they come to the vnderstanding of. <hi>Ex Fulk. annot.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whitacher. quaest.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First, that which we maintaine is euident out of the scripture, Deut. 30.11. the commaundement, which I commaund thee, is not hid from thee, nor farre of.

Paule. Rom.</hi> 10.6. vnderstandeth this place of the whole doctrine of faith, who better knew the meaning of <hi>Moses</hi> then the Iesuite.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 2. Cor. 4.3. If our Gospell be hid, it is to them onely that are lost, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scriptures are plaine to the faithfull. The Iesuite aunswereth. <hi>S. Paule</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the knowledge of Christ, not of the Scriptures. First it is manifest out of the 2. verse, that <hi>S. Paule</hi> speaketh of that Gospell, which he preached to the Corinthians, which is the same he wrote vnto them: wherefore if the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached were easie and plaine, why is not the Gospell written by him, I meane the doctrine of faith being the same, which he preached? Secondly if they graunt that the knowledge of Christ is easie, we aske no more: for this is that we say, that the doctrine of faith and saluation is plainly expressed in Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This is the difference betweene the new Testament and the old: the old is compared to a clasped booke. <hi>Isay.</hi> 29.11. the new to a booke opened. Apoca. 5. the knowledge of Christians farre exceedeth the knowledge of the Iewes: it was lawfull for them to read the scriptures, much more for all Christians. The Iesuite aunswereth that our knowledge is greater then theirs, not in all scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in the misteries for our redemption onely. We answere, this is all we desire: for if the misterie of saluation and redemption be plainly opened in the scripture, why should not the people be admitted to the reading of the word, to be confirmed in the knowledge of their redemption? who seeth not what sillie aunsweres these be?</p>

The sense of the scripture is either literall (say they) &amp; historicall, which is the first &amp; most proper sense; or spirituall, that is an higher sense deriued out of the other, and it is of three kinds, Allegoricall, Tropolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, Anagogicall: they shew by particular instance and induction, that the scripture besides the literall sense may haue these also.</p>
                        <p>The Allegoricall sense is, when besides the plaine historicall and literall meaning, somewhat is signified which by an allegorie is referred vnto Christ or the Church, as Gal. 4. beside the truth of the storie of the bond and free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>S.

                        <p>WE affirme that of one place of scripture there can be but one sense, which we call the literall sense, when as the wordes are either taken properly, or figuratiuely to expresse the thing which is meant: as in this place, the seede of the woman shall breake the Serpents head, the literall sense is of Christ, who should triumph ouer Sathan, though it be spoken in a borowed and figuratiue speach. There can be therefore but one sense, which is the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: as for those three kinds, they are not diuerse senses, but diuerse applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s onely and collections out of one and the same sense.</p>

There is then but one sense of the place, part whereof consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the storie, part in the allegorie: so that the whole sense is conteined in them both. Concerning the second exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Tropologicall: there is not a twofold sense of that place, but one whole generall sense; that as the mouth of the oxe was not to be musled, so the Minister of the Gospell must be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for. Likewise of the Anagogicall kind: it is not one sense to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the rest of Canaan, an other of the kingdome of God: but there is one whole sense, that as they for their Idolatrie were depriued of the land of promise, so we should take heede lest by our disobedience we lose the hope of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that those are not diuerse senses, but one sense diuersly applied.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The literal sense is the onely sense of the place, because out of that sense onely may an argument strongly be framed: wherefore seeing allegories and tropes do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, they are not the senses of the place. An allegorie or type may be part of the literall sense, and then it concludeth: but when an allegorie is framed beside the literall sense, it concludeth not, and therefore is no part of the sense: as to reason thus, the oxes mouth must not be musled, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster must be maintained, it foloweth well, because it is part of the sense: but allegories deuised beside the sense proue not, though they may illustrate.</p>

                        <p>WE haue a more compendious way to come to the vnderstanding of the scripture: It were to lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we doubt of any place to stay till we haue the generall consent of the pastors of the Church, or to expect a generall Councell, or go vp to Rome. And it were to much to trouble the Popes graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with euery questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The Lord hath shewed vs a more easie and ready way: see that we neede not ascend to heauen or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe the earth or passe the Alpes: but the word of God is amongest vs, the scriptures them selues and the spirite of God opening our harts do teach vs how to vnderstand them: the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture is not assigned to any succession of pastors, or tryed to any place or persons.

                        <p n="1">1 That onely hath power to geue the sense of Scripture, which doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get vs faith: the spirite onely by the Scriptures begetteth faith. Rom. 10.17. faith commeth of hearing the word, <hi>Ergo</hi> the spirit of God is the onely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of scripture. The proposition also is cleare: for seeing the Scripture is the true sense and meaning therof, if any should geue the sense of the scripture, but that which worketh faith, then vpon him should our faith be grounded. If the Pope therefore geue the sense of Scripture, and our faith ariseth of the Scripture vnderstood, then our faith is builded vpon the Popes sense. <hi>argum. Whitach.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</p>

The first part the Papistes them selues graunt: the second is thus proued: the spirite of the Apostles is not geuen by secret inspiration, that sauoureth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptisme: where is it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be found? whether is it like that <hi>S.

Yet it is all one spirite, &amp; appeareth not els where but in the Scriptures: where euery man may finde it as wel as the Pope: the spirituall man iudgeth all things. 1. Cor. 2.15. you haue an oyntment from him that is holy, and you haue knowen all things: and ver. 27. you need not that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teach you. By these places it is euident, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithfull man by the spirite of God may vnderstand the scriptures.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The doctrine of the Church must be examined by the Scriptures, <hi>Ergo</hi> the scriptures are not to stand to the iudgement of the Church. The former part is proued by the example of the Berrheans. Act. 17.11. If they did well in examining <hi>Paules</hi> doctrine, much more may the decrees of the Pope, Church, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels be examined by the scriptures. But they knew not whether <hi>Paule</hi> was an Apostle or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore they might examine his doctrine, saith the Iesuite. Answere, it is no matter for the person of <hi>Paule,</hi> they examined his doctrine, which dependeth not vpon the person. Secondly, they could not be ignoraunt of his Apostleship, who was famous throughout the Churches. Thirdly, they doubted onely whether <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apostle, but we are sure the Pope is none, neither successor of any Apostle, but very Antichrist, <hi>Ergo</hi> we haue more iust cause to examine his decrees.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Lastly, let <hi>Augustine</hi> speake: <hi>Nouit charitas vestra omnes nos vnum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrum habere, &amp; sub illo condiscipulos esse, nec ideo magistri sumus, quia de supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riore loco loquimur vobis, sed magister est omnium, qui habitat in nobis omnib.</hi> You know brethren (saith he) that we are all felow scholers vnder one maister, and though we speake to you out of an higher place, yet are we not your master, he is the teacher and master of vs all that dwelleth in our harts. <hi>Ergo</hi> the spirite of God speaking in the scriptures is the chief and best interpreter thereof.</p>

First, the Councels and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he made chief interpreters of Scripture before, and now they are but meanes: what other chief iudge then is there to vse these meanes? surely none
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20636:23"/>
but the scriptures. Secondly, these meanes are most vncertaine, the practise of the Church is often changed, fathers agree not in their expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels can not alwayes be had.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the rule of faith consisting of vnwritten verities: he groundeth it falsely vpon that place. Rom. 12.6. let vs prophecie according to the rule of faith, and Gal. 6.16. as many as walke according to this rule. This rule was a certaine platforme of Religion, geuen by the Apostles before the Scriptures were written, according to the which (say they) the Scriptures were afterward compiled by the Apostles. <hi>Rhemens. in Rom.</hi> 12.6. Answere, <hi>S. Paul</hi> meaneth no other rule, but that which is set downe in his writings, no other forme of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine but that conteined in his Epistles, as in the 6. to the Galathians, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this rule, he alludeth to the former verse, where he saith he reioyced in nothing but in the Crosse of Christ: his rule therfore is to receiue Christ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without the ceremonies or workes of the law: against the which heresie he disputeth in the whole Epistle. But of all other it is a great blasphemie to say that the Apostles set downe the Scriptures by a rule, as though the spirite of God, by whom they spake, had neede of any such direction.</p>

First, to haue recourse to the originall toung, as in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Hebrue, in the new to the Greeke: as 1. Tim. 2.15. through bearing of children they shalbe saued, if they continue in faith and loue: In the English it is doubtfull, whether this clause, if they continue in faith, be referred to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or to those that beare them: but read the Greeke and the doubt is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for bearing of children is all one word in the originall <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bearing of children is in the singular number, that which foloweth of the plurall, and it is but an action, not a person, so that it should be improperly sayd, if they continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, in bearing of children.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stapleton</hi> obiecteth against this meane: that it is not now needefull, seeing there is a perfect and absolute translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authorised by the Councell of Trent, he meaneth the vulgare Latin. We answere. First, it is no perfect but an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious translation, and verie corrupt. Secondly, if it were neuer so perfect, yet for more certaintie, it is profitable to search the originall: euery man will trust his owne skill, rather then another mans. Thirdly, the Councell did fondly in authorising an old blind translation, before the authenticall copies of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue and Greeke.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Secondly, the scope of the place, the circumstance of it, with that which goeth before, and commeth after must, be wayghed, which will bring great light to the place we haue in hand: an example we haue 1. Pet. 4.8. loue coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20636:24"/>
multitude of sinnes: the Papistes gather out of these words, that loue doth iustifie vs before God and taketh away our sinnes: but by the circunstance of the place, the Apostole saying immediatly before: haue feruent loue among you, it is euident he vnderstandeth brotherly loue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest our selues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by faultes are buried, forgeuen, and forgotten.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stapleton</hi> obiecteth: that this is but an vncertaine way, and many times fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: for the scripture passeth many times from one matter and argument to another: how then can it helpe to consider the circumstance of the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a diuerse matter? We answere, we say not that any of these meanes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for euery place, but when one fayleth, to vse another: when the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance helpeth not, to runne to the originall, if there we find, no succour to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare places together, and when we may, to vse them all, or the most.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Thirdly the conference of places is very profitable, as Iames. 2.21. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was iustified by workes, compare it with that place Rom. 4.2. there <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith flatly that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iustified by workes: Wherfore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Apostle is not contrary to the other: we must needs gather, that this word iustified is diuersly taken, <hi>Paule</hi> saith that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iustified that is, made righteous before God by his workes. <hi>Iames</hi> saith he was iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that is declared to be iust before men, and so <hi>Thom. Aquinas</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stapleton</hi> obiecteth, that this meanes in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring of places is of it selfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times of smal force. Answere, as though we affirme that these meanes must be vsed asunder, and not rather ioyntly together, and where one fayleth, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to helpe. Secondly, some things are found but once in the scriptures. Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, they are then either very plaine, or not greatly necessarie. Thirdly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes haue erred in comparing of Scripture. Answere, they compared them not diligently, nor with a syncere minde, but corruptly and negligently.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The fourth rule is the analogie and proportion of faith, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the summe &amp; grounds of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gathered out of scripture, such as are conteined in the Creede, the Lordes Prayer, the ten Commaundements, and in our whole Catechisme. We must take heede, that in the interpretation of Scripture we swarue not from this rule of faith, nor impugne any principle of Religion. Wherefore the Papistes interpretation of those wordes of Christ we do reiect. <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> this is my body: who would haue the verie flesh of Christ present in the Sacrament: for this is against the article of the Creede, that Christ is ascended into heauen, and there sitteth till his comming againe in iudgement.</p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>11</label> which we denie not, for meate is not simply necessarie, for God may preserue man without: so in respect of God nothing is simply necessarie: God is not necessarily tyed to vse this or that meanes: but his argumentes do tend to this end, to shew that the scriptures are not necessarie at all, and may be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Church (so saith <hi>Petrus a Soto</hi>) the Scripture was not alway extant, and it is not necessarie vnto faith: And the Scripture it not now so necessarie since Christ, as it was afore. <hi>Tilman. de verbo Dei error.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 There was no Scripture from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> for the space of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, and yet true Religion was kept and continued, and why might not true Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be as well preserued a 1500. yeare after Christ without scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as afore.</p>
                        <p>We answere: It foloweth not, because in times past God taught his church by a liuelie voyce, that the written word is not necessarie now: for the Lord saw it good, that his word should be left in writing, that we might haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule of our faith in this corrupt and sinfull age. And what els is this, but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troll the wisedome of God, saying it is not necessarie or needfull for the Church, which the Lord saw to be needfull: for if the Lord had thought it as good for vs to be taught without Scripture, as in that simple and innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t age of the world (I meane innocent in respect of vs) he would not haue moued and stirred vp his Apostles to write.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 After the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> when the law was written, yet there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that feared God amongest the Gentiles, which had not the Scriptures, as <hi>Iob,</hi> and the other his friends, <hi>Ergo</hi> the scripture not necessarie. The Iewes also
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20636:25"/>
them selues vsed traditions more then Scriptures, as Psal. 44. v. 1.2. the fathers did report the workes of God to their children: by the negligence also of the Priests the law was lost, as 2. King. 22. we read that the volume of the law was found, which had bene missing a long time.</p>
                        <p>We answere. First, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithfull amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles did read the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Eunuke Act. 8. had the booke of the Prophet <hi>Isay.</hi> Secondly, the Iewes declared the workes of God vnto their children, but the same were also written, as how the heathen were cast out before them, and of their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce out of Egypt: those were the things they heard of their fathers, as we read Psal. 44. &amp; 78. yet all these things are recorded in the bookes of <hi>Moses.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what though the Priests were negligent in preseruing the scriptures, it is no good argument to proue that therefore they are not necessarie, neither was the whole booke of the law lost, but either <hi>Moses</hi> owne manuscript, or the booke of Deuteronomie. Yet he hath proued nothing.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The Church after Christ wanted the Scriptures many yeares, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not necessarie.</p>
                        <p>We aunswere, it is a great vntruth: for the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Church could not be without, and the new Testament was written not long after in the age of the Apostles: whose liuely voyce and preachings were vnto them, as their writings are now to vs. See now, what strong arguments they bring: the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were not necessary in the time of the Patriarkes, when God taught them by his owne voyce, they were not necessarie in the time of the Prophetes and Apostles, when they had me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inspired of God to teach them, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not now necessarie, when neither God teacheth from heauen, neither haue we any Prophetes or Apostles to instruct vs by heauenly reuelations: nay rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not necessarie then, when they had other effectuall meanes, notwithstanding they are necessarie now, seeing there is no other way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction left vnto vs.</p>

                        <p>THat the scriptures are necessarie for the people of God, the reading, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and vnderstanding whereof is the onely and ordinarie meanes to beget faith in vs, we thus proue out of the Scriptures them selues.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The scriptures conteine necessarie knowledge to saluation, which can not be learned but out of the scripture, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are necessarie. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law is necessarie, but that onely is deriued from the Scripture: as the Apostle witnesseth Rom. 7.7. he had not knowen lust to be sinne, vnlesse the law had said, thou shalt not lust. And if the right knowledge of the law is not learned, but out of the scripture: much more the knowledge of the Gospel, is more high and mysticall, and more straunge vnto our nature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That whereby we are kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error and doubtfulnes in matters of faith is necessarie: but this is performed by the scripture, <hi>Ergo.</hi> First the Scripture keepeth vs from error.

our Sauiour). The ignoraunce of scripture was cause of their error. Secondly, if our knowledge were onely builded vpon tradition without scripture, we should be doubtfull and vncertaine of the truth, so <hi>S. Luke</hi> saith in his Preface to <hi>Theophilus</hi>: I haue written (saith he) that thou mightest be certaine of those things, whereof thou hast bene instructed: Hence we conclude, that although we might know the truth without scripture, as <hi>Theophilus</hi> did, yet we can not know it certainlie without.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 If the scriptures be not necessarie, then we may be without them, but this can not be, <hi>Ergo</hi> the scriptures can not be spared: for then God had done a needlesse and superfluous worke in stirring vp the Prophets and Apostles to write. <hi>S.

Rom. 15.4. The Lord saw in wisedome that his people could not be without the Scriptures, which are necessarie for their learning, for their comfort, and to strengthen their hope: how then dare our aduersaries say, that the scriptures are not necessarie, seeing these things wrought in vs by the scriptures, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, consolation, hope, are most necessarie.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Let <hi>Augustine</hi> now put in his verdict: <hi>Illud credo, quod etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hinc diuinoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eloquiorum clarissima authoritas esset, si homo illud sine dispendio salutis ignorare non posset. de peccator. merit. &amp; remiss. lib.</hi> 2.36.

                        <p n="1">1 First, the Iesuite thus reasoneth against the sufficiencie of Scripture.

                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:20636:26"/>We aunswere. First, we denie not, but that some bookes are now wanting, which were part of canonicall scripture, &amp; yet that which remaineth is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: as some of <hi>Solomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> bookes are perished, which he wrote of herbes &amp; pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and many of his Prouerbes: the Lord saw that they were not so greatly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for vs to saluation. Secondly, there is not so much wanting, as the Iesuite would beare vs in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for the books of the Prophets which he nameth, are the same with the bookes of the Chronicles &amp; of the Kings, which no doubt were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by those Prophetes. And as for the Epistle of <hi>S. Paule</hi> to the Laodicea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there was neuer any such: the text is, written from the Laodiceans, it was the Epistle rather of the Laodiceans to <hi>S. Paule,</hi> vnto the which he partly maketh aunswere in the Epistle to the Colossians, and therefore he would haue it read also in their Church.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 If the Apostles had any such meaning to contriue in the scriptures the summe of faith and all necessarie knowledge, it is very like Christ would haue geuen them some expresse commaundement so to do: but we read not of any such strict commaundement, <hi>Ergo</hi> they had no such purpose. <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We aunswere. First, they them selues dare not denie, but that the Apostles wrote by the instinct of the spirite: what is that els, but the commaundement of God? Actes. 16.6. <hi>Paule</hi> was forbidden of the holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia: and ver. 10. when he had seene a vision of a man of Macedonia appearing vnto him: the Apostle concludeth that they were called of God: wherefore what they did by the secret mouing of the spirite, was done at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God. Secondly, Apocal. 11.1.14.13. <hi>Iohn</hi> is bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to write that which he saw: no doubt the other Apostles had the like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 There are many points, which we ought in no wise to be ignoraunt of, which the scriptures speake either obscurelie of, or not at all.</p>
                        <p>First, these things are obscurely and doubtfully set downe in Scripture, the equalitie of the persons in Trinitie, the proceeding of the holy Ghost, from the Father and the Sonne, the doctrine of originall sinne.</p>
                        <p>We aunswere. First, if these things be found at all in the Scriptures, it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient concerning the question we haue in hand. Secondly, the Scripture doth manifestly declare the truth in all those points, the equalitie of the persons is directly proued. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.7. the procession of the spirite. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.26. the spirit is there said to be sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father &amp; the Sonne. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. Original sinne is described plainly by the Apostle. Rom. 5.12. though the name be not found in Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, there are diuerse things necessarie to be knowen, not at all decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scripture. First, as that <hi>Marie</hi> continued a perpetuall Virgine. We answere, the Scripture saith euery where she was a Virgine, neither maketh mention of any children she had, and therefore out of the Scripture we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that she continued. Secondly, <hi>Basile</hi> saith that it is sufficient to know she was a Virgine before the birth of Christ. Secondly, to know that the Pasch or Easter must be kept vpon the Lordes day is necessarie. Aunswere, there is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20636:26"/>
no such necessiitie in it to saluation: neither needed the Church so much to haue contended about it in times past: these are the mightie weapons, which our aduersaries vse.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="Protestant_doctrine">
                        <head>The Protestantes.</head>
                        <p>WE do not affirme, as our aduersaries charge vs, that all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to saluation, are expressely conteined in scripture, that is, in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words: but this we hold, that all things, which are necessarily to be knowen of vs, are either expresly declared in Scripture, or necessarily concluded out of Scripture, and so conteined in them. We also graunt, that it was not Gospell onely which was written, but all that Christ and his Apostles taught by liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voyce: the whole summe whereof and substaunce is conteined in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word: and so we conclude, that nothing necessarie to saluation either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith or manners, is els where to be found but in the holy Scriptures.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith: if we, or an Aungell preach vnto you otherwise then that which we haue preached, let him be accursed, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scripture conteineth all things necessarie.</p>
                        <p>First, the Iesuite aunswereth, that <hi>S. Paule</hi> speaketh not onely of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but also of his preachings which were not written.</p>
                        <p>We aunswere, that the summe of all <hi>S. Paules</hi> preachings is conteined in his Epistles and other holy writings: for <hi>S. Paule</hi> confirmed his doctrine out of the scriptures, as Act. 17.10. the Berrheans examined his doctrine by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and found it to be consonant, and to agree in all things.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth, those which preach any thing, not besides or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but contrarie: and therefore not any other doctrine besides Scripture is forbidden, but that which is contrarie. We aunswere, whatsoeuer is imposed as necessarie to saluation beside the Scripture, <hi>praeter Scripturas,</hi> is also <hi>contra Scripturas,</hi> contrarie to Scripture, as are all Popish traditions, which they lay a necessitie vpon, both beside and contrarie to Scripture. Neither did those false Apostles against whom <hi>S. Paule</hi> writeth so much, bring in another or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary Gospell, as the Apostle saith ver. 7. as they did labour to corrupt and peruert that Gospel, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> taught. Therfore all traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s whether <hi>praeter,</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> beside or contrarie to Scripture, are notablie by this place ouerthrowen.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.31. these things are written, that ye might beleeue that Iesus Christ is the sonne of God, &amp; that in beleeuing ye might haue life through his name, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scriptures conteine all things necessarie to saluation: for they suffise to worke in vs faith, and faith bringeth vs to eternall life.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aunswereth, that <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh onely of that which he had written. Aunswere. If this one Apostles writings were able to worke faith, the whole body of Scripture much more: but he rather speaketh of all other holy writings, of the Apostles, for he was the suruiuer of them all, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their writings and approued them. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly (saith he) the Apostle saith not that those writings onely suffise, but they are profitable, and referred to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20636:27"/>
this end to worke faith. Aunswere. The Scripture is not one of the meanes, but the sole, whole, and onely meanes: for if they perfectly worke faith, what neede any other helpes: but the first is true, for they doe beget in vs a perfect faith, which shall bring vs to eternall life, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are the onely meanes of faith.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The whole Scripture (saith <hi>S. Paule</hi>) is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and instruct in righteousnesse. 2. Tim. 3.16. <hi>Ergo</hi> it conteineth all things necessarie: for what els is requisite besides these foure, to teach the right faith, improue error, to instruct in righteousnes and vertue, &amp; to correct vice?</p>
                        <p>First they aunswere, the Apostle meaneth as well euery booke of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the whole, euery part therfore hath this perfection as well as the whole. But you will not say, that euery booke conteineth all things necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: therefore this perfection is not so to be taken.</p>
                        <p>We aunswere. First, <hi>S. Paule</hi> vnderstandeth the body of Scripture as ver. 15. thou hast knowen the Scriptures, he speaketh of them all. Secondly, if euery part had these vtilities, you might as well conclude that euery word and silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hath them, for they are parts of Scripture. Thirdly, it appeareth by these foure great vtilities here set downe, that the Apostle meaneth not any part or partes of Scripture, but the whole, for euery part of Scripture is not profitable for all these endes, but the whole.</p>
                        <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, they say it foloweth not: the Scripture is profitable, therfore suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, they also graunt it is profitable. Aunswere, but we conclude out of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> that the Scripture is not onely profitable, but sufficient, as it foloweth v. 17. that the man of God may be absolute, perfectly instructed to euery good worke. If then the scriptures are able perfectly to instruct vs, then are they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, then neede we no other helpes.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Lastly, <hi>Augustine</hi> thus writeth, in Psal. 66. <hi>Ne putetis</hi> (saith he) <hi>ex alijs Scripturis petendum, quod forte hic deest.</hi> Thinke not (saith he) that it is to be found in any other writings if it be not in Scripture. And in another place: <hi>In Euangelio quaeramus, nam si ibi non inuenimus, vbi inueniemus?</hi> Let vs (saith he) seeke to be resolued in the Gospell, if we finde not there, where shall we find it? <hi>Ergo</hi> by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Augustine</hi> there is no truth necessary to be knowen, which is not to be found in the Scripture.</p>

They do not say that all their traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are necessary, but they make diuerse kindes of them: some are vniuersall, obserued in the whole Church,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20636:27"/>
some particular: some are free, some necessarie, some are Apostolicall, inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apostles, some Ecclesiasticall by the Church: so thus they conclude: all traditions decreed in Councels, and iudged Apostolicall: &amp; whatsoeuer the Church of Rome receiueth as Apostolicall, are not to be doubted, but to be Apostolicall indeed. Secondly, all Apostolicall traditions are of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with the writings of the Apostles. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. and they are that part of the word of God which is vnwritten, as well as the scriptures are that part which is written: Let vs see what arguments they bring for these tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 They geue an instance of certaine traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as the Baptisme of infants, and the not rebaptising of those, which were before Baptised by heretikes: We aunswere, these two customes of the Church are grounded vpon scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in the time of the law Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised, so are they now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospell Baptised: and that promise Gene. 17. I will be thy God, and the God of thy seede, as it belonged to them and their children, so doth it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to vs and our children.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the other point, that they whom heretikes haue once Baptised, ought not to be Baptised againe: <hi>S. Augustine</hi> doth proue it out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Ephe. 4. there is one Faith, one Baptisme, <hi>Ergo</hi> not to be repeated.</p>
                        <p>But now they come in with other traditions, as the Lenton fast, which they vse most fondly and superstitiously: the eight Ecclesiasticall orders, Bishops, Prists, Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Subdeacons, Acolythistes, Readers, Exorcistes, Doore-keepers, the worshipping of Images, with many other: these they would face vs out to be Apostolical traditions, and to haue bene vniuersally obserued, which are but their vayne brags, and Thrasonicall crakes: they shall neuer proue them vniuersall, much lesse Apostolicall: And because they finde no scripture to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish these their superstitious fantasies by, they flye vnto tradition, which is their onely hauen, where they hope to finde succour: but all in vayne. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Consul.

                        <p n="2">2 They proceede and alledge scripture for their traditions, as that place <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.12. I haue many things to say, but you can not beare them now, <hi>Ergo</hi> say they, there are many traditions not written.</p>
                        <p>We aunswere. First, it foloweth not, because Christ declared not all things at that time, that therefore he kept them from his Apostles all together. Nay whatsoeuer afterwardes the Apostles learned of the spirite of God, they had heard before of Christ, for it was the office of the spirite, but to put them in remembrance of Christes sayings. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.26. which they had heard before, but vnderstood them not, and so forgat them. Wherefore these things, which Christ forbeareth to speake, are the same things, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles writings. Secondly, if there were other matters, which Christ vttered not, how foloweth it, nay what great presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it to say, that those trifles and apish toyes, which the Papistes vse in their Idolatrous sacrifice, and their other beggarly ceremonies (which boyes may well laugh at) are those profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20636:28"/>
matters, which the Apostles were not then able to conceiue.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That of all other, they take to be an inuincible place. 2. Thess. 2.15. keepe the instructions or traditions, which ye haue bene taught either by word, or by Epistle, <hi>Ergo</hi> there are traditions besides scripture.</p>
                        <p>We aunswere: when <hi>S. Paule</hi> wrote this Epistle, all the scriptures were not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherefore besides these two short Epistles, which do not conteine the summe of the Gospell, nor all necessarie preceptes, he by his preaching sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, what was wanting, and so declared vnto them the whole mysterie of the Gospell, as he saith. 1. Thess. 2.2. these he calleth his traditions, because yet he had not written his other Epistles, wherein those instructions and traditions are conteined. This then is but a weake argument: the Thessalonians had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and traditions beside the two Epistles writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them, <hi>Ergo</hi> they had other traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, beside all the writings of <hi>S. Paule</hi> and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: this is their mayne and waightie argument.</p>

                        <p>FIrst, we graunt, that all things are not written which our Sauiour Christ and the Apostles taught, and that it was the Gospell, which they preached, as well as this which is written: yet in substance they preached the same Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which now is expressed in the scripture: neither was there any necessarie precept deliuered in their Sermons, which is not now to be found in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Secondly, we denie not but there were certaine rites and orders ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apostles in diuerse churches, which were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to writing, because they were not to continue and endure for euer in the Church: as that precept Act. 16. that the Gentiles should abstaine from strangled, and from bloud. Thirdly, we also graunt that the Church may vse externall rites and orders either left by tradition, or ordained by the Church for decencie and comelynesse, and tending to edification. But we constantly affirme, that there are no traditions in the Church of God necessarie to saluation beside scripture: wherein all things are conteined necessarie to saluation, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith and manners.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is not lawfull, as to take ought from the word of God, so to adde any thing vnto it. Deut. 12.32. Apocal. 22.18. But they which bring in traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie beside the scriptures, do adde vnto them, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the proposition the Iesuite aunswereth, that all addition to the word of God is not forbidden, for the Prophets did write after <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp; the Apostles after the Euangelistes. We aunswere: that those holy men had authoritie from God to compile scripture, if the Papistes haue the like Apostolike authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for their traditions, let them shew it, and we will beleeue them. Secondly, the Prophetes did but explane <hi>Moses,</hi> and expound the law, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did as it were set forth their Commentaries vpon the Gospell: this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was no addition, because they did not derogate from the perfection of the scriptures any way.</p>
                        <p>To the assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they aunswere, that their traditions are but expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20636:28"/>
Scripture. We aunswere, their traditions are cleane contrarie to Scripture, as the worshipping of Images, and the sacrifice of their Masse: and they adde to Scripture, making it vnperfect, saying, it doth not conteine all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to saluation. Wherefore they can not escape that curse, which they runne into that adde to the word of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 All traditions among the Iewes besides the law were condemned Math. 15.3. <hi>Ergo</hi> all vnwritten traditions now must be abolished. The Iesuite aunswereth. First, Christ condemned not the auncient traditions of <hi>Moses,</hi> but those which were newly and lately inuented. Aunswere, first the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh no mention of any such traditions of <hi>Moses:</hi> Christ biddeth them search the Scriptures, not runne vnto traditions. Secondly, these see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be auncient traditions, bearing the name of Elders traditions, and they were in great authoritie amongest, the Iewes: most like because of some long continuance.</p>
                        <p>Secondly (saith he) Christ findeth fault with wicked and impious traditions. Aunswere. First, their traditions were not openly and plainly euill and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but had some shew of holynesse, as the washing of pots, and tables, and beds. I would the Papists did not here take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues by the nose, whose tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come nearer to open impietie, and blasphemie, then theirs did. Secondly, Christ in opposing the Scripture against traditions, therein condemneth all traditions not written, besides the Scripture.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 If <hi>Paule</hi> preaching the whole Gospell. Act. 20.27. did say none other things then <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophetes, then all things necessarie to saluation are conteined in the Scriptures. For it can not be said to be a whole and perfite Gospell, if any thing necessarie to saluation be wanting. But <hi>Paule</hi> preached nothing, but out of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophetes. Act. 26.22. <hi>Ergo</hi> much more now is the Scripture a perfect rule of faith: we hauing beside <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, the holy writings of the Euangelistes and Apostles.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Last of all, although we might multiplie many arguments, but these I trust, strongly concluding out of Scripture, may serue as a sufficient bulwarke against all Popish paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bullets.

                        <p n="1">1 They first alledge certaine places of Scripture, as Math. 3. the Church is compared to a barne floore, where there is both chaff and corne.

                        <p>We answere to the first, who would haue said, as the Iesuite doth, that there are partes in the body, that receiue neither life nor sense of the body: doth he meane the nayles and heares, as he seemeth to geue instance in the end of the Chapter: but they are no partes of the body but excrements: he is so deepe in his sophistrie, that he hath forgotten Philosophie: and yet they receiue some gift from the body, for they grow &amp; encrease, but the wicked receiue no grace at all from the Church. The Rhemistes yet are more reasonable, that say the wicked in the church, are as ill humors and superfluous excrements in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, rather then liuely partes therof. 1. <hi>Iohan.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.</p>
                        <p>To the second, is a dead bow or a braunch, I pray you, any part of the tree? I thinke not: the tree can not conueniently spare any one of the partes therof: but the dead partes are hurtfull and combersome, and it doth the tree good to cut them of. But that they haue preuented vs, we would haue vsed no better argument against them, then this drawen from the resemblance of a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for as what is in the body receiuing no life nor power from the body is not properly a part of the body, howsoeuer it seeme to be ioyned to the body: so the wicked although they be in the outward face of the Church, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not partakers of the spirituall life thereof by Christ, are not truly to be iudged members of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 If wicked men should not be right members of the Church, but the faithfull and predestinate, we should be vncertaine which is the true Church, which is not to be admitted, because the whole doctrine, and all the principles of Religion do depend of the testimonie of the Church. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
                        <p>We aunswere. First, although it is necessarie that the true Church should be certainly knowen, yet not for that cause, which the Iesuite pretendeth: for the Religion of Christians is grounded vpon the Scriptures, and although the true Church doth geue a notable testimonie thereunto, yet doth not our faith depend vpon their witnesse, testimonie, or allowance. Secondly, the true visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church is certainly knowen by the preaching of the word and the right vse of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: so that we doubt not but there is the true Church, where we finde these markes: neither is it needfull to know the estate of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular member thereof, for so long, as all actions in the Church are directed and ordered by the rule of Gods word, we neede not to doubt to commit our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to that Church, howsoeuer otherwise men do stand before God: and yet, so much as is necessarie, the faithfull may be iudged &amp; knowen by their fruites.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 The foundation of the Church is visible: therefore the Church is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the proportion they proue thus: for whether we affirme Christ, or <hi>Peter</hi> to be the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church: both of them are now visible in him which is the Vicare of Christ, and <hi>Peters</hi> successor.</p>
                        <p>We answere. First, we vtterly denie either <hi>Peter</hi> to be the foundation of the Church, or els the Pope to be his lawfull successor: for <hi>Peter</hi> is no more the foundation of the Church, then all the Prophetes and Apostles. Ephe. 2.20. whose doctrine is the foundation, not their persons. And as for the Pope, we care not so much for outward successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in place, which notwithstanding they can not proue to haue bene perpetuall without interruption, as we do require a succession of faith and doctrine. Secondly, we affirme that Christ is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but not the visible beholding of Christ, with the carnall eyes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in his name, for when <hi>Peter</hi> had vttered that notable confession of Christ, he said that flesh and bloud had not reuealed it but his father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: but if the beholding of Christ, had geuen <hi>Peter</hi> a sight of the foundation, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flesh had reuealed it vnto him, his carnall eyes had brought him to Christ. Thirdly, we may much better returne this argument vpon them selues: that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20636:31"/>
because the foundation of the Church, which is faith in Christ, is inuisible, therefore the Church is inuisible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 They heape vp many places of Scriptures, but to small purpose as Math. 18. tell the Church. Actes. 15. when they came to Ierusalem they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the Church, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Paule</hi> persecuted the Church: how could the church be persecuted, how could it receiue the Apostles, if it were not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible? <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                        <p>We answere, what goodly reasons here be: a particular church such as was at Ierusalem may be seene, <hi>Ergo</hi> the catholike and vniuersall. Secondly, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular church may be sometime visible, <hi>Ergo</hi> alwayes. Thirdly, the church is visible vnto the faithfull, as in time of persecution, for to <hi>Paule</hi> it was not knowen, when he persecuted it, but onely to the brethren, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is visible to the world. For these three points they must proue that the catholike church not a particular is visible, that the Church is not sometime but alway visible, yea and to the world, or else they say nothing: for shame masters make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arguments.</p>

                        <p>We answere.

                        <p>To this we make answere, the Apostle vnderstandeth the whole vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall church in heauen and earth, which both make but one familie, Ephe. 3.15. for here he nameth not onely the spirites of iust men which are in heauen, but the faithfull vpon earth, whose names are written in heauen: the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (saith he) of the first borne: the wordes are <gap reason="foreign">

Againe (saith he) ye are come, not ye shall come: they had now left the smoking mountaine Sinay, and were come to Sion, the church vnder the Gospell. Wherefore this is a most firme and inuincible argument: the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church is the vniuersall number of Gods chosen in heauen and in earth, <hi>Ergo</hi> inuisible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 We will giue an instance: In the dayes of <hi>Elias</hi> the church was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, for he camplaineth, and saith that he was onely left alone, 1. King. 19.10. <hi>Ergo</hi> the church is not alway visible.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Annot. in Rom. 11. ver. 4.</note>The Rhemistes answere. First, at that time the church was visible in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> the souldiers were numbred to 1000. thousand, 2. Chron. 17. We aunswere againe. First, belike they haue taken a more exact account of them then the Lord him selfe: for he (saith he) had reserued 7000, 1.

Thirdly, to beleeue that there is an holy catholike church is an article of our faith, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is inuisible.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmin</hi> answereth. First, the holinesse of the church is inuisible. We reply, so the church is partly visible, partly inuisible by his confession. First, why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do ye define the catholike church to be a visible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if it be not wholly &amp; altogether visible? they know that <hi>difinitio</hi> must <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenire definito,</hi> the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must agree wholly to that which is defined: but now it is not: for they say, the catholike holy church is partly visible as it is a church, partly inuisible as it is holy. Secondly, do we not say in the Creede, <hi>Credo Catholicam,</hi> as well as <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Sanctam,</hi> I beleeue a catholike church, as well as I beleeue the holy church? then it is also inuisible, as it is catholike, because this also is part of the article: see I pray you what shifting is here?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he answereth, that some thing is seene in the church, some thing beleeued: for we see that visible companie of men, which make the church, but whether that companie be the true church, we do not see it, but beleeue it.</p>
                        <p>We reply againe. First, the Iesuite hath not yet proued that some thing is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20636:32"/>
seene in the church, some thing beleeued: but one thing is seene, namely the congregation as they are men, another thing is beleeued, that they are the church: the sight and beliefe now by his owne confession are not both in the church. Secondly, we denie that the vniuersall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of the catholike church, which is the number of the predestinate can be seene, therefore all is beleeued, and nothing seene. Thirdly, he saith that by faith we know which is the true church: <hi>Ergo</hi> by faith we know which are the members of the church: <hi>Ergo</hi> by faith the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers do know them selues to be of the Church: therefore faith is requisite in the true members of the church: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnfaithfull men can not be true members of the church, which point the Iesuite strongly before main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against vs. <hi>Mendacem oportet esse memorem,</hi> a lyar had need haue a good memorie: lest he tell contrarie tales, and so hath the Iesuite here, for before he denied that faith was requisite to make a true member of the church: here he saith that without faith a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be knowen, much lesse therfore made.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The Rhemistes confesse in these very words, that in the raigne of (their imagined and supposed) Antichrist the externall state of the Romane church, and publike entercourse of the faithfull with the same shall cease, and that there shalbe onely a communion in hart with it, and practise in secret, <hi>Annot. in.</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.

                        <p n="2">2 They heape many arguments together. The church hath the spirite of God, to lead it into all truth, the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it. Math. 16. God hath geuen it Apostles, teachers, Euangelistes to keepe it in the truth. Ephe. 4. Christ hath prayed for the church, that it may be sanctified in the veritie. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17. Christ prayed that <hi>Peters</hi> faith should not faile, <hi>Ergo</hi> the church can not erre. <hi>Rhemens. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                        <p>We answere: euery one of the elect hath the spirite of God, neither shall the gates of hell preuaile against the faith of any one of the elect to ouerthrow it: Christ prayeth for euery one of his Disciples that they may be sanctified in the truth. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.20. wherefore it foloweth as well by these arguments, that no one faithfull man can fall into error.

                        <p>We aunswere. First, <hi>S. Paule</hi> speaketh there of a glorious church, such as it shalbe in the kingdome of heauen, not of the church as it is vpon earth: so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 7.14. The elders, which sat round about the throne, which are the Saintes

                        <p n="2">2 It foloweth out of this place that the church is as well without sinne, as free from error: which the diuines in the Councell did also graunt. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their owne confession euery member of the church, being clothed in this mortall flesh sinneth, how can the church be without sinne? If the church consist of men, and all men are sinners, how is the church free? If all the partes and members be sinnefull, how is not the whole also polluted with sinne? If all the partes of the body be sicke and diseased, how can the whole be sound? The church also is not ashamed to confesse her selfe to be blacke. Cant. 1.5. she shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be made bewtifull and glorious without all spot &amp; blemish in the kingdome of God: and euen now also is made righteous and iust before God through Christ: not because she hath no sinne, but because it is remitted: and although some errors and imperfections remaine, yet shall they be no hinderaunce to her saluation.</p>

                        <p>WE doubt not to say, that the church of God may erre in some points not necessarie to saluation: but can not fall cleane away from God into any da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable error. <hi>Fulk. annot. in Ephe.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 29.

                        <p n="1">1 When our Sauiour Christ suffred, the church erred in faith, <hi>Ergo</hi> it may erre: the proposition is thus proued. The church was either in the Scribes and Pharisies, or els in the Apostles: but both of them erred: they in putting Christ to death, the other in their incredulitie, not beleeuing rightlie in the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aunswereth, first that the Pharisies were priuiledged not to erre,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Eccles. cap. 17.</note> onely till the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ. We replie againe. First, after Christ was come they sate in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, and Christ biddeth they should be heard. Math. 23.2. if they erred not afore, neither could they now, for they were not displaced out of <hi>Moses</hi> chaire: but the truth is, they neuer had any such priuiledge not to erre. Secondly, if the Pharisies were now prone to error, then by our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries owne confession, they ceased to be the church, <hi>Ergo</hi> the church was not now visible, for in them it was not: and the Apostles fled from Christ, and shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them selues: how could then the church be visible to the world?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Iesuite aunswereth concerning the Apostles. First, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were not yet entred into their office and Bishoprike, but onely appointed to it, and therefore they might erre. We replie againe. First they were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed Apostles, but partly already they had exercised their Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: for they were sent forth to preach the Gospell, and had power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to worke miracles, and heale diseases Math. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how then is not the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite ashamed to say, that they were not yet Pastors nor Apostles? Secondly, if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20636:34"/>
the Pharisies erred, and the Apostles erred, then all the world was in error, <hi>Ergo</hi> by their saying at this instant there was no church vpon the earth, which is a great absurditie, for the church erreth not, they say.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, (saith the Iesuite) the Apostles erred not in faith: they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for not beleeuing the resurrection: which beliefe because they had not yet receiued, they could not loose it. We reply. First, though they had not erred in any materiall point: yet if there were any error at all in them, it is sufficient for our purpose: that they erred it is manifest, for they fled away from Christ. Secondly, he excuseth them for their infidelitie concerning the resurrection, because this faith they had not yet receiued. But had not Christ (I pray you) often instructed them of this matter: and if this were no such error in them, then Christ was to sharpe in reprouing them for their infidelitie. Thirdly, it appeareth, that they wholly were deceiued concerning the Messiah: Luke. 24.21. the two Disciples say, they trusted that it had bene he that should haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered Israell: see then what weake aunswers these are: did these felowes thinke, that their gloses should not be examined? or that their dreames should be taken for oracles?</p>

                        <p>By the continuance of the truth and right faith, we gather, that there haue bene alwayes faithfull teachers, though not notorious to the world, and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be: but who they were, and where they liued, what pompe, what authoritie they were of, it is not materiall to know: wherefore an outward visible succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Bishops and Pastors is not necessarie for the continuance of the truth: neither can it be concluded out of this place.</p>

                     <p>Now we will briefly declare, what oppugners and gainsayers they haue had in all ages, since their grossest opinions began to be receiued: Such were <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramus</hi> and <hi>Bere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>garius</hi> about pope <hi>Hildebrands</hi> time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that mightily impugned the grosse opinion of Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Robertus Gallus</hi> 1291. <hi>Robert Grosthead</hi> Bishop of Lincolne, who was called <hi>malleus Romanoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the mallet or hammar of the Romanes <hi>anno.</hi> 1250. <hi>Franciscus Petrarcha</hi> 1350. <hi>Iohannes de rupe Scissa,</hi> who Prophesied against the Pope 1340. with many other,<note place="margin">Fox.

Wherefore it is a great vntruth, which the Iesuite doth so stifly auouch that we can not set down the pedegree &amp; discent of their church and faith, and how it hath continually bene resisted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Now whereas they say, that they can name the ringleaders of our sect: we haue none other maisters and authors of our faith, then our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles, by whose holy writings we refuse not to be tryed: But you flye from the light: you disgrace the Scriptures, making them imperfect, and insufficient: this the true Disciples of Christ would not do, you are the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ, as the Pharisies bragged, that they were the Disciples of <hi>Moses:</hi> And as then the true church was not in those that sat in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, though they could alledge great antiquitie, but in Christ and his Apostles: so is not now the true Church to be discerned, by custome or number of yeares, but by that truth, which was taught and preached by our blessed Sauiour, and his Apostles.</p>

                     <p>That it is vniuersall, they first proue by the name of Catholike, which is, say they, by Gods prouidence appropriat to them, which name they affirme without ground to haue bene imposed by the Apostles vpon true beleeuers. <hi>Rhem. in Act. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>We aunswere. First, the name of Christians is a more honorable title then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20636:37"/>
the name of Catholikes: for it is manifest Act. 11.26. that this name was vsed in the Apostles time, and by the Apostles them selues allowed: but it is not certaine that the name Catholike came from the Apostles. Againe many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes chalenged this name to be called Catholikes, who did not so easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to be called Christians: which ancient and honorable name the Papistes do despise, for in Italie and at Rome it is vsed as a name of reproch, to signifie a dolt or a foole. <hi>Fulk. in Acts.</hi> 11.26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 We say that you doe vsurpe this name, as the Donatistes in <hi>Augustines</hi> time would be called Catholikes: for what is the name of Catholike, without the Catholike doctrine? They are the true Catholikes, that professe the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Apostolike faith: to vs therefore, be it knowen to you, this name of better right appertaineth, then to you (ô ye Papists) yet we haue better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to proue our Church by, then by sillables and titles: <hi>Quasi nos</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine) huius nominis testimonio nitamur ad demonstrandam Ecclesiam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epist. 48.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; non promissis Dei.</hi> As though we (saith he) do leane vpon this name to proue our Church by, and not rather vpon the promises of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they proue their vniuersalitie, by the multitude of people, that haue receiued the Romish faith: and their Church (say they) hath replenished the greatest part of the world. They would proue this by the propagation of the Church, in the Apostles time, in <hi>Tertulian, Irenaeus, Hierome, Augustine,</hi> yea and afterward in <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes: yea and now also besides many great coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tryes in Europe, they haue of their church in India, America, &amp; the vnknowen parts of the world. <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>nota.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>We aunswere. First, the truth is not alwayes to be measured by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or opinion of the multitude: folow not a multitude saith the Scripture to do euill: the greatest part is not the best: Christ calleth his flocke <hi>pusillum gregem,</hi> a litle flocke, feare not litle flocke (saith he). Secondly, you haue nothing to do with the Church, which was propagated in the Apostles time, nor for the space of fiue or six hundred yeares after Christ: it was not your Church, for the most of your heresies are more lately sprong vp then so. And you need not bragge of your vniuersalitie now: for the Turke (I trow) hath a larger do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion then the Pope, and Mahometisme is as largely spread as Papistrie, and further to: And for Europe, I hope you neede not make your boast: the Pope had neuer lesse iurisdiction, then he hath now, and I trust euery day, shall haue lesse. But many (you say) in the new found countryes, haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In deed, if you had had grace, such an opportunitie being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the Spaniards had, you might haue won that simple people to Christ. But you thirsted more for their gold, then for their soules health: it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously knowen to the world, what extreme crueltie hath bene wrought vpon that innocent people. Was that a Catholike part of the Spaniardes to keepe dogges of purpose, to werry and destroy the inhabitants, to vse them as horse and beastes, to plough, to carry, to digge? Thus by your crueltie, there were out of one small Iland called Hispaniola, which was well peopled and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20636:37"/>
destroyed and rooted out in short time, two milions of men and women, the storie of <hi>Benzo</hi> an Italian is abroad to be seene of this matter: you haue none or few of your Popish Catholikes in those countryes, but of your owne brood, that haue bene sent thither, but enough of this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 We nothing doubt, but that our faith, the truth of the Gospell hath bene long since knowen and published to the whole world.</p>
                     <p>Those two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, which the Iesuite putteth in, to make the Church v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall, do helpe vs very well: the first is, that it is not necessarie, that all cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes wholly should professe the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith: but it suffiseth, if there be some of the church in euery country: the second, it is not requisite, that this vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitie of the Church should be all at one time, but if it be done successiue, that is, in diuerse ages, one country to be ioyned to the Church after another, it is enough.</p>
                     <p>Now keeping these two conditions, we shall easily proue our Church to be vniuersall: for there are no countryes in Europe, and few in the whole world, wherein there are not some of our faith, namely that abhorre worshipping of Images, do onely hope to be saued by faith in Christ without merite, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the rest, as we do. And againe taking one age after another, we shall easily make it good, that our faith at times hath spread it selfe ouer the whole world.</p>

                     <p>We aunswer. First, they can not shew such an entier and perpetuall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without any interruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or discontinuance for so many yeares: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time there were two, sometime three Popes together, and this schisme conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued 29. yeares, till the Councell of Constance, where three Popes were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at once, <hi>Benedict</hi> 13. the Spanish Pope: <hi>Gregorie</hi> 12. the French Pope, and <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. the Italian Pope.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If succession be so sure a note of the Church, it is found also in other Churches besides: as in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople, where hath bene a perpetuall succession, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> saith, from <hi>S. Andrew</hi> the Apostle: in Antioch from <hi>S. Peter:</hi> and in other Churches in Grecia. The Iesuite here is driuen to his shiftes, and hath nothing to say, but this: that the argument foloweth negatiuely, that where there is no succession, there is no Church: not affirmatiuely, that where any succession can be shewed, there straightwayes it should folow there is a true Church: so by the Iesuites owne confession he hath made but a bad argument for the Church of Rome: we haue a perpetuall succession of Popes from the Apostles time, <hi>Ergo</hi> we are the Church. It foloweth not: saith the Iesuite, we graunt it. Why then a litle before did he call it <hi>insolubile argumentum,</hi> an inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20636:38"/>
and vnanswerable argument.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Thirdly we say, that a succession of persons in the same place, without succession of doctrine, which they can not shew, is nothing worth. A succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Apostolike faith and doctrine proueth a continuance of pastors and teachers, and not contrariwise. We haue the Apostolike faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we doubt not but that there haue bene continually in the Church faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teachers, by whom that doctrine hath bene preserued and kept: though they were not famous, nor carried a glorious shew in the world. For that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward succession is not necessarie, neither so much to be stood vpon. <hi>Augustine,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had alledged succession against heretikes, concludeth thus: <hi>Quanquam non tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nos de istis documentis praesumamus,</hi>

Their vnitie also is seene, say they, in the wonderfull consent of all their writers in matters of Religion: and the notable agreement and concord in the decrees of their Popes and Councels. But as for vs, and our Church, they say it is full of rents, schismes and diuisions. <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First of the vnitie of their church, and then of the vnitie of ours. Their vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they say, is partly seene in their obedience, and louing societie and felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, partly in their Religion and doctrine.</p>
                     <p>First for their concord and loue one toward another: we will take some paynes, a litle to decypher it. About the yeare of the Lord 900. there was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sport amongest the Popes, nine of them one after another. <hi>Stephen</hi> the sixth abrogated all his predecessor <hi>Formosus</hi> decrees: and not content with that, he tooke vp his body which was buried, and cut two fingers of his right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d off, and commaunded his body to be buried againe. After him succeeded Pope <hi>Rhomanus, Theodorus</hi> the second, <hi>Iohn</hi> the tenth, who ratified and confirmed the doings of <hi>Formosus.</hi> After them folowed Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> who disanulling all their actes, tooke vp againe the body of <hi>Formosus,</hi> cut of his head, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his body to be throwen into Tiber the great riuer in Rome.<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 146.</note> Was not here great amitie and loue thinke you, amongest the Popes?</p>
                     <p>Another notable example of their vnitie we haue in Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> time the 6. against whom stood vp a contrarie Pope in Fraunce named <hi>Clement</hi>: it is worth the noting, what coyle these two popes kept: between who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes were fought, many thousands slaine. Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> beheaded fiue Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals together after long torments. Bishop <hi>Aquilonensis,</hi> because he did ride no faster, was had in suspition, and slayne and cut in peeces by <hi>Vrbans</hi> souldiers, at his commaundement,<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 434.</note> behold here I pray you the vnitie of these Catholikes.</p>
                     <p>We will adioyne one other example, no longer since, then in king <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time. The Duke of Bourbon being the leader of the Emperors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20636:38"/>
layd siege to Rome, and sacked it: the souldiers brake in vpon the Pope, which was <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth being at Masse, slew diuerse of the Priests, and one Cardinall called <hi>Sanctorum quatuor:</hi> they layd siege to the Castle of S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, so long till the Pope yeelded him selfe. The souldiers dayly that lay at the siege, made iestes of the Pope: sometime they had one riding like the Pope with a whore behind him, sometimes he blessed, sometime he cursed: sometime with one voyce they would call him Antichrist. See here is their Catholike obedience to their chief Bishop.<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 988.</note> Thus much concerning their vnitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in life.</p>
                     <p>Let vs likewise take a view of their vnitie in doctrine. We heard before how Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> abolished the decrees of <hi>Formosus:</hi> how then saith the Iesuite, that the decrees of Popes do consent together? The Councell of Basile, and Constance before that decreed, that the Pope should be subiect to generall Councels: but this Canon was afterward reuersed, and now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Papists hold the contrary, that the Pope is aboue Councels.</p>
                     <p>Let vs see the consent of their writers: <hi>Bellarmin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de verbo. cap.</hi> 12. main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth against <hi>Lyranus, Driedo, Genebrard,</hi> and others, that <hi>Iudith</hi> was in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi> time. Against <hi>Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> that heretikes are no members of the Church. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccles. cap.</hi> 4. Against <hi>Iohannes de turre cremata,</hi> that faith is not necessarie to make one a member of the Church. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccles. cap.</hi> 10. And euery where the Iesuite taketh great libertie to confute and controll o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his felow Papistes: belike hauing found out some starting holes, that they either knew not, or were ashamed to creepe into, as the Iesuite doth.</p>
                     <p>But (saith he) we denie not but that we haue dissentions, but they are not in materiall points, but in such things as appertaine not to faith. I meruaile, he blusheth not thus to say, him selfe knowing the contrary. Is it not a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall point and belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to faith, to know which bookes are canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are not? But in this question they do much disagree. <hi>Caietanus</hi> the Cardinall saith, that we must acknowledge no Scripture, but that which was either written, or approued by the Apostles. But <hi>Catharinus</hi> a Papist, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that opinion. <hi>Hugo Cardinalis, Arias Montanus,</hi> do hold no bookes of the old Testament to be canonicall, which are written onely in Greeke: the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes now generally hold the contrary. <hi>Ex Whitacher.</hi> 1. <hi>contr. c. quaest. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith, that all those opinions, which the Church holdeth, as articles or preceptes of faith, were deliuered by the Apostles: &amp; that the Church must not now seeke for new reuelations, but content her selfe, with the Apostolike traditions and doctrine, <hi>de Scriptur. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Out of the which words it doth necessarily folow, that the church is not now to fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any new article of faith: but this generally is denied by the Papistes: and <hi>Stapleton</hi> an English Papist, is not ashamed to say, that the Church, may adde more bookes to the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture, by her absolute authoritie.</p>
                     <p>Further, to beleeue that the virgine <hi>Marie</hi> was without sinne, yea concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without originall sinne, is now amongest the Papistes receiued for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20636:39"/>
of faith: and therefore in Paris none are admitted to be Doctors of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, which doe not first confirme this article by their oth. Yet this was a great question betweene the <hi>Scotistes</hi> and <hi>Thomistes,</hi> and a great and hote contention arose about this controuersie <hi>anno.</hi> 1476. betweene the <hi>Dominicke</hi> Friers, who affirmed that she was conceiued in sinne, and the <hi>Franciscanes,</hi> that held the contrary.<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 801.</note> But these <hi>Franciscanes</hi> had the vpper hand, and foure of the other order were condemned and burned for it at Berne: and yet for all this our aduersaries will say still, that they varie not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in matters of faith. Thus we haue seene, what is to be thought of Popish vnitie.</p>
                     <p>Now to answere briefly to their false accusation, whereby they charge vs with manifold schismes and dissentions: yea <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is not ashamed to say, that an hundred seuerall sectes are sprong amongest vs. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Eccles.</hi>

                     <head>The fift Note of the power of working miracles.</head>
                     <p>THis they affirme both to be necessarie in the Church, to haue power to work <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>22</label> miracles, for the confirmation of the faith, when there is any extraordinarie chaunge or innouation of religion, and that it is a sufficient note to describe the Church: for it cannot bee, say they, but that, wheresoeuer this power is found, there should be the true Church.</p>
                     <p>And hereupon they take occasion to extoll the miracles of their Church: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the Apostles time, and so in euerie age they take vpon them to shew, that their Church neuer wanted those that were endued with this power. <hi>Bellar. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>We answere. First, the gift of miracles doth no more prooue that to bee the true Church where they are wrought, then they to be holie men and elected of God, that doe them: The Magicians wrought many straunge things in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tending a great while with <hi>Moses:</hi> Antichrist shal come working with signes and wonders. 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2. Therefore this proueth not a Church. But heere they haue a double euasion: these were false miracles, wrought by the diuell, as those of the Magicians, or els but forged, and onely to the eye, and in outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as Antichrist is sayd to come with lying wonders. We replye. First, they are called lying wonders, not that they are done in shewe onely, and haue no such thing indeede, but because they are wrought to confirme lyes, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the trueth. Secondly, your miracles are very like to be such, both wrought by the power of the diuell, and some of them but iugling feates of cousoners. Thirdly, yet a wicked man may haue power to worke miracles, not in shewe, but verily and indeed, as to cast out diuels, and to doe it in the name and power of Christ, and yet be none of Christs disciples. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Concerning your miracles wee answere, that they are either fables, and old wiues tales, and no credite to bee giuen vnto them, or els they are one of those two sorts, whereof <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh:<note place="margin">De vnitat. eccl. cap. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Remoueantur ista vel mendacia fallacium hominum, vel portenta me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacium spirituum.</hi> Away with those miracles, which are either cousoning trickes of deceitfull men, or wonders of lying spirits.</p>
                     <p>First, Monkish fables are not a whit daintie with our Romish Catholikes, their Legendes are full of them: As that of <hi>Berinus,</hi> how being in the middest of the sea, sayling into <hi>France,</hi> hauing forgotten somewhat at home,<note place="margin">Fox pag. 122.</note> went back walking vpon the sea, and came to them againe hauing not one thred of his garment wet. Many like tales are reported of <hi>Aldelmus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Malmesbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> as how he caused an infant at Rome of nine daies olde to speake, to cleare <hi>Sergius</hi> the Pope, who was thought to be his father: how he drew along a great piece of timber, that went to the making of the Church at <hi>Malmesburie.</hi> Such good stuffe also they haue of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Beuerley,</hi> of <hi>Egwine</hi> Abbot of <hi>Euesham,</hi> who when he had locked his feete in fetters, and cast the key into the sea, afterward a fish brought the key againe into the ship where he was sayling. Reade <hi>M. Foxe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20636:40"/>
pag.</hi> 125. All these and a thousand more are but Monkish fables and dreames, whatsoeuer the Iesuite maketh of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is out of doubt, that some of them were well practised with the diuell, and through his helpe could doe much. We will begin with <hi>Dunstane,</hi> who caused a Roode to speake, which was more strange, then that of <hi>Balaams</hi> asse: for the asse had life, though she had no reason, but this image had neither: <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> thinketh little better of <hi>Dunstane</hi> for this deede doing, but that he was a sorcerer. <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 158.</p>
                     <p>It is famous in histories, how <hi>Siluester</hi> the 2. was aduaunced to the Papacie by the diuell, and gaue himselfe vnto him, and how, hauing some remorse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, he confessed the fact before the people, and willed that his bodie should be drawne of wilde horse when he was dead,<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 167.</note> and there be buried where the horse left it of their owne accord. How much such diabolicall practises are fauoured by the sea of Rome, may appeare by this one example, which we will now touch: In Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> dayes, not many yeares agoe, there was a most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable thing practised in Rome, euen vnder the Popes nose, and by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and sufferance. The citie of Rome being at that time grieuouslie scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and punished of God with the pestilence, there was one <hi>Demetrius</hi> a Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who with the good liking of the whole citie, to appease the wrath of their gods, tooke a wild Bull, whom with magicall enchantments he made so tame, that he led him with a twine thred,<note place="margin">Ex Paul. Iouio tom. 2. lib. 21.</note> and so sacrificed him: And this being done, the sicknes somewhat slaked. Call ye this the Church of God, that suffreth such heathenish and abhominable superstitions to be done in it? Or shall I take these men for Christians, that doe allow the idolatrous and diuellish sacrifices of the heathen?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let vs see what pretie fine iugling casts haue been wrought by the Papists to deceiue the people. In King <hi>Henries</hi> dayes, there was a monstrous Idoll called the Rood of grace, which was made so with wiers and ingins, that one standing within could make euery part of the Idoll to moue, the hands, the eyes, the mouth: if a man brought but a small piece of siluer, it would hang downe the lippe; if it were a good piece, then should his iawes goe merilie: This abhominable Idoll by the Lord <hi>Cromwels</hi> meanes was broken downe, and the engines and parts thereof shewed at Paules Crosse. Such a like thing was the bloud of <hi>Hales,</hi> which they made the people beleeue was some of Christs bloud, but in the ende it was found to be but the bloud of a drake, and shewed likewise at Paules Crosse. <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 1188. At <hi>Calis</hi> in the Sepulchre, it was said, there were three hostes besprinkled with bloud (as it was put in writing vnder Bull and Pardon:) but the place being searched at King <hi>Henries</hi> commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they found three white counters sodred in the stone with the top-bone of a sheepes tayle. <hi>pag.</hi> 1223. A thousand such forged deuises the Papists had, which they are not ashamed to maintaine for straunge and holy miracles. By this that hath been shewed, it is euident (I hope) to the indifferent reader, what small cause our aduersaries haue, to boast of their miracles.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:20636:40"/>3 Now to adde somewhat concerning the miracles of our Church. First, we truely say, that our doctrine is not newe nor straunge, and therefore, they are not to call for miracles at our hands. The miracles of Christ and his Apostles, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our miracles, seeing we professe the same doctrine, which was confirmed by those miracles. Secondly, yet, the Lord be thanked, we are not destitute of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Modò caro caeci non aperit oculos miraculo domini, at cor caecum aperit oculos sermone domini.</hi> Now, saith he, the blind doth not receiue his bodily sight by the power of Christ, but the blind heart is lightened and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate through the Gospell of Christ: Such miracles (the Lord be blessed) we can shewe: sinners are conuerted, afflicted consciences are comforted, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant are instructed, many are called by the preaching of the Gospell. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if this will not content them, but they still crye with open mouth, and say, where are your miracles? Behold, to stop their wide and clamorous mouth, we will shewe them also such miracles, as they looke for, like to which they haue none. Was not that a miracle, which <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> reporteth to haue been done at the Martyrdome of Master <hi>Hugh Spengler:</hi> who being cast into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and so drowned, presently all the water was coloured with bloud,<note place="margin">Ann. 1525.</note> he hauing receiued no wound nor hurt in his bodie before: at the which all the people were greatly amazed?</p>
                     <p>But what thinke you of that straunge signe which <hi>George Scherrer</hi> shewed at his death, who being beheaded, the bodie lay a pretie space vpon the bellie, till one might haue eaten an egge, and then turned it selfe vpon the backe, &amp; cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the right hand ouer the left, and the right legge ouer the left: the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates seeing it, hauing condemned his bodie to be burned before, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the sight hereof, caused it to be buried. <hi>Fox ex Math. Illyrico.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is worth the remembring, that is reported in the French stories of <hi>Petrus Burgerius</hi> a blessed Martyr: who was cast into a filthie dungeon, where a theefe had lien the space of eight moneths, being almost eaten vp with lice, and in such miserie, that he cursed his parents that bare him. This man through the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the prayers of the Martyr, felt such comfort in the Gospell, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very patient in his affliction: and after his conuersion this straunge thing was wrought vpon him: that whereas before he was so full of lice,<note place="margin">Fox ex Ioh. Crispin. pag. 907.</note> that he might haue plucked out twelue at once betweene two of his fingers, the next day he had not one.</p>
                     <p>Now, because the Iesuite hath such a spite at <hi>Luther</hi> (he is a great eye sore to him) we will in a word or two declare what straunge things were wrought by <hi>Luther.</hi> It is credible reported of him, that a certaine young man had bound himselfe by obligation to the diuell, sealed with his bloud to giue him his soule, so he might haue his wish and desire satisfied with money: In short time hee grewe to great wealth: the matter being disclosed with much adoe to <hi>Luther,</hi> he calleth the congregation together, and ioyneth in prayer for this yong man: and as they prayed, the obligation was cast in at the windowe.<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 864.</note> A notable and straunge miracle, which is crediblie reported of <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:20636:41"/>He was a man feruent in prayer: one might haue seen the teares falling from his eyes as he prayed: And as he was earnest in prayer, so his prayers wanted not effect, for as he himselfe confessed, he had obtayned of God, that so long as he liued, the Pope should not preuayle in his countrey. And is not this also a thing to be wondred at, that for all the Pope and Emperour ioyned together, &amp; bent their forces against this silly poore man; yet the Lord defended him from the Lyons teeth, and graunted him to end his dayes in peace?</p>
                     <p>Thus it is apparant and manifest, that the Lorde sheweth his miraculous power manie times in his Saints, to astonish the wicked: The great miracles which haue been declared in their holy martyrdomes, would fil a large volume: And by the grace of God, hereafter we may haue occasion in an other treatise of purpose, more at large to publish them. But these arguments wee doe not chiefly stand vpon: Yet thus much was not amisse by the way to be put in, to requite our aduersaries withall, who doe so greatly magnifie and extoll their Antichristian Church, for their lying and fayned miracles.</p>

                     <p>To the first we aunswere. 1.

                     <p>But they wil answere, that these were not true prophecies inspired of God, but vncertaine predictions of the diuell.

                     <p>The prophecies also of <hi>Sibill</hi> are wonderfull: which many yeares before the comming of Christ, prophecied of his incarnation, and of his passion, with the circumstances thereof, as how he should be crowned with thornes, that they should giue him vineger to drinke, how the vaile of the temple should be rent, &amp; darknes should couer the earth for three houres: &amp; he himself should rise the third day: yea she setteth down the very name of the Messiah, <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>

                     <p>To the second part, concerning this miraculous gift which our aduersaries pretend to haue: we answere. 1. They are but fables which they bring: for if al that is reported of Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his life, of his miracles, and prophecies, were true, neither S. <hi>Paul</hi> nor any of the Apostles were to be compared vnto him for number of miracles: such casting out of diuels out of men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, healing of strange diseases, foretelling of thinges to come: the Gospell almost hath not stranger things of our Sauiour Christ.</p>
                     <p>As for Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> you may gesse by this, what spirit he was of, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing to his followers, a certaine strict order of liuing, as to wear no girdle, to goe barefoote, and such like, he called it <hi>regulam euangelicam,</hi> the rule of the Gospell: belike making himselfe an other Christ, and so bringing in another Gospel: for to all Christs Disciples Christs Gospel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> is sufficient. 2. But if they haue any prophecies of credit, which they can shew, they are such, as are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> the 2. who had warrant from the diuel; that he should not die before he sung Masse in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and so it came to passe, for hauing sung Masse in a chappell so called, he immediately dyed. Not much vnlike to this was that of king <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. who ended his life in a chamber at Westminster
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20636:42"/>
called <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as he had an olde prophecie. <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. also was tolde that his successours name should begin with G. which was the cause of <hi>George</hi> the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> death, his owne brother: but the diuelish prophecie not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding tooke place,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 717.</note> for <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was king after him. In like manner <hi>Valence</hi> the Emperour had a blind prophecie, that one should raigne after him, whose name began with <hi>Theod.</hi> which made <hi>Theodorus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against him: but so it came to passe in deede, that <hi>Theodosius</hi> was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour after him. Such blinde prophecies we denie not but the popish Church hath had many, which as you see, doo cause murder, sedition, and bloodshed: but other good prophecies comming of GOD, wee knowe them not to haue any.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

Our aduersaries (I thinke) haue not to reioyce in these prophecies: neither haue any great cause to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge them for their Prophets. But I will help them a little, and bring to their remembrance a notable Prophetisse of theirs in king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. dayes, which was one <hi>Elizabeth Barton,</hi> a Nun, commonly called, the holy mayd of Kent, who beeing instructed by the Friers, fayned, as though she had many reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: she prophecied, that if the king proceeded in his diuorce, then in question betweene him and Q. <hi>Catherine,</hi> that hee should not be king one yeare, no not one moneth: But (GOD bee thanked) hee liued almoste twenty yeares after that, by whom many worthy things were wrought for the good of Christs Church. This prophetisse was afterward iustly met withall, and worthily suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her demerites, with all her accomplices: amongst the which, <hi>Fisher</hi> B. of <hi>Rochester</hi> was one,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 1055</note> who thereupon was imprisoned, and forfayted his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20636:42"/>
goods to the King. If they will bragge of their Prophets, let not the holy mayd of Kent be forgotten in any wise.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now lastly because they shall not outface vs with a vaine brag of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: I will shew what prophesies the Gospell hath beene adorned withall. Was not <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> a Prophet, who thus sayd at his death: <hi>centum reuolutis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis deo respondebitis:</hi> after an hundred years you shall giue account of this your doing vnto God? Likewise <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage, post centum annos vos omnes cito:</hi> I cite you all to make answere after an hundred yeares. Which prophesie of theirs tooke effect accordingly: for both these holy men suffered martyrdome about <hi>anno</hi> 1416. and iust an hundred yeares after, <hi>anno</hi> 1516. the Lord raysed vp <hi>Luther,</hi> who indeede called the Pope and his doctrine to account.</p>
                     <p>Was not <hi>Sauonarola</hi> a Prophet, that sayd one should passe ouer the <hi>Alpes</hi> like <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who should destroy all Italie? and is it not so come to passe? for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nor whosoeuer els could haue more layde wast the popish Italian Church then the word of God hath done, and the liuely preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. <hi>Walter Brute</hi> prophecied that the temporalities should be taken from the Clergie for the multitude of their sinnes:<note place="margin">Fox. p. 500.</note> this <hi>Walter</hi> liued in king <hi>Richards</hi> dayes the second. <hi>Bilney</hi> that constant martyr and faythful seruant of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, that many Preachers should come after him, which should preach the same fayth that hee had taught, and should conuert many from their errors. And many such examples wee haue of holy martyrs and worthy Prophets: But we hereby doe not proue our Church: Yet this I hope hath not been out of the way, to haue aunswered a little to our aduersaries vaine and vntrue bragges.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto, we haue touched the principall notes and markes whereby the Papists doe decipher out their Church vnto vs: Now it followeth, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the right and certaine signes of the true Church.</p>

                     <p>THe outward tokens whereby the true visible Church is discerned, are not many in number, as our aduersaries doe reckon vp many: the Iesuite no lesse than 15. supplying belike in number that which they want in waight. Neither in this place doe we speake of the vniuersal Catholike inuisible Church which is beleeued and not seen, being an article of our faith: but of particular visible Churches, which are discerned and knowen by these two essentiall markes, the true preaching of the word, and right vse of the sacraments: Some also doe adde a third, namely, ecclesiasticall discipline. <hi>Beza confess. de eccles. art:</hi> 7. <hi>Hooper</hi> vpon the Creede <hi>articul:</hi> 72. But this partly is comprehended in the 2. former: for there cannot be hearing &amp; preaching of the worde, &amp; the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of the sacraments, vnlesse there bee an exercise of Church discipline: partly also we say that it is not so essential a note, as the other are: for the absence of the other make a nullity of the Church: If the word or sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in substance
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20636:43"/>
be corrupted, the Church also is defaced: but if there be not an exact forme of discipline, it doth not straightway cease to be a Church: Wherfore we conclude, that the true preaching of the word, and right vse of the sacraments, are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary and essentiall notes of the Church: Where these two are rightly vsed according to Gods worde, there is a right Church, as here in England God be blessed: Where they are falsely and impurely handled, there is a false and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Church, as among the Papists: where they are not at all in vse, there is no Church, as amongst the Turkes, Iewes, and Infidels.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>BEllarmine</hi> thus argueth: the true notes of the Church ought to be proper and particular, not common and generall, as these are: for euery sect of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks doe chalenge to themselues the right preaching of the word, and vsage of the sacraments. <hi>Ergo</hi> they are no true notes.</p>
                     <p>We answere. 1. It skilleth not how many do lay clayme to those notes: the word of God it self is a manifest iudge, where pure doctrine is taught, and the sacraments rightly kept according to the institution. It is no matter, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Papists and other heretickes doe make their bragges, the scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues can soone decide this question. 2. I maruaile they are not ashamed to obiect, that our notes are common, seeing theirs are most common: for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assemblies of hereticks, but euen the heathen and Idolatrous Gentiles might as well prooue themselues to be the Church, by those popish notes, of vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitie, for Idolatrie had ouer-spread the whole world; of vnitie, they all consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to persecute the Church of Christ; of antiquitie, for the worship of Idols continued aboue two thousand yeares: of succession, for the monarch of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> endured 1300. yeares, their kings all this while one succeeding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They had also Prophets, and such as wrought miracles. Our aduersaries may be now ashamed to cast vs in the teeth, that our notes are common, when as theirs doe well agree to the Synagogues of Sathan, and assemblies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sayth he, the note or the marke must be better knowen and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, then the thing marked or notified by it: so are not these: for we know not which is the worde of God, nor what bookes are canonicall, and to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for scripture, but by the Church.</p>
                     <p>We answere: the Iesuite still beggeth that which is in question: a foule fault in a professed disputer: for haue we not largely prooued before 1. <hi>contr. quaest.</hi> 4. that the Church dependeth vpon the authoritie of the scripture, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, and that there is no more certaine and euident and vndoubted thing in the whole world, vpon the which a man may bee bolde to builde and ground his faith, then vpon the scriptures? This sure is a childish and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous argument, to take that as graunted, which is most of all in controuersie.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:20636:43"/>3 The true notes (sayth hee) are inseparable from the Church: it is neuer without them. But many true Churches haue wanted these: The Church of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was a true Church, and yet they beleeued not the resurrection. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. The <hi>Galathians</hi> were a true Church, and yet they held that <hi>Moses</hi> lawe was to bee obserued together with the Gospell. And, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> likewise did not sincerely obserue the Sacraments. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are no true signes.</p>
                     <p>We answere. First, this argument may with better right bee returned vpon their owne head: for many true Churches haue wanted their markes: Christ and his Apostles had neither succession from <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor vniuersalitie, and yet they made the true Church. The Church of the Iewes after <hi>Malachies</hi> time had no Prophets, nor miracles, for the space of 400. yeares before Christ, &amp; yet were they the true Church, and so of the rest of your notes, the Church of Christ hath many times wanted them. Secondly, It was not the whole Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi> that doubted of the resurrection, but certaine false Apostles that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to seduce others. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.34. Some of you (sayth the Apostle) haue not the knowledge of God: he saith, not all. So likewise amongst the <hi>Galathians,</hi> there were false teachers, that stood for the lawe of <hi>Moses: Galath.</hi> 5.9. a little leauen doth marre the whole lumpe. It was not therefore a publike doctrine in the Church, but secretly taught by false Apostles. Thirdly, there may be some error in the Church, but being not fundamental, such an one as destroyeth faith, it doth not dissolue the Church: as there was some abuse amongst the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> in receiuing the Sacrament: but the forme and institution and substance of the Sacrament was kept. Nay, yet to graunt a little more: though the error bee daungerous and of great waight and moment, and such an one, as being stifely maintained would destroye the faith and Church too: yet if they haue fallen into it rather of ignorance, then any other cause, and doe not continue in it, but doe submit themselues to bee reformed by the word, it ceaseth not for all that to be a Church. So the <hi>Corinthians</hi> referred themselues wholly and their opinions to the iudgement and determination of the Apostle. Hetherto our aduersaries haue sayd nothing agaynst vs: now wee will say somewhat for our selues.</p>

Secondly, they are most notorious markes, and a man by the Scriptures may more easely knowe, what true doctrine is, and which are the right Sacraments, then which is the true Church. Thirdly, these markes can not be absent from the Church, but doe alwayes accompanie it, and it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a true Church, then it hath those markes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth to the first place, that the hearing of the word, is not a visible note of the Church, but a signe vnto euery man, whereby he may knowe his election. Wee replie agayne: looke which way a man is knowne to bee a member of the Church, by the same way the Church also it selfe is discerned: if the hearing of the word doe make one a sheep of Christ, then doth it also shew which is the flocke and fould of Christ: As I knowe my hand or foote to bee a part of my bodie, because it hath life and motion of the bodie: euen so the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is discerned from a carkas, because it moueth and liueth.</p>
                     <p>To the second place he answereth, very simply: that the Apostle there sheweth not, which is the Church, but what good Christ hath wrought for his Church. We replie againe: But the Church is best knowne by the benefites that Christ hath bestowed vpon it, amongst the which the Word and the Sacraments are not the least: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by these the Church is knowne, and in that place by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle described: And let the reader iudge, whether that place of the Apostle, where there is direct mention made of the word and sacraments, be not fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our purpose, concerning the description of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Let <hi>Augustine</hi> speake: <hi>In scripturis didicimus Christum, in scripturis didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus ecclesiam: epistol.</hi> 166. In the scripture we doe learne Christ, in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture let vs likewise learne the Church.

                  <p>THe Papists affirme, that the authoritie of the Church consisteth in these fiue poynts. First, in authorising the scriptures, and defining, which are Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Secondly, in giuing the sense of the scripture. Thirdly, in determining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters besides scripture. Fourthly, in making lawes &amp; constitutions for the Church. Fiftly, in exercising of discipline.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the two last, we doe not greatly stand with them. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Church hath authoritie to make decrees and constitutions, but so, as the Apostles did: <hi>Visum est nobis &amp; spiritui sancto,</hi> It seemed good to vs and the holy Ghost: the Church must be directed by the wisedome of the spirit speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>We also acknowledge the holesome power of the Church in exercising of holy discipline: but it must be done in the name and power of Christ. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. not according to the will of men.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the two first: we haue alreadie shewed, that neither the Church doth giue authoritie to the word of God, but doth take her authoritie from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:

                  <p>There remaineth therefore onely one poynt to be discussed of the authoritie of the Church: namely in deciding of matters beside the scriptures: which are of two sorts, either necessarie appertayning to faith, or indifferent concerning ceremonies: of both these in their order.</p>

                        <p>THat the Church hath no such power to ordaine articles of faith, or impose matters to be beleeued necessarie to saluation not contayned, or prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the holy scriptures: We prooue it thus, and wee are sure, that the true Church of Christ will neuer chalenge any such prerogatiue.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. All truthes and verities in the scriptures are not so necessary to saluation, that the ignorance thereof should bring perill of damnation: <hi>Ergo</hi> much lesse are any verities out of scripture of any such necessitie: the first is manifest: for to know the iust chronologie of time or space of yeares, from the beginning of the world to Christ, is a veritie in scripture, yet not necessary: so to beleeue that <hi>Marie</hi> continued a virgin euer after the birth of our Lord, was thought by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile</hi> to be no necessarie poynt to saluation, if wee did hold her to haue beene a virgin afore: and many such other poyntes there are in scriptures, which a man may be ignorant of without perill of saluation, <hi>Ergo</hi> much more may we be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of vnwritten verities, or rather Popish fables.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Church hath no more authoritie then the Apostles, nor yet in all things so much: But they had no power to make articles of faith: for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deliuereth that which he had receiued concerning the sacrament, he durst not adde vnto it, as the Papists haue been bolde to doe since, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Church may explane and open articles of fayth out of the scriptures, but not make new.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We prooue it by the confession of our aduersaries. The fathers of <hi>Basile,</hi> that concluded, it was an article of the Christian fayth to beleeue the superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the councel,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 677.</note> did gather it out of the saying of Christ, <hi>dic ecclesiae,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enforced it as an article.

Againe, the precepts of Christianitie are either directly expressed, or necessarilie concluded out of the scriptures: but externall rites and ceremonies are not particularlie declared in the word: there are onely certaine generall rules set downe, according to the which all ceremonies brought into the Church, are to bee examined: as for the Sacraments of the Church, they cannot bee altered, hauing a perpetuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from Christ: Therefore the Church cannot appoynt, what, how many ceremonies soeuer she shall thinke good, but according to these foure rules and conditions, which followe here in order.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 All things ought to bee done to the glorie of God, euen in ciuill actions, much more in things appertayning to the seruice of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.

                        <p n="2">2 All things ought to be done orderly and decently, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al ridiculous, light &amp; vnprofitable ceremonies are to be abolished: such our aduersaries haue many, as knocking, kneeling, creeping to the Crosse, lighting candles at noone day, turning ouer of beades, and many phantasticall gestures they haue in their idolatrous Masse, as turning, returning, looking to the East, to the West: crossing, lifting, quaffing, and shewing the emptie cup, with many such toyes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 All things ought to bee done without offence, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.32. But to whom, that hath but a little feeling of religion, is not the abhominable sacrifice of the Masse offensiue? What good conscience doth it not grieue, that the Priest should create his maker, as they say? should offer vp the bodie of Christ in sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and be an intercessor as it were for his mediatour, desiring God to accept the sacrifice of his sonnes bodie? As also to make it a propitiatorie sacrifice for the quicke and the dead? But of these matters we shall haue fitter occasion to entreate afterward, when we come to the seuerall controuersies.</p>

And yet this is to be maruelled at, that they should so much stand for Councels, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might vse a farre more compendious way, in referring all to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Pope, whome they boldly, but very fondly affirme, that hee cannot erre.</p>
                     <p>Although they seeme not to lay a necessitie vpon Generall Councels, yet in truth they doo contrarie: for they allowe no Councels at all, without the Popes consent and authoritie, neither thinke it lawfull for any Nation or Prouince, to make within themselues any innouation or change of Religion.

                     <p>WE doe hold that generall Councels are an holesome meanes for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing and reforming, both of errors in Religion, and corruption in manners: and that true generall Councels ought to bee much desired, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently

expected: that is, such a Councell, where euery man franke &amp; free may vtter his minde without feare: an holy Councel, where euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may goe about to set vp godlines, not to oppresse the trueth. Such a Councell King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight of worthie memorie in his protestation for the Church of England, for not comming to the Councell of the Pope, truely affirmeth, that he desired, and craued nothing so oft of God: but because there is no hope of any such Councel, seeing the Pope would be the chiefe doer in it, and it is too vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the same man should be both a partie, and a iudge: we doubt not, but that it is lawfull by the word of God, for euery Prince, Duke, Lord, within his owne seignorie, without any further delay, or expectation, by the aduice and Counsaile of the learned and godlie of the land, according to Gods Lawe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their Church.</p>
                     <p>First, because all delay in matters of the Church are dangerous, and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are at the first hand to be met withall, as we see <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 15. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie, when any question did arise, the Apostles assembled together. In the Councel of <hi>Basile,</hi> where it was decreed, that the Pope was subiect to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, <hi>Panormitane</hi> a stiffe champion on the Popes side, would haue the decree stayed till the returne of the Princes Embassadors: But <hi>Arelatensis</hi> that worthy Cardinall stepped vp, and shewed what danger there might be in a small delay, by the example of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who deferring his going but one day to <hi>Rome,</hi> was driuen cleane out of Italy, hauing been very like to haue taken the citie, if he had vsed the opportunitie. But without all controuersie, matters of faith ought not to be delayed: which could not be auoyded, if a generall Councel should alwaies be waited for.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a Prince hath the like authoritie in his dominion, as the houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath in his house. But euery man ought to reforme his house, without any further delay, aduisement or consultation, as <hi>Iosua</hi> sayth, I and my house will serue the Lord, 24. vers. 15. Wherefore the Prince may and ought to performe the like in his countrie.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we finde by experience, that the Lord hath blessed such reformations, which haue been made by Princes in their owne territories: as that in <hi>Zuricke anno.</hi> 1523. at <hi>Berne,</hi> 1528. and the most happie reformation of our Church of <hi>England</hi>

                     <p>WE hold it as a fond and ridiculous assertion, that generall Councels should be ruled at the Popes becke, but that this authoritie is due, and hath been of olde vnto Christian Princes and Magistrates, and the Pope in so doing doth but vsurpe vpon their right.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the Pope hath not absolute authoritie, to call, remoue, dissolue, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish Councels, it is proued out of scripture: for <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. the twelue Apostles, and not <hi>Peter</hi> onely, whose successor the Pope doth falsely chalenge to be, called the multitude together about the election of Deacons.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Councels in times past were sommoned by the Emperours, which our aduersaries themselues cannot denie, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> first, by <hi>Constantine</hi> the great: <hi>Constantinopolitane.</hi> 1. by <hi>Theodosius</hi> the elder. <hi>Ephesin.</hi> 1. by <hi>Theodosius</hi>

the younger: <hi>Chalcedonens.</hi> by <hi>Martianus.</hi> But, say our aduersaries, these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were not appoynted without the consent of the Bishops of Rome. I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile they are not ashamed so to say: for when <hi>Theodosius</hi> called the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon, Leo</hi> then Bishop of Rome, neither liked the time, for hee would haue had it deferred, nor the place, being desirous to haue it in <hi>Italy:</hi> yet he was content to obey the Emperours commaundement, and sent his Agents to the Councel, there to appeare for him: <hi>Epist.</hi> 41.47.48. <hi>ad Martianum:</hi> This was alleadged by <hi>Tonstal</hi> and <hi>Stokeslie</hi> two archpapists in their Epistle to Cardinall <hi>Poole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is a good reason which was alleadged in the Councell of <hi>Basile,</hi> that if Popes onely should call Councels, there should be no meanes left to withstand a wicked and vicious Pope. Who would thinke (say they) that the Bishop of Rome would congregate a Councel, for his owne correction, or depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Pope hath no more authoritie, nor, by their leaue, nothing like as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had: but he challenged not this dignitie amongst the Apostles, to summon Councels. We reade of foure onely Councels of the Apostles, say the fathers of <hi>Basile</hi> (for this also is their argument) the first was for the choosing of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias.</hi> Act. 1. congregate at the commaundement of Christ, who inioyned them not to depart from Ierusalem. The second. Act. 6. congregate by the twelue, not <hi>Peter</hi> onely,<note place="margin">4. Councels called by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</note> for the election of Deacons. The third, which was holden as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the taking away of circumcision, and other ceremonies of the lawe, was gathered together by a generall inspiration, Act. 15.6. The fourth, wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things contained in the lawe are permitted, seemeth to be gathered by <hi>Iames. Act.</hi> 21.18. Vpon these reasons the Councel thus concludeth: that if the Pope would resist, and haue no Councel congregate, yet if the greater part of the Church doe iudge it necessarie to haue a Councel, the Councel may bee congregate, whether the Pope will or not. <hi>Ex Aenea Syluio, Fox. pag.</hi> 676. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.</p>

determining voyce: Priests and other learned may dispute and haue a consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue voyce: Princes are there to defend the Councel, and see order kept: other of the Laitie may be there as officers and ministers, as Scribes and Notaries: but the suffrages and voyces must onely be giuen by Bishops. <hi>Eckius. loc. de concil. Bellarm. de concil. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. Let vs see some of their reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, to teach and to feede is proper for the Pastors only, and to establish and decree in Councel, is nothing els but to feede and teach: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Pastors onely must rule in Councel: which none are but Bishops: <hi>Soli Episcopi pastores sunt</hi> (sayth the Iesuite) <hi>neque laici neque ecclesiastici quicunque:</hi> Onely Bishops are pastors, and none other of the Clergie besides, and to them onely, he sayth, that is to bee applyed, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. Take heede to your selues, and the flocke, ouer the which God hath made you ouerseers.</p>
                     <p>I answere. First, what an absurd saying is this and voyde of sense, that the Bishop is the onely pastor of his Diocesse, and that euery Minister is not pastor in his owne parish? Nay, if the Iesuite would speake trueth, he shall finde that popish Bishops are neither Pastors nor Doctors, for the most of them neither feede, nor teach: And they be not ashamed to professe it, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1540. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, <hi>Thomas Forret</hi> Martyr, being found fault withall by the Bishop of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelden</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> because he preached so oft, exhorted the Bishop agayne, and wished that he did preach. The Bishop answered: nay, nay, let that bee, we are not ordayned to preach: and in further talke the blind blockish Bishop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed his owne ignorance, I thanke God (sayth he) that I neuer knewe what the olde and newe Testament was. Thereupon rose a common prouerbe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> you are like the Bishop of <hi>Dunkelden,</hi> that knewe neither the old nor new lawe. <hi>Fox. Martyrol. pag.</hi> 1266.</p>
                     <p>With this blind saying of the popish Bishop, our countrey men of <hi>Rhemes</hi> also doe agree, which doubt not to say, that many which haue no gift to preach, yet for their wisedome and gouernment, are not vnmeete to be Pastors and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. <hi>Annot. in</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5. <hi>sect.</hi> 13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 I answere, the Iesuite bewrayeth his ignorance, in making no difference betweene <hi>communis,</hi> and <hi>propria politia ecclesiae:</hi> the common and speciall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and office of the Church: for there are proper offices and dueties, some of Pastors, some of gouernours, some of other Ministers: but this office to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in general Councels, is not proper to Pastors, but common to the whole Church: whereupon wee denye, that it is <hi>Proprium pastorum munus, suffragia ferre in concilijs:</hi> It is not the proper duetie of Pastors, to giue voyces and make decrees in Councels.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 By the Iesuites argument, the fathers of <hi>Basile</hi> doe conclude cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie out of that place, 4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> That because Christ instituted not onely A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Prophets, but pastors and teachers for the work of the Ministerie, who doubteth (say they) but that the gouernance also of the Church is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto others together with the Apostles? And hence they inferre, because
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20636:51"/>
the worke of the Ministerie is layd vpon the rest of the Clergie, that therefore they ought not to be excluded from Councels.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Panormitane</hi> in the Councel of <hi>Basile</hi> thus reasoneth for Bishops: that they were the pillars and keyes of heauen, and therefore had onely deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding voyces: Vnto him answered at that time the wise and couragious Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Arelatensis,</hi> shewing <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement vpon those words (I will giue thee the keyes of heauen) that the iudiciall power was giuen not onely to <hi>Peter,</hi> but also to the other Apostles, &amp; to the whole Church, the Bishops, the Priests. Whereupon he inferreth, that if the Priests haue a iudicial power in the Church, they also ought to haue a determining voyce in Councels.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Lodouicus</hi> the Prothonotarie in the same Councel thus argued: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit (sayth hee) Christ chose twelue Apostles and 70. Disciples, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the setting forth of the Creede, onely the Apostles were present, thereby giuing example, that matters of faith did pertaine onely to the Apostles, and so consequently to Bishops. To him <hi>Arelatensis</hi> made this answere: First, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not, because the Apostles onely are named, that they therefore only were present at the setting forth of the Creede: for wee see that Princes beare the name and commendation of many actions, which are done notwithstanding by their helpers. 2. <hi>Lodouicus</hi> cannot be ignorant (sayth he) that there be some articles in the Creede, which were not put to by the Apostles, but afterward by generall Councels: as that part, wherein mention is made of the holy Ghost, which the Councel of <hi>Lions</hi> did adde: Thus much out of the Councel of <hi>Basile.</hi>

                     <head>The Protestants confession.</head>
                     <p>OVr opinion grounded vpon trueth and scripture is this: that, not onely Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but all other pastors admitted to the Councel, and the learned and discreete amongst the Lay men, ought to haue concluding voyces in Councel: and that rather the discussing and consulting of matters pertayneth to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuines, the deciding to all, then contrariwise.</p>
                     <p>First, that inferiour pastors are to bee ioyned with Bishops and Prelates, it was amplie proued in the Councel of <hi>Basile,</hi> of the which I haue so often made mention, as noble <hi>Arelatensis</hi> reasoneth thus: The dignities of the fathers is not to be respected but the trueth: neither will I preferre a lye of any Bishop, be he neuer so rich, before a veritie or a trueth of a poore Priest: this is his first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the trueth ought to bee receiued at any mans mouth bee he neuer so simple: and therefore Priests as well as Bishops are to bee admitted to the Councel.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He declareth the ancient practise of the Church: In the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> where there were assembled 322. Bishops, <hi>Athanasius</hi> being then onely a Priest, withstood the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and infringed their arguments: In the Synode
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20636:51"/>
of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> there were present sixe hundred Priests, which name is common both to Bishops and Priests. When <hi>Paul</hi> Bishoppe of <hi>Antioch</hi> preached that Christ was a man of common nature: the Councell assembled against him at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where the sayde <hi>Paul</hi> was condemned, neither was there any man, which did more confound the sayd <hi>Paul,</hi> then one <hi>Malchion</hi> Priest of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> which taught Rhetorick there.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the second part, that laye men also with Priests ought to bee admitted: first we haue testimonie out of the word of God for it. Tit. 3.13. for this cause <hi>Zenas</hi> the lawyer is ioyned as fellow in commission with <hi>Apollos.</hi> But we haue a more euident place. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.22. It seemed good to the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church: here we see that not onely the Elders but the whole multitude, were admitted into consultation with the Apostles. To this place our aduersaries doe thus aunswere: <hi>Lodouicus</hi> the Prothonotarie, first thus rashly and fondly gaue his verdicte in the Councell of <hi>Basile,</hi> that there was no argument to be gathered of the Acts of the Apostles, whose examples were more to be maruayled at, then to be followed:<note place="margin">A blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</note> But to this <hi>Arelatensis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he would stay himself most vpon the Apostles doings: for what, sayth he, is more comely for vs to followe, then the doctrine and customes of the primitiue Church? And <hi>Aeneas Siluius</hi> reporteth (who writeth of the actes of that Councell) that all men impugned this saying of <hi>Lodouicus,</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were not to be followed, as a blasphemie.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Iesuite hath found out another aunswere: he sayth that none but the Apostles gaue sentence, the rest onely gaue consent, and inwarde li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and approbation: this cauill <hi>Arelatensis</hi> met withall long before the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite was borne, in the forenamed Councell. Neither this worde, sayth hee, It seemed good, signifieth in this place consultation, but decision, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: And so it doth indeede: for seeing there is one worde applyed to them all, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>placuit,</hi> it seemed good to the Apostles, Elders and the whole multitude, why should it not be taken in the one and selfe same sence, and after the same manner vnderstood of them all?</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="1">1. The Pope is the chiefe pastor of the vniuersall Church, for vnto <hi>Peter</hi> onely it was sayd, <hi>pasce oues meas,</hi> feede my sheepe, and he is called and saluted in Councels by the name of father: and all other both Princes and Bishops are sheepe in respect of him.</p>
                     <p>Wee answere, first, in the Iesuites argument, there is <hi>petitio principij,</hi> a foule fault in a good Logician, though it bee none in a Sophister, still to begge that which is in question: for yet he hath not prooued that the Pope is the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall pastor. 2. That place, feede my sheepe, prooueth it not: <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>redditur negationi trinae trina confessio, ne minus amori lingua seruiat, quàm ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mori. in Iohan. tract.</hi> 123. he recompenceth a threefold deniall, with a threefold confession, lest that his tongue should be lesse seruiceable to loue, then it was to feare: so then, by this fathers iudgement, it was no priuiledge to <hi>Peter</hi> to bee thrise admonished, but he is thereby put in mind of his thrise deniall of Christ. Againe, I maruaile the Iesuite can so soone forget himselfe: for in the 15. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter afore, he prooued by these words (feede my sheepe) that Bishops onely were pastors, and he can now turne the wordes to serue onely for the Pope. 3. What great matter is it for the Pope to be called father, seeing he is not ignorant that all Bishops assembled in Councell and other learned, are called by that name. Nay, it is no rare matter for other Bishops to be saluted by the name of Pope: as <hi>Prosper</hi> writing to <hi>Augustine,</hi> twise in one Epistle calleth him, <hi>bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimum Papam,</hi> most blessed Pope, Tom. 7.4. Princes and Bishops to the Pope are sheepe, sayth the Iesuite. 1. For Bishops, though he had a iurisdiction ouer all, which will stick in his teeth to prooue, yet shall they be no more his sheep, then Priests are to Bishops, and Bishops to their Metropolitanes, who cannot be sayd to be their sheepe, though they haue some preeminence ouer them: for <hi>Augustines</hi> rule must stand, <hi>nemo se nostrum episcopum episcoporum constituit. De baptism.</hi> 2.2. No man is a Bishop of Bishops, nor shepheard of shepheards. Secondly, for Princes he hath nothing to doe with any but those in his owne Bishopricke, and as they are his sheep one way, as they are taught of him, so he and his Cardinals are the Magistrates sheepe another way, and in respect of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20636:52"/>
the ciuil gouernement he is their shepheard: And both he and they, prince and priest are sheep-fellows, vnder Iesus Christ the chiefe shepheard: as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> sayth, <hi>tanquam vobis pastores sumus, sed sub illo pastore vobiscum oues sumus,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. we are shepheards to you, but both you and I are sheep vnder that great shepheard.</p>

                     <p>WE doe truely affirme, that the Soueraigne Maiestie of the Emperour and chiefe Magistrate, or his legate, if he either be present himselfe, or sende, ought to be president of the Councel: Or else in their absence, one to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and elected by the Councel for that function, as Cardinal <hi>Arelatensis</hi> was chosen in the Councell of <hi>Basile</hi> by the fathers to be moderator.</p>
                     <p>First, that it belongeth to the Prince, to haue this prerogatiue, it is hence prooued, because he is the chiefe iudge in all matters and causes, both ciuil and eccesiasticall: And it appeareth by the auncient practise of the godly kings in Israel and Iuda. <hi>Dauid</hi> gathered a Councel together, when hee brought the Arke to Ierusalem. 1. Chronicl. 15.3. where he was the chiefe doer, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; for he appoynted the Leuites their courses, and set forth a certayne fourme of thanksgiuing to be vsed. 1. Chronicl. 16.4.7. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> assembled a Councel. 2. Chronicl. 30.2. where it was decreed, that the passeouer should be solemnly kept: &amp; the postes were sent forth with the kings writ or commission. In <hi>Iosiah</hi> his raigne there was a great assembly at Ierusalem, of the Princes, the people, priests and Leuites, and al from the greatest to the smallest: where the king him selfe was president and chiefe agent, reading the law before the people. 2. Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicl. 34.30.31.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we finde that the Emperours themselues haue beene present at Councels: As in the <hi>Nicene, Constantine</hi> the great was present: in the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon, Martianus:</hi> in the Constantinopolitane 3. <hi>Constantinus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: in the <hi>Constantinopl.</hi> 4. <hi>Basilius</hi> the Emperour was present. Is it to bee thought that these noble Emperours, were at the Councels as inferiors or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings? or had they not the chiefe places? then sure they were presidents: for in the Councell the chiefe place belongeth to the president. They might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt a speaker or prolocutor for them, as in the parliament house, though the prince be present, yet the Lord Chauncellour speaketh: but the chiefe power and Soueraigntie in the Councell, was in the Emperours.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, not to heape vp many reasons in so playne a cause: I will alleadge one example most manifest out of <hi>Augustine</hi>: who writeth that in that great Councel at <hi>Carthage</hi> where the matter was discussed between the Catholicks &amp; the Donatists, there being present more then 500.

This then is the Iesuites opinion, that no Councels by the pope confirmed can erre: &amp; that a particular Councel hauing his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is to be preferred before a generall without. Let vs see some of their reasons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They abuse certaine places of scripture for their purpose: as that Act. 15.
<q>It seemed good to vs, and the holy Ghost: I am with you to the end of the world: He that heareth you, heareth me.</q>
                        <hi>Bellarmine cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Rhemist. in Act.</hi> 15.8.10. so then thus they argue, Councels are neuer without the spirite of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can they not erre. A silly argument, as though the spirite of God were at their commaundement, or were tyed to places or persons: They must first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the condition, before they can chalenge the promise: that is, to followe the rule of Gods word, and obediently to submit themselues thereunto, then will God vouchsafe to be present: The Gospell sayth, that wheresoeuer two or three are gathered together in my name, I will be present euen in the midst of them: Here promise is made not to thousands or hundreds, but to two or three: and therefore by this place an assemblie of few persons may as well be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from error, as Councels: but there is a condition, <hi>In nomine meo,</hi> in my name, and then followeth, <hi>in medio illorum,</hi> in the midst of them: if then they are not met in the Lords name, they cannot looke for the presence of Christ. I pray you where was the holy Ghost present in that Councel at Rome vnder Iohn. 23. when there appeared a great Oule, which stared and out faced the pope, who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20636:53"/>
blushing at the matter, and fuming, rose vp and departed?

                     <p>WE doubt not to say, that Councels haue erred, and may erre, presuming any thing besides the warrant of Gods worde, and that neither v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall or particular Councels are priuiledged, much lesse any one man, no nor the Pope, not to erre in matters of fayth, otherwise, then following the trueth of the Scriptures, for in so doing, they are sure, not to be deceiued.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We haue also examples in the scripture of Councels that erred, as that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie in <hi>Achabs</hi> dayes of 400. Prophets, who were al deceiued: the Iesuite thus answereth, that it was an assemblie of prophets, not of priests: as though priestes were more piuiledged from error, than Prophets. And these, say they, were false Prophets, not Prophets of the Lord: We graunt so, and this withal, that wheresoeuer the Lords Prophets, and pastors, and ministers assemble, that there they will heare the Lords voyce: which the Pope in his Councels doth not. But he still supposeth, that the Pope and his ministers are Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: which is an vnreasonable supposition, seeing we hold him to be Antichrist, and that the Iesuite knoweth.</p>
                     <p>Such a Councell was that of the Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. where all they were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that confessed Christ, &amp; <hi>Mark.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ himselfe was by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel condemned: It cannot be denied, that this Councell erred. Let vs heare the papists goodly answeres: some say, that the Councel erred in a matter of fact, <hi>de facto, non de iure,</hi> not in a case of right, as whether Christ should be put to death: as though in condemning him, they denied not that he was the Messiah: other, that they erred in their owne opinion, not in the sentence giuen, for Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede was guilty of death, say they, because he did beare our sinnes: the Iesuite findeth not much fault with this answere, &amp; yet it is an open blasphemie, as is that also of the papists, that the Iewes had sinned mortally, if they had not put Christ to death. Some of them say, the Councel erred not in that which was done, but in the maner of iudgement, because it was tumultuous &amp; disorderly,<note place="margin">Popish blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</note> &amp; done by suborning of false witnesses: and this sayth the Iesuite, is <hi>probabilis responsio,</hi> a probable answere sayth hee, being most impious and blasphemous. But he dare not rest in this answere, but findeth out a fourth of his owne, that the chiefe priestes and Councels of the Iewes could not erre before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

of Christ, but after he was come, they might. A blinde popish answere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for doth not Christ euery where impugne the traditions and decrees of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. which our Sauiour should not haue done belike, seeing the Elders before his comming could not erre: or will they say, that those traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were right and good before, and afterward erronious? I know not els, what they should say.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We see by experience that many councels haue erred: we let pas those which the Iesuite himself co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth to haue erred, as the third Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where <hi>Athanasius</hi> was condemned, and the <hi>Arrian</hi> heresie approoued: the Councel of <hi>Arimine,</hi> where the same heresie was furthered: the fourth Ephesine appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Eutiches</hi> heresie: These Councels, though they were generall, the papists confesse to haue erred, and they haue a trick to shift it off, but a silly one God knoweth. They were not approoued by the Pope, saye they: As though all verity &amp; knowledge in the whole earth were locked vp in the Popes breast.</p>
                     <p>But wee will bring an instance of such Councels as the Pope allowed, and yet by the papists owne confession erred. In the Councell of <hi>Naeo-Caesarea,</hi> confirmed by <hi>Leo</hi> 4. in the 7. <hi>canon</hi>: second marriage is forbidden. In the Councel <hi>Toletan.</hi> 1. the 17. <hi>canon:</hi> it is thus written, that one may be admitted to the communion, though he haue a concubine, <hi>modò non sit vxoratus,</hi> so hee be not wiued: the Iesuites poore shift is this, that a concubine is here vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode for a wife without a dowrie, and further sayth, that <hi>Agar</hi> was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> wife, and not his concubine, agaynst the scripture: for <hi>Abraham</hi> should haue done euill in sending of her away as he did, if she were his wife, and the scripture calleth <hi>Sara</hi> by the name onely of <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, the other by the name of a bond woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.8.12.</p>
                     <p>In the sixt Synod confirmed by <hi>Adrian</hi> the 1. <hi>canon.</hi> 72. the mariages betweene Catholikes and hereticks are adiudged to be voyde. In the second Councel of <hi>Nice, act.</hi> 5. it was concluded, that Angels and mens souls are bodily and circumscriptible.</p>
                     <p>In the Councel of Rome vnder Pope <hi>Stephan</hi> the 7. all the acts of <hi>Formosus</hi> his predecessor were reuoked: And in the Councel of <hi>Rauenna</hi> vnder <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. Pope, <hi>Formosus</hi> actes were established, and <hi>Stephans</hi> decrees abrogate.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, in the Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi> they are excommunicate, that receiue the sacrament in both kinds: the Councel of <hi>Basile</hi> on the contrary side permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and giueth leaue to the <hi>Bohemians</hi> to vse both kindes. One of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, must needs erre, &amp; both of them were confirmed by the Popes: the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Constance</hi> by <hi>Martin</hi> the 5. the Councel of <hi>Basile</hi> by <hi>Foelix</hi> 5. By this indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many particulars we inferre and conclude, that Councels euen appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Pope, may and haue erred,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Lastly, <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion is this, that prouincial Councels ought to giue place to general: <hi>Et ipsa plenaria priora posteriorib. emendari,</hi> and the former ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels must be amended by the latter.

Other Papists more fauorable to their new God amight, say, that the Pope is by right aboue the Councell, but he may (if he wil) submit himselfe to the Councell. But now commeth in the stoute Iesuite, and saith with the rest of the schoolemen, that the Pope hath such a soueraigntie aboue the Councell, that he cannot be subiect to their sentence, though hee would. <hi>Bellar. de concil. lib.</hi> 2.14. Yet hee is in a mammering with himselfe, for saith he, <hi>in periculo schismatis,</hi> when there is a schisme, and it is not knowne who is the true Pope, in such a case the Councell is aboue the Pope: Let vs examine some of his best reasons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Now commeth in a great blasphemie.

                     <p>O Lord what great blasphemie is here, to appropriate the titles of Christ, to a mortall man: But goe to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the rest of that packe, fil vp the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of iniquitie of your forefathers: say with Pope <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that the people of the world are the partes of his bodie: with Cornelius the Bishop in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope being the light came into the world, and men loued darkenes rather then light: with Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> who, when hee saw the Councell would not consent to excommunicate the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, impiously cried out, that they had forsaken him, as Christ was left of his Disciples: with <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, that all things in Heauen and earth, and

vnder the earth doe bowe the knee vnto him: with <hi>Otho</hi> no Pope, but a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that sitting amongst his Bishops, blasphemously applied to himselfe the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Ezechiel cap.</hi> 1. resembling the Bishops to the sower faced beasts, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto God that approched to the Prophet in the midst.

                     <p>But we will leaue to charge them so deepely with blasphemie, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they cannot auoyde: Let vs heare, what the fathers of <hi>Basile</hi> say to this poynt. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, the Pope is the husband: but they reason cleane contrarie: the Church (say they) is the spouse of Christ: the Pope, make the best of him you can, is but a Vicar: but no man dooth so ordaine a Vicar, that hee maketh his spouse subiect vnto him, but that the spouse is alwaies thought to be of more authoritie then the Vicar, forsomuch as she is one body with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but the Vicar is not so: thus haue they to the full answered the Iesuite, <hi>ex Aenea Syluio.</hi> Better arguments they haue none for the Popes prerogatiue, then we haue seene.</p>

                     <p>THat the Pope is by right, and ought to be subiect to generall Councels, and that they haue authoritie to iudge, examine, suspend, punish, &amp; depose him, if there be iust cause, it is proued thus. This matter was pithilie disputed vpon by the Fathers of <hi>Basile,</hi> some of whose reasons, it shall bee sufficient heere to followe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They proue this conclusion out of Scripture. First, whereas <hi>Panormitane</hi> had saide, that the Pope was Lorde of the Church, vnto him <hi>Segouius</hi> answered, that it was the most honourable title of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be called the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the seruants of God: and <hi>Peter,</hi> saith hee, forbiddeth pastors to behaue themselues as Lords ouer the Clergie, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. And if Christ the sonne of God, came not to be ministred vnto, but to minister and serue, how then can his Vicar haue any dominion? So was <hi>Panormitane</hi> answered.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the Diuines thus argued: Christ saith to <hi>Peter, dic Ecclesiae, Peter</hi> is sent to the Church or Councell: <hi>Ergo</hi> the veritie doth remit the Bishop of Rome to the Councell. But to this the Iesuite saith, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not yet entred into his office to bee chiefe Bishop, but was as a priuate person. So then belike, this rule of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>dic Ecclesiae,</hi> tell it to the Church, did but binde <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> till Christ were ascended, and he receiued his Vicar-dome.</p>
                     <p>This cauillous answere the Fathers of <hi>Basile</hi> wisely foresaw, and preuented it, for they shew how <hi>Peter</hi> was subiect to Councels euen after the ascension, as <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>Peter</hi> is rebuked (say they) by the congregation, because he went to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> an heathen man, as if it had not been lawfull for him to attempt any great matter without the knowledge of the congregation: but that seemeth to make more for the purpose, <hi>Galath.</hi> 2. where <hi>Paule</hi> rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> to his face, because
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20636:56"/>
contrarie to the decree of the Councell of the Apostles, hee did <hi>cogere gentes Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizare,</hi> hee would constraine the Gentiles to doe like the Iewes. <hi>Ergo, Peter</hi> was subiect vnto the Councell, <hi>ex Aenea Syluio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Other reasons many were alleaged by the Fathers of <hi>Basile.</hi> First the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Burgen:</hi> As in euery well ordered Kingdome, the whole realme should be of more authoritie then the King, so the Church ought to be of more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie then the Pope, though he were Prince thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Diuines brought these argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: the Church is the mother of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and so of the Pope, if he be a faithfull man: the Pope is then the Churches sonne, as both <hi>Anacletus</hi> and <hi>Calixtus</hi> Bishops of Rome confessed. <hi>Ergo</hi> how much the sonne is inferiour to his mother, so much is the Church superiour to the Pope. Secondly, the Pope is inferiour to Angels, he is not greater then <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> of whom it is said, that the least in the Kingdome of God is greater then he: but the Angels doe reuerentlie accord vnto the doctrine of the Church. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Pope is bound to doo the same, who is lesse then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. These Fathers thought none so absurd to denie the Pope to be inferiour to Angels, and therefore labour not to proue it. Yet <hi>Antoninus</hi> an olde Papist saith, <hi>Non minor honor datur Papae, quàm Angelis,</hi> there is no lesse honour due to the Pope then to the Angels. Nay another saith (I thinke it be Pope <hi>Paschalis) Datur Episcopis, quod ne Angelis, vt Christi corpus crearent:</hi> it is graunted to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, which is not giuen to the Angels, to create the bodie of Christ. But the Fathers of <hi>Basile</hi> thought not these men worthie the answere, no more doe we, and so let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> passe. Thirdly, the Pope (say they) being the Vicar of the Church, for he is more truely so called, then the Vicar of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may be deposed of the Church: for a Lord may put out his Vicar at his pleasure. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Pope is vnder Councels.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 If the Councels might not ouerrule the Pope, there were no remedie left to resist a wicked Pope: Shall we suffer all things, say they, to run into ruine and decay with him? for it is not like, that hee would congregate a Councell against himselfe. To this the Iesuite answereth, that there is no remedie left, but to pray to God in such a case; who will either confound or conuert such a Pope. Here is goodly diuinitie: we know that Antichrist shall at length be destroyed at the comming of Christ: but if he should be let alone in the meane while, and not be bridled, he might doe much hurt, as he hath done too much alreadie. Yet the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite confesseth, that a wicked Pope may bee resisted by force and armes: and why not, I pray you, as well by peaceable meanes? these sayings are contrarie. <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>So then this is Popish diuinitie, that be the Pope neuer so wicked, doe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much harme, hee is not to bee controuled of any mortall man. Such doul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish schoole poynts maintained especially by begging friers, the fathers of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile</hi> complained of: As that they should say, that no man ought to iudge the high and principall seate, that it cannot be iudged, either by Emperour, Clergie, King or people. Other affirme, that the Lord hath reserued to himselfe the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20636:57"/>
of the chiefe Bishop: Others, yet more mad, are not ashamed to affirme, that the Bishop of Rome, though hee carrie soules in neuer so great number to hell, yet is he not subiect to any correction, or rebuke. For all these straunge and blasphemous positions, the fathers concluded, as yee haue heard, that the Pope ought to obey generall Councels.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Lastly, I will adioyne the iudgement of <hi>Augustine,</hi> who writing in his 162. Epistle concerning the Donatists, whose cause was heard and determined by the Emperours appoyntment at Rome before <hi>Miltiades</hi> then Bishop there, and other Bishops assistants: and yet for all this the Donatists would not bee quiet: Thus he saith, <hi>Putemus, illos iudices, qui Romae iudicauerunt, non bonos iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices fuisse: Restabat adhuc plenarium Concilium, &amp;c.</hi> Put case (saith hee) that the Bishop of Rome and the rest, iudged corruptly: there remayned yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedie: A generall Councell might haue beene called, where the iudges and the cause might further haue been tried, and examined, &amp; their iudgement, if there were cause, reuersed. Whereby it appeareth, say the fathers of <hi>Basile,</hi> that not onely the sentence of the Pope alone, but also the Pope with his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops ioyned with him, might be made frustrate by a Councell. Here the Iesuite paltreth &amp; saith, that a matter determined by the Pope in a particular Councell may be called againe in question by the Pope in a general Councel. First what neede that, seeing that a particular Councel hauing the Popes authoritie, as the Iesuite confesseth, cannot erre? Againe, <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>vbi cum ipsis iudicibus causa possit agitari:</hi> In the which generall Councell the cause and the former iudges, of the which <hi>Miltiades</hi> was one, may bee tryed and examined, so that the Pope himselfe might be adiudged by the Councell, and not the cause onely. Vpon the Premisses we truely and iustly conclude, that the Pope is and of right ought to be subiect to generall Councels.</p>

                     <p>OVr conditions, which we would haue obserued and kept, in generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, are these, most iust and reasonable:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the Pope, which is a party, should be no iudge: for it is vnreasonable, that the same man should be both a partie and a iudge: and therefore he ought not to meddle with calling and appoynting Councels, with ruling, or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating them, seeing it is like, he would worke for his owne aduantage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That such a time and place be appointed, as when and where the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Christendome may most safely and conueniently meete together: not at such a time, as <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, called a Councell, when all Princes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome were occupied in great affaires: nor such a place, as he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appointed at <hi>Mantua</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> whither Princes could not come without perill of iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and danger of life, being penned in by the Popes garrisons.

So Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> would haue dissolued the Councell at <hi>Basile,</hi> and brought it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his owne nose.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 We would haue it a free Councell, where euery man might fully vtter his minde, and that there should be a safe conduct graunted to al to come and goe: which the Pope for all his faire promises is vnwilling to doe, as it was flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Constance:</hi> to whome it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he should haue safe conduct to come, but none to goe. Neither if they should giue a safe conduct, were they to bee trusted, for it cannot bee forgotten, to their perpetuall infamie, that they brake the Emperour <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> safe conduct graunted to <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> saying, that faith was not to be kept with Hereticks.</p>

The question now is, whether the same forme ought to bee reteyned in Church-gouernement: and in this question certaine things are to bee obserued: First, that wee haue not to deale in this place with that part of Ecclesiasticall regiment, wherein the prince hath interest, as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayning Ecclesiasticall Lawes, and seeing to the execution thereof: but the question is onely of that regiment Ecclesiasticall, which is proper to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church, which consisteth in the ministerie of the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in ordaining and electing of Church-ministers, in the dispensing of the keyes of the Church, in the Ecclesiasticall censures and discipline, and such like: whether in the Church there ought to bee one chiefe Bishop, from whom all other receiue this power in the premisses. Secondly, the question is not of the spirituall gouernement of Christ, who is the chiefe Monarch and King of his Church, but of the outward and externall regiment vpon earth. Thirdly, wee speake not of the state of any particular Church, either nationall, prouinciall, or oppidall, but of the generall state of the Church: whether ouer all Churches there ought to be one chiefe Bishop.

                     <p n="1">1 The militant Church is in all things answerable and correspondent to the triumphant companie in Heauen: as <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Moses</hi> was bid to make all things according to the paterne shewed in the Mount.

                     <p>We answer. First, the Church vpon earth, neither is, nor can be altogether like to the celestiall congregation: for there is no temple, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.22.

These are but their dreames, they haue not a worde in Scripture for it. And concerning <hi>Michael,</hi> they are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for in that place <hi>Apocal.</hi> 12.7. Christ is called <hi>Michael: Michael</hi> and his Angels fought against the Dragon. And who I pray you is the chiefe Captaine of the Church against the diuell and his hoast but Christ? And so is it expounded verse 10. Now is saluation in Heauen, and the strength and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our God, and the power of his Christ: Here hee is called Christ, who before is <hi>Michael.</hi> In other places also, <hi>Michael</hi> is vnderstood to be Christ, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.21. there is none that holdeth with mee but <hi>Michael</hi> your Prince: here <hi>Michael</hi> is the prince of the Church, and not of the Angels. And that <hi>Michael</hi> is not the prince of the Angels, as our aduersaries meane, taking <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> for an Angell, it is proued out of the 13. verse. <hi>Michael</hi> one of the chiefe princes: the Angels are all called princes, and not one to bee prince aboue them.</p>
                     <p>Likewise the nature and signification of the word <hi>Michael</hi> agreeth hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:<note place="margin">Tremel.</note> for it is compounded of three <hi>hebrue particles,</hi> as much as to say, one that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall vnto GOD: which name in that sense cannot bee giuen vnto any creature.</p>
                     <p>Further, Epistle <hi>Iud.</hi> 9. there is mention made of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell, who stroue against the diuell, and saide, the Lord rebuke thee Sathan: where the Apostle alludeth, to that place of <hi>Zacher.</hi> 3.2. where the very same words are found: but there the prophet calleth him <hi>Iehouah,</hi> that spake those words, and here the Apostle calleth him <hi>Michael:</hi> so that in this place it must needes bee vnderstoode for Christ.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude, we denie not, but that <hi>Michael</hi> may bee the name of some glorious Angell: but out of these places it cannot bee proued. And againe, we will not stand with them, but that there may be degrees of excellencie amongst the Angels, as there shall be amongst the Saints: but that any one hath any such soueraigne and commaunding authoritie ouer the rest, it is a curious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous surmise.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Church of the olde Testament was a figure of the Church vnder the New: but they had a high Priest aboue the rest. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there ought to be now.</p>
                     <p>We answere, First, we graunt the high Priest was a figure, but neither of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> nor Pope, but onely of Christ: for in two things did the high Priest resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Christ, in offering of sacrifice (so hath Christ offered vp himselfe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27.) and in entring into the sanctuarie to make attonement for the people: so Christ is entred into the Heauens, to appeare in sight for vs before God, as the apostle saith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. I trow in neither of these the high priest could be a type either of <hi>Peter</hi> or Pope.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Neither doth it follow, because there was an high priest in one countrey, therefore there ought to bee one ouer the Churches in al countries: as the Iesuite

frameth an other argument by a comparison: because a bishop is ouer his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, a Metropolitane ouer his prouince, there may bee as well a Pope ouer the whole Church: For by the same reason, because a Lorde may bee the chiefe in his seignorie, a Duke in his prouince, a Prince in his Kingdome, therefore there ought to bee an Emperour ouer all the world: or as Master <hi>Caluine</hi> saith, because one fielde is committed to one Husbandman to dresse and to till, therefore the whole Worlde may: which were a thing impossible.</p>

                     <p>THat there ought not to be any one chiefe Bishop, Pope or prelate, to exercise iurisdiction ouer the whole Church, wee doe thus make it good.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 We acknowledge no head of the Church but Christ, neither doth the Scripture attribute this title of Maiestie ouer the whole Church, but onely to Christ. If the Pope or any else bee the head, the Church is his bodie,<note place="margin">Iuel ans. to the Apol. page. 657.</note> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is a shamed to graunt yet. Pope <hi>Athanasius</hi> doubted not to call <hi>populos mundi, partes corporis sui,</hi> the people of the Worlde the partes of his bodie.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if he be the head, hee must doe the duetie of an head, which is, to knit and ioyne the parts together, and to giue effectuall power to euery part. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.16. Where the Apostle alludeth to the gouernement of mans bodie: in the which the parts receiue a double benefite from the head, the knitting and ioyning together by sinewes, which come from the head, and sense and motion also giuen to euery part from the head: but it were blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie to thinke this of the Pope, that he giueth any influence to the Church. If they answer, he is but a ministeriall head, Christ is the principall. We say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that although these things are principallie wrought by the principall head, yet they must bee done instrumentally or Ministerially by the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall head: or else it is but a rotten head: such an one as the Wolfe found in a caruers shop (as you knowe the fable is) a goodly head, saith hee, but without wit or braine. If Christ performe all the duetie of the head himselfe, then is there no other head: if the Pope doe somewhat, that belongeth to the head, tell vs, what is it? If hee will bee an head, and doe nothing, surely hee must needes bee a brainelesse and witlesse head.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is a daungerous and impossible thing to haue the charge of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches committed to one man: GOD alone is sufficient to beare that burthen. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saith, who is sufficient for these things? No pastor or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that is but set ouer one flocke or parish, is sufficient to preach the worde: much lesse is any one man sufficient to gouerne the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth first: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, that hee had the care of all Churches. 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.28. We replie againe, first, then belike
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20636:60"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was vniuersall pastor and not <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, wee must consider that the Apostles were sent to all the world: their calling was not limited: when they had planted the Gospell in one place, they did take care also for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places: but now there is no such Apostolicall calling. Thirdly, <hi>Paul</hi> did not beare this burthen alone, but the Apostles and Euangelists were his coadiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and fellow-helpers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, sayth he, why may not the care of the whole Church bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one man, as well as the gouernment almost of the whole world was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to <hi>Nabuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Augustus</hi>; seeing the gouernement of the Church is easier then the ciuill and politike regiment?</p>
                     <p>We replie. First, wee neuer reade of any that had dominion ouer the whole world, as the Pope chalengeth to haue ouer the whole Church, which is disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed throughout the world. Secondly, these great and large Monarches are saide to haue been giuen of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.37. Not that this large dominion and vsurpation ouer other countries so much pleased God: for the people of God the Israelites in their most flourishing estate neuer had such soueraigntie ouer other countries, but by voluntarie subiection, as in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 4.21. the Kings round about brought presents vnto him: But because the Lord tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vsed this their large and mightie dominion to the good of his Church: for <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a defender of the Church, against all that bare euill will thereat: and the large Empire of the Romans serued very commodiously for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Gospell. Thirdly, the Iesuite sheweth his skill, when he saith, that the regiment of the Church is easier, then the gouernement of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: Whereas there is no greater and waightier burthen vpon earth, then is the charge of soules. It seemeth the Pope taketh his ease, finding the care of the Church to be so easie and pleasant a thing: in deede as he vseth it, it is no great matter: for hee preacheth not, but giueth himselfe to ease and idlenes and all princely pleasures. But England hath found by experience, and so did that worthie and famous Prince King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, that there was neuer matter so hardlie compassed, as was the reformation of the Church, and the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of idolatrie and superstition in this lande. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Nemo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum se episcopum episcoporum constituit, aut quasi tyrannico terrore ad obseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di necessitatem collegas suos adigit. de Baptis.</hi> 2.2. None of vs doth count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a Bishop ouer other Bishops, or taketh vpon him after a commaunding manner, as tyrants vse, to enforce his fellowes to obey. <hi>Ergo</hi> by his iudgement all Bishops are of like and equall authoritie.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To make this argument the more strong, they set vnder it diuerse props: First, why did Christ giue <hi>Peter</hi> this name more then to any other of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, to call him <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Petra</hi> a Rocke, but to shew that hee was appointed to be the foundation of the Church? <hi>Bellarmine cap.</hi> 17. Wee answer, Christ hereby signified, that <hi>Peter</hi> should bee a principall piller of his Church, as the rest of the Apostles, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. He chaunged also the names of some other Apostles, as <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were called <hi>Boanerges,</hi> the sonnes of thunder, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. Therefore this was no such preeminence to <hi>Peter,</hi> neither is it true that <hi>Peter</hi> was almost called by no other name, for he is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Gospel after this called by his old name <hi>Simon, Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17, 25. <hi>Fulk. Annot. in Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>sec.</hi> 7. Secondly, againe (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) the text is <hi>aedificabo,</hi> I will build my Church: but if Christ be here taken for the rocke, his Church was built alreadie,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20636:61"/>
for many beleeued in him. But <hi>Peter</hi> was not made the foundation of his Church, till afterward after his resurrection, and therefore hee saith, I will build.</p>
                     <p>Wee answere. First, it is a corrupt glosse, to say the Church of Christ was not builded, till after the resurrection: for seeing that many beleeued before in Christ, and made a Church, either they must graunt, that the Church was without a foundation, or else, that the foundation was changed from Christ to <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondlie, it is taken therefore for the enlarging and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing of the Church of GOD. It followeth not, because Christ saith, I will build, and his Church was begun to bee built alreadie, that therefore another kinde of building must bee excogitate: no more then, because Christ gaue his spirite to the Apostles <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1. and againe <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.22. and yet biddeth them stay at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> till they should receiue the holie Ghost <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.7. that therefore they should looke for another holy Ghost, or as though they had not receiued the holy Ghost before. But as the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Ghost is meant, for the increase and more plentifull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thereof, so is the building of the Church here taken for the increase of the building.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Tract vlt in Iohann.</note>Wee yet further answere with <hi>Augustine: super hanc petram, quam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessus es, aedificabo ecclesiam:</hi> vppon this rocke, which thou hast confessed, will I build my Church: so that in this place is meant not <hi>Peter</hi> to bee the rocke, but either Christ, whome he confessed, or his saith: whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed him, which commeth all to one effect. There is no great difference, whether wee say, the Church is builded vppon Christ, or faith is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church, for faith is an apprehension of Christ: but of the person of <hi>Peter</hi> it can no more bee vnderstoode then of the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who in some sence are called the foundation of the Church, namely in respect of their holy Apostolick doctrine vpon the which the Church is built. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Iesuites denie not, but here is relation also to the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> but faith considered in his person. We answere: if they meane <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> particular faith, which was a proper adiunct to himselfe, the vniuersall Church cannot be built vpon that faith, seeing when <hi>Peter</hi> dyed, his faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as a proper accident to his person, ceased: if they vnderstand that generall faith, whereby <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of all the rest made this confession: then they all are as well made pillars and foundations of the Church, as he, because it was their generall confession. <hi>Fulk. annot.</hi> in 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> sect. 8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Another place, which our aduersaries mightely vrge, are those words which follow verse 19. I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, whatsoeuer thou shalt binde in earth, shalbe bound in Heauen: <hi>Ergo: Peter</hi> had especiall iurisdiction giuen him more then any of the rest. <hi>Bellarmine cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>Wee answere. First, as <hi>Peter</hi> confessed in the name of all the rest, so this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20636:61"/>
power is geuen him not onelie for the rest (as the <hi>Rhemists</hi> falslie charge vs, that we make <hi>Peter</hi> a proctor for others) but together with the rest: <hi>Peters</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be excluded: for immediately after he deserued for a certaine slip of his person to bee called Sathan: it were an vnfit match, the same person at the same time to be honoured with the glorious title of the rock of Christ, and to sustaine so great a rebuke as to bee called Sathan. Secondlie, here is no more promised to <hi>Peter</hi> then vnto all the rest of the Apostles: <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18.

                     <p n="2">2 By the keyes here cannot be vnderstoode that large iurisdiction which the Papists dreame of, as not onely the authoritie and chaire of doctrine, iudgement, knoweledge, discretion betweene true and false doctrine, all which we graunt together with <hi>Peter</hi> to haue been giuen to al the Apostles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. But say they, hereby is signified the height of gouernement, the power of making lawes, of calling Councels and confirming them, of ordeyning Bishops and Pastors, finally to dispense the goods of the Church spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: all this is added without ground, neither had either <hi>Peter</hi> or any of the Apostles this ample authoritie, no nor the Bishops of Rome for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Christ.

But howsoeuer it was, it is no great matter: for this order is not alwaie kept, as <hi>Galath.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul</hi> nameth <hi>Iames</hi> first; <hi>Iames, Cephas, Iohn,</hi> saith hee, verse 9. the Iesuits best shift is heere to denie the text, saying; it should bee read, <hi>Cephas, Iames Iohn:</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>Iames</hi> bee named first, because he was Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Marke I pray you, <hi>Ergo</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem Peter</hi> was not before <hi>Iames,</hi> but next vnto him, therfore not prince of the Apostles. <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 18.</p>

                     <p>THat <hi>Peter</hi> had no such iurisdiction ouer the Apostles, as to bee called the head and Prince of them: but that to them all indifferentlie were the keyes committed, and did all faithfullie execute their Apostleship without any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of each to other, but ioyned the right hands of fellowship together: we thus confirme it out of the holy Scripture, and necessarie arguments deriued out of the same.</p>

                     <p>Wee answere. First, by his owne confession the Apostles had chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as Apostles, but there was no higher authoritie or power then of the Apostleship: but as they were Apostles they were equall (saith the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite:) <hi>Ergo</hi> there could be no superioritie, for the calling of the Apostles was the highest in the Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To preach the Gospell, and to haue iurisdiction of gouernement, do both belong to the power of the keyes: but the keyes were equallie committed to all: <hi>Ergo</hi> they had all equall power both to preach and to gouerne.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20636:62"/>
Bishop of Rome was to haue the preeminence: To this we replie: that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> was rather to be preferred in respect of place, which was chosen by the Lord himselfe, to be the chiefe citie of his Church: But Rome through the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and vsurpation of the Romans ouer other countries was aduanced to that dignitie, not by the election of God.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of the whole Church, and so of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> too. We answere, he now saith lesse for <hi>Peter,</hi> then if hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, as he was, the Apostle of the whole world: for it was more to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Bishop.

                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Peter</hi> had no superioritie ouer <hi>Paul,</hi> for they ioyned right handes of fellowship: and this allotment was made betweene them, that <hi>Paule</hi> should bee the chiefe of the Gentiles, and <hi>Peter</hi> of the circumcision, <hi>Galath.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth. First, they were ioyned as fellow-laborers in the preaching of the Gospell: but <hi>Peter</hi> might for all this bee greater in the office and power of gouerning. Wee answere: yea, but the text saith, that <hi>Paule</hi> onelie was not appointed to preach to the Gentiles, but hee had the chiefe Apostleship. Now to the Apostleship belongeth, not onely the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of preaching, but the whole vse of the keyes, and power of iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Ergo:</hi> in all respects Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ouer the Gentiles had the chiefe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship.</p>
                     <p>But let any man say, that this was a humane compact amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and <hi>Paul</hi> had his lotte at <hi>Peters</hi> assignement: the text sheweth, that the Lorde himselfe had made this distribution. For when they sawe, saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Gospell ouer the vncircumcision was committed to mee, verse 7. So then the Apostles did but confirme by their consent, that distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they sawe the Lord himselfe had appoynted.</p>
                     <p>Further saith the Iesuite, the diuision was not so made, but that it was lawfull for <hi>Peter</hi> also to preache to the Gentiles. Wee answeare: wee graunt it, and for <hi>Paule</hi> to preache to the Iewes, yet that distinction remayned still, that <hi>Peter</hi> was chiefe of the circumcision, <hi>Paule</hi> of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision.</p>
                     <p>Againe saith hee: but <hi>Peter</hi> had the more excellent lotte, for Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe first preached to the Iewes. Wee answere, wee denie not, but that hee had the first lotte in order: for to the Iewes was the Gospell first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: but <hi>Paul</hi> had the larger and more glorious lotte: the Church of the Iewes, now decaying, and the Gentiles beginning to be planted in their roome. But howsoeuer it was, it cannot bee denied, but that <hi>Paule</hi> was chiefe towards
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20636:63"/>
the Gentiles: And therefore the Church of Rome might with better right haue deriued their authoritie from S. Paul, then from Peter: Both of them they cannot make patrons of their See: seeing by their owne rules the Pope cannot be successor to them both.</p>
                     <p>Further, out of the same place, <hi>Galath.</hi> 2.11. an other thing commeth to bee obserued: that Peter was rebuked of Paule, and in such sort, that it appeareth there was no great inequality between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he doth it to his face openlie, before all men, and at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in <hi>Peters</hi> owne Bishopricke, as they say, can it be now thought that <hi>Paul</hi> was any thing inferior to <hi>Peter</hi>?</p>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Iesuits answere, that the Pope may bee rebuked of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, and ought to take it patiently, if it be done in zeale and loue. Aunswere: First, wee doe not simplie thus conclude, because <hi>Paul</hi> reprehended <hi>Peter,</hi> therefore he was not his superior, but because of the manner, as we shewed: it was done in such sorte, so plainely, so openly, without any submission or crauing of pardon, that there can appeare no inequalitie at all betweene them. Secondly, although they seeme heere to graunt, that the Pope may be rebuked, yet is it otherwise in their Canon lawe, which saith, that though the Pope doe leade innumerable soules to hell, no mortall man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to reprooue his faultes, <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>distin.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.

                     <p n="4">4 Lastlie, what reason was there, why Christ should giue the supremacie to <hi>Peter</hi> ouer the rest? Christ was no acceptor of persons: if hee had bene, <hi>Iohn</hi> should haue bene preferred, whom he loued most. If deserts be weighed, I think <hi>Peter</hi> deserued no more then the rest of his fellowes: Nay I thinke the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Spirit, foreseeing the questions that should afterward arise in the Church about <hi>Peter,</hi> hath so disposed, that this Apostles infirmities both in number more and weight greater then any of the rest, should be euidentlie set forth in Scripture. We will brieflie runne them ouer, not to derogate from the blessed memorie of so excellent an Apostle; but a litle to stay and bridle the preposterous zeale of our aduersaries, who doe ascribe more vnto him, then euer he would haue challenged to himselfe.</p>

The same <hi>Peter</hi> (sayth he) which a little before had confessed him to be the Sonne of God, feared lest he should dye and perish as a man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In promising rashly not to denye Christ, yea vnto death, whereas Christ had foretold him of his fall before, <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth great presumption: <hi>Petrus ex egregio praesumptore creber negator effectus.

                     <p n="3">3 The third great sinne was committed by <hi>Peter</hi> in denying of Christ, and that thrice, yea with an oath, at the instance of a mayden, and in a very short while, before the cocke crewe twise, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.72.

                     <p>Let vs heare <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement of <hi>Peters</hi> fall.

But some agayne may say: he denyed not Christ, for hee sayd hee knewe not the man: <hi>Quasi vero</hi> (sayth he) <hi>qui hominem Christum negat,</hi>

                        <hi>non Christum neget:</hi> as though hee that denyeth the man Christ, doth not flatly denye Christ. Christ also taketh away all doubts (saith he) when he thus said to <hi>Peter,</hi> the cock shall not crowe till thou hast denyed me thrice: he sayth not, till thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the man, but me. Agayne, <hi>Ipse potius redarguit defensores suos: Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doth confute his maintayners and defenders: <hi>Agnouit planè peccatum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um infirmitas Petri: Peters</hi> owne conscience gaue him, that hee had sinned, for he went out and wept bitterly. But if by this meanes his primacie was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he had occasion to reioyce, and not to weepe: Yea he wept bitterly, his sinne was very great: how then dare one of your sect say with a blasphemous mouth, <hi>Petrus non fidem Christi, sed Christum salua fide negauit:</hi>

                        <hi>Peter</hi> denyed not the faith of Christ, but his faith remayning safe and sound he denyed Christ? The ancient writers durst not so extenuate <hi>Peters</hi> fall, no nor <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, that wept full sore, as these men presume to doe.</p>

a Paulo fuit, quòd seruabat consuetudinem Iudaeorum, in qua natus &amp; educatus fuit, sed quòd eam gentibus imponere volebat. Exposit. ad Galat. Peter</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked of <hi>Paule,</hi> because hee kept the custome of the Iewes, wherein hee was brought vp, but because he would lay it vpon the Gentiles. Was this <hi>leuissimum peccatum,</hi> a small transgression? S. <hi>Paule</hi> should greatly haue been to blame, for rebuking <hi>Peter</hi> openly, and so plainly for so small an offence, and should haue done agaynst his owne rule, <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.1. But <hi>Peter</hi> did it of a good mind (sayth <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bellarm. cap. 28.</note>) Yea did? then he was worthie to be excused, not worthie of blame, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> writeth. He might also doe it ignorantly and vnwittingly (saith hee.) How can that be? seeing he was one that made the decree, <hi>Act.</hi> 15: That no yoke should be layd vpon the Gentiles: other then there expressed, and now contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to that decree, hee constrayneth the Gentiles, <hi>Iudaizare,</hi> to play the Iewes.

                     <p>I will now conclude out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> as hee alleageth out of <hi>Cyprian: Nec Petrus, cum secum Paulus de circumcisione disceptaret, postmodum vindicauit sibi aliquid insolenter, vt diceret se primatum tenere, De baptis.</hi> 2.2. Howsoeuer it was, <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Paule</hi> reasoned thus with him, did not stand vpon his pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofles, &amp; chalenge any primacie to himselfe.

                     <p n="2">2 Agayne, they alleadge that storie, how <hi>Peter</hi> ouercame <hi>Simon Magus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> when he would haue taken his flight into the ayre, hauing made himselfe wings, and by the prayer of <hi>Peter</hi> was brought downe agayne and brake his legges, and so dyed: whereupon <hi>Nero</hi> being offended with <hi>Peter,</hi> would haue apprehended him: who being counsailed by the Church, would haue fled from <hi>Rome:</hi> but meeting Christ at one of the gates, and saying vnto him, whether goest thou Lord?

                     <p n="3">3 That concerning Christs apparition to <hi>Peter,</hi> seemeth to bee most vnlike of all: and sauoureth somewhat of the Popish Legends. Like vnto this are the tales of S. <hi>Christopher,</hi> how he caried Christ, and how S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> had him for one of his ghests at his table of hospitalitie: such visions and apparitions of Christ are contrarie to the scriptures, which say, that the heauens must conteyne him till his comming agayne. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth: first, by this meanes, wee doe <hi>compedes Christo inijcere,</hi> wee fetter Christ in heauen. We answere, belike then heauen is a prison, with the Iesuite: God send all that are his such a prison at the length. Agayne, Christ is no otherwise concluded and shut vp in heauen, then as it pleaseth himselfe, and as he hath appoynted so to be.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He obiecteth: that Christ appeared neere vnto the earth to <hi>Paule.</hi> We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: First, there is no such thing proued out of the text, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that the voyce was heard from heauen; not neere the earth, but aboue, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.6.

Therefore out of this place they cannot prooue any such real apparition of Christ.</p>

                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:20636:65"/>We answere: First, it followeth not, if <hi>Peter</hi> were buried at <hi>Rome,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed there: for the translation of the bones and bodies of Martyrs is no vnusuall thing in your Church: As it followeth not, because <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> head, as you say, is to be seene at S. <hi>Siluesters</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that therefore he dyed there; so neither doth it followe of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>

                        <p>COncerning <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome:</hi> First, wee doe not vtterly denye it, but onely affirme that he could not come thither so soone as in the second yeare of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and sit there so long, namely, fiue and twentie yeares, as they hold.

                        <p n="1">1 There is great disagreeing amongst the writers, concerning the time of <hi>Peters</hi> comming to <hi>Rome: Orosius</hi> sayth hee came thither in the beginning of <hi>Claudius</hi> raigne: <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, the 2. yeare of his raigne: other say, the fourth yeare: other, the thirteenth yeare: <hi>Damasus</hi> would haue him come thither in <hi>Nero</hi> his raigne. This dissention of writers sheweth that the matter may be iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubted of, <hi>Fulk. in Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Iesuites answere: No more doe all agree concerning the time when the world was created, nor for the storie of Christs life, in what time euery thing was done when he suffered, and such like: yet it followeth not, that those things were not true, because there is some diuersitie about the time, <hi>Rhemist.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13.</p>
                        <p>Wee replie: First, most of these things concerning the chronologie of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though it be not necessarie to saluation, yet by diligent search may be found in scripture. Secondly, if they can shewe any scripture for <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> as we haue for the other stories, we will beleeue it, though the time perfectly be not knowne: but seeing the scripture maketh no mention at all of his being there, and the time is vncertayne, we may worthilie doubt of it, much lesse are bound necessarilie to beleeue it.</p>

of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the 37. yeare after Christs ascension: we proue out of the scriptures to bee false. For <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and in those quarters round about till 18. yeares after Christ: for <hi>Paul</hi> sawe him there 3. yeares after his calling, and agayne 14. yeares after that, <hi>Galath.</hi> 2. there is 17. yeares, and one yeare was past before <hi>Pauls</hi> conuersion: in all 18. yeares: adde vnto these the 25. yeares of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> that maketh 43. yeares: and so <hi>Peter</hi> should suffer in <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus</hi> raigne, and not in the time of <hi>Nero.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Iesuites answere: that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> seauen yeares before the Councel held at <hi>Ierusalem, Act.</hi> 15. which was in the 18. yeare after Christ: and that being expelled the citie by <hi>Claudius</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there spake with <hi>Paul,</hi> and after that went to <hi>Rome</hi> agayne and there ended his life.</p>
                        <p>This answere we shewe to bee very insufficient. First, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. it appeareth that there was, as it were, a standing and set councel of the Apostles at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> of the which <hi>Peter</hi> was one: for the Church thought good to send vp to the Apostles and Elders which were at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Secondly, till the 18. yeare when this Councel was held, it seemeth that <hi>Peter</hi> had laboured onely or especially amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> of whom there were then but fewe at <hi>Rome:</hi> for, saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, he that was mightie in <hi>Peter</hi> in the Apostleship ouer the circumcision, was also mightie in me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. Therfore <hi>Peter</hi> was not knowne to haue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill this time in the circumcision. Thirdly, afterward it is more like he went to <hi>Antiochia</hi> then to <hi>Rome:</hi> for after this, <hi>Paul</hi> rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch, Gal.</hi> 2. Fourthly, these are but bare coniectures of our aduersaries, and craftie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion without scripture: but seeing we appose them out of scripture, it is great reason, they should likewise answere vs out of scripture.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 We haue diuers other obections also out of the scriptures: as first, that if <hi>Peter</hi> were at <hi>Rome,</hi> it is not like that <hi>Paul</hi> would leaue him out in his salutation in the end of his Epistle, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 16. sent to the brethren. Our aduersaries answere but very simplie, that at that time, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle, either <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> or els <hi>Paul</hi> might write some especiall letters to him by himselfe, and this Epistle enclosed in them: such goodly coniectures they haue. But I pray you what needed S. <hi>Paul</hi> to haue written vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> if S. <hi>Peter</hi> so faithfull and vigilant a Pastor, were continually amongst them?</p>
                        <p>Other places also of scripture we haue: as <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2.20. speaking of <hi>Timothy</hi> he saith, I haue none like minded to him that will faithfully care for your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4.11. These onely are my workfellowes, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.11. onely <hi>Luke</hi> is with me: <hi>Ergo, Peter</hi> all this while was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> would not haue left him out of the number of his fellowe-helpers: at the lest he would not haue commended <hi>Timothy,</hi> though he were a worthie yong man, before him. That which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, is iust nothing: that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces onely of his domesticall helpers, which did minister vnto him: When S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh plainly of his fellowe labourers: these onely are my workfellowes to the kingdome of God, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4.11.</p>

                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:20636:66"/>An other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth arise out of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.16. At my first answering no man assisted me: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is like that <hi>Peter</hi> was not then at <hi>Rome,</hi> for he would not haue forsaken <hi>Paul. Bellarmine</hi> answereth: that he speaketh onely of such fauourers as hee had in <hi>Caesars</hi> court, that they would not make sute for him to the Emperour. But this is a weake solution. First, it appeareth by that which followeth, that they left him without helpe in his open Apologie or defence: they did not assist me (sayth he) but the Lord assisted me: that is, gaue me strength to defend my cause: so that the word, assisting, must bee taken in the same sense before, that they fayled him in that, wherein God assisted him, that is, in speaking boldly in the defence of the truth. Secondly, it is proued by the diuers successe that he had at his first and second answering: at the first all left him, but at the next many were emboldened through his bonds: what to doe? more frankly to speake the word, <hi>Philipp.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Ergo,</hi> at the first they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke him, because they were afrayd to speake the word.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 The Romane faith was first planted by <hi>Peter,</hi> for he first preached to the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was the first Bishop.</p>
                     <p>Answere: First, that <hi>Peter</hi> first preached to the Gentiles, it is contrarie to the storie of the Acts: for <hi>Paul</hi> was conuerted before <hi>Peter</hi> sawe the vision from heauen, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. before which time <hi>Peter</hi> made a great question, whether it were lawfull to preach to the Gentiles.

Secondly, that <hi>Peter</hi> first preached not at <hi>Rome,</hi> it is thus ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered: because it is not like that the Christian faith being spread farre abroad, could be kept from <hi>Rome</hi> the space of 12. yeares, for so long it was by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, before <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome.</hi> Agayne, there were diuers that dwelled at <hi>Rome,</hi> which heard the Apostles speake diuers tongues, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. being straungers then and soiourners at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. he maketh mention of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> and <hi>Iunia,</hi> which were in Christ before him: By these it is most like that the Christian faith was first sowed at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, it is more like that <hi>Paul</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Peter:</hi> for when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he called the Iewes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who sayd vnto him, that they had heard nothing concerning him by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or from the brethren out of <hi>Iudea, Act.</hi> 28.22.

                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p>That appeales ought not to be made to Rome, but that all matters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies may best be ended and determined at home, where they doe arise: It is thus confirmed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This matter was notably handled, <hi>anno</hi> 420. in the sixt Councel of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> where <hi>Augustine</hi> was present, with <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Orosius:</hi> To this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Pope <hi>Zozimus</hi> sent his Legate with certaine requests, of the which this was one, that it might be lawful for Bishops and priests to appeale from the sentence of their Metropolitanes, and also of the Councel to Rome: alleadging for him self a decree of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel. The Councel of <hi>Carthage</hi> sent forthwith to the patriarkes of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople, Antioch</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for a copie of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20636:69"/>
of <hi>Nice,</hi> wherein no such Canon was found, that appeales should bee made to Rome: but the contrary: for in the sixt Canon of that Councel, it was founde how all matters, and all persons ecclesiasticall, both Bishops and others were committed to their Metropolitanes: vpon this decree the Councel of <hi>Carthage</hi> drew out certain reasons why appeales should not be made to Rome. First, it is not otherwise to be thought, but that the grace of God is as ready at hande in one prouince as in another. Secondly, there is no neede to seeke any outlandish help: for the partie grieued may appeale to a prouinciall or generall Councel. Thirdly, it were not equall nor right to appeale from the Councel to the Bishop of Rome: for it is not like, that God will inspire his truth vnto the Bishop, and denie it to a multitude congregated in his name.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, no forraine or outlandish iudgement can be so vpright or iust: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the witnesses cannot be present, being hindered by infirmitie of sex, age, sicknes, by whom the truth should be discussed.</p>
                        <p>Vpon these reasons the Councel concluded, that neither any appeales should be made to Rome: neither that Legates should be sent from Rome for deciding of matters: And this answere they made to <hi>Zozimus</hi> first, to <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and <hi>Celestinus,</hi> that in short time one succeeded another. And for all the B. of Rome his absolution, <hi>Apiarius</hi> was againe called <hi>coram,</hi> and brought to confesse his fault. <hi>Fox. p.</hi> 10. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
                        <p>Now out of the Acts of this Councel, and their reasons alleadged wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it is not fit, conuenient nor reasonable, that appeals should be made to Rome.</p>
                        <p>The Iesuite answereth, that appeales were forbidden to be made by priests to Rome, not by Bishops. This is but a vaine shift, for the reasons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel are general against all appeales: And <hi>Apiarius,</hi> that appealed to Rome, was a priest, and no Bishop.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We can bring the decrees of a latter Councell, then this of <hi>Carthage:</hi> for in the Councell of <hi>Basile</hi> it was decreed, that no actions or controuersies should be brought from other countries to be pleaded at Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were more then foure daies iourney distant from the said court of Rome, a few princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall matters onely excepted, <hi>apud Fox. p.</hi> 697.</p>

                        <p>He reasoneth thus: A manifest hereticke is not so much as a member of the Church, much lesse can he be pope, who they say is the heade of the Church, and therefore in such a case the pope is deposed without anie sentence: and if
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20636:71"/>
afterward the Church proceede against him, they doe not iudge the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he had lost his papacie before.</p>
                        <p>We answer: First, if a manifest hereticke be actually deposed, it is by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret iudgement and sentence of God: for by no other authority can he be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as they hold: but before God manifest heresie, and close and secret heresie is all one: therefore the Pope is also actually deposed for secret heresie, and not onely for manifest: and so some of the papists think, as <hi>Iohann. de Turre veniata.</hi> Secondly, what call you manifest heresie? or how is hee knowen to bee a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest hereticke? Can hee bee an heretick before hee bee conuinced? shall iudgement passe against him vncondemned? A murtherer is a dead man by lawe, yet hee liueth till iudgement passe vpon him: so is the Pope beeing an heretick, yet Pope, till he be iudicially proceeded against; as a murtherer dead by right is in act yet liuing, till by law he is depriued of his life. An heretick, sayth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> after two or three admonitions auoyd: that is, saith the Iesuite, he is now excommunicate before the sentence of the iudge. Be it so, but hee must first be admonished, and if he still continue obstinate, then he is a manifest heretike: so before the Pope can be knowen to be a manifest heretick, he must be found obstinate, he cannot be obstinate, vnlesse he refuse to be admonished, if he be admonished, then is he iudged. Thirdly, an heretick ceaseth not to bee a priest, (as they speake) no not after heresie is knowen, for manifest heretickes may baptize. The <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Augustines</hi> time were manifest hereticks, and yet the Church did not baptize againe after them: If a manifest heretick cease not to be a priest, neither ceaseth he to be Pope; there is like reason of both: for if an heretick, because he is not a member of the Church, can not be a Pope, neither also can he retayne the priesthood.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, who seeth not what bare and friuolous shifts those are? one saith, the Church may iudge the Pope,<note place="margin">Caietan.</note> not as he is Pope, but in respect of his person: an other sayth, that they may iudge the man which was Pope, but hee is then no Pope, because his heresie tooke from him the papacie. Why masters what iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is here? is the Pope one thing and the Popes person an other? By the same reason you may say, that the Pope neither eateth, nor drinketh, nor sleepeth, nor dieth, and so make a god of him, because it is the popes person that doth all this, and not the Pope.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 Diuers examples wee are able to bring forth, how the Pope hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for other crimes, beside heresie. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 13. was deposed in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel by the consent of <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour, for other matter beside heresie: as that he ordayned Deacons in a stable, that he committed incest with two of his sisters, that playing at dice, he called to the diuell for helpe, that he defloured virgins, that he lay with <hi>Stephana</hi> his fathers concubine, likewise with <hi>Ramera</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and her Neece: for these beastlie parts and such like, he was deposed: there was no heresie obiected agaynst him. And thinke you not he was worthily vnpoped? yet the Papists thinke no: for they admit no cause of depriuation but heresie. This deuillish Pope, through the harlots of <hi>Rome</hi> (for he was well beloued of them) recouered his Popedome agayne; but at the length the Lord himselfe displaced him: for in the tenth yeere of his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being founde without the citie with an other mans wife, hee was so wounded of her husbande, that within eight dayes after hee dyed, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 159.</p>

                        <p>In the Councel of <hi>Brixia, Gregorie</hi> the 7. was deposed, not for heresie, but for other abominable vices: as maintayning of periurie and murthers: for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diuinations &amp; Dreames, Sorcerie &amp; Necromancie, <hi>Fox. p.</hi> 181. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. deposed in the Councel of <hi>Constance: Eugenius</hi> in the Councel at <hi>Basile:</hi> yet neither of them for heresie. And yet our aduersaries would still make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that Popes cannot be deposed for any crime but heresie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 We can haue no better argument, then from our aduersaries themselues. It is a sport to see what diuers opinions they hold, and doe runne as it were in a maze, not knowing which way to get out. <hi>Pighius</hi> thinketh, that the Pope cannot possiblie fall into heresie, and therefore for no cause may bee deposed: Some other thinke that the Pope for secret and close heresie is actually deposed of GOD, and may also bee deposed and iudged of the Church: thus holdeth <hi>Iohann. de turre cremat. Caietanus</hi> is of opinion, that for manifest and open he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie the Pope is both alreadie by right deposed, and may also actually be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the Church: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confuteth all these. There is a fourth opinion most grosse: that the Pope neither for secret nor open heresie, is either alreadie of right deposed, or may be actually depriued of the Church. Lastly commeth in the nice and daintie Iesuite with his quirkes and quiddities, who sayth, that the Pope in case of manifest heresie, ceaseth to bee Pope, and is euen now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: and if after the Church proceede agaynst him, they iudge not the

                        <p>A third cause was, the vnquiet estate of the Greeke Church, who often vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily referred their matters to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being lesse partiall and a more indifferent Iudge, they themselues being diuided and rent into sects. And hereupon, and other like causes it came about,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 18.</note> that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> a little stepped aboue his fellowe Patriarkes, but yet had no such preeminent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as to commaund them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> being thus tickled with vayne glorie, because they were reuerenced of other Churches, many matters were committed vnto them, and their consent required vnto the decrees of Councels, when they were
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20636:73"/>
absent. Hereupon they laboured euery day more and more to aduance that See, taking euery small occasion that might helpe forward their ambicious desire, till <hi>Anno.</hi> 606. or somewhat after, <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. obtayned of wicked <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour (who murthered his master the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to come to the Empire, and was after slaine himselfe of <hi>Heraclius</hi> that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him) of him, I say, <hi>Boniface</hi> for himselfe and his successors obtayned, to bee called vniuersall Bishops ouer the whole Church:<note place="margin">Fox. p. 120.</note> and the See of <hi>Rome</hi> to haue the preeminence aboue all other Churches in the world.</p>
                        <p>Afterward in Pope <hi>Zacharie</hi> his time, the proude and insolent iurisdiction of <hi>Rome</hi> was established by <hi>Pipinus</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who aspired to the Crowne, and obtayned it by the sayd Popes meanes, first deposing <hi>Childericus</hi> the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, and dispensing with the oath, which the French men had made before to <hi>Childericus, Calum. Institut.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 17.</p>
                        <p>Thus then it sufficiently appeareth, that the primacie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which it now vniustly challengeth ouer other Churches, is not of any such antiquitie, as they would beare the world in hand, neither that it had the beginning from Christ: but both the time when, and the authors by whom it began, may bee easily assigned.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Wee neede no better argument, to proue that the primacie of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not his originall from Christ, then the Iesuites owne confession. First, he sayth, that it doth not depend of Christs institution, but, <hi>ex Petri facto,</hi> of <hi>Peters</hi> fact, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should bee rather <hi>Peters</hi> successor, then the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> or any other: It is not, <hi>iure diuino,</hi> saith he, by Gods lawe: neither is it, <hi>ex prima institutione pontificatus, quae in Euangelio legitur,</hi> of the first institution whereof wee reade in the Gospell. And agayne, <hi>Romanum pontificem succedere Petro, non habetur expresse in scripturis:</hi> It is not expressely set downe in scripture, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should succeede <hi>Peter:</hi> but it is grounded onely vpon the tradition of <hi>Peter.</hi> Nay, he saith further, that <hi>Peter</hi> needed not to haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen any particular place for succession, and he might as well haue chosen <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> as <hi>Rome: Ergo,</hi> neither is the succession of <hi>Rome</hi> grounded vpon scripture, neither any commandement of Christ: for then <hi>Peter</hi> could not haue had free choyse to appoynt his successor where he would himselfe, as the Iesuite saith, if he had had any especiall direction or commaundement from Christ. So then, marke I pray you, they cannot proue out of scripture, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to succeede <hi>Peter</hi> in the chiefe Bishopricke, but onely that <hi>Peter</hi> had the chiefe Bishopricke committed to him and his successors in generall, whosoeuer they should appoynt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> by their owne confession, can alleadge no scripture, institution, or commandement of Christ, for the primacie of the Church to bee annexed to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> and yet agaynst their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they will alleadge scripture to colour the matter withall, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de pontif. ca.</hi> 17.</p>

Secondly, Our Sauiour prayeth likewise for all his Apostles, that they might be sanctified in the truth, yea for al, that should beleeue by their preaching: yet is not euery Christian pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged from all error of fayth.

                     <p>THat the Popes and Bishops of Rome haue not onely erred in manners, but euen in fayth; and not onely priuately and personally as men, but pulikely and iudicially as Popes; that they haue by their publike and open preaching, defence, allowance, and consent approued and established erronious, and some hereticall opinions: thus we trust to make it playne and euident to all men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Peter</hi> erred: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope may, though he were <hi>Peters</hi> successor. First, <hi>Peter</hi> erred in denying of Christ: the Iesuite answereth: First, he began not yet to be the chiefe Bishop, which he entred not into till after the resurrection, when Christ sayd vnto him, Feede my sheepe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. therefore all this while he might erre. A goodly answere: I pray you tell me, was not the Church before Christs passion, and after, built vpon the same rocke? I trow they cannot denie it: but <hi>Peter</hi> was not the rock before, therefore not after.</p>
                     <p>If he were therefore called a rock because of his confession of Christ, why should he not then rather, straight after his confession, take possession of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then immediately after his deniall of Christ? Surely this is but a silly shift. Secondly, sayth the Iesuite, <hi>Peter</hi> fayled in charitie when he denied Christ, not in fayth, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and if he fayled in fayth, he lost the confession of fayth, and not fayth it selfe. We answere: First, and can a true fayth then bee separated from loue by your doctrine? The Apostles knew no such fayth: Saint <hi>Iames</hi> sayth, it is a dead fayth that is without the works of loue, and the fayth of diuels, that is, no faith, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.17.19. If then <hi>Peters</hi> loue failed, his fayth also fayled. Secondly, we doe not say that <hi>Peters</hi> fayth was lost and vtterly extinguished, for Christ prayed for him, but whether it were an error in fayth which <hi>Peter</hi> fell into: for it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20636:76"/>
is not all one to erre in fayth, or cleane to lose fayth. Thirdly, hee lost the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of fayth, he denied Christ in word, <hi>Ergo:</hi> he denied the fayth, howsoeuer he thought in heart: for these two are the principall fruites of fayth, to Beleeue with the heart, and Confesse with the mouth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and where either of these is wanting, there can not be a right fayth: for he that putteth away a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, maketh shipwrack also of faith, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. But the Iesuite I see hath a queazie stomack, let him cough vp lustily, and say with one of his fellowes, <hi>Petrus non fidem Christi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Alan. Cop.</note> 
                        <hi>sed Christum salua fide negauit. Peter</hi> denied not the fayth of Christ, but, his fayth remayning sound and whole, hee onely denied Christ. Loe, here is newe popish diuinitie, that a man may denie Christ, and yet not denie the faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> erred in constraining the Gentiles to doe as the Iewes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, it was an error in example &amp; conuersation, not in fayth or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. We answere: First, in this example of <hi>Peter</hi> there was also inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an error in fayth, for how should the Gentiles better know <hi>Peters</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then by his example, by the which they fell into an error of fayth, and were constrayned to conforme themselues like to the Iewes: thinking that the Iewish ceremonies were necessary to bee retayned? Secondly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe sayth, they went not the right way to the truth of the Gospell: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they erred from the trueth of the Gospell, and so in fayth. Thirdly, the diuines of <hi>Paris</hi> doe attribute to <hi>Peter</hi> an error in fayth, <hi>Fulk. annot.</hi> 4. <hi>Galat. sect.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We can produce many examples of the Popes, which haue erred iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, namely, openly haue maintayned errors. To let passe <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> who sacrificed to Idols, as a slippe of his person, and he afterward repented him of his fall: yet by the way the Iesuite is deceiued, that thinketh it probable, that the Popes particular person cannot fall into heresie: here you see <hi>Marcellinus</hi> fell into Idolatrie.</p>

That <hi>Honorius</hi> was a <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelite, Melchior Canus</hi> a papist confesseth: hee was condemned for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike in the 6.7. and 8. generall synodes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are corrupted, or they might be deceiued in iudgement, as in a matter of facte: or that <hi>Honorius</hi> onely misliked the speech, to say there were two willes in Christ, and not the thing. See what poore shiftes heere bee to make <hi>Honorius</hi> no heretike, and yet all will not be.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the sixt tooke vp <hi>Formosus</hi> body, and cut off two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of his right hande, and buried him againe in a lay-mans Sepulchre: Then
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20636:76"/>
followed <hi>Rhomanus</hi> the first, <hi>Theodorus</hi> the second, <hi>Iohannes</hi> the ninth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored <hi>Formosus</hi> with his decrees, iudging him to bee lawfull Bishop. After them commeth <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, who tooke vp the body agayne, cutte off the head, and cast it into <hi>Tiber.</hi> The Iesuite answereth, that <hi>Stephanus</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> erred onely in a matter of fact. A goodly cloke to couer the filthines of their Ghostly fathers withall.</p>
                     <p>But by your leaue a little: doe you not holde it to bee an article of fayth to beleeue the Pope to bee heade of Christes Church? Then was it an article of fayth to hold that <hi>Formosus</hi> was right Pope, for at that time there was no other. <hi>Ergo, Stephanus</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> erred in fayth, defining the contrary. All that you can say, is this: that it was not yet determined and decreed for an article of fayth, so to beleeue: see I pray you, these mennes fayth is pinned vpon Popes sleeues. Why masters, the rule of fayth is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, you cannot make new articles of fayth now, but onely declare and explane those that are. But doe you not thinke that these iollie Popes, that would rake the dead out of their graues, for their holines might deserue at GODS hand, to haue a priuiledge not to erre in fayth?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Siluester</hi> the second was a Necromancer and a Coniurer, and therefore fallen from the fayth. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayth: hee was a good man, and all are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and lyes that are tolde of him: and because hee was cunning in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, that ignorant age straightwayes iudged him to bee giuen to Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee may take the Iesuites worde, if wee will. But the storie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by authors of better credit then <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> as <hi>Iohannes Stella, Platina, Petrus Premonstratens. Nauclerus, Antoninus. Fox. pag.</hi> 167.</p>

                        <hi>Anastasius</hi> was a Nestorian heretike, whose heresie was this, that there are, as two natures, so also two persons in Christ, <hi>Alphons. de castro. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de haeresib. cap.</hi> 4.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now commeth in Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or rather <hi>Heldebrand,</hi> for hee was a very brand of hell fire: called <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth: Of whome <hi>Benno</hi> writeth thus: that hee poysoned sixe Popes his predecessors to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a way to the popedome: that hee was a Coniurer, a raiser of Diuels, and in his rage hee cast the sacrament into the fier. But sayth <hi>Harding</hi> our countrey man, though vnworthily, <hi>Benno</hi> was his enemie, and wrote of displeasure: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinketh that some <hi>Lutherane</hi> was the author of the booke, which goeth vnder the name of <hi>Benno,</hi> who was Cardinall in this <hi>Hildebrands</hi> time. But <hi>Benno</hi> onely doth not thus report of him: he was openly twise for the same crimes conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned in Councel: first at <hi>Wormes:</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel at <hi>Brixia</hi> in Italy, &amp; Pope <hi>Clement</hi> 3. elected to succeed him.<note place="margin">Vrspergens.</note> And the said <hi>Gregory</hi> died in exile, of whom <hi>Antonius</hi> reporteth, that before his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20636:77"/>
death, he repented him of his insolencie shewed toward the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. whom with his wife and young child bare foote, and bare legd, hee had caused three dayes together, in extreame frost and colde, to waite at his palace gates at <hi>Canusium,</hi>

Yet this <hi>Hildebrand</hi> for all these insolent, cruell, and dishonest partes, is commended by our papists, <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Bellarmine</hi> and other, for a deuout Catholike man, who did all things of a zeale to the Church. By this you may iudge, whome our aduersaries count a Catholike man.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. affirmed, that the soules lie in a traunce till the day of iudgement, and feele neither payne nor ioye. <hi>Harding,</hi> and likewise <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> answere, that this was an error, but no heresie. Yet in the Vniuersitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> it was condemned for heresie, as <hi>Gerson</hi> writeth. Againe sayth <hi>Harding,</hi> he held it only as a priuate opinion. But <hi>Massaeus</hi> sayth, that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> preached this heresie and sent out preachers to maintaine it. Hee was condemned (sayth he) with his error by the diuines of <hi>Paris</hi> in the presence of <hi>Philip</hi> the French King, before he was Pope, when he was yet but a priuate Doctor. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is proued by B. <hi>Iewel,</hi> that he was Pope 13. yeares before <hi>Philip</hi> was king, <hi>Iuell. defens. apolog. p.</hi> 667.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. denied the life to come, and the resurrection of the body: And this heresie was openly obiected against him in the Councel of <hi>Constance. Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> before him, answere, that he was not the rightful Pope, for there were three at that time, and therefore might erre. But <hi>Platina</hi> sayth, that he was chosen at <hi>Bonoma,</hi> by the consent of all the Cardinals, <hi>ex Iuel. pag.</hi> 671.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 4. was condemned and deposed as an heretike in the Councel of <hi>Basile.</hi> Where the Iesuite hath no other answer, then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Councel as Schismatical, to acquite the Pope, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de pontif. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>By these examples it may appeare to the indifferent reader, that it is no rare nor impossible thing, for the Popes of Rome to erre, yea become playne heretikes: And as for that shift of the Iesuite, that they are no longer Popes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they openly begin to teach heresie, this is, as <hi>Alphonsus</hi> sayth, <hi>In re seria verbis velle iocari,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De haeresib. lib. 1. cap. 4.</note> to dallie with words in a serious and earnest matter. And so euery Bishop shal be as well priuiledged as the Pope, and cannot fall into heresie: for why may we not say that a Bishop, when he is knowen to bee an heretike, ceaseth to bee Bishop any longer, as the Pope is no longer Pope, and so as long as he remayneth Bishop, cannot possiblie bee an heretike? Surely this is but paltrie and beggarly stuffe.</p>

                        <p>We answere: First, it is a great vntruth, that all other Apostolike Sees are gone, for there is a succession at <hi>Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople, Ephesus,</hi> euen at this day. Secondly, it is false, that the See of Rome hath continued in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it now professeth, which indeed is no religion, but superstition and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, these 1600. yeres: for first till <hi>Gregories</hi> time, which was 600. yeeres after Christ, none of the popes would be called vniuersall Bishops: and it was more then 300. yeeres, from <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 1. to <hi>Siluester</hi> the 2. when sathan is thought fully to be let loose: for he by the diuel was aduanced to the papacie: All these yeeres therefore you must strike off in your account.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20636:78"/>
for it is the iust iudgement of God vpon the world, because they loued not the trueth, that they should be deluded a long time, and deceiued by Antichrist, and beleeue lies: so did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prophesie, 2. <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 2.10, 11.

                        <p>IT is euident and plaine, and neede not much proofe, that the Romane Church, as also any particular visible Church, maie not onely erre in faith, but fall cleane away into heresie and Idolatrie, as we see it come to passe in the Church of Rome.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

The Pope may erre, as we haue before shewed, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Church of Rome: for the Apostolike See, as they say, is the cause that no error can approch or come neere them.

It is necessary to haue some lawes, beside the diuine law, for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church: for the word of God is too vniuersal, neither is sufficient to direct euery particular action: therefore other ecclesiasticall lawes must bee added, but euery good and necessary law hath a coactiue and constraining po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and bindeth the conscience to obedience: <hi>Ergo</hi> the constitutions of the Popes and Councels, which are the only ecclesiastical lawes, doe binde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, the word of God contayneth all necessarie rules to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherefore all lawes of the Church concerning matters of faith, are but explanations, and interpretations of the rules of fayth set forth in scripture, if they be godly lawes, and so are not the lawes of men but of God, and doe bind the conscience to the obseruation thereof: as the lawes of the Church, which command Christians to resort to the congregation to heare Gods word, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently to receiue the sacraments, are the very ordinances and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christ, who enioyned his Apostles to preach, and baptize, and his faythfull people to heare and to be baptized, and therefore in conscience wee are bound to the obedience hereof. Secondly, there are other ecclesiasticall lawes appoynted for the publique order of the Church, concerning externall rites and circumstances of persons and place, as the houres of prayer, the forme of the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20636:79"/>
but in regarde of that contempt, and offence which might followe in the not keeping of them: contempt to our superiors, whome wee ought in all lawfull things to obey; offence, in grieuing the conscience of our weake brethren. So that euen these constitutions also which are made according to the rules of the Gospell, that is, vnto edification, to the glorie of God, and for auoyding of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, doe necessarilie binde vs in conscience, not conscience of the thinges themselues, which are but externall, but conscience of obedience to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrates, and conscience in taking heede of all iust offence, <hi>sic.

                              </gap>. lib. 4. de pontif.</note>2 Wee will beate the Iesuite with his owne staffe: hee saith not that all lawes doe binde the conscience, but onely iust lawes, in the which fower co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are required. First, that they be made for some profitable end: so are not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish lawes which nourish superstition, and haue no edifying, and some of them doe commaund plaine idolatry, &amp; open impietie, as the worshipping of images, the adoration of the Masse, &amp; such like. Secondly, saith he, they must not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Gods law, but such are many of their ordinances, yea the most of them. Thirdly, they must be made by him that hath authoritie: therefore none of the Popes lawes binde the vniuersall Church, for it is not subiect to him. Fourthly, the forme and manner of imposing such lawes must be orderly: but their lawes are most disordered, imposed vpon the Church violently, without their consent, or any good proceeding. Thus, you see, euen by their owne confession, their lawes cannot binde.</p>
                        <p>One thing more I must needes tell them of. If they would needes haue their lawes to binde men in conscience, they should haue made fewer of them: now they are so many, that if the breach of them were an offence of conscience, doe men, what they could, they should dailie make shipwrack of their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is a true saying that is reported of one <hi>Thomas Arthur,</hi> a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, it is an homely speech, because the matter was somewhat homely, yet hee did hit the marke. Like as (saith he) crosses were set vp against the walles of <hi>London,</hi> that no man should pisse there; and while there were but a few, men for reuerence of the crosses, would not pisse against the wall: but when in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner they set vp crosses, men of necessitie were faine to pisse vpon the wall and crosses too. So saith he, if there had been fewer lawes of the Church, they would haue been better kept:<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 999.</note> but now they are so manie, that men cannot chose but breake them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The Pope hath no power to correct the transgressors of his lawes ouer the whole Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee cannot make lawes to binde the whole Church. The argument followeth, for hee that hath absolute power to make lawes, hath also power to commaunde obedience to the lawes so made.</p>
                        <p>The first is thus proued: the Pope indeede hath taken vppon him many times to thunder out his excommunication against other Churches: but it was an vsurped and tyrannicall power, and many times resisted, and controuled.</p>
                        <p>Pope <hi>Victor Anno</hi> 200. would haue excommunicate the East Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about the keeping of Easter,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 41.</note> but hee was stayed by <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> The

                        <p>In the Councell of <hi>Basile,</hi> Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> cited Cardinall <hi>Iuliane,</hi> with the rest of the fathers there assembled to come to <hi>Bononia,</hi> vnder great penaltie: they likewise cited <hi>Eugenius</hi> vnder the like penaltie, either to come or send to <hi>Basile. Fox. pag.</hi> 668.</p>
                        <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, in his fumish Antichristian Bull, excommunicated and condemned <hi>Luther.</hi>
                           <hi>Luther</hi> with better right pronounceth sentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against him, being an aduersarie to Christ, in these words: <q>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the power and might, that the spirit of Christ, and efficacie of our faith can doe in these our writings, if you shall persist still in your furie, we condemne you together with this Bull and all the decretall, and giue you to sathan to the destruction of the flesh, that your spirit in the day of the Lord may be deliuered: in the name, which you persecute, of Iesus Christ our Lorde. <bibl>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thus you see what small force there is of these popish leaden Bulls, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous excommunications: for it falleth out iustlie by them,<note place="margin">Prouer. 26. ver. 2.</note> as the wise man saith.

                        <p n="1">1 God tooke of the spirite that was in <hi>Moses,</hi> and distributed it among the seuentie Elders,<note place="margin">Numb. 11.16.</note> that were chosen to beare the burthen of gouernement
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20636:81"/>
with <hi>Moses</hi> and to bee his helpers: the Lorde tooke of his spirite, not by dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing it, but by deriuing of his vertue to the rest: but the Pope is now in the roome and place of <hi>Moses</hi> in the Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> from him to the rest is this an authoritie deriued.</p>
                        <p>Answer: First, <hi>Moses</hi> example was extraordinarie, he was a figure of Christ, not of the Pope, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 18. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. The Pope might with better right stand vpon <hi>Aarons</hi> example, who was high Priest, not lay claime to <hi>Moses</hi> office, who was the Prince and Captaine of the people: for the Pope, I trow, would be chiefe Bishop, and not Emperor too. Secondly, the meaning is not that God deriued <hi>Moses</hi> spirit to the rest: but bestowed the like gift of prophesying vpon them, as <hi>Moses</hi> had: surely neuer any mortall man had the spirite in such aboundance, that it could bee deuided into seuentie portions, and one Prophet to make many. The like phrase is vsed, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.15. Where the Prophets saide, that the spirit of <hi>Eliah</hi> did rest on <hi>Elisha,</hi> that is, God endued him with an excellent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prophesying, as <hi>Elias</hi> had. If they will vnderstand this place also of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of spirits, how then shall that be taken in the 9. verse where <hi>Elisha</hi> praieth, that this spirit might be doubled vpon him? If his spirit were deriued from <hi>Eliah,</hi> how could it be doubled vpon him? How could it be multiplied and increased? how could he haue more then was in the fountaine or originall, seeing he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all from thence?</p>
                        <p n="3">3 What maketh this place, I pray you, for the power of externall iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Here it is saide that God gaue of his spirit to seauentie Elders and rulers of the people, and enabled them for their office; endued them with wisdome, and knowledge, and dexteritie in iudging of the people: this maketh nothing for their purpose, vnlesse they will also say, that there is a secret influence of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wisdome deriued from the Pope to all other Bishops, whereby they are made able to execute their office: but (I trow) they will not say so: for <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus de castro,</hi> truly saith of the Popes of Rome, <hi>constat plures eorum adeo esse illiteratos, vt grammaticam penitus ignorent:</hi> it is certaine that many of them were so vnlearned, that they hard and scant knew their grammar.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The argument followeth not from one particular countrie, as this was of the Iewes, to the vniuersal Church: that because the seauentie Elders receiued iurisdiction from <hi>Moses</hi> (yet that cannot be proued out of this place, for they were rulers before, and commaunders of the people, the were now but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnished, and further enabled) yet it were no good reason, that therefore the Ecclesiasticall Ministers ouer the whole Church, should receiue their power from one.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Neither doth it follow, that because the Prince and ciuill Magistrate may bestowe ciuil offices, create Dukes, Earles, Lords, constitute Iudges, Deputies, Lieutenants, by his sole authoritie, that by the same reason Ecclesiasticall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should receiue their power &amp; office from their superiors: for although, the Church from ancient time, hath thought it good, to make some inequalitie and difference in Ecclesiasticall offices for the peace of the Church: yet the superiors
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20636:81"/>
haue not such a soueraigntie and commaunding power ouer the rest, as the Prince hath ouer his subiects.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 The Apostles had not their iurisdiction from <hi>Peter,</hi> but all receiued it indifferently from Christ: this the Iesuite doth not barely acknowledge, but proueth it by argument,. against the iudgement of other Papists. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. <hi>Ergo</hi> neither Bishops are authorised from the Pope, though he were <hi>Peters</hi> successor: for if he were (to graunt it for disputation sake) he is no more to the Bishops of the Church, then <hi>Peter</hi> was to the Apostles. If hee gaue not the keyes to the Apostles; neither doth the Pope Saint <hi>Peters</hi> successor, to the Bishops, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles successors: for they may with as great right challenge to bee the Apostles successors, as he can to be Saint <hi>Peters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nay, the Apostles gaue no power or iurisdiction to the Elders and pastors, whom they ordained: <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.

                        <head>The Papists.</head>
                        <p>THe Papists of former times were not ashamed to say, that the Pope is the Lord of the whole Church: as <hi>Panormitane</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Basile, Fox. page</hi> 670. Yea, Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third said, writing to the Emperor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> that as the Moone receiued her light from the Sunne, so the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dignitie did spring from the Pope: and that the papall dignitie was seuen and fortie times greater then the imperiall:<note place="margin">Innoc. 3. in decretal.</note> yea Kinges and Emperors are more inferior to the Pope then lead is to golde, <hi>Gelasius distinct.</hi> 96. But our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter papists ashamed of their forefathers arrogancie, in wordes seeme to abate somewhat of their proud sentence, but in effect say the same thing: For they confesse that the Emperor hath his office and calling of God, and not from the Pope: neither that the Pope directly hath any temporall iurisdiction: but indirectly hee may depose Kinges and princes, abrogate the lawes of Emperors, and establish his owne: he may take vnto himselfe the iudgement of temporall causes, and cite Kings to appeare before him: yet not directlie (saith the Iesuite) as hee is ordinarie Iudge ouer the Bishops and whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, yet indirectlie, as hee is the chiefe spirituall Prince, hee may doe all this, if hee see it necessarie for the health of mens soules. And so in effect, by their popish indirect meanes, they giue him as great authoritie, as euer hee vsurped or challenged, <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The Ecclesiasticall and ciuill power doe make but one bodie and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, as the spirite and the flesh in man: Now the Ecclesiastical power, which is as the soule and spirite, is the chiefe part, because it is referred to a more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end, namely the safetie and good of the soule: the other is as the flesh to the spirite, and respecteth but a temporall end, as the outward peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie of the common-wealth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the spirituall power is chiefe, and may commaund the other. <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, it is a very vnfit and vnproper similitude, to compare these two regiments to the soule and the bodie: for by this meanes, as the spirite giueth life to the bodie, and euery parte thereof, so the ciuill and temporall state should receiue their office and calling from the Ecclesiasticall, which the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite himselfe denieth, and so directly the one should rule the other: for the soule directly I trow, not indirectly moueth the body and gouerneth it. But if wee will speake as the Scripture doth, we make all but one bodie: and it is the spirit of Christ, who is the head, that giueth effectuall power to euery parte. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.15.16.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It is false that the ciuill magistracie onely concerneth the outward and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20636:82"/>
temporall commoditie onely: for vnto Princes also is committed the chiefe care of religion and the worship of God: They are to see true religion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced, yea to watch ouer Ecclesiasticall ministers, and to charge them to looke to their offices: the Prince is Gods minister, for the wealth both of the soules and bodies of his subiects: And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth to pray for Kings and gouernours, that wee may liue (not onely) a peaceable life, but in all godlines and honestie, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is parte of the magistrates office, as to procure the peace of the people, so to haue a care of their godlie life. Wherefore it is false, as the Iesuite supposeth, that the chiefe ende of the ciuill gouernement, is onely outward and temporall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> his argument is nothing worth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Azariah</hi> the high Priest droue <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King out of the temple, when hee would haue burned incense, and caused him to goe out of the citie and dwell apart, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. <hi>Iehoiada</hi> likewise deposed <hi>Athalia,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 11. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope may depose wicked and vngodly Princes. <hi>Bellarmine cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, wee denie, that there is now, or ought to bee any such high Priest in the Church of God, to haue the chiefe authoritie in spirituall matters, as there was in the lawe: for hee was the type and figure of Christ, who is our high Priest, and chiefe Bishop. Secondly, these examples doe not excuse the Popes tyrannie, who hath deposed rightfull Kinges and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and better then himselfe: as Pope <hi>Zacharie</hi> deposed <hi>Childericus</hi> the French King, and set vp <hi>Pipinus: Gregorie</hi> the seuenth set vp <hi>Rodolphus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Henricus</hi> the fourth, the Emperor. Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> set vp the sonne of the saide <hi>Henricus</hi> against his father. But we will answere more particularly to these examples.</p>
                        <p>To the first: First, it was not the sole act of <hi>Azariah</hi> the high Priest, but there were 80. Priests that ioyned with him beside, and they all spake to the King: this example therefore maketh nothing for the sole authoritie of the Pope, who saith, that he may depose the Emperor himselfe, without any Councell. <hi>Innocent.</hi> 4. Secondly, they did not depose <hi>Vzziah:</hi> they onely withstoode him according to the lawe of God, because hee vsurped the priests office: so ought faithfull Bishops and pastors euen to reproue the greatest Magistrates, for the manifest contempt, and open breach of Gods lawe: Neither did they constraine the King to goe forth, before they saw the iudgement of God vpon him: for the text saith, they compelled him to go forth, because the Lord had smitten him, they saw the leprosie to rise vp in his face, vers. 20. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the extraordinarie iudgement of God, and not of the high priest. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was not deposed from the Kingdome, though he dwelt alone: his son did execute the office only for him, and raigned after him: for being a leper, by the law he was to dwell apart, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 13.46. Here was nothing done (we see) by the sole authoritie of the high Priest, but they had the manifest and direct lawe of God, vnto the which their Kings also were subiect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="150" facs="tcp:20636:83"/>To the second example, we answere. First, <hi>Athaliah</hi> was a tyrant and an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper, and ought not to raigne, and therefore was iustly deposed. Secondly, <hi>Iehoiada</hi> did it not by his owne power, but assembled the Fathers and Princes of the land, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.2. He shewed them the young King, and they made a couenant with him. <hi>Iehoiada</hi> onely gaue directions, (the King being now knowen vnto them) vnto the Captaines and gouernours. Thirdly, they had the flat word of God for that action, The Kings sonne must raigne, as the Lord hath saide, concerning the sonnes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> ver. 3. So when the Pope hath any such warrant from God, he may doe as <hi>Iehoiada</hi> did.</p>

                           <hi>Aaron</hi> was chosen to the priesthood, vnto whome the charge of sacrifices and vnto his sonnes was committed: so <hi>Moses</hi> remained still Prince of the people, whom <hi>Iosua</hi> succeeded, and <hi>Aaron</hi> was inuested to the priesthoode, and so the offices were distinct: this example therefore of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> is extraordinarie, and proueth not.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the time when <hi>Ely</hi> iudged <hi>Israel,</hi> which was in the dayes of the iudges, we must vnderstand, that the gouernement of <hi>Israel</hi> was very disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and men were left to themselues to doe almost what themselues listed: as <hi>Iud.</hi> 17. we reade that <hi>Micah</hi> set vp an Idoll in his house, and the reason is rendered, there was no King in <hi>Israel,</hi> but euery man did that which seemed good in his owne eyes.

The <hi>Leuites</hi> wife was most shamefully abused by the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> for there was no King, chap. 19.1. The men of <hi>Beniamin</hi> tooke them wiues by force: for they had no King, chap. 21.25. So you see that both religion was corrupted, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people grew to be outragious; and all because there was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect distinct gouernement, there was no King in <hi>Israel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In <hi>Elie</hi> his time, the word of God was precious, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. Great was the ignorance of the whole land: the licentiousnesse also of his sonnes was a great offence to all <hi>Israel,</hi> and brought a great decay of godlines with it, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17.23. Yea they caused the people through their euill example to sinne, verse. 24. Wherefore <hi>Elie</hi> his house was iudged of GOD for his remisnes in gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in not correcting his sonnes, chapter 3.13. And hee that cannot rule his owne house, how should hee care for the Church, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.5? It cannot now bee proued by the example of <hi>Elie,</hi> that the ciuill gouernement was annexed to the priesthoode by the Lordes appoyntment: but it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee ascribed to the corruption of those times: for hauing no King nor Captaine ouer them, they were driuen of necessitie to come to the high Priest, vnto whome the iudgement of many matters was committed by the lawe of God, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 13.2. But the priesthood, and the ciuill magistracie were two distinct things alwaies from the time of the lawe established.</p>
                        <p>It is then no good argument, which is drawne from the practise and example of those corrupt times: And yet wee say not, that these offices were so distinct, but that the Lorde might rayse vp some extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie prophet, as hee did <hi>Samuel,</hi> who to restore iustice and religion decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might for a time both iudge the people and offer sacrifice, as wee see hee did.</p>

But that any spirituall person may bee a temporall prince, and haue the chiefe gouernement of both states, and handle both swordes, we say it is contrarie to the word of God: for in these three poyntes standeth chiefly the office of the prince, in making and ordaining ciuill lawes, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power of life and death, in proclaiming of warre, and waging of battayle: with none of these ought Ecclesiasticall persons to deale, as we will now shew in order.</p>

If therefore spirituall persons suffice not to execute to the full, their spirituall charge, though they should bend all their studie and care that way, much more insufficient shall they be, if they be entangled in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affayres, for the well guiding and ordering whereof a whole man likewise is scarce sufficient.</p>

from the faith: for that an apostacie signifieth a relinquishing of the faith, not a departure from the Romane Empire. Now this generall falling away from the faith cannot be accomplished in one man, but it sheweth a whole bodie or companie, whereof Antichrist is the head, one man of sinne succeeding another by succession: and this apostacie cannot be wrought at one time, but it shall come to passe in seuerall ages: for how is it possible, that at once such a generall apostacie should be? <hi>Ergo,</hi> Antichrist shall not be one particular man, <hi>Argum.

                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:20636:88"/>Answere: It is true that the Romane Empire, while it retayned and kept the ancient dignitie, maiestie and power thereof, was an hinderance and let to the tyrannie of Antichrist, but when it began to decay, then Antichrist set in his foote. First, it was not necessarie therefore that the Empire should vtterly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, but so much onely taken away, namely the ancient honour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall maiestie therof, as hindered Antichrist, and so we finde, that the Romane Empire was more then halfe decayed, when Antichrist crept into Rome. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the imperiall power must in some sort be restored by Antichrist: for the Pope vsurped the same authoritie which the Emperours had, yea greater: for the whore is described sitting vpon the beast, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17. which is the Empire: and therefore it is sayd, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. The beast that was, and is not, and yet is: for the ancient Empire both is, and is not: It is, because the power thereof is translated to the Pope: it is not, that is, not in that kingly manner, as it was in times past. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13.12. The beast that rose out of the earth with two hornes like a lamb, did all that the first beast could doe before him: that is, the power of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was in the Pope. Thirdly, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13.15. It is sayd, that the image of the beast remayned, &amp; that the other beast gaue a spirit vnto the image of the beast: So is it at this day, the name and image of the Empire remayneth, but the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and power is gone: And who giueth life to the image but the Pope? he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth and ratifieth the election of the Emperour. Wherefore, this rather is an argument that Antichrist is alreadie come, because nothing but the image of the beast remayneth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Antichrist shall raigne three yeeres and an halfe: but if hee were alreadie come, he must needes haue raigned diuers hundred yeeres alreadie, <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>They proue this raigne of Antichrist for this short season, out of those places of <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.25. A time, times, and halfe a time: and <hi>Apocal.</hi> 12.14. Also it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by dayes 1260. dayes, and by moneths 11.2. two and fourtie moneths: which all come to one reckoning, and make three yeeres and an halfe.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, the time is also set downe by the name of three dayes and an halfe, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 11.11. How then is it likely, that 1260. dayes and three dayes and an halfe, should signifie the same time? Secondly, with much better sense are these times applied by our learned and painfull countreyman Master <hi>Fox,</hi> to the great persecution vnder the Emperours, which continued 294. yeeres, which time is mystically signified by 42. moneths, taking euery moneth for a sabboth of yeeres. And the rest of the numbers agree hereunto: for 1260. dayes make three yeeres and an halfe, that is, moneths 42: and three daies and an halfe make houres 42.<note place="margin">Fox. p. 101.</note> So taking euery houre in the dayes, and euery moneth in the yeeres for a sabboth of yeeres, there ariseth 294. yeeres, which was the iust time of the persecution from the death of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> vnto the end of <hi>Licinius</hi> the tyrant &amp; persecutor. This account, I say, better agreeth with the truth of historie, then their imagined computation. Thirdly, if it should be taken, as they expound it, for so short a time, then very little of the prophecie in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20636:88"/>
which we doubt not but is most accomplished, as it may appeare in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the visions reuealed in that booke together. And agayne, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie beside this of 42. moneths, which can bee applyed to the great persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Primitiue Church: wherefore it is not like that the Lord would leaue his Church, without some comfort, in forewarning them of those great troubles which immediatly ensued. But if these prophecies, which are wrested by the Papists, did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> foretell of those persecutions, then are they vtterly forgotten in that booke: which is not like, it being the greatest triall that euer the Church had.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 We say then, that wee are not curiouslie to search into times and seasons, which the Lord hath not reuealed: Onely this wee learne, that the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being set downe by dayes and monethes, the faithfull should hereby bee comforted, knowing that the time of their trouble is limitted of God, and is but short in respect of the kingdome of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Lord sayth, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. that those daies shall be shortned, lest no flesh should be saued. But how can the time bee short, if it should last some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, or a thousand of yeeres? <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Rhemist. annot. Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>sect.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, that place <hi>vers.</hi> 22. is properly vnderstood of the calamitie of the Iewes, which if it had continued any longer, the nation of the Iewes had bin vtterly destroyed. Secondly, yet notwithstanding the raigne of Antichrist is short in respect of the eternall kingdome of Christ: yea the whole time from his ascension vntill his comming agayne, is counted but short, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 22.20. I come quickly: and S. <hi>Peter</hi> sayth, That a thousand yeeres before God is as one day, and one day as a thousand yeeres, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Christ preached but three yeeres and an halfe, therefore Antichrist shalbe suffered to preach no longer.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, yet Christ was thirtie yeeres old when he began to preach, and shewed himselfe before, though not so openly, as when he was twelue yeere old he disputed with the Doctors in the temple: he was also acknowledged for the <hi>Messiah</hi> in his natiuitie. If Antichrist then must in this respect be correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Christ, he must also be knowne to be thirtie yeeres vpon earth, before he be fully manifested. Secondly, though Christ himselfe preached no longer, yet he sent his Apostles, who preached many yeeres after: we doe not therefore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the person of Antichrist, whom we denye to be a singular man, to Christ, but the kingdome of the one to the other. Now by their owne reason, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that because the kingdome of Christ endured many yeeres, and yet doth, that therefore Antichrists kingdome must likewise.</p>
                        <p>Other demonstrations the Iesuite hath to prooue that Antichrist is not yet come: as because the Gospell is not yet preached to all the world, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Bellar.

                        <p>THat Antichrist shall raigne but three yeeres and an halfe, we take it for a meere fable, and a very popish dreame: whereas on the contrarie side, wee are able to shewe, both that Antichrist is alreadie come, and hath tyrannized in the world these many yeeres.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 We will make it plaine by demonstration, that Antichrist hath been in the world many yeeres agoe, by the propheticall places of scripture. First, it is sayd, the number of Antichrist is 666. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13.18. So, <hi>anno.</hi> 606. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. obtayned of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour to be called vniuersall Bishop. Thus sayth <hi>Illyricus, Chytraeus.</hi> Also beginning at the yeere of the Lord 97. at which time <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and counting 666. yeeres, we shal come to the time of <hi>Pipinus,</hi> whom the Pope made King of <hi>France,</hi> and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne much enlarged the iurisdiction and authoritie of the Pope. And yet more euidently, about the yeere of the Lord 666. the Latine seruice was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be vsed in all countreys subiect to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Pope <hi>Vitalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> and about the same time, <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour remoued the ancient monuments of the Empire to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and left the citie to the Popes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>Fulk. annot. in</hi> 13. <hi>Reuel. sect.</hi> 10.</p>
                        <p>Another prophecie we haue, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20.3. that after one 1000. yeeres Sathan must be let loose. Euen so, a thousand yeeres after Christ, Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> a great coniurer, hauing made a compact with the Diuell, obtayned the Papacie, and not long after him came in <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. a great Sorcerer also and Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, <hi>sic Lutherus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But because it is not to be thought, that Sathan was bound during that great and long persecution vnder the Romane Emperours, wee must begin the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the 1000. yeeres, from the end of the persecution, which continued 294. yeeres: vnto that adde a thousand, so haue we the yeere of our Lord 1294. About which yeere <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. made the sixt booke of the Decretals, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the orders of Friers, and gaue them great freedomes: with this number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth <hi>Daniel</hi> his 1290. dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. Also somewhat before this time, <hi>anno</hi> 1260. the orders of <hi>Dominicke</hi> and <hi>Franciscane</hi> Friers began first to be set vp by <hi>Honorius</hi> the 3. and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 9. and so haue we the 1260. daies, which are set downe, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 12. <hi>plura apud Fox. pag.</hi> 398.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 If Antichrist should raigne but three yeeres and an halfe, as our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries teach, and then immediatly that time being expired, the world should end: then it is possible to assigne the time of our Lord Christ his comming to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so soone as Antichrist is reuealed. But the Gospell sayth, that of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels in heauen, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.36. yet these good fellowes take vpon them to be wiser then the Angels: for they dare
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20636:89"/>
set downe the very day of Christs comming: which shall be, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously imagineth, iust 45. dayes after the destruction of Antichrist. And to this purpose he abuseth that place of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. where mention is made of 1290. dayes, that is, as he fondly interpreteth, three yeeres and an halfe, the iust time of Antichrists raigne: But blessed is he that commeth (sayth the Prophet) to 1335. dayes: that is, sayth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to 45. dayes after the destruction of Antichrist, and then Christ commeth, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. What intolerable boldnes and presumption is this, contrarie to the saying of Christ, to attempt to declare the very houre of his comming?</p>
                        <p>Agayne: the prophecie of <hi>Daniel</hi> had no such meaning: for he onely spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the afflictions of the Church, before the comming of Christ, as <hi>Iohn</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth of the troubles that came after. <hi>Daniel</hi> therfore in that place receiueth instructions concerning the cruell persecution of the Iewes vnder <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,</hi> the beginning, and the end thereof: There are three times reuealed vnto him.</p>
                        <p>The first is of a time, two times, and halfe a time, or rather the deuiding of time, or as <hi>Tremellius</hi> more agreeable to the Hebrew, a part or parcel of times:<note place="margin">Dan. 7.25.</note> so long should the temple be defiled, and the abomination set vp in the temple, that is, three yeeres and certayne dayes: And so it came to passe, for this deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation began in the temple the 145. yeere of the raigne of the Greekes, the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene day of the moneth <hi>Casleu.</hi> 1. <hi>Macchab.</hi> 1.57. when <hi>Antiochus</hi> caused the daylie sacrifice to cease, and incense to bee burnt to Idols: And iust three yeeres and ten dayes after, which is to bee reckoned for the odde parcell of times, <hi>Ann.</hi> 148. the 25. day of <hi>Casleu,</hi> they began to offer sacrifice in the temple according to the lawe, 1. <hi>Macchab.</hi> 4.52.</p>
                        <p>The second time reuealed, is of a 1290. dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. which maketh three yeeres, seuen moneths and odde dayes: which is the time, counting from the desolation, when as the sacrifices should be restored, and confirmed by the Kings graunt, and Letters Patents: which accordingly came to passe, <hi>ann.</hi> 148. the fifteenth of the moneth <hi>Xanthicus,</hi> which was the last moneth but one, as it is recorded, 2. <hi>Macchab.</hi> 11.33.</p>
                        <p>The third time is described by dayes, 1335. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12. Blessed is hee that should liue to see that time: namely, when the Church of the Iewes should ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bee deliuered by the death of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> which was in the beginning of the next yeere, which was 149. 1. <hi>Macchab.</hi> 6.16. Thus wee see these times were fully accomplished vnder the tyrannie of <hi>Antiochus:</hi> wherefore these prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being once fulfilled, they cannot bee drawne to signifie any other time, but by way of similitude and comparison.</p>
                        <p>Neither is that any thing worth, which the Iesuite obiecteth out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.8. Then shall the wicked man bee reuealed, whom Christ shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume with the spirit of his mouth: As though presently after the reuelation of Antichrist Christ should come. And therefore Antichrist must not be expected

And therefore Antichrist, at what time soeuer he is reuealed after the ascension of Christ, he commeth in the last times: whose vtter ruine and destruction shall be reserued for the glorious appearing of Christ, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle there speaketh.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Whereas the scripture sayth, that Sathan must bee bound for a thousand yeeres, and after let loose agayne, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 20.2: And it is playne that the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres since Christ are expired more then fiue hundred yeeres agoe: It followeth hereupon that Antichrist is alreadie come: for he must bee reuealed with the loosing of Sathan.

you that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he sayth, that all thinges doe bowe the knee to the name of Iesus, yea of things in heauen, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. that he meant, that euen the Angels doe stoup and make obeysance, when they see the name of Iesus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a glasse window?

                        <p>Answere: First the <hi>Rhemists</hi> say that this is not a marke for all times, to know an heretike by, but it was onely for those times, to confesse Christ to bee come in the flesh: this is a surer note now, say they, that whoso confesseth not Christ to be really present, and to be sacrificed in the masse, is not of God. <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Serm. de verbis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoli. 33.</note> Where I will not stand to note the presumption of these papists, that will correct and amend the Apostles rule, to know here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes by, which serueth for all times, and so <hi>Augustine</hi> taketh it. But here first I oppose our <hi>Rhemists</hi> iudgement against <hi>Bellarmine</hi>: for they denie that this place serueth to describe Antichrist, belonging onely to the Apostles times: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, it doth most properly decipher Antichrist.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="173" facs="tcp:20636:95"/>2. The great Antichrist shall denie Christ no otherwise then other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists and heretikes did in the Apostles time: for they are all Antichrists 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.18. and he giueth one rule to know them all by, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists then denyed not Christ apertly, but couertly, <hi>Ergo,</hi> so shall the great Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>The first is true, that the olde heretikes did not plainly denie Christ to bee come in the flesh: but some denied his humanitie, some his diuinitie, some his person. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Arriani hoc negant, licet verbis fatea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur,</hi> the <hi>Arrians</hi> deny that Christ is come in the flesh, though they confesse it in word: for he that doth not confesse that Christ is equall vnto God, denieth Christ in the flesh: and so of other heretikes. The second also is as true: that Antichrist, who is no other but the Pope, shall also cunningly and couertly denie Christ, for he that denieth the offices of Christ, denieth Christ: As <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth of <hi>Peters</hi> deniall, <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid eius negauit, ipsum negauit. Tract. in Iohann.</hi> 66. whatsoeuer hee denyed of or belonging to Christ, he denied Christ. So the Pope denieth Christ to bee our Prophet, King, and Priest: His propheticall office he defaceth, and in effect denieth, in disgracing the scriptures, saying, they are imperfect, and conteine not all matters necessary to saluation, that their authoritie bindeth vs not without his allowance: His Kingly office, in making himselfe Christs Vicar and Vicegerent vpon earth, in making new lawes, sacraments, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances beside Christs, as necessarie to saluation as the rules of the Gospell: His priesthoode, in setting vp a new propitiatorie sacrifice in the abominable Masse, beside the onely sacrifice of attonement vpon the Crosse, in making other mediators and intercessors beside Christ: and such like, whereof wee shall haue occasion to entreat afterward more at large. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope in denying the offices of Christ, denieth Christ, and so is Antichrist.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Hee shall make himselfe Christ and Messiah,<note place="margin">Argum.</note> which the Iesuite would prooue out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 43.

                        </p>
                        <p>Answere: First, It is not necessarie that Antichrist should openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse himselfe to be Christ, in name, but he shall doe it, <hi>opere,</hi> indeede, and that closely and couertly: for those whom Christ calleth, <hi>pseudochristos,</hi> false Christs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.23. <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth <hi>Antichristos,</hi> Antichrists, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.18. False prophets therefore are false Christs, &amp; Antichrists: yet all those false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and heretikes did not in name and outward profession make themselues Christs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Pope of Rome in effect maketh himselfe Christ: for who but Christ is the head of the Church? who but Christ is superiour to the Angels, and to commaund them? who but Christ can make sacraments and articles of fayth? But all this the Pope taketh vpon himselfe to doe: yea the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite is not ashamed to say, that he hath the same office which Christ had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

vpon earth, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de pontif. cap.</hi> 4. And whereas they say, the Pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the name of Christ: it shall as much profite him (it being not in trueth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in colour onely and shew) as it shall profite the false prophets to say in the day of the Lorde, Haue not wee in thy name prophecied, and cast out diuels? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22.23. to whome Christ shall make answere, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I know you not.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Antichrist shall openly name himselfe God, and commaund men to worship him as God,<note place="margin">Argum.</note> 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.4. But this doth not the Pope: <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee is not Antichrist, <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Answere: First, If Antichrist should be such an one, you might haue found amongst the Emperors of Rome diuers Antichrists: for such an one <hi>Caligula</hi> was, that commaunded temples to be erected in his name, and his images to be set vp to be worshipped, yea in the temple at Ierusalem.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> wordes will not beare any such sence: he shall sitte, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, as God: and your vulgar Latine hath <hi>ostendens se, tanquam sit Deus,</hi> shewing himselfe as though he were God, that is, in deede and effect, not in open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: for hee should sit and be worshipped in the temple as God: howe then can it bee called the temple of God, being thus a temple of most grosse Idolatrie?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Pope in effect maketh himselfe a god vpon earth: for he can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence against the law of nature, the law of GOD, agaynst both new and olde testament: as we haue shewed before, <hi>quest.</hi> 9. of this Controuersie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayth, he may by his Apostolike authoritie dispence with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Apostles <hi>cap.</hi> 14. He is able to change the nature of things, and of nothing to make thinges to bee, of wrong to make iustice, &amp;c. <hi>Pope Nicholaus distinct.</hi> 96. yea it is sayd of the Pope, that hee is neither GOD nor man,<note place="margin">Extrauag.</note> but a middle thing betweene both: Pope <hi>Boniface.</hi> I pray you then what is he? he is no Angel, for he is aboue them, and commaundeth them: <hi>Papa Angelis praecipit,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Agrippa.</note> the Pope commaundeth Angels. He must then either be a God or a diuell, by your owne confession, choose which you will: Nay they doe make him a playne God: <hi>Es alter Deus in terris,</hi> an other God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth: and they salute him by these names, <hi>Dominus deus noster Papa,</hi> our Lord god the Pope. Thus it is proued, that the Pope, both by his deedes as also by his titles, doth make himselfe god vpon earth.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Antichrist say they, shall take away all worship yea of Idols, and shall commaund nothing to be worshipped but himselfe,<note place="margin">Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.4. the worde is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>numina,</hi> all things that are worshipped. But so doth not the Pope, for he prayeth to Saints, adoreth the bodie of Christ on the altar. <hi>Ergo. Bellarm. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Rhemist.</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 10.</p>
                        <p>Answere:
First, the text prooueth not, that hee shall take away, all Idols, or thinges worshipped, but shall exalt himselfe agaynst them, and make smal account of them. The place also of <hi>Daniel</hi> is playne, <q>
                              <bibl>11.37.</bibl> Hee shall not regarde the God of his fathers, nor care for any God, but shall magnifie
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20636:96"/>
himselfe aboue all: And in his place shall he honour the God <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> and the God which his fathers knew not, shall hee honour, with golde and siluer.</q>
Out of this place we gather two thinges: first, that Antichrist shall bring in a strange God, which his fathers neuer knew: so hath the Pope inuented a breaden God, which he honoureth with golde and precious stones, making more account of it, then of any image or relique whatsoeuer.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, yet he shal magnifie himself aboue all such Gods, Images, Roodes, shrines and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea aboue his owne breaden God: so doth the Pope: for he rideth vpon mens shoulders, when his breaden God is caried vpon an hackney: he exalteth his throne aboue the altar, the Crosse is caried on the right hand of Emperours swordes and scepters, but is layd vnder his feete: In the yeare of <hi>Iubile,</hi> he beateth vpon the gates of Paradise with a golden ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: <hi>Fulk. annot.</hi> 2. <hi>Thesse.</hi> 2.10. so then howsoeuer like an hypocrite he seeme to adore his breaden God, yet indeede dooth hee magnifie himselfe aboue it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath no other shiftes to foyst off our arguments, but these: hee sayth, this <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> is like enough to be the diuell himselfe, whom Antichrist shall worship: but he careth neither for siluer or golde: or else it is himselfe. And how I pray you can a man worship himselfe? or else, saith hee, it is some strong castle where he shall lay his siluer and golde: or else you know not what, <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That Antichrist shall not abolish Idoles of siluer and golde, but rather commaund the people to worship them, as the Pope now doth, it is playne, <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> 9.20.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Rhemists</hi> obiect, that hee speaketh here agaynst the heathen Idols, which is here called the worship of diuels. Answere: First, in this place <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of the ende of the worlde, in the opening of the seuenth seale: and the Idols of the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were abolished long agoe: Neither is there any knowen nation in the worlde that hath worshipped Idols of golde, siluer, brasse, stone, or wood, but the papists, for these many yeares. Secondly, all worshippers of Images, doe worship diuels: for Idolatrie is a seruice inuented by the diuell, <hi>Fulk. annot. Apoc.</hi> 9. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</p>

                        <p>THat Antichrist shall not in outward shew be an open enemie to Christ, but secretly and closely, and vnder pretence of religion take away all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: thus we make it playne.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 These places alleadged before doe prooue it: <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.2.18. the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and the Antichristes, shall bee enimies all alike, but the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrstes in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time, were couert enemies. <hi>Ergo,</hi> so shall the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="176" facs="tcp:20636:97"/>2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the mystery of iniquitie, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.7. and he shal come in all deceiueablenesse of vnrighteousnesse, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. and God shall send them strong delusion, to beleeue lies, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. All this prooueth that Antichrist shal worke closely, cunningly, mystically, by deceiuing, by delusion, not by open enimitie, and prophanenes, or by violence and tyrannie onely, as the papists imagine.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Antichrist shall be the greatest enemie to Christ, and his kingdome, that euer was in the worlde. But hee is a greater enemie that pretendeth friendship, and yet is a foe, that vnder the name of Christ persecuteth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian fayth, then he that openly destroyeth it, making no shewe of Religion: as <hi>Dauid</hi> complayneth, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 41.9.

Euen so they now a dayes, are the greatest enemies that Christ and the Church hath, that betray Christ with a kisse, which name themselues the Church of God, and yet make hauock of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Lastly, <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth as much, that Antichrist shall come with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable doctrine, and shew of righteousnes. <hi>Quid expa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Marke nowe I pray you, if all this bee not true of the Pope of Rome: for hee taketh vpon him to iustifie, to sanctifie, to dispense with mens sins for an hundred, yea a thousand yeeres: to ridde soules out of Purgatorie: nay to commaund Angels to carrie their soules to heauen, that die in their Pilgrimage to Rome, as Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the sixt did: what is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> else but to saie,<note place="margin">Iuel. p. 595.</note>

shall bee wrought by him: Hee shall cause fire to come from heauen, and make the Image of the beast to speake; and thirdly, hee shall faine himselfe dead and rise agayne, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 15.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He shall by the helpe of the diuell cause fire to come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as it is <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13.13.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, it is a great question whether the diuell haue any such power to bring downe fire from heauen: for the Iesuite himselfe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the storie 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18. How <hi>Baal</hi> his priests would haue fetched down fire from heauen, but they could not: onely <hi>Elias</hi> did it: and he that will doe the like, must haue <hi>Elias</hi> his spirite, as Christ sayth, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is very grosse to vnderstand this literally: for the whole chapter is mysticall, of the Beast with seuen heads, of another beast with two hornes, and all the rest. But three waies Antichrist may fitly bee sayde to bring fire from heauen: First, by fire the holy Ghost may be vnderstoode, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and <hi>Act.</hi> 2. The spirite appeared in fierie tongues: so Antichrist and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters make men beleeue, that they doe conferre the holy Ghost, as in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, in absolution of sinners, and such like. Secondly, the Popes thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of excommunication, are resembled to fier, whereby he hath made the whole world afrayde in times past, as though he could cause the heauens to fall vpon men: yea, to make the matter more likely, the Pope vseth burning Tapers in excommunicating men, which with violence are throwen downe as though GOD himselfe did rayne fire from heauen vpon them. And this is the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner of their excommunication: there are three candles burning set vp:<note place="margin">Fox. p. 1038</note> and then they begin to accurse them, whom they excommunicate, bodie and soule to the diuell: and let vs, say they, quench their soules in hell fire, if they be dead, as this candle is put out (and with that they put out one of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles) If they be aliue, let vs pray, that their eyes may be put out, as this candle is, and so the second candle goeth out, and that all their sences may fayle them, as this candle looseth his light, and so the third candle goeth out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, here is the fire which the Pope and his popelings doe bring from heauen. <hi>Sic Bullinger. serm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> 60. <hi>in Apocalips.</hi> Thirdly, the Dragon is sayd, <hi>Apocalips.</hi> 12.4. with his tayle to drawe many starres from heauen: that is, many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men, as starres in giftes and knowledge, shall bee deceiued by the Pope, and be wonne vnto him: yea the Pope himselfe is a Starre fallen from heauen to the earth, from heauenly doctrine to earthly tradition, <hi>Apocalips.</hi> 9.1. thus Antichrist also may be sayd to fetch fire from heauen.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The second miracle, hee shall cause the Image of the beast to speake, which the Iesuite vnderstandeth literally, that is, grossely.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and our Iesuites doe not here agree: for <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> sayth, that these two miracles shall be wrought by Antichrist himselfe, to fetch fire from heauen: and to cause the Image to speake: But the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> saye, this other beast, is another false Prophet, inferiour to Antichrist, which shall also worke wonders, such an one as <hi>Caluine,</hi> say they: where
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20636:98"/>
they shew their malice, more then learning, for <hi>Caluine,</hi> they know, tooke not vpon him to worke myracles, <hi>annot. Apocal.</hi> 13. <hi>sect.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 This causing the image to speake hath a better meaning: The image of the beast is the shadow of the olde stately Empire of Rome, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Pope: for the west partes wanted an Emperour the space of three hundred yeeres from <hi>Augustulus</hi> time till Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third, who made <hi>Charles</hi> the great king of France,<note place="margin">Auentin. lib. 4.</note> Emperour: And at this day is there nothing in the Empire, but onely a name, title and image: for neither hath the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour the Imperiall authoritie, which is in the Pope, nor the Imperiall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, vnlesse he haue them of his owne. And the Pope onely maketh this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to speake, for vnlesse he doe confirme the election of the king of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, he is not thought worthy the name of Emperour. <hi>Bullinger. ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 And yet we denie not, but that they both haue and may make images speake either by the helpe of the diuell, as <hi>Dunstane</hi> caused a roode to speake, or by iugling, as the Roode of grace by gimmals was made to roule the eyes, mooue the lippes and such like, in king <hi>Henries</hi> dayes.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 That he shall craftily aspire to the kingdome, he proueth it out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> 11.21. where it is prophecied of one that he shall obtayne the kingdome by flatteries.</p>
                        <p>Ans. This prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as likewise the whole chapter, was historically accomplished in <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who defrauded <hi>Seleucus</hi> his brothers sonne of the kingdome, and circumuented his elder brother <hi>Demetrius:</hi> so that it being once fulfilled, it cannot be wrested to any other sense: of Antichrist it cannot be ment; for here is a succession of Kings described, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. One is sayd to be ouerthrowne, that is, <hi>Seleucus,</hi> but not in battaile, for he was poysoned, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. There another is sayd to bee ouerthrowne and to be no more found, that is, <hi>Antiochus magnus.</hi> But Antichrist cannot succeede any in the kingdome of the Iewes: for he shall be their first King, as the Papists imagine.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 He shall (sayth <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) ouercome three kings, of <hi>Lybia, Aegypt, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, Dan.</hi> 11.43. and this horne shall remoue three other hornes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8.</p>
                        <p>Ans. This also must needes be vnderstood of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes:</hi> and they are two prophecies. First, he is called a little horne, because he was not heire to the kingdome: he remoueth three other hornes: for by his meanes <hi>Ptolemaeus Philopater</hi> was cast out of the kingdome in his fathers time <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great: his brother <hi>Seleucus</hi> poysoned, his sonne <hi>Demetrius</hi> disinherited, <hi>Tremell. Dan.</hi> 7.20. The second prophecie was also accomplished by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the countreys adioyning.</p>
                        <p>Of Antichrist it cannot bee vnderstood: for the first prophecie speaketh of a beast with ten hornes, which must be vnderstood of one kingdome &amp; monarch, and by the ten hornes ten Kings are signified: for so was <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> the tenth from <hi>Seleucus:</hi> here then is a succession of Kings: but Antichrist shall not succeede any.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The Iesuite saith, that Antichrist with a great armie shall vexe the whole world, and that shalbe the battaile of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> prophecied of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 38.39. <hi>&amp; Apocal.</hi> 20.</p>
                        <p>Ans. The prophecie of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> was fulfilled in the time of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> when as <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that is <hi>Antiochus,</hi> with the helpe of the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Scythians</hi> and other countreys, molested the people of God: for vers. 23. chap. 39. the Prophet speaketh of the captiuitie of Israel, from the which they should at that time bee deliuered. And agayne, the Lord would not leaue his Church, which at that time endured great afflictions at the hands of the heathen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortlesse: but if these prophecies of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> concerne them not, then small had been their comfort. Lastly, the Iewes may with as good reason vnderstand the prophecies concerning Christ, of their <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom they yet looke for, as you may these prophecies concerning the enemies of the Church, of your Antichrist.</p>

                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:20636:99"/>The other prophecie also is fulfilled, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 20.8. how <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> from the foure corners of the earth, shall compasse the tents of the Saints: for by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> is vnderstood the whole multitude of the enemies of the Church both within and without, as Turkes, Papists, Infidels, which all haue agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at times and in their turnes, though enemies amongst themselues, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the people of God, <hi>Fulk. annot. in hunc locum.</hi>

                        <p>And seeing Antichrist shall begin at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> make his habitation there, and haue an end there: (for (say they) he shall be slayne in Mount <hi>Oliuet, Gloss. sup.

                        <p n="2">2 Antichrist is not described in scripture as a warriour, or warlike man sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting harnessed in his tent, but like an hypocrite adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing himself in the temple; not comming with engins of warre, but deluding and deceiuing with false mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and lying signes, 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.

                        <p>They therefore, craftily foreseeing this, doe take great paynes to deliuer the Pope out of this danger, and haue found out many starting holes, but all to smal purpose: yea their forefathers seeing the matter so playne, and almost put out of doubt,<note place="margin">Concil.

This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a guiltie conscience. But yet they face out the matter, and say, the Pope cannot be Antichrist: their arguments are none other then those we haue heard, being eight in number.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 vers. 36. It is sayd, He shall doe what him listeth.

But wee doe hope that his date is out, and that hee shall prosper no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 vers. 37.

Secondly, he sayth, the place is meant literally and properly of <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who was giuen to the pleasures of women.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, if it be meant literallie of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then can it not be meant literallie of your Antichrist: If <hi>Antiochus</hi> be but a type of Antichrist, then can you not necessarilie conclude out of this place: for types prooue

not, vnlesse they be diuine, that is, appoynted of God to be types, which you can not shewe for this place: see then, the best arguments that you haue for your Antichrist, out of the prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> are proued nothing worth. Secondly, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> was giuen to vnlawfull desires of women, so is the Pope: yet might he be an enemie to chast and holy marriage, and so is the Pope. And by the way let it bee noted, that the Iesuite picketh quarrels with scripture, and maketh it false: for the text sayth, He, that is, <hi>Antiochus,</hi> shall not care for the desires of women. Yes (sayth the Iesuite) he shall be giuen to the pleasures of women, cleane contrarie to the text, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 21.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 vers. 38. He shall honor his god <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> that is, a god of power and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with gold, siluer, precious stones: Both of these are most true of the popish religion: for their god hath brought them great riches, lands, treasure, posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: by their idolatrous Masses, they haue greatly enriched themselues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their <hi>breaden god</hi> playeth the chiefe part: and therefore they doe worship him agayne with gold, siluer, precious stones: what rich Corporals, and Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes, Copes, Vestiments of veluet, silke, wrought with gold, are seene in their Churches? what gilding of Roodes, and Roodlofts, garnishing of Idols, what rich Crucifixes of siluer, of gold, beset with pearle and precious stones?</p>

So the Pope challengeth the full authoritie of Christ, as wee haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and exalteth himselfe aboue Emperours, which are called gods vpon earth: yea they haue taken the iust proportion of inequalitie betweene the Pope and Emperour: for the Pope is 47. degrees aboue the Emperour: as the Sunne is 47. degrees bigger then the Moone, <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. <hi>in decretalib.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 He shall sit in the temple, that is, in the Church: so the Pope nameth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe head of the Church, and hath the keyes, as he braggeth, both of heauen and hell. Therefore the Turke cannot bee that Antichrist, because he is out of the Church: and so in truth is the Pope, but yet he challengeth to him and his the name of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The mysterie wrought in <hi>Paules</hi> time, and afterward encreased: so not long after the Apostles time, the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> began to lift vp their heads aboue other Churches, as <hi>Zozimus</hi> falsified the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> and sent to the 6. Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to haue it there confirmed, that it might be lawfull to send vp appeales to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 Antichrist shall come with lying signes: So hath the Pope done, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience proueth, and we haue shewed before.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 vers. 11. God shall send strong delusions, that they shall beleeue lyes. And in time of Poperie, men indeede were so strongly deluded, that the father perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the sonne, the sonnes set fire to their father, yea the husband was made a witnesse agaynst the wife, the wife agaynst her husband, and seruants accused
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20636:101"/>
their masters. These things are so well knowne in stories, that I neede not come to particulars.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 Antichrist is called a wicked man, and a man of sinne, vers. 3.8. And where shall you finde more wicked men, then among the Popes? <hi>Siluester</hi> the 2. gaue his soule to the diuell to obtayne the Papacie, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 167. <hi>Benno</hi> reporteth of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> that he poysoned sixe Popes to come to the Popedome. Pope <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> and <hi>Sergius,</hi> tooke vp the bodie of <hi>Formosus,</hi> and mangled it, cutting off his head and fingers, and so cast it into <hi>Tibris, Fox. pag.</hi> 120. We haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what a holy Father Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 13. was, he lay with his owne sister, and with his fathers Concubines, playing at dice, called for the diuell, was slayne in adulterie. And was it not, I pray you, a common prouerbe in England? He that goeth to <hi>Rome</hi> once, seeth a wicked man; he that goeth twise, learneth to know him; he that goeth the third time, bringeth him home with him, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 841. <hi>argument.

                        </p>
                        <p>The third place we doe take out of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> chap. 9. where is a playne storie set downe of the Pope.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 vers. 1. He is a starre fallen from heauen: he is departed from the ancient faith of <hi>Rome</hi> to superstition and idolatrie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 He hath the key of the bottomlesse pit: who giueth the crosse keyes in his armes but the Pope? who sayth hee may euacuate all Purgatorie at once, if hee will, but he? Who sayth, he may, <hi>Pleno iure currus animarum plenos secum ad tartara detrudere,</hi> by full right, carrie downe to hell with him charriots Ioden with soules? <hi>cap. si Papa. distinct.</hi> 42. Is not this the Pope? who then more fitly may be sayd to haue the key of the bottomlesse pit.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 There arise out of the bottomlesse pit a great flocke of Locusts, that is, the innumerable sort of begging Friers: for they are in euery respect described: First, compared to Locusts for their number, vers. 3. There were an 100. diuers sorts of Friers, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 260. Secondly, they had power giuen them for fiue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths: that is, as <hi>Walter Brute</hi> expoundeth it, taking a moneth for thirtie dayes, &amp; a day for a yeere, as it is prophetically taken: an 150. yeeres, for so long it was from the beginning of the Friers vnder <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. <hi>anno</hi> 1212. to the time of <hi>Armachanus,</hi> who preached, disputed, and wrote agaynst the Friers, about <hi>anno</hi> 1360. <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 414. Thirdly, they shall sting like Scorpions, not slay all at once, but venome and poyson the conscience with the sting of their pestilent doctrine. Fourthly, other parts also of the description agree, as vers. 7. They are as horses prepared to battaile, that is, stoute &amp; ambitious, their haire as the haire of women, that is, they shall be effeminate, and giuen to the lusts of the flesh: their teeth as the teeth of Lions: they by valiant begging shall deuoure the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the poore: as it was well proued in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. dayes, in the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of beggars,</hi> that the summe of the Friers almes came to a great summe in the yeere: for the fiue orders of Friers had a penie a quarter for euery one of euery housholder throughout England, that is, for them all twentie pence by the yeere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suppose, that there be but ten housholds in euery towne, and let there

be twentie thousand parishes and townes in England; it will not want much of twentie thousand pound. Thus had they Lions teeth, that is, consuming and deuouring. Lastly, they haue a King, vers. 11. whose name is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer: for the Pope their chiefe prince and patron, hath by his Antichristian doctrine layd wast the Church of God, <hi>Argument. Chytraei.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth place of scripture wee will take out of the 17. of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there the seate of Antichrist is described. First, vers. 5. It is called <hi>Babylon,</hi> the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which raigneth ouer the Kings of the earth, vers. 18. This can be no other but <hi>Rome,</hi> which then had the Empire of the whole world. Secondly, It is the citie built vpon seuen hils or mountaynes, vers. 9. that is no other but <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, the whore, which is Antichrist, shall sit vpon the beast with seuen heads and ten hornes, that is, shall succeede in the Empire, and haue the authoritie thereof: so hath the Pope. Fourthly, the ten hornes, that is, the Kings of the earth, shal giue their authoritie to the beast: but afterward shall deuoure her flesh: Euen so the Kings of the earth by their sword maintayned the authoritie of the Pope. But now being taught by the Gospell, they are made the Lords free men, and begin to subdue their neckes from his yoke.</p>
                        <p>The fift place is 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.22. Who is a lyar, but he that denyeth that Iesus is Christ? the same is Antichrist that denyeth the father and the sonne.</p>
                        <p>Euen so the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> though not openly and apertly, yet closely and subtilly is an enemie vnto the whole trinitie: He exalteth himselfe aboue God the father; because he taketh vpon him to dispense not onely agaynst the lawe of nature, but agaynst the lawe of God, the morall law, and agaynst the precepts both of the old and new testament: but a lawe cannot be dispensed withall, but by the same authoritie or greater.</p>
                        <p>Agaynst Iesus Christ he exalteth himselfe, and all his offices, he denyeth him to be the onely Prophet, saying, the scriptures are vnperfect, and that their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are also necessarie to saluation. Agayne, he maketh other bookes scripture, then those which are Canonicall. His kingly office he doth arrogate to himselfe, in making lawes to binde the conscience, in ordayning other Sacraments, in granting Indulgences and Pardons, &amp; saying that he is the head of the Church. His Priesthood he is an enemie vnto, constituting another priesthood after the order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> then that of our Sauiour Christ which begun vpon the Crosse, and remayneth still in his person, being incommunicable to any other creature: yet they make euery sacrificing Priest to bee of the order of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He impugneth the office of the holy spirit, counting that prophane which the holy Ghost hath sanctified, as marriage and meates: arrogateth in all things the spirit of truth not to erre: applieth the merites of Christs passion after his owne pleasure, by Pardons, Indulgences, by ceremonies and Sacraments of his owne inuention, <hi>Fulk.</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 10. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we conclude out of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that seeing he denieth Iesus to be Christ, he is Antichrist.</p>

An aduersarie in doctrine, teaching cleane contrarie to the Gospell of Christ: so doth the Pope.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The scripture sayth, wee ought to put our trust onely in God, and not in man, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.7. and to call vpon God onely in the day of trouble, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.15. and to worship him in spirit and truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.24. The Papists say cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that we must call vpon Saints, and beleeue they can helpe vs, and they teach vs to fall downe before Images, which are stockes and stones.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Gospell teacheth, that wee are freely saued by Iesus Christ, without workes, which neither merite remission of sinnes, nor eternall life, for eternall life is the free gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. And our sinnes are forgiuen vs freely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not imputed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. They affirme cleane contrarie, that by our merites we may deserue heauen: and that <hi>vita aeterna,</hi> is <hi>merces bonorum operum,</hi> that eternall life is the reward of good workes. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, it is a free gift, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 23.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The Gospell teacheth vs, that we should growe vp to an assurance of our election, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:10. and with boldnes to call vpon the name of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.10. The Papists say, we should be kept alwaies in doubt, and it is presumption to be assured of the fauour of God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The Gospell saith, that not onely externall acts, but euen secret thoughts are sinne, yea the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence of the flesh to be sinne, <hi>Genes.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. They denie that concupiscence and euill thoughts are sinne, vnlesse the be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, and haue the consent of the will, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 The Gospell teacheth, that it is impossible for any man to keepe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the lawe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. They doubt not to say, that a man by grace may fulfill the lawe, and by fulfilling of it deserue heauen.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 Christ instituted the Sacrament in both kinds, and <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. giuing a direction concerning the Sacrament, not onely to the Pastors and Ministers, but to the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> doth rehearse the institution in both kinds. But the Papists doe minister but in one kind to the people.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 The Gospell saith, that the Church is builded vpon Christ, and he is the onely foundation thereof, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. The Papists hold that <hi>Peter</hi> first, and now the Pope, whom they make his successor, is the foundation of the Church, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Chytraei.</hi> And thus we see, the Pope in his doctrine is a plaine aduersarie to Christ, and therefore Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>The seuenth argument, <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 17.1. Antichrist is called the great whore: And here we are to note the singular prouidence of God, who suffereth not one iot of his word to fall to the ground: for euen soverily, <hi>Anno</hi> 853. next after <hi>Leo</hi> the 4. there was a right whore elected Pope called <hi>Iohn,</hi> or if you will, <hi>Ioane</hi> the 8. who fate in the Papacie two yeeres, sixe moneths; and on a time being with child, fell in labour in the midst of a solemne procession. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was a certayn Image of a woman with a child set vp in the same place where the Pope was deliuered: And euer since the Popes, when they goe to <hi>Laterane,</hi> doe shun that streete, being yet the neerer way, abhorring that fact and the memorie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20636:103"/>
There was also long after a chayre of Porphyrie stone kept in <hi>Laterane,</hi> with an hole in the midst, wherein the newe elected Pope was wont to sit to haue his humanitie tried, <hi>Iuell. pag.</hi> 428. <hi>Defens. Apol.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Obiect. 1. <hi>Harding,</hi> and since him <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiect, that there was neuer any such Pope, because she is not registred in the Popes Calendar. Ans. No, they left her out for shame, as <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> writeth. Agayne, Bishops names haue vpon sundrie occasions been left out: as <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> name was striken out vpon displeasure out of the table of the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> So Pope <hi>Cyriacus</hi> is not reckoned in the Calendar of the Popes, and yet he was one of them.</p>
                        <p>Obiect. 2. Whereas it is said, that this Pope <hi>Ioane</hi> was first student at <hi>Athens,</hi> and afterward professed at <hi>Rome, Harding</hi> denieth, that at <hi>Athens</hi> then there was any place for students, but all was barbarous, and so sayth <hi>Bellarm.</hi> neither that at <hi>Rome</hi> there was any open profession of letters at that time. Ans. First, <hi>anno</hi> 680. the Bishop of <hi>Athens</hi> was at a Councel at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> called <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus sexta, anno</hi> 742. at the second Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> there were many Bishops of <hi>Greece</hi> present: and Pope <hi>Ioane</hi> followed, <hi>anno</hi> 853. and how should <hi>Athens</hi> afterward become barbarous, being inhabited all this while by Christians? for it was not taken of the Turkes before <hi>anno</hi> 1440. Secondly, and me thinkes it is a discredite for <hi>Rome,</hi> that there should be there vnder the Popes nose no profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of learning, and that there should be there no Vniuersitie of Students, where the vniuersall Bishop sate. But <hi>Theodoricus Niemus,</hi> sometime the Popes Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, sayth, she read a Lecture two yeeres at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Obiect. 3. It is not like that God would suffer S. <hi>Peters</hi> chayre to be polluted by a woman, <hi>Harding.</hi> Ans. You presume to much of Gods prouidence, hauing no such promise. Why might not a woman as well creepe into S. <hi>Peters</hi> chayre at <hi>Rome,</hi> as one did into S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> of <hi>Constantinople?</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, what priuiledge hath one more then the other.</p>
                        <p>Obiect. 4. As for the chayre (saith <hi>Harding</hi>) it is a fable: but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> more modestly graunteth there is a chayre of Porphyrie, but to another purpose, to shewe the Popes humilitie, not to trie his humanitie. Agayne, <hi>Harding</hi> sayth it is a lye, that the Popes refrayne to goe that way. But <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that knoweth <hi>Rome</hi> better then he, denieth not that the Pope so doth, but not for any such hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fact there committed, but because it is a strait way, and is not fit for his trayne. And as for the Image, <hi>Harding</hi> saith, it representeth no such thing, but is rather like one of the great ragged stones at <hi>Stonage. Bellarmine</hi> denieth not, but there is such an Image, but it seemeth not to bee a picture of a woman, but rather of some heathen priest going to sacrifice. We see how handsomely they agree in their answers: And no maruaile, for if one lyer is many times contrary to himselfe, how should two lyars agree? But these men go only by coniectures: we haue their owne writers against them: for <hi>Theodoricus Niemus</hi> saith there is such an Image that resembleth such a thing, and that the Popes will not goe that way in procession to this day vpon that occasion. And as for the chayre of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20636:103"/>
marble to that vse, to search the Pope, <hi>Sabellicus</hi> reporteth it, <hi>Aenead.</hi> 9. <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p>In this one example we may see the boldnes of our aduersaries, which are not ashamed to denye so famous a storie, being reported by <hi>Sabellicus, Leonicus Chalcondyla, Marianus Scotus,</hi> that liued about the yeere 1028. <hi>Sigebertus Gim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blacens. anno</hi> 1100. beside thirteene Historiographers, as they are quoted by Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> and of them all not one a Lutherane.<note place="margin">Desens. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. p. 434.</note> It is almost as foule a shame for them to denye so manifest and playne a thing, as it is a great blot to their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, that a whore sate sometimes in the Papall chayre. Thus then by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstration it appeareth, that the Pope is the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and so consequently very Antichrist.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, in the eight place, their owne witnesses shall speake: <hi>Bernard</hi> sayth, <hi>Bestia de Apocalypsi, cui datum est os, loquens blasphemias, Petri Cathedram occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat.</hi> The Beast in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Epistol. 125</note> to the which a mouth was giuen speaking blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, doth occupie <hi>Peters</hi> chayre. <hi>Ioachim.

Nay, long before any of these, <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 1. first of all the <hi>Gregories,</hi> and the best of all the Popes that haue followed him, thus prophecied of his successors: <hi>Ego fidenter dico,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. epist. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>quòd quisquis se vniuersalem sacerdotem vocat, vel vocari desiderat, in elatione sua Antichristum praecurrit</hi>: I speake it confidently, that whosoeuer calleth himselfe, vniuersall Priest, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth so to bee called in the pride of his heart, is the forerunner of Antichrist. But the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are now called vniuersall Bishops or Priests: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are either Antichrists, or the forerunners of Antichrist. But it is not like that Antichrist should haue so many forerunners, and so many yeeres, almost a thousand since <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. was first called vniuersall Bishop: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is alreadie come, and hath been a good while: and where els should he be, but there where his forerunners were, namely, at <hi>Rome?</hi> Now therefore seeing wee haue so many witnesses, the scripture, reason, experience, authorities to prooue the Pope Antichrist: who will either bee so simple, as seeing so good grounds, not to beleeue it, or so scrupulous, hauing such certayne euidence, to doubt thereof? And thus at the length, by Gods gracious assistance, wee haue finished and brought this great question concerning Antichrist, to an end, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the whole controuersie as touching the Bishop or Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>66</label> THis name Clergie, in Latine, <hi>Clerus,</hi> is a name made proper to the Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by vse of antiquitie, and agreeably to Scriptures: they are so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the Lords lot, and consecrate to the diuine seruice: the rest are called popular, or lay men, which meddle not with any function of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 This word (say they) hath been vsed by all antiquitie, and thereby Church Ministers only signified: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a fit and decent name, <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Clericis, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Rhemens.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3</p>
                     <p>Ans. First, the Fathers vsed this name Clergie, but not as it is now vsed of the Papists, which doe hereby as it were exclude the people of God from the Lords inheritance, counting them as Asses and Dogs, in respect of the Clergie: they vsed it as a ciuill indifferent name, for an outward distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their callings, not as a name of more holines, and so we refuse it not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 What though by custome &amp; continuance this name hath been somewhat abused, we will learne herein to speake of the scriptures, and not of men.</p>

                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:20636:104"/>Secondly, we mislike this name (say our aduersaries) because we would haue no difference betweene the people and Clergie, <hi>Rhemist. ibid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. It is a great slander: because we make no such difference, as they doe, as to make the Clergie onely Gods lot and portion, and to count the people as vnholy, and to preferre euery ignorant doltish Masse priest, before the best and deuoutest of the people: therefore they imagine we make no difference at all. We doe distinguish the calling of the one, and the other: none of the lay sort to be so hardie as to meddle with the word or Sacraments, which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Ministers, which you notwithstanding permit them to doe: and the people euery where to reuerence their Pastors and to yeeld due obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But that the calling of the one before God in it selfe, is more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then the other, that we doe not, neither dare affirme.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Leuites in the time of the lawe, were seuered out from the rest of the Lords people, and he was their lot and inheritance, and they the Lords lot. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.2. And as the Leuites were then, so are the Ministers of the Gospell now. <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. First, the Lord is rather sayd to be their lot, because they had the Lords portion, and liued of the Altar, then they are sayd to be the Lords lot: for the whole nation was holie vnto God, and a kingdome of Priests, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it followeth not, that because there was a legall and ceremoniall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then betweene the Priests and the people, that therefore it ought to be so now: Nay rather the contrarie followeth, because there was such a difference then, that therefore the Priesthood of the lawe being ceased, there ought to bee none such now: for Christ hath made vs all Kings and Priests to God his father, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1.6: And we are al a royall priesthood and holy nation, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Now, though there be a difference of callings amongst men, yet before God we are all Priests alike, and there is but one Priest for vs all to Godward, euen Christ Iesus our Lord.</p>

The Apostle exhorteth the pastors and teachers to feede the flock of Christ, <hi>non vt dominantes Cleris,</hi> not as Lords ouer Gods Clergie &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.

Clerkes, which serue in the Ministerie, I thinke, were so called, because <hi>Matthias</hi> was chosen by lot.

                        <p n="1">1 That the people are to be vtterly excluded, thus they would proue it: <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was onely elected of <hi>Moses,</hi> without consent of the people, so were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles by our Sauiour: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the peoples consent is not required, <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. Who seeth not, that there is great difference betweene ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary callings? such as the calling of the Apostles was, and <hi>Aarons</hi> at the first, though the office of the high Priest afterward became ordinarie. Also it followeth not, the Apostles were chosen without consent of the people, when there were yet no faithfull and Christian congregations, and because they were pastors of the whole world, <hi>Ergo,</hi> as well the peoples consent may be wanting in the election of ordinarie Bishops and Pastors, which haue their peculiar &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per charges, and there being now many faithfull and well instructed congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is one thing to appoynt Pastors for the Church not yet planted, &amp; an other thing to constitute them in a Church alreadie reformed and instructed: for we reade of nations that haue been conuerted to the faith, by those that had no calling of the Church, as a great nation of the <hi>Indians</hi> was by <hi>Aedesius</hi> and <hi>Frumentinus, Ruffin. lib.</hi> 1.9. and the <hi>Iberians</hi> by a captiue woman, <hi>Ruffin.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The people cannot iudge, who are fit to be pastors, and their elections are tumultuous, as we may reade, how in the election of <hi>Damasus</hi> there were 137. persons slaine, and therefore it is not meete, nor conuenient, that the matter should be committed to the people, either to elect, or ordayne: but whatsoeuer they did in times past, it was either by sufferance or negligence of the Bishops, <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, meere popular elections were neuer allowed in any well ordered Church, neither was the allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their pastors wholly referred to the people, neither did they beare the chiefe stroke, but the election was moderated by the wisedome and grauitie of the Clergie, <hi>Fulk. Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. Secondly, the question is not betweene vs, concerning the ordayning of pastors, for that belonged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Eldership, and was done by laying on of their hands, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.14: but concerning the electing and choosing of them. Thirdly, neither doe we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether it be conuenient and necessarie at al times, but whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for neither doe we affirme, that it is of the essence and substance of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ministers to be chosen by the voyces of the people: as though they were no ministers, but vsurpers and intruders that are not so called:<note place="margin">Fulk. Act. 14.22.</note> but whether it hath been at any time, &amp; may yet be lawfull, to require the consent of the people. Fourthly, it is false, that the people had this right by vsurpation, or els sufferance of the Pastors: for <hi>Cyprian</hi> sayth, it did, <hi>De diuina authoritate descendere, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epistol.</hi> 4. That this custome was grounded vpon diuine authoritie, yea it was established by the lawes of Kings: as there was a lawe made by <hi>Lodouicus Pius</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> that Bishops should bee ordayned by the free election of the Clergie and the people, <hi>ex Ansigis. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="194" facs="tcp:20636:106"/>3 Therefore (say they) elections of Bishops ought to bee at the Popes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signement: for vnto <hi>Peter</hi> was committed the care of the vniuersall Church, when he bad <hi>Peter</hi> feede his sheepe. Hereupon they are bold to affirme, that we haue neither true Bishops nor Ministers, because they are not lawfully sent, that is, as they interprete it, from the See Apostolike, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, the charge giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> beareth no such sense: that because Christ bad him feede his sheepe, therefore he and his successors should onely haue authoritie to consecrate Ministers: for if <hi>Peter</hi> had it by this grant, other Elders and Pastors had it in like sort, to whom it as well appertayned to feede the flocke of Christ, 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 5.2. And agayne, not <hi>Peter</hi> onely, but the rest also of the Apostles did ordayne and consecrate Pastors and Elders, as it shall be shewed afterward.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, neither is it a good reason to condemne our Ministerie, because it hath not the Popes allowance: for euery Church hath a lawfull calling within it selfe, without sending to forrayne Prelates for their approbation. And if you aske vs by whom our Ministers were first called, seeing there were none but popish Bishops in euery Church: wee answere: that some had their calling in the Popish Church, which afterward being more effectually called of GOD, became profitable teachers of the Gospell. Neither is it necessarie, that the Church should alwayes be bound to an ordinarie calling; when as the state of the Church is so corrupted, and the gouernment thereof, that no good calling can bee obtayned: for then the Lord raiseth vp some extraordinarily for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Church, such as we doubt not, but <hi>Luther</hi> was. In which and the like cases, the ordinarie imposition of hands by the Pastors of the Church, being heretikes and idolaters, as it was in time of Poperie, is not to be expected or stayed for, <hi>Plura apud Fulk. annot. Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</p>

                        <p>COncerning election or choise to be made by the people, we are to put three cases. First, meere popular elections, wherein the people by multitude of voyce should carrie all away, are in no case, nor at any time to be allowed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the people to giue their voyce in elections, which are moderated and gouerned by the graue and wise Pastors and Elders, it hath been vsed in times past, and may bee agayne, and is in some places, where the state of the Church, the condition and qualitie of the people will beare it. Thirdly, though the people neither beare sway in the election, nor giue their suffrages and voyces, yet it is conuenient and requisite, that their consent should be had, and publike testimonie: for the Ministers should bee such as haue a good report of all, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Fulk. Act.</hi> 14. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. But as for the Pope, let him keepe himselfe, as a Bishop in his owne Dioces, he hath nothing to doe with ordayning or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Ministers in other Churches.</p>
                        <p n="1">

And herein they offended manifestly agaynst their owne rules: for their decree is, <hi>Nullus inuitis detur Episcopus,</hi>

                        <p n="2">2 We haue the example of the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. &amp; 6. &amp; 14.23. When <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> was elected, the whole multitude was called together: and <hi>Act.</hi> 6. the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were chosen by the whole multitude: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people had an interest in times past in the election of Church officers: and this example of the Apostles may safely and lawfully bee followed of the Church, when time and place ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth: First, the election of Deacons and Pastors is not all one, neither is there the like reason. Ans. They are both publike officers for the good of the Church, and therfore if the people haue any interest in the one, why not in the other? Secondly, this was done by the grant and sufferance of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. Ans. Yea the Apostles called them together, but by the direction of the holy Ghost: as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. when the Church was assembled together vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion, it is sayd, It seemed good to vs and the holy Ghost. Agayne, in the election, beside imposition of hands, prayer was vsed, which was a chiefe part of that action: but the people had their interest in publike prayers, as being part of the congregation, and were not admitted thereunto at the pleasure and will of men: wherefore it is not true, that it was a meere grant of men, that the people might be present at elections, but it so seemed good to the Apostles thereto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the spirit of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But as for the right of elections in the Pope, it hath no shewe of reason: for bee it that <hi>Peter</hi> had onely the right of consecration amongst the Apostles, you doe but flatter your selues in thinking, that whatsoeuer right was in <hi>Peter,</hi> it must needes be in the Pope: for he is not <hi>Peters</hi> successor, as we haue shewed before at large. But we will hold you rather to this poynt: that all the Apostles had as full right to ordayne and consecrate by laying on of hands, as <hi>Peter</hi> had. Looke <hi>Act.</hi> 6.6. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. And if the Pope cannot haue all that which <hi>Peter</hi> had, much lesse can he bee capable of that which <hi>Peter</hi> neuer had.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 We haue had good experience in England, of the Popes great discretion and wisedome, in collation of spirituall preferments, and ordayning of Bishops. About <hi>anno</hi> 1253. the Pope wrote a very imperious and commanding letter to the good Bishop of <hi>Lincolne, Robert Grostede,</hi>

certificate was sent vp into the Chauncerie, of such Ecclesiasticall dignities, as were possessed by strangers not inhabiting the land: and there were found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fourtie Deaneries, Archdeaconries and Prebends, and those not the worst, some worth one hundred, some two hundred, nay, some foure hundred pound by the yeere, the Archdeaconrie of Canturburie was valued at seuen hundred Florences by the yeere, which a Cardinall of <hi>Rome</hi> had: And there were aboue a dosen Cardinals resiant at <hi>Rome,</hi>

By this example it appeareth, though the people made not the choise, yet their consent was demanded. And thus a Bishop was elected, and no word sent vp to <hi>Rome</hi> at all.</p>
                        <p>Neither was it the custome of the Church so to do in those dayes: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Donatists obiected agaynst <hi>Cecilianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> because he stayed not to be ordayned of the chiefe Bishop of <hi>Numidia, Vt princeps Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus a principe ordinaretur:</hi> That one chiefe Bishop might bee ordayned of an other. <hi>Augustine</hi> answered, that there was another custome of the Catholike Church, <hi>Vt non Numidiae, sed propinquiores Episcopi, Episcopum ecclesiae Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis ordinarent:</hi>

                     <head>THE SECOND PART CONCERNING the election of the Pope.</head>
                     <p>THey say, that the surest and safest way and simplie the best, is that which is <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>68</label> now vsed, to choose the Pope by, namely by the Colledge of the Cardinals: That whosoeuer is by two partes of the sayd Cardinals elected, is rightly the successor of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the vndoubted Pope of Rome.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 None can better iudge who is fittest for the papacie,<note place="margin">Argum.</note> then they which are the Popes Counsellers, and know the affayres of the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals the meetest men.</p>
                     <p>Answere: First, you take that for graunted, which wee instantly denie, that the Cardinals of Rome are alwayes the wisest and most learned: as though a Cardinals hat doth bring with it such abundance of vertue and learning: nay a title of a Cardinalship is sooner obtayned by fauour than desert, by masses of money, then weight of learning: And good reason, seeing that the Cardinals make a gayne of the papacie: For an Asse loaden with golde shall sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Castle of Saint <hi>Angel,</hi> then any other comming with a cart loade of bookes: they that reade Cardinal <hi>Wolseyes</hi> instructions sent to <hi>Stephen Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> at Rome, what great promises of money and preferment, may easily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the disposition of the Pope-holy Electors of Rome: Seeing they make a gayne of the Pope, why should not he set Cardinalships to sale?<note place="margin">Fox. p. 992.</note> for if <hi>Iacobus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> payd 27000. florences for his pall, what thinke you a Cardinals hat is to be valued at, which is a higher degree,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 794.</note> then either Bishop or Archbishop?</p>
                     <p>We say then, that there may be wiser and more learned men of the Clergie in Rome then the Cardinals: and that the whole Clergie may better iudge, then a few ambitious Cardinals, and are freer from corruption.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They are not fitter, not concerning the affayres of the Church, for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are like to know better, what appertayneth to the office of a Bishop, then priests and Deacons, as most of the Cardinals are.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It appeareth by the continuance to be the best:<note place="margin">Argum.</note> for it hath now endured foure hundred yeeres: and by the effect, for the See of Rome hath neuer been freer from Schismes, then since this order was taken for the Popes election, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin. cap.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>Answere: First, how can it be of such long continuance, seeing by your owne confession, it exceedeth not foure hundred yeeres? Nay who will not graunt, that the ancient order of electing the Bishop of Rome by the whole Clergie, and consent of the people of Rome, with the confirmation of the Emperour, which lasted a thousand yeeres, till this new deuice came in place, was far more ancient and durable? Secondly, how well the Cardinals election hath kept the See of Rome from Schisme, experience of former times teacheth vs: In pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> time the 6. there were two popes many yeeres together:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20636:108"/>
and one did so deadly pursue the other, that Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> at once cut off fiue of the Cardinals heads: might they not haue great ioy, thinke you, in choosing such a Pope? In the time of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. there were three Popes at once. In the Councel of <hi>Basile</hi> Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> was deposed,<note place="margin">Fox p. 434.</note> and counted an heretike. And yet for all this, the Cardinals are the onely preseruers and maintainers of the peace of the Apostolike See.</p>
                     <div type="Protestant_doctrine">
                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>THough it doe not greatly concerne vs, what manner of election is vsed at Rome: (for vnto vs the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the meanest Bishop in the land is as much, yea and more, then the glorious enthronizing of the Pope:) Yet it shall not be amisse briefly to shew, how these great antiquaries are become enemies of antiquitie, refusing the ancient manner of election, which was vsed in Rome for a 1000. yeares together, namely, that the Bishop there should be elected by the whole Clergy, wiht the consent of the people and confirmation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is a playne case, that till the yeare 685. in all their elections they way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the authoritie of the chiefe Magistrate, the Emperour, or the deputie of Italie. But then came in the constitution of <hi>Constantine</hi> the 4 that their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should be firme without the consent of the Emperour. Yet for all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, <hi>anno.</hi> 810. Pope <hi>Adriane</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Carolus magnus</hi> full authoritie to elect the Bishop of Rome: and <hi>anno.</hi> 961. <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. made the same grant to <hi>Otho</hi> first <hi>Germane</hi> Emperor. This continued in force till <hi>Alexander</hi> the 2. his time, who was elected first without the Emperors consent, but afterward repenting of it, he protested openly, that he would be no longer Pope vnlesse hee had the Emperours consent, and thereupon he was deposed by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and throwen into prison. This was more then a 1000. yeeres after Christ: since that time the Emperour hath been excluded, and shut out from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections. But all this while notwithstanding, though the Emperors consent sometime was not necessary, yet the Clergie of Rome, and the people retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their ancient priuiledge still. So we see by this new erection of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 4.6.</note> there is great iniurie offered to three estates, the Emperor, the Clergie of Rome, the people.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 This new forme of election hath not stood continually in force, since it was first founded. For in the Councel of <hi>Constance sess.</hi> 40. they proceeded to the election of a new Pope, not staying for the rest of the Cardinals, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting other electors in their roume. In the Councel of <hi>Basile,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> was elected Pope, by other electors, then Cardinals: Nay there was but one Cardinal, namely, <hi>Arolatensis,</hi> the rest were Bishops, Doctors and others. And though they will say perchance that this Pope was chosen in a schisme, for they holde the Councel of <hi>Basile</hi> to be schismaticall: yet they can not, neither doe deny, but that Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the 5. who was chosen at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> was rightfully Pope.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Answere: First, to let passe this, that the Councel may be suspected for the credite thereof, seeming wholly to be patched out of the Popes decrees. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we denie not but they had such offices, as Readers, to reade the text of the scriptures, exorcists to cast out diuels, which was an extraordinary gift for that time, Acoluthists, young men appoynted to attend vpon the Bishop for their better instruction: Doore-keepers, that kept the entrie of the Church that no heathen person or excommunicate should enter. But these were both diuers offices, then are now appoynted for them in the popish Church: for they make them now, all or the most ministers and seruitors for the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous seruice of the Masse, which in those dayes was not heard of: neither though there were such offices and seruices in the Church, were they made orders and degrees of the ministerie.</p>

But as for vnable offices and seruices, which shall be thought meete for the affayres and busines of the Church, they may bee retayned and kept, but not as new orders of the ministerie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 These offices are first Idolatrous, as they are nowe vsed among the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, for the Deacons, Subdeacons, Acolythi, were to attend vpon the Priest at Masse.

                        <p>From the Priest when he was disgraded, they tooke the Chalice, patine, and host, that he should haue no power any more to offer sacrifice: they scraped his nayles with a peece of glasse, and so tooke away his annoynting: and lastly, they tooke away his priestly orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>From the Subdeacon they tooke the book of the Epistles, that he should haue no more power to reade them, also the emptie Chalice, and Subdeacons ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: his office was to serue and minister to the Deacons at the Altar.</p>
                        <p>The Acolythi did light the candles in the Church, and brought wine and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20636:109"/>
water to the altar in pitchers and bottels: and in his degradation there was taken from him, an emptie flaggon or bottle, and a candlestick, with a waxe candle put out.</p>
                        <p>The order of exorcisme was taken away, by depriuing him from power to reade in the booke of exorcismes.</p>
                        <p>From the Reader they tooke the booke of Church lectures or lessons. Last of all, from the doore-keeper was taken the keyes of the Church: And so was hee depriued of all power to open or shut the Church doores, and to ring the bels. <hi>Ex Fox pag.</hi> 2134.</p>
                        <p>Thus we see, how much these offices are degenerate from the ancient vse: First, they are all but Ministers and attendants for the abominable sacrifice of the masse, which in those dayes was not knowen, for the Acoluthus or waiter waiteth vpon the Subdeacon, the Subdeacon vpon the Deacon, and all of them vpon the Priest at Masse. Secondly, whereas then the Exorcists had a peculiar grace of God to cast out diuels: their Exorcists do but reade certaine exorcismes in bookes, their Readers onely read the text of scripture: now they reade the legends of popish saints. Then in time of persecution, when Christians assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the night, the wayters had the charge to light the candles, but now they doe light them at noone day.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 These offices haue not been in vse these many yeares among the papists themselues: for many times the Sexton or his boy, doe execute the charge both of Acolites, Ostiaries and Readers, yea of Deacons and Subdeacons also, when the Priest with his boy can dispatch a Masse.

                        <p>WE differ from them in two poynts: First, they say, that Bishops are not onely in a higher degree of superioritie to other Ministers, but they are as Princes of the Clergie, and other Ministers as subiects, and in all things to bee commaunded by them.

                        <p>For the first, for the princely authoritie of Bishops, whom they would haue obeyed in all things; they wrast these and such like places of scripture: as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. I write vnto you, to know whether you will be obedient in all things,

Thirdly, at that time when the Deacons were elected, the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was at Ierusalem, neither were there as yet any other Pastors ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; therefore the Apostles only atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon preaching of the word: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when they had ordayned Pastors in other Churches, to them also ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was committed the word of reconciliation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. Christ hath giuen some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Pastors and teachers: So that Pastors &amp; teachers, though ordained first by the Apostles, yet had their calling of God, and together in their calling, authoritie and commission to preach, neither being once ordayned, needed they to expect anie further license from the Apostles.</p>

                        <p>FIrst, though we doe admitte, that for auoyding of schisme, the Church hath thought it meete, there should be difference in degree and a superioritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Ministers, yet your princely dominion which you doe vrge, in no wise must be admitted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is contrary to the rule of Christ. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.25. the Kings of the nations are Lords ouer them, and they that haue authoritie ouer them, are called bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: Here our Sauiour speaketh not of tyrannical dominion (for how could tyrants be benefactors?) but forbiddeth, that there should be any such prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and pompous preeminence among ecclesiasticall persons, as there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong secular and ciuill gouernours: A superioritie may be graunted, but not as the Prince is ouer his subiects: it was so in time of popery, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were halfe subiects to the Prince and halfe subiects to their spirituall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: But though we acknowledge other ecclesiasticall fathers and pastors, yet we are subiects onely to our prince.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Saint <hi>Peter</hi> also is flat against this princely rule and dominion, Feede the flock, sayth he, not as Lords ouer Gods heritage, but that you may bee ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. But are not they, I pray you, Lords ouer the flock, that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to be princes?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, concerning the power of preaching, we affirme, that euery pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor once ordayned, hath sufficient authoritie to preach in his owne flocke and charge,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 454.</note> as <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> notably prooued to their face out of a certayne glose in the fift booke of the decretals, that when as the Bishop ordayneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Priest, he giueth him also therewithall authoritie to preach.

                        <p>Whatsoeuer belongeth to the office of a Minister set ouer a flocke or charge, hee receiueth the power thereof when he is ordayned: But to preach the word, belongeth to the office of such: for preaching is properly the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the people.</p>

                           <pb n="204" facs="tcp:20636:111"/>But see the absurditie of the papists: they say it is not proper to the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to preach, but onely to haue power to sacrifice the body of Christ: But it is proper to the Bishop, say they, to preach. We answere: First, then the Bishop is properly the pastor of euery flocke and congregation in his diocesse, for hee that properly feedeth, is properly the Pastor: And hee that is properly the Pastor, hath the charge of soules properly, yea more, then hath the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Pastor: for he is improperly their Pastor, but as it were the Bishops sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and Vicar: But what Bishop in the worlde is able to beare so great a burthen, to haue the especiall and proper charge of all the soules in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse? It is not to be denied, but he hath a charge of their soules, as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince also hath in some respect of his subiects: but to say hee is the proper Pastor, and hath the proper &amp; principall charge of soules in teaching and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them (for the question is now of preaching, not of gouerning) who is able to abide it? Secondly, but our <hi>Rhemists</hi> tell vs another tale, that many that are not able to preach, are meete enough to bee Bishops, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5. <hi>sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not proper to Bishops neither to preach. I pray you then, for whom is it proper? if neither for Bishops nor inferior Pastors, then for none. Thirdly, they make but seuen orders of Ecclesiasticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the priesthood is the chiefe: for a Bishop and a priest make but one order, as <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> confesseth <hi>cap.</hi> 11. But to none of all these orders it is proper to preach: for seeing it is not proper to the priest, none of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior orders can challenge it.

                        <p>THe Keyes of the Church, that is, the power to bind and loose sinners, to open or shut vnto them the kingdome of God, consisteth both in the externall discipline and gouernement of the Church lawfully executed according to the word of God, as also in preaching of the Gospell, by assuring in Christs name all faithfull and penitent persons remission and forgiuenes of their sinnes, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and threatning the wrath of God against the disobedient and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: also as the sacraments are ioyned to the word, as seales and pledges of the promises thereof, so by the right administration of the sacraments together with the preaching of the word, sinnes are retained or remitted.</p>

Leauing now this part of spiritual power in Ecclesiasticall discipline, which is not in this place in question betweene vs, wee must touch that other part, which is exercised in the word and sacraments.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the sacraments doe binde and loose, it is proued out of the word of God: they doe binde, Whosoeuer eateth &amp; drinketh vnworthily, eateth &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his own damnation, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. they doe also loose, As oft as ye shal eate this bread and drinke this cup, you shewe the Lords death, till he come, vers. 26.</p>
                        <p>But here is a double caution and condition to be annexed. First, that all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments worke not this effect, but onely those of Christs institution, which are but two, baptisme and the supper of the Lord: for <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I haue receiued of the Lord, that which I deliuered vnto you, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. If the Apostles would not, neither might deliuer any Sacraments, but those which were instituted of Christ, what great presumption is it in any other to doe it?

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20636:113"/>
of Christ: for though that were alwaies to bee wished, yet where it cannot bee had, there must and ought to be a briefe shewing and declaration of the death of Christ out of the word, so oft as the Sacrament is administred, as it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our Church. <hi>Fulk.

                        <p n="3">3 We must take heede, we conceiue not thus, as though the Sacrament gaue grace by the worke wrought, and that by the very vse, forme, and externall act of the Sacrament wee obtaine remission of sinnes, as the <hi>Rhemists</hi> would beare vs in hand, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. <hi>sect.</hi> 15.

These conditions then being obserued, we denie not, but that there is an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the keyes euen in the Sacraments.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 But chiefely and principallie, is this power dispensed by the preaching of the word, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Wee are the sauour of death vnto death, vnto some: there is the binding: and to other the sauour of life vnto life: there is the loosing, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.16. So our Sauiour Christ saith, He that refuseth mee, the word that I haue spoken, shall iudge him in the last day, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.48. Here is the power of binding: Againe, the truth shall make you free, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.32. Here is the power of loosing. Who therefore doubteth this, that the preaching of the word is the most proper and principall way and meane, for the exercising of this Ecclesiasticall power? for seeing faith is the key of heauen, thereby wee haue free accesse vnto the throne of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. and faith commeth by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. and hearing by the word: It remaineth that by the word the keyes are dispensed.</p>

                           <hi>Augustine</hi> also subscribeth vnto this: for speaking of reformation of life and repentance with remission of former sinnes, thus he saith, <hi>Quid empturus es vt facias, quae emplastra quaesiturus? ecce cùmloquor, muta cor, &amp; factum est, quod tam saepe &amp; tam diu clamatur, vt fiat. in Psal.</hi> 63. What medicine or plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster wilt thou buie to heale thy sinne? Behold euen now, while I preach vnto thee, change thy heart, and it is already done, which we so often call vpon you to be done: See then by the preaching of the word our heart is chaunged, our life amended, and our sinne remitted.</p>

Iohn</hi> 20. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 They reason thus out of our Sauiours owne words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.21. As my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath sent me, so I send you. He sheweth his fathers commission giuen to himselfe, and then in plaine termes most amply imparteth the same to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: But Christ had full right to remit sinnes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> also the Apostles and their successors: for they haue the same power that Christ had, <hi>Rhemist. annot.

                        <p>Ans. First, it is great presumption, and spoken without any ground, to say, that Christ, by sending his Apostles into the world, gaue them as full, large, and ample commission, as he himselfe had: for neither the Pope, in whom remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as they say, the Apostolike authoritie, by their owne confession, can doe all that Christ did, as to ordaine and institute Sacraments: and Christ (say they) might forgiue sinnes without the Sacraments, which the Pope cannot doe, and so consequently neither the Apostles, whose full iurisdiction he hath, in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, <hi>Bellarm. de pontif. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. Secondly, the power therefore here granted to the Apostles, is in the name of Christ, to declare and pronounce remission of sinnes, according to the wil of God, not properly in their owne power to release or absolue sinners.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 He breathed vpon them, and gaue them the holy Ghost, vers. 22. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that denieth the Priests authoritie to forgiue sinnes, he must denye the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20636:114"/>
holy Ghost to be God, and not to haue power to remit sinnes, <hi>Rhem. ibid sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>Ans. What a blasphemous consequence is this? The holy Ghost hath abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power to forgiue sinnes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Apostles also, and all other Priests haue the same power. First, by this meanes they make no difference betweene the fulnes of power in our Sauiour Christ, and the communication of that power to other Ministers: of Christ it is sayd, that the Spirit was not giuen him by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.34. and that the holy Ghost dwelleth in him bodily: but it were great blasphemie so to say of any man, Apostle or Minister beside, which haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the same grace, but not in the like measure that Christ hath, but the spirit is giuen to euery one in measure, as they haue neede in their seuerall places and callings. Secondly, though we should grant, that the Apostles had the full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Christ actually to remit sinnes, which they shall neuer proue, yet it may be doubted, whether al Ministers, whom they call Priests, (which name we refuse not, if it be taken according to the sense of the originall word <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and not for a sacrificing priesthood) haue as full power, in this case, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had, nay it is plaine, they haue not: for the Apostles and other in the Primitiue Church, had power to discerne spirits, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. and to giue actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bodies of the excommunicate to bee vexed, and possessed of the diuell, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and after a strange manner to exercise power ouer their bodily life, as <hi>Peter</hi> did vpon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Act.</hi> 5: Yet we rather stand vpon this poynt, that neither the Apostles, nor any other Ministers haue power actually to remit sinnes, then onely as dispensers and stewards in the name of Christ.</p>

                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>AL the power of binding and loosing committed to the Apostles and to the Ministers of the word and Sacraments, is, by declaring the will and pleasure of God out of his word, both to pronounce forgiuenes of sinnes to all, that are truely penitent, &amp; the reteining of them to the obstinate and impenitent, <hi>Fulk. annot. Iohn</hi> 20. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. So that Ministers are not made iudges in this case, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Lords ambassadors, to declare the will of God out of his word.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 There is a notable place for this purpose, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.18. God hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vs vnto himselfe through Iesus Christ, and hath giuen vs the ministerie of reconciliation. So then Christ is the onely author of reconciliation, the Apostles are but ministers: how then say the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> that Christ himselfe is but a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster also of our reconciliation, yet a chiefe minister, whereas the Apostle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him the author? God was in Christ reconciling the world to himselfe, vers. 19. Wee are but ambassadors for Christ, and pray you in Christs stead, to bee reconciled vnto God: this then is the office of Ministers, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile men vnto God, but to pray them to bee reconciled through Christ: Christ onely is the reconciler, they but ministers of reconciliation: They are but messengers and ambassadors, onely to declare their Princes pleasure;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20636:115"/>
their commission is certaine, beyond that they cannot goe. Wherefore that is a blasphemous decretal, and cleane contrarie to the scripture, which is ascribed but falsely, to <hi>Pontianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which sayth, that God hath Priests so familiar, that by them he forgiueth the sinnes of others, and reconcileth them vnto him, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 59. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, that God onely by Christ reconcileth vs vnto himselfe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Augustine</hi> doth very freely vtter his minde concerning this matter, who putteth this obiection: If men doe not forgiue sinnes, then it should seeme to be false which Christ sayth, Whatsoeuer you bind in earth is bound in heauen. He answereth: <hi>Daturus erat dominus hominibus spiritum sanctum, &amp;c.</hi> God was to giue vnto men the holy Ghost, by whom their sinnes should be forgiuen them. <hi>Spiritus dimittit, non vos; spiritus autem Deus est: Deus ergo dimittit, non vos:</hi> the spirit therefore remitteth sinne, and not you: the spirit is God, God forgiueth sinnes, and not you. Here is one argument, God onely forgiueth sinnes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not man. Againe, <hi>Quides homo nisi aeger sanandus? vis mihi esse medicus? mecum quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re medicum.</hi> O man what art thou that takest away my sinnes, but a sicke man thy selfe? wouldest thou be my phisition? nay, let vs both together goe seeke a phisition that may heale vs. Lo, another argument: He cannot be a phisition to others, that needeth a phisition himselfe: he cannot reconcile others to God, who hath himselfe neede of a reconciler. Further, he sayth: <hi>Qui dimittit per ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem, potest dimittere praeter hominem: non enim minus est idoneus per se dare, qui potest per alium dare.</hi> He that can forgiue sinnes by man, can forgiue also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out man: for he may as well forgiue by himselfe, as he can doe it by another. Here is then the third argument: If man doe actually forgiue sinnes, then Christ should not forgiue sinnes without man:<note place="margin">Augustin. Homil. 23.</note> for the whole power is committed to man. Yea, the <hi>Rhemists</hi> affirme the same, that it is necessarie we should submit our selues to the iudgement of the Priest for release of our sinnes: if it bee neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, then sinnes cannot be remitted without the Priest: then is Christs power limited, he cannot forgiue without man, which is contrarie to that <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmeth here.</p>

pontif. cap.</hi> 10. where, this place being alleadged against the temporall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Ecclesiasticall persons, he answereth, that this place onely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>negotiationes,</hi> and <hi>mercimonia,</hi> merchandise and traffick in the worlde, not <hi>regimen politicum,</hi> not politicall regiment. If then the politicall care of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, prouince, or common-wealth be no impediment, in his iudgement, to the spirituall warfare: much lesse without all question is the domesticall care of one familie, the charge of wife and children. Thirdly, we vtterly denie, that mariage is an hinderance or let to the calling of Ministers: nay we say, that it is an helpe and comfort to those that haue not the proper gifte of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Iesuite giueth diuers instances, wherein mariage is a let and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to ministers: As, it hindreth their prayer, their preaching, their almes and liberalitie to the poore, for they haue wife and children to care for. <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Answere: First, belike you esteeme of mariage as of an vnholie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure thing, that a man can neither pray, nor doe the office of a Christian performing the duetie to his wife: and indeede one of your companions cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth mariage a prophanation of sacred orders. <hi>Greg. Martin. discouer. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>sect.</hi> 11. Whereas the Apostle calleth it an honourable state, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. and it was instituted in Paradise, whereas before the fall of man there was no vncleane thing. Secondly, we denie not, but that abuse of mariage both in ministers and other lay-men, is an impediment to all holie actions: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth generall Counsell to all both ministers and others, that they which haue wiues should bee as though they had none, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. that is, should liue soberly in mariage, and not giue themselues to the wantonnes of the flesh. Thirdly, neither doth mariage hinder hospitalitie: for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that a minister should be harborous, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. giueth also rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the gouernement of his familie, his wife and children. <hi>vers</hi> 4.11. For to whom may he better commit the care of houshold affayres then to his wife? And that familie which is guided by a carefull &amp; godly huswife, we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, to yeeld more reliefe to the poore, and giue entertainement to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then those houses which haue none. And where it is obiected, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters will care altogether for their children: It hath been seene that single priests in time of poperie, haue been more couetous and greedie to enrich their kinred, then maried Ministers haue cared for the prouision of their children.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Single life by the Apostle is preferred before the maried estate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fittest for Ministers: for he that is maried careth for the things of the world, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 33. <hi>Rhemist.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. First, single life is preferred before mariage, in all men, &amp; not onely in Ministers: And therefore as lay-men are not bound to single life, though it be in it self more conuenient, so neither ought ministers to bee. 2. Though a thing in it selfe be best, yet is it not vniuersally best for euery man: as riches are better then pouertie, because they are Gods blessing: yet is it not best
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:20636:117"/>
for euery man to be rich: God seeth it good, that some men should be poore: So single life is the best for those that haue the gift of chastitie, that can with a quiet conscience liue single: otherwise matrimonie were much better: for Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that wisheth that euery one would liue single as hee did, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sayth, It is better to marrie then to burne: So that by the Apostles iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to marrie is best for him that hath not the gift of continencie. <hi>Iewel. pag.</hi> 232. <hi>defens.

                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>THat it is not onely lawfull but conuenient, that all men both Ministers and others, that haue not receiued a proper gift of continencie, should marrie, and that it is agreeable and consonant to the word of God: thus wee shew it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The scriptures are most playne for the mariage of Ministers, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.2. Saynt <hi>Paul</hi> sayth a Bishop, and generally euery Minister, may be the husband of one wife: and <hi>verse</hi> 11. their wiues are described, howe they ought to behaue themselues: Let their wiues be honest. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is lawfull for them to bee maried. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that Saynt <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the wiues which they had before their calling and ordayning, not those, which they should marry after. But there appeareth no such thing out of the text: Nay Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> say wee, had libertie as well as others, to leade about a sister a wife, euen after hee was an Apostle, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9. Wherefore it is as lawfull afterward as afore. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth: We must thus read, a Sister a woman, and it is like they were women, that did minister vnto the Apostles and followed them. We replie: First, the word Sister, doth implie a woman, and therefore it had been an improper and needlesse speech, to say, a sister a woman: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must rather read, a sister a wife. Secondly, if they were other women, which ministred of their substance, what neede the Apostles to be mayntained of the Churches? if they ministred but in their seruice and attendance, who were more fit to doe it and to follow them from place to place then their wiues? Thirdly, the phrase of leading about a sister, importeth a superioritie and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, such as the husband hath ouer his wife.</p>
                        <p>Another place we haue, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.3. Mariage is honourable among all men: <hi>Ergo,</hi> amongst Ministers. <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> If it were meant of all mariages, then to marrie within the degrees of consanguinitie, were also honourable. Answere: This is a very childish cauill: First, hee might haue read further, And the bedde vndefiled: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> therefore speaketh of lawfull mariage: and indeede the other ioyning and coupling of men and women together contrarie to GODS lawe, is not to bee counted Matrimonie or Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, but Incest rather and Fornication, as the brother to marrie his brothers wife, and such like. Secondly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, not all mariages are honourable, but mariage is honourable for all men; the generalitie is not of the thing, but the persons: Wherefore we doe fittly conclude out of this
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20636:117"/>
place, that marriage is lawful and commendable euen among ministers. <hi>argum. Caluin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Further Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, For auoyding of fornication, let euery man haue his owne wife, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.2. Here is no restraint for Ministers. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> this is to be vnderstoode of those that haue not made a vow of continency. Answer: First, our Sauiour Christ commaundeth no such vowes: it is a cruell Antichristian yoke laide vpon Ministers, to binde them, when they receiue orders, to vowe single life: &amp; therefore your Antichristian decree ought not to abridge the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall libertie granted by the Apostle. Secondly, the end of marriage is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to auoyde fornication, and therefore the remedie also is generall: for euerie man hauing not a proper gift of continencie, may be in danger of that inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, if he be denyed the ordinarie helpe. <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Againe, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. to forbid marriage is called a doctrine of diuels: but the Popish Church forbiddeth marriage. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> Wee doe not forbid marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to any, but we require single life of all that are entred into orders, which, it is at their owne choyce to receiue, or to refuse. Ans. First, it is necessarie that some should receiue orders, and be consecrate to the Church ministerie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requiring this condition of all such to liue single, though particularly you prohibite not this man or that to marrie, yet generally you prohibite the whole calling, which is worse. Secondly, if you say you doe not forbid marriage sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie to all: no more did the <hi>Manichees,</hi> for they suffered their scholars and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors to marrie. And Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> words are generall. <hi>Ille prohibet matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium, qui illud malum esse dicit:</hi> he forbiddeth marriage,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Faust. li. 30. cap. 6.</note> that thinketh it is euil: you therefore forbidding marriage, must needs hold opinion that is wicked and euill.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 This restraint of the marriage of Ministers, hath not been of ancient time in the Church, but imposed vpon the Church of late, 1000. yeere after Christ: <hi>Polycrates</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus anno</hi> 180. had seuen of his progenitors before him Bishops of the same See. In the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel <hi>Paphnutius</hi> stoode vp, and stayed the decree, that should haue past, for restraining of the marriage of Ministers, and it is saide, <hi>Synodus landauit sententiam Paphnutij</hi>: The Synod commended <hi>Paphnutius</hi> sentence. <hi>Sozomen. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the father of <hi>Gregorie</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Nazianzum.</hi> The Greeke Church neuer yet receiued this popish decree of single life, and their Bishops are married at this day. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> saith, that the Church of Rome hath dispenced with them, cap. 18. <hi>Ergo</hi> if the Pope would dispence with the Latine Church, it might be lawfull enough then for Ministers to marrie; wherefore it is but a humane constitution. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is false that they haue dispenced with the Greeke Church: they care not for their dispensations, but vse their owne Christian libertie: neither was the Greeke Church euer subiect to the Bishop of Rome.</p>
                        <p>Thus we see, that in times past marriage was lawfull for all men, vntill Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the second, <hi>Alexander</hi> the second, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sorcerer and adulterer: for these three comming together, one not long
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20636:118"/>
after another, began by publike decree to restraine Priests marriage: not long after them, <hi>Anselme</hi> began to play the Rex here in England, <hi>anno</hi> 1104. who stoutely proceeded in his vngodly purpose,<note place="margin">Fox pag. 1166.</note> and enacted that married Priests should either leaue their wiues, or their benefices. At which time 200. Priests at once came barefoote to the Kings palace, to make complaint: And for all <hi>Anselmes</hi> Popelike and outragious proceedings against married Priests, yet they continued married well nie two hundred yeeres after <hi>Anselmes</hi> time,<note place="margin">Pag. 1167.</note> doe what he could: and thus it is manifest, that the restraint of Ministers marriage is no ancient thing, but then began most to be vrged, when Antichrist fullie was reuealed to the world, when as the orders of Friers came in and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and priuiledged vnder <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. about <hi>anno</hi> 1300.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 What better argument can we haue against this Popish decree, then the great vncleannes, and foule enormities that haue been brought, by the meanes thereof, into the Church? In the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first, who enioyned his Clergie to liue single, commaunding on a time his seruants to catch him some fish, out of his Motes and Ponds, in stead of fish they brought vnto him sixe thousand heads of yong children: whereupon, he fetching a great sigh with himselfe, commended then the saying of the Apostle, It is better to marrie then to burne. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath no better answere then to denie the storie, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding is found in the Epistle of <hi>Huldericus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Augusta,</hi> which he sent to Pope <hi>Nicholas. Fox. pag.</hi> 1155.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Anselmes</hi> time, after the restraint of Ministers marriage, great rumors, and complaint was brought to him,<note place="margin">Fox. pag. 1165.</note> of the execrable vice of <hi>Sodomitrie,</hi> which began to raigne in the Clergie. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the second saide, hee sawe manie waightie causes, why wiues should bee taken away from Priests, but he saw more why they should be restored to them againe. Bishop <hi>Iewell Apol. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>diuis.</hi> 3. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>Tolle de Ecclesia honorabile coniugium, &amp;c.</hi> Take from the Church honorable Matrimonie, shall you not replenish it with ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous persons, concubinaries, Sodomiticall vices? Hereupon the popish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes seeing their owne infirmitie,<note place="margin">Sup. Cant. serm. 66. Iuel p. 231.</note> began thus to salue vp the matter, <hi>Si non castè, tamen cautè:</hi> if thou deale not chastly, yet deale charily. Yea they are not ashamed thus to write, If any of the Priests should bee found imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a woman,<note place="margin">Fox. p 785.</note> it must bee expounded and presupposed, that hee doth it to blesse her.</p>
                        <p>I but (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) these are the abuses of single life, will you condemne a good thing, because of the abuse? by the same reason (saith he) <hi>coelum &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra tollenda sunt,</hi> Heauen and earth must be taken away, because they were abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the heathen and taken for Gods. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, wee say not, that these bee the fruites of single life, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth in all those that haue the gift, but of this co-acted and constrained Popish Virginitie, which is imposed indifferently vpon all, and cannot haue any good vse: secondlie, when you can proue that restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Ministers marriage is of Gods ordinance, as it is certaine Heauen and

                        <p n="1">1 They reason thus out of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.2. A Bishop must be the husband of one wife: that is, say they, that no kinde a way was, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi> or had two wiues either at once, or one after another: And they proue their interpretation thus: First, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> describeth a widow of the Church, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5.9. that hath been the wife of one husband, so here hee saith of a Bishop, that he should be the husband of one wife: but that is meant, <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuè,</hi> of one husband after another: for it was neuer seene that one woman should haue more husbands then one at once, nor neuer suffered either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Iewes or Gentiles: therefore it must be so taken here, a husband of one wife: that is, who hath been but once married, as it is taken there, a wife of one husband, that neuer had more, not onely <hi>simul,</hi> at once, but not <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuè,</hi> not successiuely one after another, <hi>Bellarmine cap.</hi> 23.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, there were many women both among the Iewes and Gentiles, that had forsaken their first husbands, and were vnlawfully coupled to others, and so had moe husbands at once, and likewise many men that had done the like to their wiues, but afterward repented, and were conuerted to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, but yet were not admitted to any publike office in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their former infamous life. Of such the Apostle speaketh in both these places, and not of those that married one wife, or one husband after another.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20636:119"/>
It is therefore great boldnes, and a greater vntruth to say, that there were none such heard of in those dayes: for although it were neither lawfull then nor now, yet both many such were heard of in those dayes, and it were no hard matter to finde out some now among the papists, that haue had more then one wife at once. Secondly, he is not to be counted <hi>Bigamus,</hi> or <hi>Digamus,</hi> that is coupled and ioyned to one wife after another lawfullie, but he that vnlawfully at once enioyeth more then one. <hi>Fulk.

                        <p>THat it is not by the word of God forbidden, that any man should marrie the second, yea the third time, after the decease of his wife, neither that hee is to be counted vnchast or giuen to wantonnes in so doing (much lesse hee that in his first marriage taketh a widow,) neither that, to haue been twise married ought to be a barre or a stop from entring into the state and calling of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, if otherwise the man be qualified and furnished with sufficient graces for that calling: thus it is proued.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 They that cut off such, as haue been twise married, from behauing any calling in the Church, doe sauour of the heresie of <hi>Montanus,</hi> into the which also <hi>Tertulliane</hi> fell, who condemned second marriage: for if once marriage be no impediment nor preiudice to him that is to bee ordained, but second marriage be, then doe they disallow second marriage, (because a man is thereby disabled to be a Minister) if not simply, yet they make it lesse lawful, nay more offensiue, and subiect to obloquie and reproch.

                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:20636:119"/>3 Second marriage, make the worst of it you can, is not so great a blot as fornication, or adulterie, or to haue a Concubine: but these were no lets of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in poperie: Nay, we reade that <hi>Augustine</hi> in the purer age of the Church, that confesseth he had two Concubines, yet afterward was made presbyter,<note place="margin">Confess. lib. 6. ca. 15.</note> and at the last a Bishop for all that.

                        <p>Ans. 1.

We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no sacrificing priesthood in the newe testament, nor any sacrifice in the Church for sinne, but onely that sacrifice of atonement vpon the Crosse: but our sacrifices are spirituall, of praise and thanksgiuing; therefore the argument fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not from the priests of the law, to those that are no priests, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 1166. 3. Purenes of life, we grant, is as much required now in Ministers of the Gospell, as it was then in the priests of the lawe: therefore they ought as well to haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to marrie, seeing matrimonie is the best remedie agaynst fornication and vncleannes of life.</p>

                        <p>NEither the Apostles forsooke the companie of their wiues, after they were called and chosen of Christ, neither ought the Ministers of the Gospell to renounce, abandon, and forsweare the societie and fellowship of their wiues: but rather to liue with them in all temperance and sobrietie, for the good example of others:</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is proued out of the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. that <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the other Apostles did leade about their wiues in their companie, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> there sayth, that he also might vse the same libertie. Likewise, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.5. S. <hi>Paul</hi> giueth rules concerning the house and familie of the Minister, his children, the behauiour of their wiues. vers 11. But where, I pray you, is it fitter for the Ministers wife and children to be, then with her husband? By these places it is apparant, that Ministers wiues were not excluded from their husbands companie: as a thousand yeere after &amp; more it was decreed by <hi>Anselme,</hi> that they should not dwell in house with their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, nor talke with them without two or three witnesses, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 1167.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It is cleane contrarie to the scripture. First, our Sauiour sayth, whosoeuer putteth away his wife, except it be for fornication, causeth her to commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.32. By this rule, therefore a Minister ought not for any other cause to put away and dismisse his wife, but for fornication: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not lawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his calling, or vpon any other colour to send her away. Secondly. S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, They ought not to defraud one another but for a time, and that with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.5. Therefore if the wife will not consent, her husband cannot goe from her: nay, though there be consent, yet they must be asunder but for a time: they cannot by consent altogether breake off, and dissolue their marriage, which was made before God, though they would neuer so fayne themselues, vnlesse it be for fornication, then without consent the marriage knot is broken.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Peter</hi> left not the companie of his wife after he was made an Apostle: for he had a daughter called <hi>Petronilla,</hi> of whom the popish legends write much holines, which must needes be borne after he was called <hi>Peter.</hi> And agayne, it is proued by her age, for she was so young in the persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder <hi>Domitian,</hi> that <hi>Flaccus</hi> the Countie desired her in marriage: but if she had been borne before

                        <p n="4">4 <hi>Augustine</hi> thus writeth of this matter: <hi>Vna sola esse causa posset, qua te id. quod vouisti, non solum non hortaremur, verumetiam prohiberemus implere, si forte tua coniux hoc tecum suscipere animi, seu carnis ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>THE SIXT QVESTION, CONCERNING THE maintenance of the Church by tithes.</head>
                  <p>COncerning the maintenance of the Church, there are diuers poynts, wherein we &amp; our aduersaries agree: The maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Ministers of the Church is either by temporal possessions, which haue been bestowed vpon the Church, by the gift of deuoute and religious men, or els they haue inheritance from their friends and a patrimonie of their owne, or els they liue of the tithes and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 We grant, and agree vnto them: that the Church Ministers, beside the portion of tithes, may lawfully enioy temporall lands, which the Church of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time hath been endowed withall. But we yeeld vnto them vpon certaine conditions: First, there must be a moderation vsed in all such gifts, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the Church: for Ecclesiasticall persons ought not to be too greedie and hastie in receiuing whatsoeuer in simplicitie and blind deuotion any man shall giue vnto them: as if they see that others are empouerished by the gift whereby they are enriched. Thus the Priests offended in our Sauiour Christs time, who allured the people to bring their offerings to the Altar, though their parents wanted in the meane time, whom they were bound to relieue by the law of God. This also was a common practise in time of Poperie: So the priests might be enriched, they cared not greatly, though all the stock of their patrones and founders were vndone: who because they were vnsatiable, &amp; had no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in entising simple men, to giue ouer their lands and Lordships into their hands, the statute of <hi>Mortmaine</hi> was made not without iust cause, to be a rule vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that otherwise could not rule themselues. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Aurelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and worthely, for this one act: A certaine rich man of <hi>Carthage</hi> hauing no children, gaue all his substance to the Church, reseruing onely the vse thereof for his life time: afterward the man had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: <hi>Reddidit Episcopus nec opinanti ea, quae donauerat.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ad fratres in erem. ser. 52.</note> The Bishop restoreth vnto him that which hee gaue, not looking for it, nor making any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it: <hi>In potestate habuit Episcopus non reddere; sed iure fori, non iure poli:</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:20636:121"/>
It was in the Bishops power not to restore the gift, but by the lawe of the court, not by the lawe of heauen. I pray you how many such examples can ye shewe me in the time of popish superstition? This then is the first thing required, that although it be lawful for the Church to enioy the bequests of their benefactors, yet it should be done with some limitation: As the Leuites, beside their tithes, had cities appoynted them: but the number was set downe, they should not exceede 48. in all: and to euery citie was a quantitie and circuite of ground al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, which should in length and bredth contayne euery way 3000. cubites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. <hi>vers.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It must also be prouided, that the gifts and legacies bestowed vpon the Church, bee for the maintenance of pietie and true religion, and to good vses, not to nourish idolatrie and superstition: or if they be giuen through ignorance of the time, to such vnlawfull purposes, they ought by the Prince to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to better and more godly vses: As now in England, the lands of Colledges, which were first giuen to maintaine that abominable Idoll of the Masse, are turned to the maintenance of learning and true religion. So was the lawe of <hi>Moses,</hi> that the gold and siluer, brasse, yron, tinne, lead, which the Israelites should receiue of the heathen,<note place="margin">Numb. 31 23.</note> first should passe through the fire, and so bee made cleane, and fit for holy vses: Euen thus according to this lawe, the lands consecrate to superstition, hauing now passed through the fire of Gods word, and triall of the truth, may safely be vsed to the glorie of God, in aduancing and setting forward true religion and vertue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Another thing must bee required: that Church-men ought not to abuse the possessions of the Church, to maintayne pride, idlenes, and ryotous liuing: for in case they doe notoriously spend and wast the Church goods, the Prince, by whose authoritie they were giuen to the Church, may iustly take from them their superfluities, not leauing the Church destitute of sufficient maintenance. This is notably proued by <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> in the defence of <hi>Wickliffes</hi> articles: And we haue seene the practise thereof in England,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 457.</note> in the late suppression of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes: wherein (though some of those lands might otherwise haue been dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of) yet the prouidence of God notably appeared in bringing desolation vpon those Cels of sinne, and vncleane cages of birdes: neither hath this been an vnusuall and vnaccustomed practise in the Church, for Princes to correct the misdemeanour of Priests, by cutting them short of their temporalties: for in <hi>Augustines</hi> time the Christian Emperours dispossessed the Donatists of their Churches and possessions, and gaue them to the Catholike Bishops. And at that time the Donatists cryed out, as the Papists doe now, <hi>Quid mihi est imperator?</hi> What hath the Emperour, the King to doe with our lands? <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> answereth, <hi>Secundum ius ipsius possides terram:</hi> by the lawe of Princes the Church enioyeth her possessions: <hi>Recitemus leges imperatorum, videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus si voluerint aliquid ab haereticis possideri:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tractat. in Iohann. 6.</note> Let vs then rehearse the lawes of Emperours, and see, whether they suffer heretikes to enioy the Church pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:20636:121"/>Secondly, concerning the second kind of maintenance, which ariseth by the proper and peculiar inheritance, which Church ministers haue:<note place="margin">Bellarm. cap. 27.</note> we also yeeld our consent, that a Minister<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom some inheritance is befallen, is not bound to disclaime therefore the maintenance which he hath of the Church: for the Leuites, beside the allotment of the tythes, had their proper houses, which they might sell, and redeeme agayne, <hi>Leuitic.</hi> 25.32. As also that place 1. <hi>Timot.</hi> 3.2. will beare it, where the Apostle would haue a Bishop to be harberous, and giuen to hospitalitie: which he shall be much better able to performe, hauing some helpe, beside the Church liuing, of his owne inheritance. So then it is not to be doubted, but that Ecclesiasticall persons may, together with spirituall liuings, retayne their owne proper inheritance: referring them both to one and the selfe same end, that is, to countenance their Ministerie, and to be the better able to performe the externall dueties thereof, in releeuing the poore, helping the needie, and such like.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as touching the proper maintenance, and reuenew of the Church, which is by tithes: diuers poynts are agreed of and accorded betweene vs. First, that tithes due onely to the Church, and cannot be alienated to any other vse, nor be turned to the maintenance of lay men: for there must be, where tithes are payed, a matter of giuing and receiuing, <hi>Philipp.</hi> 4.15. We giue spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and receiue temporall: which because lay men doe not performe, they haue nothing to doe with the tithe: for not keeping the condition, they cannot claime the couenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The people are bound in conscience, to giue of their goods vnto their lawfull Pastors, according to the determination of the Church, and the positiue lawes of Princes made in that behalfe, the which they are bound to obey: and the tenth being the hire of the labourer and the wages of the Lords workeman, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.10: it shall be as great a sinne to defraude the Minister of his portion, as to keepe backe the meate or wages from the hireling and labourer, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We vtterly denie also, and herein consent with our aduersaries, that tithes are not pure almes, as some haue been of opinion in times past,<note place="margin">Belarm. cap. 25.</note> but are a plaine debt of the people to their Ministers. First, the wages or reward of the labourer is no almes, but his due, and of right belonging to him: but tithes are so vnto Ministers who labour in the Lords haruest, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no almes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, almes doe alway exceede the desert of the almesman, they shewe the beneuolence and free heart of the giuer, not any merite or worthines in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer: but tithes and all other temporall gifts, are farre inferiour to the labours of Ministers: for what are temporall things to spirituall, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11? <hi>Ergo,</hi> no almes. Thirdly, the tenth is the Lords part, and by him it is assigned to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers, which in Gods stead doe teach vs, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. But almes cannot be giuen vnto God. Agayne, the tenth is as an inheritance to the Church, and to bee counted as the corne of the barne, or the abundance of the winepresse, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. <hi>vers.</hi> 26.27. It is vnto them as the fruite of the earth, and encrease of the ground to the husbandman: Therefore to be counted no almes from men,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20636:122"/>
but the blessing of God both vpon the pastor and the people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 We also agree, that it is not meete that the maintenance of Ministers should be voluntarie, or left to the peoples choise: but that it is conuenient, iust, equall, requisite, that both by lawes of Princes, and constitutions of the Church, prouision should be made, as there is, for the necessarie, certayne, and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent maintenance of the Church. First, the tenths in the lawe were established by a perpetuall ordinance: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the maintenance of Ministers ought now also to be confirmed by positiue lawes, as then tithes were: the argument followeth: for if their Ministerie deserued such assurance of their maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which did but serue at the Altar, much more now doth the Ministerie of the Gospel deserue it. And the Apostle also seemeth so to reason, 1. <hi>Corint.</hi> 9.14.15. that as they which wayted on the Altar were partakers of the Altar: so God hath ordayned (sayth he) that they which preach the Gospell, should liue of the Gospell. That is, as then the people did not onely giue tithes voluntarily, but were bound by lawe to doe it: euen so God hath ordayned, that Ministers should liue of the people: and by this ordinance of God, the people may as well be bound vnto it now, as they were then. Secondly, if Ministers, bound in conscience to feed and instruct the people, may also be enforced and vrged by the constitutions of the Church and lawes of Princes to do that, which in conscience they are bound: why may not the people likewise be constrayned by publike lawe, to performe that dutie to their pastors, which their owne conscience doth vrge them vnto? Thirdly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that men are hardly (euen liuing vnder a law) brought to pay their rights to the Church, no not in those places where they can take no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against their pastors: how much more vnwilling would they be (I speake of those which are not yet wonne to a through liking of the Gospel) if they were left to their owne libertie?</p>
                  <p n="5">5 We also acknowledge (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> seemeth to grant, cap. 25.) that to pay precisely the tenth, is not now commanded by the law of God: as though that order could not be changed by any humane law, as the Canonists hold, but men necessarily were bound to pay tithes: But thus farre forth we hold, that it is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Gods law: first, in respect of the equitie of the law, in paying of tithes, which is this, that the Ministers ought to liue of the people, and to haue sufficient &amp; competent maintenance by them: which equitie and substance of the law is morall, and ought alwaies to continue, being grounded vpon the law of nature: Thou shalt not musle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.6</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in as much as the lawe of the land and of the Church doth confirme this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient constitution of tithes, (which is left indifferent of itselfe) we are bound to obey such lawes, being agreeable to the word of God: And in this sense also, tithes may be sayd to be due by the lawe of God, because Gods word comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth obedience to our Magistrates, in all lawfull ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Though the lawe of tenths be not now necessarie, as it was a ceremonious duetie: but it is lawfull either to keepe that or any other constitution, for the sufficient maintenance of the Church, whether it bee more or lesse then the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20636:122"/>
tenth part: yet we doubt not to say, that this prouision for the Church mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by paying of tithes, is the most safe, indifferent and surest way, and no better can come in the place thereof. First, it is the most equall way, to haue euery thing in the kinde, according to the Apostles rule; Let him that is taught make his teacher partaker of al his goods, <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.6. But this cannot be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently done any other way, as by erecting of a set stipend, or such like, as by paying the tenth in the kind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> requireth, that the Pastor should be giuen to hospitalitie, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.2. who seeth not, that for the better and more conuenient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his house, it is the fittest course to receiue the tenth in his owne nature and kind: being so more able to relieue the poore, hauing sufficient prouision and store of his owne?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The tenth is as the corne of the barne, &amp; the abundance of the winepresse, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.27. that is, it is more or lesse, as God giueth encrease to the fruites of the earth: which is the most equall and indifferent way: for then the Minister, as God blesseth them, shall be partaker of the blessing, and if they suffer losse, he likewise shall beare the burthen with them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 This manner of tithe-paying is farre more safe and sure, then any way can be deuised, because of the long custome and continuance, which without great hazard of the Church cannot be broken: neither is it possible by any act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to make stipends so certayne, as this constitution of tithes is: for the people will hardly yeeld to breake their custome: and when an old custome is broken, a newe is not so soone receiued: nay, many yeeres must runne to make a custome. Agayne, whatsoeuer may be obiected agaynst tithes, that they breed much trouble, wrangling and contention, may be more iustly feared, in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, leuying, imposing, and demanding of stipends.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Hitherto we haue shewed, that it is most naturall, that the Ministers por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be payed in the kind. Now, concerning the tenth, though it be not necessarie, yet that proportion being first appoynted by the wisedome of God, is verily thought to be most equall and indifferent betweene the pastor and the people, as both affoording competent sustenance for the one, when he liueth of the tenth, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fifteenth, or twentith part, which were too skant allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor yet grieuing or oppressing the other, when the owner hath nine parts reserued to himselfe. And so if it be most meete, that things should be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their kind, no proportion can serue better, then that which was first deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Lord himselfe: yet we hold neither the one nor the other to bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto for the most part we and our aduersaries are agreed, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tithes, as also other maintenance of the Church: but we differ about tithes in two poynts. First, there is a question betweene vs and the <hi>Rhemists</hi> about the necessitie of paying of tithes: Secondly, concerning the right whereby the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospell may demaund their dueties, which they say, is by reason of their Priesthood: of both these now briefly in their order.</p>

One Papist shall answere another at this time. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proueth by this example the cleane contrary, that the paiment of tithes is not morall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it did not bind before the lawe of <hi>Moses:</hi> for <hi>Iacob</hi> made a voluntary vow to pay his tithes, vpon a condition: but if he had been bound absolutely to pay tithes, they should haue been payed without any such condition: It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a voluntarie and a franke offering in <hi>Iacob.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. We must consider in what time our Sauiour Christ so spake vnto the Pharisees: for as yet neither the lawe nor the ceremonies thereof were fully ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated: Christ was circumcised, &amp; Mary his mother purified according to the lawe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.21.22. Our Sauiour also biddeth the Leper to shewe himselfe to the Priest, and offer a gift as <hi>Moses</hi> commanded, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.4. Yet none of al these ceremonies doe now stand in force, though Christ did them at that time, and bad them to be done. The same answere may serue also concerning his iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Pharisees as touching their tithes.</p>

                        <p>THe lawe of paying tithes did borrowe part of the morall, part of the iudicial, and part of the ceremoniall lawe. The morall part therefore, is the equitie of the lawe, which is perpetuall, that as the Leuites then liued of the tenth, so the Ministers at all times ought sufficiently to be prouided and cared for. The iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part was in this, that as the Leuites were not much lesse in common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then the tenth part, being one of the tribes, (though in proportion of number, they made welneere the thirtith part: for the rest of the tribes were numbred to sixe hundred, three thousand, fiue hundred and fiftie persons, <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> 1. the Leuites made but two and twentie thousand,<note place="margin">603550</note> 
                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.) As I say the Leuites made one whole tribe, and were not much lesse then the tenth part in that account, being in number the thirteenth tribe, for there were twelue beside.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20636:123"/>
So it was thought reasonable that the tenth parte of their brethrens goods should be allotted vnto them: which being a iudiciall and politike constitution of that countrey, doth neither necessarily binde Christians now, neither is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, but left in that respect indifferent. Thirdly, the ceremonie of the lawe was in this, because the tenth was due to the priests and Leuites for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at the altar, and as belonging to their priesthood: In which sense tithes are neither due now vnto Ministers, nor in any such respect can be challenged, seeing the Priesthood of the lawe is gone, and all the ceremonies thereof: Whereof although it bee a wise and politike constitution, that the people should pay their tithes, and may conueniently be retayned, yet is it not now of necessitie imposed vpon Christians, as though no other prouision for the Church could serue but that.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus reasoneth (for herein he is an aduersary to our <hi>Rhemists</hi>) (one Iesuite against another) If the law of tithes be moral, then the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept annexed to this law was moral also, that the Leuites, because they liued of the offerings and tithes, should haue no patrimonie or inheritance beside. And by this reason euery Minister now ought to resigne such inheritance and possessions, as are left him by his friends: which is not to bee admitted. <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither the other law standeth necessarily in force, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 25.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth in flat words, If the priesthood be changed, of necessitie there must also be a change of the law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. But the priesthood of the law is altered and changed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> also the law of the priesthood, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ceremonial duetie of tithes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 In <hi>Augustines</hi> time, it was no generall law nor custome in the Church, that tithes should be payd. <hi>Praecidite &amp; deputate aliquid fixum ex annuis fructib. vel quotidianis quaestibus:</hi> defaulke, sayth he, and appoynt some certaine porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either of your yearely fruites, or your ordinary and daylie gaines.<note place="margin">In Psal. 146</note>

priesthood of the Gospell being more excellent then the priesthood of the Law and their sacrifice, which they offer vp in the Masse, being of greater worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they may with better right challenge tithes, then the priests of the law did for their seruice at the altar: So that tithes are due to the Church onely because of the priesthood, not for any other duetie appertaining to that office, as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word, ministring the sacraments, or any such.</p>
                        <p>Abraham payd tithes, they say, to <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> which was the priest of the most high God in offering the formes of bread &amp; wine, wherein <hi>Melchisedech</hi> did sacrifice: <hi>Ergo,</hi> tithes are now due to the priests of the Gospel and new law, which are all after the order of <hi>Melchisedech, Rhemist.

                        <p>Answere: First, <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> priesthood consisted not in offering bread and wine to God, but brought them foorth to refresh <hi>Abraham:</hi> neither were they formes of bread and wine onely, as you imagine, but very materiall bread and wine: for if <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> priesthood had consisted therein, the Apostle would not haue omitted the chiefe thing, wherein Christs priesthood was shewed forth, as he doth, making no mention at all of it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. Secondly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is great blasphemie to say, that euery popish priest is after the order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rhemist. Heb. 7. sec. 8</note> nay that the proper act of Christs priesthood consisteth in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall offering of his bodie &amp; blood in the Church: for by this reason euery im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure priest doth more properly offer the body of Christ in the Masse, then it was offered by himself vpon the cros: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which, what greater blasphemie can be vttered? And yet they are not ashamed to speak it: yea the sacrifice of Christ vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse, (say they) was after the order of <hi>Aaron</hi>; and not after the order of <hi>Melchisdech,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Fulk. Heb. 7. sect. 9 12</note> and so they preferre euery popish priest offering in the Masse, before Iesus Christ sacrificing himself vpon the Crosse: contrary to the scripture, which maketh this difference between the priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Melchisedech</hi>; that the priests of the law were many, because they were taken away by death: But Christs priesthood is eternall, because he dieth not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.23. But if there should be many priestes after <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> order, there should heerein bee no difference at all: Wherefore seeing <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> priesthood onely resteth in Christ, and is not translated to any other; and that there is now no sacrifice left but spirituall, of prayse and thanksgiuing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. it followeth that by <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> right no tithes are now due vnto the Church, neither in any such regard ought to be challenged.</p>

                     <p>Answere: First, <hi>Paul</hi> hath no generall commandement from God to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the yoke of continencie vpon any, because God had left marriage free, and therefore no man is to be barred and kept from it: But the Apostles par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aduice and sentence (being moued by the spirit of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 40.) is not onely a Counsel, but a commandement, that both they which haue the gift of continencie, should glorifie God by that gift, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. and they which haue it not, should marrie rather then burne, and so dishonour God, <hi>vers.</hi> 9.

If a man be called to liue single, hee ought to obey his calling, hauing receiued the gift: if a man be called to the maried estate, he must not presume beyond his strength, to liue vnmaried. Wherefore it is both Counsel &amp; a precept, to those that haue receiued the gift of single life: for otherwise they disobey Gods calling, which is sinne. And our Sauiour sayth, he that is able to receiue it, let him receiue it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.12. He that hath the gift, is commanded to vse it, for in leesing it he sinneth. And lastly, euery man by commandement is bound to the vttermost of his power to set forth Gods glorie: But God is most glorified by the single life of those, which are able to conteine, and therefore they ought in duetie so to doe.</p>

He that loueth God aboue all things, although he loue him not so entirely, as perhaps he may, neither doth all things for his sake, that lie in his power, yet for al this, he esteemeth of God as his chief good: I pray you see what contradictorie speeches these be: The Iesuit sayth, a man may loue God perfectly and aboue all, and yet not loue him so much as he is able, that is, imperfectly: so a man, by his Monkish diuinitie, may loue God aboue all, and yet not loue him aboue all: for if he did, he would refuse to do nothing for Gods loue that is in his power.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. As though the argument followeth not strongly: you cannot doe the lesse, that is, keepe my commandements, therefore you cannot doe the more, that is, speaking now (as the Iesuite doth) the Counsels of perfection, which are more then the precepts: It is a precept of necessitie to dispense our goods to the vse of the poore, it is a counsell of perfection, as they say, to giue all away to the poore: But if a man cannot performe the first, that is, keeping his goods to vse them aright, much lesse is hee able with a resolute minde to giue them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he answereth: Christ biddeth them to say so, as shewing their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, not that they were indeede vprofitable seruants. A poore shift, as though Christ enuied the good of his seruants, or would obscure their wel-doing, and doth not rather aduance it to the vttermost, and make the most of the seruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able workes of his children, as wee see, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. And Christ being a faithfull Prophet, would not surely deceiue his Disciples, and tell theme one
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20636:128"/>
thing, and himselfe knowe and thinke another. But these Frierlike mists and smoake of Locusts, is not able to dimme the cleere light of this scripture, which sheweth, that when we haue done all wee can doe, wee come farre short of our duetie.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Augustine,</hi> though sometime he seeme to make some difference betweene a precept and a Counsel: <hi>Praeceptum est,</hi> saith he, <hi>cui non obedire, peccatum est: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium, quo si vti nolueris, minus boni adipisceris, non mali aliquid perpetrabis. De virginit. cap.</hi> 15. A precept is that, which not to obey, is sinne: A Counsel is that, which if thou wilt not followe, thou doest not commit any euill, yet thou hast the lesse good. Though he seeme in words, I say, to make difference, yet his meaning is this, That a precept is of things necessarie, as to followe vertue, to eschue vice: A Counsel is of things indifferent, as to vse or not to vse, as to eate or not to eate flesh: But yet the occasion may so serue, that euen this counsel is necessarie: for we ought not to eate flesh to offend our brother. <hi>Multa facienda sunt non iubente lege, sed libera charitate:</hi> Many things are to be done (sayth he) not by force of any lawe, but by the rule of charitie: that is, we haue no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar law, but the generall rule of charitie. A Counsel then is seene in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which are alwaies lawfull, but not alway expedient: and it is nothing els but a particular application of the generall rule of charitie: Charitie wisheth that nothing should be done to offend our brethen, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. The scripture likewise giueth libertie to eate flesh, there is no generall precept or prohibitione yet the Apostle giueth counsel, that is, according to the rule of charitie sayth, that although all things are cleane: <hi>Malum tamen est homini, qui per offensionem manducat:</hi> yet it is euill to the man that eateth with offence, <hi>Roman.</hi> 14.20. Here we see the transgression of an Apostolicall Counsel is sinne: And though we be not bound by any particular precept, at this time or that to abstaine from flesh, yet, <hi>qua facienda sunt libera charitate,</hi> the things that are to be done in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of loue, doe as well binde vs, as if we had a direct commandement: for loue is the fulfilling of the commandements, yea it is one of the great commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to loue one another. Yet the counsel or libertie concerning indifferent things, remaineth in it owne nature free still: as the Apostle counselleth to eate, not asking any question: in such a case it is neither euill not to eate, nor good to eate: but if any man be present that may take offence by our eating, then is it euill to eate. So <hi>Augustine</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth: <hi>Multa mihi videntur licere &amp; non expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire, quae per iustitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quae coram deo est, permittuntur, sed propter offensione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vitanda sunt.</hi> Many things are lawful, but not expedient, lawful before God, but not expedient because of the offence of our brethen. <hi>De adulter. coniug. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.17. Thus we see <hi>Augustine</hi> doth nothing fauour the popish distinction of precepts and counsels: for by his sentence, euen Counsels, that is, the libertie and freedome of things indifferent, are restrained, and made necessarie in the externall vse, by the rule of charitie.</p>

                        <p>Ans. First: We denie not but that the Iewes had voluntarie vowes, and might binde themselues by vow to performe many things, which being not vowed, it was no sinne to leaue vndone: As the <hi>Nazarites</hi> vowes concerning abstinence from wine and strong drinke: which things other might lawfully vse without sinne, if they were not professed <hi>Nazarites.</hi> But these ceremoniall lawes doe nothing appertaine to Christians.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it may also be vnderstood of necessarie vowes, which we are bound vnto of duetie, and then the sense is this: If you abstaine from vowing ye sinne not, that is, not so hainously as after the vowe made; as Pagans and Infidels doe sinne in transgressing Gods law: but a Christian sinneth more after publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and promise made of obedience vnto Gods commandements.</p>

                        <p>WE hold that to vow is not a thing simply forbidden Christians: but our vowes are limited and restrained: for they are either such, as directly or immediatly are referred to the worship of God, whereby wee binde our selues more straightly to serue him: and such vowes are onely of such things as are commanded and necessarily to be done: and in this sense there is but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vow of all Christians, and that is our solemne promise made in baptisme, which the Papists denie properly to be a vow, <hi>Bellarmin, cap</hi> 19. There is another kind of vowes, that directly concerneth not the worship of God, which may be of things not commanded, of the which we will entreate in the next section. Now wee are to proue, that Baptisme is the onely proper vow of Christians, which directly toucheth the seruice and worship of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Circumcision was a generall vow of the Iewes, for thereby they bound themselues to keepe the whole law, <hi>Galath.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Baptisme is the vowe of Christians, which commeth in the place of circumcision. And againe, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20636:130"/>
by this, that because Christians transgressing, doe deserue greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then Iewes or Gentiles, that they are more straightly obliged and bound by their couenant vnto God then the other: and not onely, as the Iesuite sayth, because they haue tasted more of the goodnesse of God, and so are more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull: for there are two parts of the couenant betweene God and vs: The Lord sayth, Thou art my people, and so enricheth them with knowledge, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good thing: The people say, Thou art my God, <hi>Hosh.</hi> 2.23. And thus as the Lord doth couenant with them, so they doe binde themselues vnto God: The breach of which couenant, is that which stirreth vp principally the anger of God against vs.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Iacob</hi> vowed to pay tithes, <hi>Genes.</hi> 28. <hi>Dauid</hi> to build a temple vnto God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131.2. But neither of these two were commanded them, and yet they were properly referred to the seruice of God.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, we denye not, as we haue sayd, but that in the law and before there might be such voluntarie vowes, yet it followeth not, that there should bee any such now. Secondly, both those dueties were necessarie, and commanded in generall, though not in particular. As first, <hi>Iacobs</hi> vow was that the Lord should be his God, vers. 21. No man can denye, but this was necessarie, and a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: Then seeing the Lord is his God, it is also necessarie that he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him by some externall worship, as by appointing the Lord an house in that place, and bringing oblations vnto his altars: these are but particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that doe followe that generall commandement.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Dauid</hi> did vow that, he was bound to doe being King of <hi>Israel,</hi> namely, to haue a care of the temple of God: for thus he sayth to <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, I dwell in an house of Cedar trees: but the Arke of God remaineth within the curtaines, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2. This belonged to the King of duetie, as it was generally commanded all <hi>Israel, Hagg.</hi> 1.4. but that <hi>Dauid</hi> was discharged of this care, by the especiall warrant of God by the Prophet.</p>

But these things of themselues, by the outward act, are not the more acceptable vnto God, neither is God by eating or not eating, or looking or not looking, the better worshipped, as these things are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in themselues.

                        <p>Answer. First you cannot shew, that your monkish Abbots haue such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer their Monkes, as the father hath ouer his children: for <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. and in many other places, children are commanded to be obedient to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: But they haue neither authoritie nor calling out of the word.

                        <p>Ans. This is meant onely of those that haue the gift of continencie, who, if they be sure they haue receiued it, may vow and purpose single life: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such assurance no man can vow continencie lawfully.

                        </p>
                        <p>Answer: First, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not here of widowes alreadie chosen, but to be chosen: hee would haue younger widdowes to bee chosen, because they woulde waxe wanton, and marrie: and therefore it is not like, that by the first fayth heere is meant the vowe of chastitie, seeing there is no cause that these younger widdowes shoulde make any vowe, beeing excluded by the Apostle from Church seruices. Secondly, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe Counselleth the younger widdowes to marrie, therefore it is not like they were votaries. Thirdly, by the first fayth is vnderstood the Christian fayth, which the younger widowes waxing wanton, and lasciuious, nor carying to match with Infidels, were in danger to breake, as the Apostle telleth them of some that had done so already, and were turned backe after Sathan. Fourthly, we say not that the fayth of baptisme is broken by all mariage, but with ioyning with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Fiftly, it appeareth what breach of faith <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, when he sayth, They waxe wanton, and idle, and are busie-bodies, goe from house to house, and speake things vncomely, <hi>verse</hi> 13.

                        <p>OVr sentence then appeareth to be this: that the vow of continencie cannot lawfully be made of all, neither is indifferently to be required of them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all are not indued with that gift, <hi>Fulk.

                           <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Answer. First, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth men to marrie, not for euery temptation of lust, but when they are ready to fall into externall workes of vncleannes, as into fornication: and therefore hee sayth, For auoyding of fornication let euery one haue his wife: For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> felt the pricke of the flesh, that is, the lust of concupiscence, and was buffeted of it, yet maried not for all that <hi>cap.</hi> 30. <hi>Rhemist. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, we say not that for euery light temptation, which by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting may be ouercome, in those that haue the gift of continencie, a man is to desire mariage, but when he is continually enflamed with lust, so that the will doth consent: though he be not yet so ouercome, that he fall in outward
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:20636:133"/>
vncleannes: and this is the Apostles meaning, when hee sayth, It is better to marrie then to burne, that is, with inward lust when his minde is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted: And such a man as doth burne with secret concupiscence, still wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with that fire, and not being able to quench it, if he refuse to vse the lawfull remedie of mariage, is in danger also to fall into outward fornication.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Concerning <hi>Pauls</hi> example: First, the place is not so to be vnderstoode of the lust of concupiscence: for it is not like, that the Apostle being kept vnder, with hunger, colde, imprisonment, should bee so greatly tempted that way. But either it may be vnderstood of the particular temptation to pride and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie, as he him selfe expoundeth it, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. lest I should be exalted out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure through the abundance of reuelations: Or else generally Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth by flesh, the whole masse of corruption and whatsoeuer was in him that resisted the spirite: In this sense he crieth out, <hi>Roman.</hi> 7. Who shall deliuer me from this body of death! <hi>Caluin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Though we yeeld that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was tempted of his concupiscence, yet he ouercame and subdued it, obtayning from God, after some striuing, grace and power to quench the secret fire: And so we denie not, but that men ought by fasting and prayer to labour for that precious gift. But if they feele the fire to burne within them still, then are they to vse the remedie prescribed by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, to marrie.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, sayth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth libertie of mariage onely to those which were free and had not vowed continencie, <hi>cap.</hi> 31.</p>
                        <p>Answere: First, the Apostles words are generall: Let euery man haue his wife: I, say the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> he speaketh of those that were maried before their conuersion, that they might still vse and keepe their wiues. Yea but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of all vnmaried, in the verse next before, It is good not to touch a woman: I trow he meaneth not, it is good for a man that is maried not to touch his wife. Secondly, it is a generall libertie, which he granteth to all, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. If they cannot conteine, let them marry: but many votaries cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, as it may appeare by the vnchast liues of your Monkish rabble: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing the disease, they may vse the remedie, that is, marrie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Virginitie, and continent life is onely to be required of those which haue the gift of continencie: But all haue not that gift: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the vow of Virginitie is not indifferently to be made by any. That the gift of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie cannot be had or obtayned of all, neither resteth in our free wil, it is plaine by scripture.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Math.</hi> 19.12. He that is able to receiue this gift, let him receiue it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> all are notable to receiue it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> First, though they are not able to receiue it yet, yet they may if they will, and aske for it by prayer: for the text is, Some haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues chaste for the kingdome of God: whereby it appeareth that it is in the will of man, <hi>cap.</hi> 31. Answer. Hee speaketh cleane contrary to the text: for Christ sayth, None receiue it but to whom it is giuen, and the wordes are,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:20636:134"/>
                           <hi>qui capere potest,</hi> not, <hi>qui velit,</hi> hee that can receiue, not hee that will receiue. And they are sayd to make themselues chaste, not because it is in their owne choyce, but being enabled of God, and hauing receiued power ouer their will, they are sayd to make themselues chaste, hauing receiued power by the spirit of God: So our Sauiour sayth, Come vnto me all ye that are laden, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. &amp; yet no man commeth to Christ, but his father first draweth him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44. Wherefore it being a peculiar gift of God, all cannot haue it, neither are sure to obtaine it, though they aske it by prayer, because wee haue no promise to bee heard.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rhemist.</hi> When a man is bound to abstaine by vow, or other necessarie occasion, as imprisonment, banishment, sicknes, no doubt, if he labour for the gifte of continencie, he may haue it. Ans. They that binde themselues to a rash vowe, haue no promise to be heard praying for continencie. Secondly, they that are driuen vnto any such necessitie as you speak of, which they are not a cause of themselues, neither can auoide, as in long and perpetual sicknes, it is certaine that God will giue the gift being sought by lawful meanes: But as for banishment and imprisonment, they are not of such necessitie, but that the husband is bound to follow the wife, and the wife her husband, <hi>Fulk.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6.</p>
                        <p>Neither are many of those meanes commendable, which were vsed in Monkerie: for some of them were superstitious and vnlawfull, as they vsed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and medicine to correct or slake, and extinguish nature in them: <hi>Francis</hi> was wont to couer his bodie with yce and snow, others did whip themselues: This was not to subdue and tame the bodie, but to destroy and kill the bodie, and make it vnfit for other dueties. The scripture prescribeth no other meanes but prayer and fasting, and labour in our vocation. Some of them againe vsed externall exercise of their bodie, as by fasting, by lying harde, by watching, which in themselues were not amisse: but they leaue the chiefe and principall, which is the spirituall meanes: for the outward ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rcise of the flesh without this, is little worth, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.23.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> To beleeue is no lesse the gift of God, then to liue chaste, yet we exhorte all men to beleeue, and they doe vowe and promise it in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: why may they not as well vowe continencie, although it be a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar gift? <hi>cap.</hi> 31.</p>
                        <p>Ans. They are both indeed the giftes of God, but one is necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, namely, to beleeue, and is promised to all that will seeke for it: But the other gift is not necessary, neither hath any such promise.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth this a proper gift: But if all men were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, how could it be called a proper gift? One after this manner, another after that, sayth the Apostle. But if euery man might attaine to that one gift of continencie, they should not all haue their proper gift, but all one gifte, and after the same manner. And though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> should meane, that to liue chastely in wedlock be also a proper gift of God, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vrgeth, and we denie not: yet it remaineth still, that the other is a more singular and proper
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:20636:134"/>
gift, and is not therefore commonly, and indifferently bestowed vpon all.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, that a man may marrie his Virgin if neede so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.37. But if euery one, labouring for the gift of continencie, might obtayne it, there should then be no necessitie of mariage: which the Apostle here affirmeth.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the <hi>Rhemists</hi> say, that the marriage of those that haue vowed, is the worst sorte of incontinencie and fornication, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> saith cleane contrarie: <hi>Non ipsae nuptiae talium damnandae iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur, sed damnatur propositi fraus, damnatur fracta votifides: postremò dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur tales, non quia coniugalem fidem posterius inierunt, sed quia continentiaa primam fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> irritam fecerunt: de bono viduitat. cap.</hi> 9. The mariages of such are not condemned, but the violating of their vow is condemned, not because they afterward entred into the league of mariage, but because they did break the first fayth of continencie: <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth not, that such mariages are no mariages, but plaine adultery &amp; fornication: But maketh the mariage lawful, &amp; reproueth their rashnes before in making, and their vnstedfastnes nowe in breaking their vowes.</p>

Secondly, as though the wals of Monasteries were able to keepe in Virginitie: no, it is notoriously knowne, that vnchast life hath scaled the wals of Nunneries, crept in at windowes, and found muses in the ground.</p>

First the Apostle saith directly: they should but separate themselues for a time. Secondly, we doe thus reason out of his wordes: there is no cause of separation, but to be giuen to fasting and prayer: but this may be done by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for a time: neither is it necessary we should alwaies be giuen to fasting and prayer, but vpon speciall occasion: therefore perpetuall separation is not needfull. 3. They that are long separated, are subiect to fall into tentation: the same cause therefore that moued them first to marrie, for auoiding of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, ought to moue them to come together againe: Therefore it is not good nor lawful they should separat them selues for euer.</p>

                           <hi>Augustine</hi> Thus writeth, <hi>Non licet excepta causa fornicationis coniugem a coniuge dirimi, nec sterilem coniugem fas est relinquere, vt faecunda ducatur, de nupt. &amp; concupiscen. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. It is not lawfull for married couples, one to be separat fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, vnlesse it be for fornication: nor to leaue a barren wyfe to marrie a frutefull. Therefore if fornication onely be a iust cause of finall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, there can be no other: If there were any other, it is most like it should be for procreation of children: But neither for that cause is a man to leaue his wife, Ergo for no other. Therefore, not for any vow of continencie is marriage to be dissolued, or any separation to be admitted. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> saith, that by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, Marriage is not dissolued.

                        <p>Answ. First, a single life is not alwayes the perfecter state, nor to all, as it is not to them that haue not the gift to containe, as it is most like hee hath not, that is contracted, and hath made promise of mariage: for then all this needed not. Secondly, though there be none of those impediments named, yet there is a greater: namely, their fayth &amp; promise made each to other before God, which they ought not to violate. Thirdly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, If thou be bound to a wife, seeke not to be loosed, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.27.

                        <p n="1">1 Our reason is, because it is perfect mariage already in substance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, which is ratified by contract onely and solemne vowe and couenant made each to other: And being thus betrothed, the one giueth power of their body to the other, and now they are no more free. That this mariage is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before God, and in substance, it appeareth by the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> by the which a man defiling a mayd betrothed, was to suffer death, as well, as if hee had committed vncleannes with a woman already maried. <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 22. <hi>verse</hi> 22.23.

                        <p>THat the solitarie life of Eremites, in flying the comfortable societie of men, and their rigorous manner in the vnnatural chastising of their bodies, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the rule of the Gospell, thus we shew it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.25. Let vs consider one another, and prouoke one another to good workes, not forsaking the assemblies of our selues together, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of some is, but exhorting one another: here the Apostle speaketh manifestly against those that shunne the societie and companie of their brethren, because they must needes fayle in the dueties of charitie, as in exhorting one another, and prouoking to good works: these dueties Eremites can not performe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their life is vnlawfull: and <hi>Math.</hi> 24, it is a note of false prophets and false Christs to liue in the desarts. Againe, they that loue solitarie places, doe offer themselues to tentation, and fall into the snares of the diuel: God saw it was not good for <hi>Adam,</hi> no not in Paradise, to liue alone: but I think their desarts are farre vnlike to Paradise: Christ to be tempted of the diuell was lead into the Wildernes: Therfore such places are fit for Sathans working. The preacher sayth, Two are better then one, for if one ouercome him, two shal stand against him, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.12. We are better able being ayded by our brethren to resist Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than then being alone: We ought not then to tempt God, and not knowing our own strength, to goe forth into solitarie places, and as it were prouoke Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than to the Combat.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That cruel and inhumane kind of chastising their bodies by fasting &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discipline vtterly is vnlawful. The Monks called <hi>Grandimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenses,</hi> did weare shirts of maile next their bodies, the Charter Monkes, haire-cloth: the Monks <hi>Flagellants</hi> went bare-foote in linnen shirts, leauing an open place in the backe where they did daylie whip themselues before the people, till the blood follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. <hi>Moses</hi> a certaine Abbot did so afflict his bodie with fasting and watching, that for 2. or 3. daies together many times he had no appetite at all to his meat, neither could sleepe. An other Eremite (as <hi>Cassianus</hi> writeth) did purpose with himselfe not to eate meate, vnlesse he had some guest or stranger with him, and so was constrayned to abstaine somtime fiue dayes together: two other Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall brethren, trauayling in the desart of <hi>Thebaide,</hi> did vow not to take any sustenance, but such as God should send them: and as they went, a certaine wilde people,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 154.</note> contrarie to their custome, offered them meat, the one tooke it as sent of God, the other refused it, because he thought it to be sent rather of man then of God, and so died.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Basilius magnus,</hi> and <hi>Gregor. Nazianzene,</hi> did so pluck downe themselues by immoderate fasting, that when they were called to bee Bishops they were not able to sustaine the labour thereof.</p>
                        <p>Where in all the scriptures learned these men, thus to punish their bodies? this is not with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to subdue and bring vnder the flesh: but to kill and destroy it: contrary to that saying of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

Our <hi>Rhem.</hi> vse the same reason for shauen crowns, that it is a note of distinction between the Clergie and lay-men, <hi>annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. And for priestlike garnents, they alleadge out of <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 13. how Christ appeared to <hi>Iohn</hi> vested in a priestlike garment.</p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. We deny not, but that it is conuenient for Ministers to be discerned from others euen in their apparel: which may be done by the grauity &amp; mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie therof in colour, in plainnes, not necessary to bring in strange and ridiculous fashions of attire, such as Monks coules are: yet Ministers are better discerned by other things, then their apparel, as they are described by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. But as for any such distinction of monks we allow not: for the very calling it selfe ought to be abolished. As for shauen crownes and beards, they are but tokens of <hi>Baals</hi> priests, make the best of them you can.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Christ appeared in a long garment down to the feete: which they translate a priestlike garment, as though Christ were then going to Masse: The word is, <hi>podéres,</hi> which signifieth a long vesture, downe to the feete, which was one of the high priests garments, and hereby is signified the priesthood of Christ: but what is this to the attire of Monks or priests? We denie not but long garments for their comlines are fit for Ministers, according to the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the countrie, but not as necessarie, representing more holinesse: for in the <hi>East</hi> countreyes, short garments were graue and comely enough: as the prophets had their mantles: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention of his cloke. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.</p>

                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>WE condemne both the habite and shauing of the Monkes as superstitious, euen as their whole life and profession is.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:20636:139"/>1 There is no one precept in the new testament concerning formes and fashions of apparell to be vsed by Clergie men, but onely in generall termes, that they should be modest and sober, and graue in their behauiour, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. The Leuites and priests indeede in the law, had rules and precepts set them both for their vestures in the temple, and their ordinary apparell, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.39. that it should be made with fringes in remembrance of the commandements. But who seeth not that such significations of apparel were Leuitical, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremonious? such is the habite of Monkes: for their coules, sayth the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, signifie their innocencie, like vnto children that are couered with vailes like vnto coules. But to place any religion or holines in apparell, as they did, (for it was thought a great priuiledge to be buried in a Monks coule) is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable superstition: for such Monkish superstition our Sauiour rebuked the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.5. All their works they do, to be seene of men: for they make their Phylacteries broad, and make long the fringes of their garments. If the Pharisies did abuse to vain-glorie and superstition, that kinde of apparell which the law commaunded: there can be no good vse of Monkish habites, which the Gospel neither commendeth nor commandeth.</p>
                        <p>As for shauen crownes: they were directly forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> not only to round the tufts of their beard, as the Gentiles did, <hi>Leu.</hi> 19.27. but not to shaue their beard, or make bald their head, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 21.5. And then it was a signe of holines not to cut the haire, as in the <hi>Nazarites</hi> it appeareth, <hi>Num.</hi> 6. It was then the custom of the heathen and of their Idolatrous priestes to shaue themselues: How then dare the papists make that a signe of holines now, which was a signe of prophanenes, and heathennes then? And is their religion so beggarly, that they must needs borrow their ceremonies of the heathen?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The great variety of their habits, &amp; foolish significations of their shauings, doe shew what beginning they had. The Monks of <hi>Basiles</hi> order went in white, of <hi>Benets</hi> rule in black, the <hi>Cistercians</hi> had white rotchets vpon a black coate: the <hi>Grandimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenses</hi> a coate of mailes,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 154.</note> with a black cloke vpon. Some starred Monks: some Iesuites, with a white girdle, &amp; a russet coule: some <hi>Celestines</hi> all in blew, both cloke, coule and cap. The <hi>Franciscanes</hi> did weare ropes for girdles &amp; treen shooes.</p>
                        <p>They render also diuers reasons of their shauen crownes: some say, it resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth Christs crowne of thornes: some by shauing the haire, do signifie the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiyng of the affections, as cutting of things that are superfluous: some by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the head, the simplicitie and plainnes of life. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> saith, it is a signe of repentance and conuersion. Is not here good stuffe, thinke you? Such rites, such ceremonies, such significations, such humane traditions, I think the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies would haue abhorred. For these are worse then their washing of tables, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen vessels, pots, cups, and such like: And yet our Sauiour saith of them, that they did lay the commandement of God apart, to establish their owne traditions, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.8.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, let <hi>August.</hi> speak: Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the habite of ecclesiastical persons, thus

De salutar. docum. cap.</hi> 8. The heauenly palace is as well open for Lay men, keeping the commandements of God, as for Priests in their holy attire. What profiteth it then, I pray you, to be buried in a Monkes coule? Againe, <hi>Augustine</hi> found fault with certaine dissolute Monkes in that time, that suffered their haire to growe long: Against whom he vrgeth the saying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.14. Doth not nature it selfe teach you, that it is a shame for a man to haue long haire? And so he concludeth: <hi>Hoc quò perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, quaeso, tam apertè contra Apostoli praecepta comari?</hi> What meaning haue you in this, to suffer your haire to growe, contrary to the precept of the Apostle? But this precept did no more belong to Monkes, then all other Christians. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the shauing of Monkes, <hi>Augustine</hi> hath not one word at all, but of polling, and clipping the haire: he speaketh onely against certaine <hi>crinitos fratres,</hi> that nourished their haire and suffered it to grow of length.</p>
                        <p>Nay, our <hi>Rhemists</hi> loue shauing so well, that they defend the shauing of Nunnes, and would proue it out of <hi>Hierome,</hi> who indeede speaketh of the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their haire, not for any religion, but to auoyd certaine little beasts that bred betweene the skinne and the haire, (you knowe what beasts they are) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they vsed not the bathes, nor oyle, as other women did, <hi>Fulk.</hi> 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 2.

                        <p>THe 3.6.9. houres, they say, are consecrated and deuoted to praier, which they call their Canonical houres: at the 3. houre the holy Ghost descended: at <label type="milestone">

                        <p>Ans. First, we denye that it can be gathered by any of those places, that these houres onely ought to be set apart for prayer. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> went vp at the 9. houre, which was the time of the euening sacrifice, when the religious Iewes went vp to pray. Secondly, <hi>Daniel</hi> praied three times a day, but at what houres the text speaketh not: yet by this example, and by the other proofes alleadged, we doe gather, that at the 3.6.9. houre, that is not precisely at any of these times, but in the morning, when men rise vp to their labours, at noone before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, and at night when they goe to rest, it is meete and conuenient that men should make their praiers vnto God, and at other times also when they finde themselues fit. Thirdly, the popish seruice hath nothing but the names of these
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:20636:140"/>
houres: for they are all finished in the forenoone, they haue their <hi>Nocturnes</hi> at midnight, their <hi>Prime</hi> early in the morning, whereas the sixt houre is at high noone, the ninth houre is the third houre before the Sunnes set, <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi>
                        </p>

                     <div type="Protestant_doctrine">
                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>WE denye not but that set times of publike prayer are commendable, as we haue our forenoone, and afternoone seruice: But at vnseasonable houres, as at midnight, or the rising of the Sunne, to call the people together, when they cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently be assembled, is but a superstitious custome. Again, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for men in the morning, noone, euening, though not precisely at any set houres, to direct their prayers vnto God: but so to stint mens prayers, as that they ought of necessitie to keepe their houres, as though their prayers were then more auaileable, it hath no ground out of scripture.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Pray continually, 1. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is lawfull to pray at all times, and one time as fit for prayer as another, if a man be prepared. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, the same Apostle saith: I will that the men euery where lift vp pure hands without wrath and doubting, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.8. Out of these words we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two arguments: First, prayers are no more bound to times, then to places: a man may pray euery where, <hi>Ergo,</hi> at euery time. Secondly, a man ought not to pray but when he is voyd of wrath, and is otherwise prepared: but it may be that at the stinted houres, of the 3.6.9. a man may bee in wrath, and otherwise not fit, therefore he is not necessarily to be tyed to those houres.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Augustine</hi> thus writeth: <hi>Cum quisque orationem quaerit, collocat membra si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut ei occurrerit. Cum autem non quaeritur, sed infertur appetitus orandi: hoc est, cum repente aliquid venit in mentem, quocum<expan>

When any man desireth to pray, let him dispose his bodie as he thinketh best: But when as it commeth not of his desire and seeking, but suddenly his affection is stirred vp to pray, howsoeuer prayer findeth him (that is, whether standing or sitting) he must not in any case deferre it and put it off to another time. This then is <hi>Augustines</hi> minde, that a man should pray so oft as he hath a disposition thereunto, and not deferre his prayer, as they doe, which bind themselues to Canonicall houres.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. First, we grant that Ministers of the Gospell labouring in the word and Sacraments, ought to be maintained by the Gospell: But such are fewe or none of your Monkes, who being fit for no other seruice either in the Church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, are thrust into Monasteries by their friends: they are idolatrous Priests, and serue little better then at <hi>Baals</hi> altar.

Martyr,</hi> by whom the Church of God hath receiued much good: but they must come first out of your Dennes, and relinquish their Monkish life, and labour amongst the people: so shal they be no more regular, but secular priests, as you terme them. Secondly, the lands which were bestowed vpon them, were first giuen vpon an euill intent, that by their prayers they should redeeme the soules of their founders, who most of them had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted some notable sinne, &amp; so <hi>pro remedio animaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to helpe their soules, they built Monasteries: So King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelstane</hi> for killing his brother <hi>Edwin,</hi> built two Monasteries, <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Michelney</hi> for his soule, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 152.

Those lands therefore being giuen first for vngodly purposes, and continued by them for idolatrous vses, ought cleane to bee taken from them, and to be bestowed vpon better vses, neither is it lawfull for them in that sort to enioy them.</p>

First, I pray you where euer did you reade that Christ went a begging? he liued not of almes, but gaue almes, and <hi>Iudas</hi> was the almesman, though he playd his part but euill. <hi>Augustine</hi> flatly denyeth that you auouch: He saith that Christs bagge was as <hi>Fiscus regis,</hi> euen as the Kings Exchequer: and that what was giuen him, was as due as tribute money to the Prince: But the King, I trow, is not a begger. <hi>Nisi putetis,</hi> (sayth he) <hi>quia dominus petebat &amp; indigebat, cui seruiebant angeli, qui de quinque panibus tot millia pauit.</hi> Vnlesse you thinke (sayth he) that Christ begged, and wanted, whom the Angels serued, and who fed with fiue loaues not a fewe thousands, <hi>in Psal.</hi> 146. Secondly, if the Apostles were beggers, then they liued of almes, but that is vntrue: for Christ saith, The labourer is worthie of his hire: but the labourers wages is earned and deserued, it is no almes.</p>

                        <p>FIrst we say, that no idle persons ought to be maintained in a Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, but they that haue not any other necessary calling, should labour
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:20636:141"/>
with their hands, and therefore Monkes that are fit for no other seruice in the Church, ought to labour and worke.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth a general rule: He that will not worke, let him not eate, 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 3.10. speaking of those that haue no necessarie calling in the Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Monkes must worke, or els by S. <hi>Paules</hi> rule, not eate. The <hi>Rhemists</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that this is but a naturall admonition or counsel. Nay, it is a precept and commandement, that all in their seuerall places and callings should labour, none liue idlely: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith not, this I counselled you, but this I warned you of, or denounced vnto you, and he calleth those that followed not this rule, inordinate walkers.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Againe, if you will needes haue Monks, let them be as they were in times past: for then they were lay men and laboured with their hands, till <hi>anno.</hi> 606. when <hi>Boniface</hi> made a decree that Monkes might vse the office of preaching and Christening: but before that, Monks were forbidden by the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> not to entermeddle with matters Ecclesiasticall, <hi>Fox. pag.</hi> 154. But perhaps they will say, as they doe, that some of them work, as their Nunnes: And I pray you, why not their Monkes too? I thinke their great bellies hinder them. Neither are their Monkes altogether idle; for some of them in painting, caruing, grauing, and garnishing their Idols, are very cunning. But, according to the saying, they might better be idle then ill occupied, and as good neuer a whit, as neuer the better.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Neither is it to be permitted, that Friers should get their liuing by begging: for what are they els but valiant beggers? First, there ought to be no beggers in the common-wealth: as <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 15. Though the Lord say, that they should neuer be without poore or beggers, which should want their helpe, vers. 11. Yet vers. 5. this charge is giuen, that by them, that is, their default, there should not be a begger in <hi>Israel:</hi> they should so prouide for the poore, that they neede not go a begging. There are also positiue lawes, to restraine the number of beggers, and therefore there is no reason, that by a number of idle vagrant persons, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li-god Friers, that begging order should be enlarged. Secondly, but seeing it can not bee chosen, but there must needes be some beggers: they ought not to bee young sturdie lubbers, that are able to worke, as most of the Friers were, but such as are described, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.21. where the King saith to his seruants, Goe out quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and bring hither the poore, the maimed, the halt, the blinde: <hi>Ergo,</hi> such lusty fellowes ought to liue by the sweate of their browes, not to eate vp the bread of the poore. Lastly, in the sermons, <hi>Ad fratres in eremo,</hi> which are ascribed to <hi>Augustine,</hi> thus we reade: <hi>Eia fratres mei, semper boni aliquid facite, quem tadet orare,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Serm. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>vel psallere non desistat, quem taedet orare, vel psallere, manibus laborare non desistat.</hi> My brethren, alwaies bee ye doing of some good; if you bee wearie of praying, sing, if of singing, then labour with your hands. And in the same place, old men onely of 80. yeere old are exempted from working. And in another place <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth, that the Monkes in his time did so plye their worke, <hi>Vsque adeo, vt etiam naues oneratas in ea loca mittant, qua inopes incolunt:</hi> that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:20636:141"/>
they sent shippes laden with necessaries, vnto those places where the poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited. <hi>De morib. eccles. cap.</hi> 32. <hi>Ergo,</hi> in <hi>Augustines</hi> time Monkes liued not by begging, but with labour of their hands.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. First, the obedience here required we acknowledge, that it ought to be yeelded by Kings &amp; Emperours to those that haue the ouersight of their soules: for the Prince is bound to receiue and beleeue all true doctrine which is taught by the Pastors and Bishops of the Church, agreeable to the word of God, vnder paine of damnation: and the Pastors are bound vnder the like paine to obey the Princes lawes, made according to the word of God. Secondly, wherefore the spirituall obedience of the ciuill Magistrate to the word of God, taught by the Pastors of the Church, is no exemption of them from their ciuill obedience: for euery soule is subiect to the higher powers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Fulk. annot.</hi> 13. <hi>Heb. sect.</hi> 9</p>

                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>THat Ecclesiasticall persons are subiect to temporall gouernours, and are to be iudged by their lawes, the scriptures speake plainly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Bishops, yea the Pope himselfe, if he haue a soule. The like sayth S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1.2.13. Submit your selues to all manner ordinance. <hi>Salomon</hi> remoued <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Priesthood, and put in <hi>Sadock. Paul</hi> appealed, and submitted himselfe to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Againe, if Priests offend and commit any grieuous sinne, as of murther, theft, who shall punish them? The ciuill Magistrate onely beareth the sword: They
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20636:142"/>
must either grant, that priests are no euill doers, which were to too grosse: or if they be, that they are vnder the ciuill Magistrates power: for he is the Minister of God to take vengeance vpon euery euill doer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Augustines</hi> time, the controuersies betweene the Catholike and Donatist Bishops, were committed to the iudgement of the Emperour. <hi>Ait quidam,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Epistol. 162</note> saith he, <hi>Non debuit Episcopus proconsulari iudicio purgari: Quasi verò ipse sibi hoc com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parauerit, ac non Imperator ita quaeri iusserat, ad cuius curam, de qua rationem deo red liturus est res illa maximè pertinebat.</hi> But, saith one, a Bishop ought not to haue been purged before the Proconsul, or ciuill Magistrate: As though (sayth <hi>Augustine</hi>) the Proconsul did of himselfe intermeddle in this matter, and was not commanded rather of the Emperour so to doe: vnto whose charge that matter principally appertained, and whereof he shall make account vnto God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by his sentence, the cause of the Bishop principally was to be iudged by the Emperour.</p>

                        <p>Ans.

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. First, the authoritie of ciuill Magistrates doth not giue any thing to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Ministers, which appertaineth to their office, as to ordaine, preach, baptize, neither is the Prince to deale in these offices: yet may the ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates command them to execute their charge and dueties according to the word of God. Wherefore it followeth not, Princes cannot execute the pastoral dueties themselues: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ought not to see them executed. <hi>Dauid, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Iehosophat, Ezechia,</hi> commanded the Priests to execute their office accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law of God, though it was not lawfull for them, neither did they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any thing proper to the Priests office in their owne persons; neither doth any Christian Prince challenge any such right in Ecclesiasticall functions: wherefore it is an impudent slander of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which he giueth forth of our Queene, <hi>Iam re ipsa Caluinistis in Anglia mulier quaedam summus pontifex.</hi> And now (sayth he) in England the Caluinists haue a certaine woman for their chiefe Bishop. <hi>De notis eccles. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It doth not followe, that the Prince might as well execute Ecclesiasticall offices, as he may ciuill in his owne person, if he haue authoritie ouer both: No
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:20636:143"/>
more then it followeth, that because Ecclesiasticall persons doe teach both ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magistrates and Church officers their dueties, and may in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons execute the one, that is, spirituall duties, that they may as well intermeddle in the other: But these two offices of Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall gouernment are distinguished, and must not be confounded. The Prince, though he haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to command Ecclesiasticall persons, yet being a ciuill Magistrate, is not to deale with the execution of spirituall dueties. Bishops &amp; pastors likewise haue a spiritual charge ouer kings &amp; princes, to shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their duties out of Gods word, yet because they are persons Ecclesiastical, they ought not to meddle with meer Ciuill dueties. The Prince hath the soueraigntie of externall gouernement in all causes &amp; ouer all persons, yet not alike, for Ciuill offices he may both command and execute; Ecclesiasticall duties he commandeth onely: Bishops and pastors haue also a spirituall charge ouer all, prescribing out of Gods word as well the duetie of Magistrates, as of Ministers, but not alike, for the one they may fully execute, so may they not the other. The head in the naturall bodie, resembleth the Prince in the commonwealth, in some sense: the head giueth mouing to the whole bodie and all the parts thereof: but to the principall parts in the head the eyes, tongue, eares, it giueth beside the facultie of mouing, the sense also of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tasting, hearing: So in the common-wealth, by the Princes authoritie all persons are kept in order, and vrged to looke to their charge, both ciuill officers and spirituall, as al the parts of the bodie receiue mouing from the head: But the ciuill officers receiue power and authoritie beside, and their very offices of the King, as the parts in the head, receiue sense from their fountaine: but Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Ministers receiue not their offices from the Prince, or any mortall man, but they haue their calling according to the order of the Church of God.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. For the space of 300. yeeres the Church after Christ had no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian gouernours, but all Heathen and Idoll worshippers, yet then the Church was established, and preuailed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ciuill Magistrates ought not to deale in Ecclesiasticall affayres, <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>

                        <p>Ans. 1.

The heathen Emperours then had the same power, but they knewe not how to vse it: Christian Princes doe succeede them in the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but are better taught by the word of God how to exercise the sword. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we denie not but that in the time of persecution all things necessarie for the spirituall building thereof may be had, without the Magistrate, as a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard may bring forth fruite without an hedge, but it cannot enioy peace, nor be in a perfect estate, in respect of the externall gouernement, but vnder good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, as the Vineyard may soone be spoyled, the wild bore and the beasts of the field may breake in vpon it hauing no hedge. The child being in the womb, though it haue as yet small vse of the head, but is fed by the nauell, which is in

steed of the mouth, hath in it selfe the lineaments and proportion of a humane bodie, yet it wanteth the perfect beautie, till it be borne and come forth, and the head receiue his office: So may the Church haue a being in persecution, and the want of the ciuill head may be otherwise supplied, but it is not beautifull till the head be set vp, and the sword put into the Christian Magistrates hand.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 3. Princes haue no cure nor charge of soules: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not to meddle with Ecclesiasticall lawes, <hi>Rhemist. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. <hi>sect.</hi> 16.</p>
                        <p>Ans.

Therefore Princes also haue directly charge of the soules of their subiects accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their place and calling, by prouiding and making good Ecclesiasticall lawes, and compelling them to the true seruice of God: As the Ecclesiasticall Ministers in another kind, and more properly are said to haue the cure of soules, in feeding and instructing the people, <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi>

                        <p>THe ciuill Magistrate, by the word of God, hath power to make and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Ecclesiasticall lawes, and to establish true religion, and see that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vnder their gouernment doe faithfully execute their charge: To say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Church officers are to deuise lawes concerning religion, and the Prince onely to execute them, is to make the Prince their seruant, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate too much from the princely authoritie: Neither doe we giue vnto the Prince absolute power to make Ecclesiasticall lawes: for first, the Prince is not to prescribe what lawes he listeth to the Church,<note place="margin">Fulk.

Secondly, that it is expedient and meete, according to the commendable custome of this land, that the godly learned of the Clergie should be consulted withall, in establishing of Ecclesiastical ordinances, vnlesse it be in such a corrupt time, when the Church gouernours are enemies to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for then the Prince, not staying vpon their iudgement, ought to reforme religion according to the word of God, as we see it was lawfully and godly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by King <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8. Thirdly, we doe make exception of all such Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall canons and ordinances, the making whereof doth properly belong to the office of Bishops and gouernours of the Church: for our meaning is not, that it is not lawful for Ecclesiastical Ministers, to make Ecclesiastical decrees, which do properly concerne their office, as concerning the censures of the Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, suspension, absoluing, binding, loosing, and such like, which things are incident to their pastorall office: and yet we grant, that the Prince hath euen in these cases an ouerruling hand, to see that none abuse their pastoral office. But that any lawes ought to be made without the authoritie of the prince, which the prince is bound, to execute, we vtterly denie: And so we conclude, that the ciuill Magistrate hath power ouer all persons and in all causes, both temporall and ecclesiasticall, in such manner as we haue sayd.</p>

the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> most blasphemouslie: for there can be no head of the vniuersal bodie but Christ: But for Princes to be called the head, that is, chiefe gouernours of the Churches in their kingdomes, they do abhorre it. Whereupon <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is so saucie as to checke and controule King <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8. because he was called the head of the English Church.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The heathen Emperours were not heads of the Church, being not so much as members thereof: therefore neither Christian Magistrates, which doe suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede them in that authoritie, <hi>Rhemist. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. The argument followeth not: they were no true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church, therefore could not be heads, that is, haue the soueraigntie of the externall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: for wicked kings and princes doe keepe their magistracie &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment still: who though they be not true members of the Catholike Church, yet ought to be obeied as princes. 2. Though the metaphorical name of head agreed not vnto them, yet were they by Gods ordinance appointed to be heads &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of his people &amp; protectors of his Church, &amp; should haue been, if they had not abused their authoritie. 3. Christian princes, though they haue the same authoritie, which they had, yet now exercising the sword according to Gods law, and being Nurses of the Church, may vse and retaine those princely titles in deed, to be called Patrones and defenders of the faith, &amp; head, that is, chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours and protectors of the Church: which by right had been due vnto the other, if they had vsed their authoritie as they should.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Christian princes are members of the Church, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not heads: for if they were heads, how could the Church stand without them, as it did in the time of persecution?</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, as though the head is not a member and part of the bodie, though a principall one: so the Prince is a member of the Church, but a principall and chiefe member, not of the inuisible Church, for so Christ is onely head, but of a particular visible Church. Secondly, we denie not but that the inuisible and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Church may consist without the Magistrate, but a visible, flourishing, and wel-gouerned Church cannot want a head or chiefe gouernour, that is as a wall or hedge vnto it.</p>

                        <p>TO bee head of the vniuersall Church is proper onely to Christ, and in that sense is not communicable to any creature: for he is to his Church, as the head to the naturall bodie, giuing vnto it influence of grace, spirit and life: he is therefore the onely mysticall head of the vniuersal Church: But in another sense the Prince may be said to be the head and chiefe gouernour of his kingdome, &amp; of that particular visible Church, where he is king: We make him neither the mysticall head, which is only Christ, (farre be that blasphemie from vs) nor a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial head, as they make the Pope to be as Christs Vicegerent in the Church; but a politicall head, to keepe and preserue the peace of the Church, and to see
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20636:145"/>
that euery member doe his office and duetie. But this name we confesse is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly giuen to the Prince, neither were we the first inuentors of it: for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists first gaue it to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. And there are other titles which doe sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expresse the office of the Prince, and may bee more safely vsed. If any man thinke it too high a name for any mortall man, and so not to be giuen to any, we will not greatly contend about it: But if any denye it to the Prince, as thereby to abridge her of her power in Ecclesiastical matters, we doe stand stiffely for it; and are bold to affirme, that with much better right is this title attributed to the ciuill Magistrate then it was to the Pope: yea, and that it hath been of old giuen in a modest and sober sense to Kings and Princes, and may with a fauourable exposition be still: and Princes also may receiue this honour and title at their subiects hands, with protestation of their Christian meaning herein.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 This phrase, for the King to be called the head, is not vnusuall in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Saul</hi> is sayd to be the head of the tribes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.43. <hi>Dauid</hi> the head of the nations: <hi>Isay.</hi> 9.15.

                        <p>Ans. <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> taketh away this cauill very sufficiently, we will set one Papist against another. It is all one (sayth he) to call the Prince head of the Church of England, and head of the Realme of England: for if all English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be his subiects, why are they not his subiects, as they are Christians? If the wife or seruant bee subiect to the master or husband being infidels, doth their conuersion, or name of Christians make them lesse subiect,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 1059</note> then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? <hi>Haec ille.</hi> Againe, how farre is this, I pray you, from Anabaptistrie, to say, that subiects, onely as men, not as Christians, are in subiection to Princes? for doth it not followe hereupon, that as Christians they ought to haue no superiour or Magistrate?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It is sufficient for vs, that this title more fitly and properly belongeth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Prince in his owne kingdome, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Pope, for the Pope can in no wise be head of the Church: he is not the mysticall head, neither dare they say so: for Christ onely is the head in that manner: neither can he be the Ministeriall head of the vniuersall Church: for the Catholike Church is a bodie mysticall, &amp; must needes haue a mysticall head: neither is he the politicall head of any particular Church: for no Bishop can be a politicall head: because he that is the head and chiefe must haue a coactiue power, to binde his subiects to obedience: so hath not any Bishop: The Prince onely beareth the sword, and enforceth obedience. Againe, in a farre diuers sense is the Prince called the head, then the Pope was: for first the Pope challenged to be head of the vniuersal Church: but the prince is chiefe only in his owne kingdome. Secondly, the Pope would be an absolute head, to doe all vpon earth that Christ did, yea and more to, to bind and loose at
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:20636:146"/>
his pleasure, to depose Kings, to dispense with the word of God, to constitute and make lawes at his pleasure: in so much that one of his clawback flatterers is not ashamed to say of him, <hi>Christus &amp; Papa vnum faciunt consistorium, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto peccato potest Papa, quasi omnia facere, quae potest Deus:</hi> Christ and the Pope make but one Consistorie,<note place="margin">Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note> &amp; keepe but one court; &amp; sinne onely excepted, the Pope in a manner can doe all things that God can doe. But we doe limit the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Prince: who is not to impose any lawes vpon the Church, but such as are agreeable to the word of God: neither doe we make him a spirituall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, as the Pope would be, but a ciuill gouernour, who by positiue lawes is to prouide for the peace and welfare of the Church.</p>

His meaning is, that when a man is put to the racke, or otherwise tortured, that he might confesse the truth, and cleere himselfe; it commeth to passe, that through extremitie of the payne, he maketh himselfe guiltie, and so the innocent is both wrongfully tormented, and vniustly put to death.

                        <p>FIrst, <hi>Michael</hi> in that place signifieth Christ, who is Lord of the angels; for the angels cannot be sayd to be any other <hi>Michaels</hi> angels, but only the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God and Christ: <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi> This is also proued by the text, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Now is come saluation, the kingdome of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of the brethren is cast out. Here he is called Christ, which before is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Michael. Augustine</hi> also so expoundeth it, <hi>Michaëlem intellige Christum:</hi> By <hi>Michael</hi> vnderstand Christ: <hi>Homil.</hi> 9. <hi>in Apocalyps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, it followeth not, that as there is a chiefe and captaine of the euill angels, so amongst the good there should be a chiefe angel aboue the rest, beside Christ: for it is sufficient that there is one Lord and prince of the angels, euen Christ. Secondly, neither is it proued out of scripture, that amongst the diuels there is one captaine and great diuel to whom the rest were subiects: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Pharisees obiected, that Christ cast out diuels through <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the prince of the diuels, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. if either the Pharisees did then so meane, or any shall now gather vpon their words, that there is a great master diuell that ruleth
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20636:152"/>
and commandeth the rest, it was in them but a pharisaicall dreame, and in the other a popish collection. We deny not, but that there may be degrees in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and angelicall gifts both among the good and bad angels, as there shall be degrees in glorie among the Saints: yet the Saints shall not be princes one ouer the other, no more are the angels now. Thirdly, marke the answere of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in that place, If Sathan cast out Sathan, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. Here Sathan is made a common name to all euill spirits. But <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> 12. where mention is made of the diuell and his angels, the text sayth, The great dragon, the old serpent, called the Diuell and <hi>Sathanas, vers.</hi> 9. Here the name <hi>Sathanas,</hi> is giuen to the prince of the diuels: so there is not one <hi>Sathanas,</hi> but many. And where our Sauiour calleth the diuell the prince of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them all principalities and powers, worldly gouernours, and princes of the darknesse of this world, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.12. So there is not one prince of the diuels, but they are all princes. Thus <hi>Augustine</hi> expoundeth that place, <hi>Draco pugnauit &amp; angeli eius: id est, diabolus &amp; homines voluntati eius obtemperantes:</hi> The dragon fought and his angels, that is, wicked men obeying his will, <hi>Apocalyps.

                           <hi>Argum.</hi> 2 <hi>Abraham</hi> had knowledge of things in earth, which were not in his time, as that they had <hi>Moyses</hi> and the Prophetes bookes, which hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sawe. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>Rhemist.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The saintes therefore in heauen knowe so much as the Lord thinketh good to reueale vnto them, they knowe not all things.</p>

                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>WE deny not, but that as Prophetes and holy men in this life, may knowe many secret thinges reuealed vnto them by the spirit of God, as <hi>Peter</hi> found out the secret fraude of <hi>Ananias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sapphirae: Eliseus</hi> being absent found out <hi>Gehezi</hi> his corruption: yea, hee could tell what was doone in the King of <hi>Syria</hi> his chamber: so the Lord may reueale vnto the saintes in heauen at his pleasure, some thinges done vpon earth. But that they receiued any such gift of God, to know all thinges done vpon earth, it is a great vntrueth, and cleane contrary to the scriptures.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Salomon</hi> sayeth in his prayer vnto God: Heare thou in heauen, in thy dwelling place, and giue vnto euery man according to his wayes, as thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:20636:155"/>
his heart, for thou onely knowest the hearts of all the children of men. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. Out of this place we thus reason, he only knoweth the heart, that is the Iudge of all men, and a rewarder of them according to their wayes: But the Lord onely is iudge. Ergo. Againe, the wordes themselues be plaine, that God onely knoweth the heart: so that what knowledge of secrets the Saintes haue, it is by reuelation, not by searching the heart.</p>
                        <p>Againe S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith: No man knoweth the thinges of man saue the spirit of man which is in him: so the thinges of God knoweth no man, but the spirite of God. <hi>1. Corinth.</hi> 1.11. the <hi>Rhemist.</hi> aunswer that no man knoweth the secrets of the heart naturally, but by extraordinary gift he may, as the Prophets did. <hi>Ans.</hi> No man euer had or can haue a generall gift to know the heart, but when God seeth it good to reueale it: for otherwise the comparison holdeth not: The spirit of God onely knoweth the things of God: which also is giuen to men to know, but not by receiuing any gift, to search and looke into the nature and heart as it were of God (for then should they knowe all the secrets of God, which neuer any did:) but onely by reuelation of the spirite, which openeth Gods secrets vnto them, so farre as it is conuenient and needfull.</p>
                        <p>Euen after the same manner the spirite of God may reueale the secrets of the heart of man, not by giuing them a generall gift them selues to looke into the heart, as into a glasse, but by reuealing such thinges, when the Lord seeth it expedient.</p>
                        <p>Neither had the prophets an inherent gift and dwelling in them, to know secrets, but the worde of God was inspired into them at times, as they had neede, as we see in <hi>Nathan</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3.4. in <hi>Elisha.</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.15. in <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.4. And though <hi>Paul</hi> was taken vp into heauen, and sawe many secrets, yet he knew not all: for thus he saith of him selfe, If I knew all secretes: <hi>1. Corinth.</hi> 13.2. Ergo, no man euer receiued this gift, to search the heart: but it is proper vnto God, who will not giue his honour to another.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Nescire mortuos quid hic agatur dum hic agitur</hi>: that the dead know not what is done here, while it is in doing. But they vnderstand either by relation of those that departe this worlde, or els by the Angels: <hi>Non quidem omnia, sed quae sinuntur indicare: sicut Prophetae, nec hic omnia cognosce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant. sed quae illis essereuelanda dei prouidentia iudicarat. de cura pro mortuis. cap.</hi> 15. Neither do they know all things, but what God suffereth to be knowen, as neither did the Prophets knowe al things while they liued, but what God in his diuine prouidence thought good to reueale vnto them. I note out of this saying of <hi>Augustine,</hi> three thinges.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, What great vncertaintie of opinion heere is: Howe the dead should come by the knowledge of humane affaires, the Papists think they haue it by Gods gift: otherwhile they say, they see all thinges in God, as in a cleare glasse. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayeth, they knowe them by the Angelles, or by men newly departed this lyfe: so that it appeareth to bee but a meer conceit and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that they haue any such knowledge, whereof there is no surer ground.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:20636:155"/>
Secondly, <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, they know not things presently done, but afterward, contrarie to the Papists. Thirdly, they know not all things, as the Prophets also did not, but what the Lord reuealeth vnto them: wherein also he is contrarie to our aduersaries.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. He worshipped not an Angel, but the Lord Christ himselfe the captaine of the Lords armie: for it was a diuine worship: He is bid to put off his shooes, as <hi>Moses</hi> was, when God appeared out of the fierie bush, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.

                     <p>AS for due reuerence, which is of loue, not of any seruice, there is no question, but we ought to yeeld it vnto the Angels. But all religious seruice or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is due onely to God, and whosoeuer man or Angel requireth, or receiueth any religious worship or seruice, vsurpeth that which is due vnto God, <hi>Fulk. Apocal.</hi> 19. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Apocal.</hi> 19.10. and 22.9. <hi>Iohn</hi> fell downe to worship the Angel: but the Angel suffered him not: See thou doe it not, (saith he) for I am thy fellowe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and of thy brethren, worship God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Angels are not to be adored with any religious worship.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhemist.</hi> First, he forbiddeth him onely to worship him with diuine adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Ans. The words are generall: he sayth not worship God, with this kind of seruice: but worship God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhemist.</hi> Secondly, you say, that <hi>Iohn</hi> so worthie an Apostle was not ignorant
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:20636:156"/>
of that poynt, that Angels were not to be worshipped as God: we may replye also, that if <hi>Iohn</hi> had knowne that this other kind of seruice was vnlawfull, he would not haue done it.</p>
                     <p>Ans. <hi>Iohn</hi> sinned not of ignorance, but of forgetfulnes, in this extasie of his mind, while he beheld the glorie of the Angel, as likewise through his frailenes and forgetfulnes he committeth the like againe, <hi>cap.</hi> 22. which <hi>Iohn</hi> would not haue done, being once before admonished, had he not presently forgotten himselfe: But the other error of worshipping the creature for the Creator, was too grosse an error for the Apostle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhemist.</hi> Thirdly, he was deceiued in the person, taking the Angel for Christ, and therefore was not culpable at all in this fact, in giuing diuine honour to the Angel, for he sinned onely materially, not formally.</p>
                     <p>Ans. First, <hi>Iohn</hi> was not ignorant, that he was an Angel, and not Christ, for he sayth, he was one of the seuen Angels that had the seuen vials. Secondly, though he sinned of ignorance, yet was it a sinne: for the Prophet, which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the olde Prophet, sinned grieuously, as it appeared by his punishment, though he did it ignorantly, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 13. Wherefore it is a grosse error of your Schoolemen, that say, a man sinneth not, if he worship the diuell in the shape of an Angel ignorantly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rhemist.</hi> Fourthly, the Angel would not receiue this worship at <hi>Iohns</hi> hand, whom he knew to be in great fauour with God, and greater then some Angel.</p>
                     <p>Ans. First, though hereafter the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God shalbe made equall to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in glorie, yet in this mortall life they must needes be inferiour, seeing Christ himself, in respect of his passion, was inferiour to the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Secondly, the Angel would not haue taken this homage at any other mans hands, beside <hi>Iohn:</hi> for he giueth a reason, that he is not only his fellow seruant, but also of his brethren. So for al their shifts and cauils, we strongly conclude by this example, that no religious honour ought to be giuen to Angels.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Honoramus Angelos, charitate non seruitute</hi> (sayth <hi>Augustine) nec eis tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla construimus:</hi> We honour Angels with the duetie of loue, not of seruice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we build temples vnto them. <hi>Quod ergo colit summus Angelus, id co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendum etiam est ab homine vltimo.</hi> That therefore which is worshipped of the highest Angel, the man of lowest degree ought also to worship, <hi>De vera reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. cap.</hi> 55. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no worship due vnto Angels, but all vnto God.</p>

Secondly, the places alleadged proue no such aduocation of Angels, but onely defence and protection. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.23.

                        <p>THat angels are not to be worshipped, nor inuocated, as mediatours, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, or aduocates, the scripture speaketh euidently.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.18. Let no man beguile you in the humblenes and worshipping of Angels: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not lawfull to pray vnto them, or to worship them.</p>

                           <hi>Rhemist.</hi> The Apostle speaketh heere against the wicked doctrine of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that affirmed that the angels both ill and good, were mediators for vs vnto God, and against the superstition of the Iewes, that worshipped the angels by whom the law was giuen.</p>
                        <p>Ans. The Apostle condemneth both these superstitions, as likewise the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish inuocation of angels: because all will-worship is forbidden, which is not after the prescript of Gods word, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Fulk. in hunc locum.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2 If any man sinne, (sayth the Apostle) we haue an aduocate with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iesus Christ the Iust, he is the propitiation for our sinnes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ onely is our aduocate.</p>

                           <hi>Rhemist.</hi> Christ is our aduocate in the highest degree, because by himselfe, and his owne merites, without the assistance of any other, he obtaineth pardon for vs. The other, as angels and Saints are as secondary intercessors, that obtaine not any thing by their owne merites, but onely through Christ.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, he onely and properly is an aduocate that can pleade the iustice of his clients cause, which euery one that prayeth for vs cannot doe: for though the angels and Saints departed should pray for vs (which we knowe not by the scriptures) as our brethren vpon earth doe, yet should they not be mediatours and aduocates, but petitioners and intreators for vs, <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, we gather many strong arguments out of this place, for the sole sufficient aduocation of Christ. First, the Sonne is the best and onely sufficient aduocate with the father, therefore where we may haue free and bold accesse to the Sonne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. what need haue we of the seruants helpe? 2.

                           <note place="margin">Haeres. 9.</note>THey haue deuised and imagined in their foolish conceit foure infernall and subterrestrial places: Hell, Purgatorie, <hi>Limbus infantium,</hi> where children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine dying without baptisme, and <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> where the Fathers were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christs comming. These places they distinguish three waies: first by the situation: Hell is lowest, Purgatorie is next, <hi>Limbus infantium</hi> in the third place, <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> vppermost. Secondly, they differ in measure of punishment, some of them haue <hi>poenam damni,</hi> and <hi>poenam sensus,</hi> a double punishment, both of losse, in that they are excluded heauen, and of paine also, as Hell, and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: the other two <hi>Limbi,</hi> are but dungeons of darknes onely, where they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no other smart or paine, but are onely absent from God. Thirdly, they differ in time and continuance, say they, Hell and the dungeon of children shall abide for euer: but Purgatorie and the dungeon of the fathers are temporall: the one, that is, <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> is many yeeres agoe dissolued: and Purgatorie also shall cease, say they, at the comming of Christ, <hi>Ballarm. de purgat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>This then is their opinion, that the Patriarkes and Prophets before Christs comming were not in heauen, but were kept in an infernall place of darknesse, yet without paine, and were deliuered by Christs descending into hell, <hi>Bellarm. de Christi anima. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Rhemist.

                        <p>Argum. First, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. God prouiding a better thing for vs, that they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20636:157"/>
vs should not be perfect: That is, (say the <hi>Rhemists</hi>) the Fathers of the law could not be admitted to the ioyes of heauen, till the Apostles and other of the new lawe, were associate with them, and a way made into heauen by the death and ascension of Christ, <hi>Rhemist. ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. First, by this reason the Patriarkes could not enter into heauen before the death of the Apostles, if there were no enterance found, vnlesse they were asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with them. Secondly, if the way were not opened before Christs ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then the Patriarkes could not ascend before: where were they then al those 40. daies? for they were deliuered out of <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> before Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Thirdly, there is therefore no such meaning of this place: but it is to be vnderstood of the resurrection, when as all the elect shall be consummate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and enter bodie and soule into heauen. <hi>Fulk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Zachar.</hi> 9.11. I haue loosed thy prisoners out of the pit, where there is no water; That is out of <hi>Limbus Patrum, Bellarm. de Christi anima. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>Ans. <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth a cleane contrarie sense of the place, by the pit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water he vnderstandeth, <hi>Humanae miseriae siccam profunditatem &amp; sterilem, vbi non sunt fluenta iustitiae, sed iniquitatis lutum:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">De ciuitat. dei. lib. 18. cap. 35.</note> The drie and barren dungeon of humane miserie, where there are no springs of iustice, but the puddle and mire of iniquitie: That is, the Prophet speaketh of the deliuerance of the people from their cruel and vniust bondage and captiuitie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. In the which spirit he also went and preached vnto the spirits that were in prison, which sometime had been disobedient in the daies of <hi>Noe.</hi> This place proueth euidently (sayth <hi>Bellarm.</hi>) that Christ descended into hell, and deliuered the fathers from thence, <hi>De Christi anima. lib.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                        <p>Ans. The place can haue no such meaning: First, by the spirit here the humane soule of Christ cannot be vnderstood, but is diuine power: for he was not quickned or restored to life by his humane soule, but by his diuine power his soule was ioyned againe to his bodie. <hi>Augustine</hi> also giueth another reason, why he cannot be said to be quickned or made aliue in spirit, that is, in his soule: for then he must haue died before in soule. But, <hi>Mors animae peccatum est, à quo ille immunis fuit:</hi> But the death of the soule is sinne, from the which Christ was free.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Apostle speaketh onely of those which were incredulous and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, not of the faithfull, such as the Patriarkes were and Prophets. Yea (sayth <hi>Bellarm.</hi>) they might be vnbeleeuers at the first, but after repented before they dyed.</p>
                        <p>Ans. Then the Apostles comparison could not hold, if any were saued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Arke: for as then eight persons onely were saued, all without the Arke perished: so now without baptisme and faith of the Church (for by baptisme he vnderstandeth not the washing of water, but the inward grace of the spirit) none can be saued. If then any were saued out of the Arke, there may now also be saluation out of the Church. <hi>Augustine</hi> also sayth, <hi>Ii modò, qui non credide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Euangelio illis intelligantur esse similes, qui tunc non crediderunt, cum fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:20636:158"/>
arca.</hi> They which now beleeue not the Gospell, are like to them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not then while the Arke was in making. And they which doe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and are baptized, are like to those which then were saued in the Arke. <hi>Augustine</hi> thinketh therefore, that they were incredulous persons, and vtterly perished both bodie and soule: And so is our opinion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The text saith not, he went and deliuered, but went and preached: for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> calleth it an absurd thing to thinke, that the Gospell was preached to them that were dead, which in their life time were incredulous: for if the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell bee preached in Hell (sayth he) it would followe that it is not necessarie it should be preached here in the world, if men when they are dead, may heare it, and be conuerted. And againe, it would ensue (sayth he) that there should bee a Church in hell: for where the word is preached, there is a Church. Wherefore he concludeth, that it must needes be vnderstood of <hi>Noah</hi> his preaching in the spirit and power of Christ: <hi>Arcae fabricatio, praedicatio quaedam fuit.</hi> The building of the Arke was a kinde of preaching, <hi>Epistol.</hi> 99. So also he expoundeth that 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. The Gospell was preached to the dead: <hi>Ex circumstantia loci apparet, eum intelligere eos, qui nunc mortui sunt, sed olim in vita Euangelium audiuerunt. Commentar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in epistol. ad Roman.</hi>

                        <p n="4">4 The text is not, that were in prison, but doth better beare this sense, that are: So the Apostles meaning is this, that they which were incredulous and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient in time past, when <hi>Noah</hi> in the spirit of Christ, or Christ by his spirit in <hi>Noah</hi> preached to the world, were then destroyed in the flood, &amp; now for their increduliti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THat the holy Patriarkes, Fathers and Prophets dyed in the same faith before the comming of Christ, which all true Christians doe now hold, and were presently receiued into the ioyes of heauen, and not kept in any infernall place or dungeon of darknes: thus it is proued.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 They had all faith, and beleeued in Christ: yea, the same faith that is now preached: as it is defined by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. They also by this faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained remission of sinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as it is alleadged out of the Psalme: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they were blessed: but out of the kingdome of God there was no blessednesse to be found: therefore they also went to heauen.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 If the heauens were not opened before Christs ascension, as the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> affirme: then none went to heauen before Christ ascended. But that is false: <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> by their owne confession were taken vp into Paradise: so was the soule of the theefe vpon the Crosse. But Paradise is heauen, yea the third and the highest heauen, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.4. And so <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> expoundeth that place, <hi>Voluit Deus Apostolo demonstrare vitam, in qua post hanc vitam viuendum est in aeternu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The Lord would shew vnto the Apostle
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:20636:158"/>
that life, wherein, after this life, we shall liue and remaine for euer: <hi>De Gene. lib.</hi> 12.28. These three therefore went to Paradise, which is no infernall or place of darknesse, but a Celestiall habitation of ioy, light, and felicitie: They were not then in <hi>Limbo Patrum,</hi> in the dungeon of the Fathers. Wherefore we conclude, there was accesse to heauen before the ascension of Christ.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The Fathers and Patriarkes, before Christs comming, were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome: but that was no infernall place or prison, such as they imagine <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> to be. <hi>Augustine</hi> proueth, that it could not be <hi>membrum,</hi> or <hi>pars infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum,</hi> a member or part of Hell, or any infernall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> place, as the Iesuits hold: First, the text saith, there is <hi>magnum chaos,</hi> a great gulfe, a great distance betweene, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.26. and <hi>vers.</hi> 23. The rich man sawe <hi>Abraham</hi> a farre off: wherefore it is not like, that both those places should be infernall. Secondly, <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, was <hi>quietis habitatio, &amp; faelicitatis sinus,</hi> a place of rest and blisse: but so is not any infernall place, where there is horror, and darknesse. Thirdly, the place where the rich man was, is called Hell, or infernall: there is no such thing sayd of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he was in any lower place: but aboue in some high and farre distant place: for the rich man is sayd to lift vp his eyes. <hi>Augustine</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth: <hi>Ne ipsos quidem inferos vspiam scripturarum locis in bono appellatos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perire potui. Epistol.</hi> 99. I doe not finde that this word infernall, is taken any where in the scriptures in the good part. And therefore the bosome of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> being a place of rest, sayth he, cannot be any infernall place.</p>

                           <p>THere is (they say) a certaine infernall place in the earth, called Purgatorie,<note place="margin">Haeres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.</note> in the which, as in a prison house, the soules which were not fully purged in this life, are there cleansed and purged by fire, before they can be receiued into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: <hi>Bellarm. de Purgator. lib.</hi> 1.1. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Rhemist.

                           <p>Ans. First, the Iesuite brought this place before, to proue that there was <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Patrum,</hi> and now he maketh it serue for Purgatorie: thus they can make the scripture to speake what they list themselues. But Purgatorie and <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> are two diuers, yea and contrary things: for the <hi>Limbus</hi> was onely for those that liued before Christ: Purgatorie began since: the <hi>Limbus</hi> was voyde of payne and punishment, so is not Purgatorie: wherefore if the Lake or pit in <hi>Zacharie</hi> signifie Purgatorie, it maketh nothing for <hi>Limbus:</hi> and if it serue for <hi>Limbus,</hi> then they misse of a place for Purgatorie. But indeede it signifieth no such thing: but is taken onely in that place for the affliction and miserie of this life, as we shewed out of <hi>Augustine.</hi> And so doth he also expound such and the like places out of the Psalmes: as <hi>Psalm.</hi> 86.13. Thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest graue. <hi>Quid</hi> (sayth he) <hi>est lacus infimus, nisi profundissima mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, qua non sit profundior?</hi> What els (sayth he) is the lowest pit or graue, but the lowest degree of miserie, then the which there can be no greater?</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.55. Her spirit came againe and she arose. Christ raised the rulers daughter to life.

                           <p>Ans. Surely a goodly argument, the spirits of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and of the Maide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is a third place: and why may you not thinke, that their soules were, whereas the soules of other righteous are? And why may not the

Of all other they most insult, and beare themselues bolde vpon that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. which being rightly vnderstood, doth not helpe them anything at al: <hi>vers.</hi> 13. The fire shal trie euery mans worke. <hi>vers.</hi> 15. if any mans worke burne, he shall suffer losse, but he shall be safe himselfe, yet as it were through the fire. <hi>Bellarm. Rhemist.</hi> by fire here vnderstand the flames of Purgatorie; by wood, stubble, strawe; veniall sinnes, which must be purged by that fire, <hi>Rhemist.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, by the precious matter here, as of gold, siluer, are not the workes of charitie vnderstood, but the preaching of sound doctrine: by straw, and stubble, and wood, and other combustible matter, the affectation of eloquence, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt teaching of the truth, yet holding the foundation: not veniall sinnes, as the <hi>Rhemists</hi> affirme: and this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also granteth.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, fire is here taken allegorically, as the rest of the words are of gold, siluer, stubble: neither can it be taken for their Purgatorie fire; because it trieth the workes onely, not the persons, and all must be tried by this fire, as well those that build gold and siluer, as the other: but all shall not passe through Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, by their owne confession. They are driuen to this shift, to graunt, that <hi>vers.</hi> 13. the fire is taken in one sense, namely, for the sentence and iudgement of God, and <hi>vers.</hi> 15. in another, that is, for the flames of Purgatorie. But who seeth not how absurd a thing this is, that in an allegorie the same word, and in the same place, should be so diuersly taken?</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The day shall reueale it, that is, sayth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the day of the Lord at the comming of Christ: the <hi>Rhemists</hi> vnderstand the particular day of euery mans death; so well they agree together. But it is apparant, that this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the day, that is, the time shall declare it: for God hath appoynted a time to examine euery mans doctrine by fire: which is nothing els but the iudgement of God by the fire of his word, whereby euery man, in the day of his calling and conuersion, shall knowe whether he hath preached aright or not: <hi>Fulk.</hi>

                           <p>THat there is no such place of Purgatorie after this life, but that here onely is the place of repentance, and to be reconciled vnto God: and that the soules departed are presently either receiued vp to heauen, or thrust downe to hell: thus it is proued out of the scriptures.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. The scripture maketh but two kinds of works, either good or euill, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> 12.14. But two sorts of men, he that beleeueth shall be saued, he that beleeueth not, shall be condemned. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. But two places, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and hell: <hi>Math.</hi> 25. Christ hath but two flockes, one of sheepe at the right hand, another of goates at the left: and he saith to the one, Come ye blessed:
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:20636:160"/>
to the other, Goe ye cursed. There are but two sorts of men, therefore but two places: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Purgatorie.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarm.</hi> There shall be indeede at the comming of Christ but two places, heauen and hell: Purgatorie shall haue an end.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, you say your selues that there shall be two infernall places for euer, Hell for the wicked, and a <hi>Limbus</hi> for infants that dye vnbaptized, and heauen that maketh three, and now you say there shall be but two. Secondly, there are but two places now, because there are but two sorts of men, for the beleeuers are alreadie passed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.24. The vnbeleeuers are alreadie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18. Thirdly, <hi>Augustine</hi> consenteth with vs, <hi>Non est vlli vllus medius locus, vt possit esse nisi cum diabolo, qui non est cum Christo:</hi> There is no middle or third place, but he must needes be with the diuell, that is not with Christ. <hi>De peccator. remiss. &amp; merit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. And againe, <hi>Tertium locum penitus ignoramus, imo nec esse in scripturis sanctis inuenimus:</hi> The third place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side heauen and hell, we are vtterly ignorant of, nay wee finde not in scripture that there is any.</p>
                           <p>Arg. 2. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that euery man shall receiue the works of his bodie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which he hath done either good or euill, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. Therefore there is no place to cleanse and purge the soules of men after this life: for then they should not receiue according to the works done in their flesh.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayth, that euen they whose sinnes are remitted after death, doe receiue nothing but that which was done in the flesh, for they deserued in their life time to be helped after death.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, as for desert, we will shewe elsewhere, that it hath no place before God neither in this life, nor the life to come: for the scripture sayth, Blessed is he to whom the Lord imputeth no sinne: not who deserueth remission of sinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. Secondly, this deuised and friuolous distinction, doth not stand with the Apostles meaning: for he speaketh of things actually done in the flesh, not deserued to be done, and of the workes of the bodie, not of the soule, &amp; of things perfectly done, not begun onely or in choate: and he vseth it as a reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men, euen while they liue, to be accepted of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 9.11. But if there might be any such helpe after death, there needeth no such hast presently to be conuerted vnto God.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 14.13. Blessed are the dead from henceforth that dye in the Lord, for they rest from their labours: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no Purgatorie: for all the godly departed are at rest.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarm.</hi> First, it is not meant of all the godly, but onely of Martyrs, which dye for the name of Christ.</p>
                           <p>Ans. As to liue in Christ Iesus, is a phrase of scripture, &amp; signifieth to liue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Christ, 2. <hi>Timot.</hi> 3.12. so to dye in the Lord, signifieth to dye in the faith of Christ, 1. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 4.16. Therefore this place is vnderstood of all the godly.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellar.</hi> 2. This word (<hi>amodò</hi>) from henceforth, is not to be vnderstood straight after their death, but straight after the day of iudgement, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shalbe blessed.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="310" facs="tcp:20636:161"/>Ans. First, by this reason none that are dead in Christ should be happie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time. And yet by your owne confession, Martyrs are straightway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vp to heauen. Secondly, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> vseth this word elsewhere, to signifie from this time forward, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.51. Christ sayth to <hi>Nathanael,</hi> From hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth you shall see heauen open.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Rhemist.</hi> Thirdly, it may be also vnderstood of the soules of Purgatorie, that are without danger of sinne and damnation, and are put in vnfallible securitie of their saluation, with vnspeakable comfort.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, so the Saints liuing are blessed, being as well without feare of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. and are assured of their saluation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. Secondly, I pray you what rest or comfort can they haue, that endure greater paine then any in this life? And how can their consciences be quieted, seeing their soules are so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted? for bodies they haue none, whatsoeuer they suffer is in soule: how then can ioy and paine, comfort and horror be together in the soule? <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi>

                           <p>WE hold, that it is not onely an article belonging to the faith, but contrarie to it: and that though there were a Purgatorie, yet it should not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to saluation to beleeue it. First, because the scripture hath not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, which containeth all things necessarie to saluation. Secondly, the Greeke Church holdeth it not to this day: they confesse no Purgatorie, though they pray for the dead: it were a hard matter therfore to pronounce them damned. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Augustine</hi> doubted of it: He sayth, that there should be some such place after death, <hi>non incredibile est,</hi> it is not incredible, <hi>&amp; vtrum ita sit, quaeri potest, &amp; aut inueniri aut latere fideles potest:</hi> whether it be so or not, it may be enquired, and it may either be safely found out, or remaine hid and vnknowne to the faithfull: <hi>Enchirid.</hi> 69. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, A faithfull man may safely be ignorant of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</p>

                           <p>FIrst, we denye that any sinnes are of their owne nature veniall, as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; for the wages of al sinne, without the mercie of God, is death, <hi>Ro.</hi> 6.23.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:20636:161"/>
Secondly, what equitie should there be in this, that veniall sinnes should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the hellish fire of Purgatorie, that exceedeth al the afflictions of this life, yea and a longer time then any man liueth vpon earth; for the Pope taketh vpon him to pardon for thousands of yeeres: and yet mortall and deadly sinnes (as they call them) may be satisfied for here, where neither the penance can be so grieuous, nor so long? Thirdly, the sinne once remitted, there remaineth no punishment, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.5. Christ saith to the sick of the palsie,
<q>Thy sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen thee: and <hi>vers.</hi> 10. That ye may knowe that the Sonne of man hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie on earth to forgiue sinnes, I say vnto thee, arise, take vp thy bed and walke.</q>
The releasing him of the punishment of his bodie, was a signe that his sinnes also were forgiuen, and the sinne being remitted, the punishment also ceaseth. Wherefore who so leaueth the world without sinne, is no more guiltie of any punishment.</p>

that they which receiue sentence of life goe presently to heauen, the other to hell. For to what purpose els should the sentence be giuen, if it be not straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in force? So S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that they which looke to be clothed with their house from heauen, shall not be left naked or vnclothed, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. But if some soules ordained to life eternall, should pause a while in Purgatorie, being vnclothed of their flesh, they should be left altogether naked, hauing not yet receiued their clothing from heauen. Secondly, where there is securitie of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, there is the greatest comfort &amp; ioy that can be: how then can the soules in Purgatorie be so grieuouslie tormented, which cannot be els where then in their conscience? for as for the whipping, scalding, freezing of soules in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, they are but old wiues fables: the ioy then of the soule is in the conscience, so is the sorowe: how then can both these be matched in the soule together, to haue vnspeakable ioy, as also to feele most horrible paine?</p>

First, is not here a strong argument, thinke you, Christ raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> and some others from death to life, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we ought to pray for the dead? for it followeth not, that vpon the miraculous workes of Christ, we should build the ordinarie dueties of Christians: <hi>Augustine</hi> would haue told you that Christ is not to be imitated in such workes: <hi>Non hoc tibi dicit, non eris discipulus meus, nisi ambulaueris supra mare, aut nisi suscitaueris quatriduanum mortuum:</hi> He saith not vnto thee, Thou shalt not be my disciple, vnlesse thou walke vpon the sea, &amp; raise one that hath been dead foure daies: But, Learne of me: for I am humble and meeke. Secondly, if prayer for the dead be vnto vs, as the raising of the dead was to Christ: then, as all the dead are to be praied for, so Christ should haue rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed againe all that went then to Purgatorie, or els, by your conclusion, he failed in charitie, as we doe now, if we pray not for the dead, as you beare vs in hand. Thirdly, though the Saints departed, and the faithfull liuing are members of the same bodie, and so are bound in loue one to the other, yet it followeth not, that one should pray for the other. They with vs, and we with them doe wish and long to see the redemption of the sonnes of God accomplished, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 6.10.22.20. But charitie bindeth vs not one to pray for another, because we knowe not one the particular needes of another. Nay, to pray for any departed, is against the rule of charitie: for loue beleeueth all things, and hopeth all things, 1. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> 13.7. Wee ought to hope the best of the dead, that they are at rest: but in praying for them, wee presuppose they are in miserie, and so neede our prayers: therefore wee hope not the best of them, as charitie willeth vs.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. The Apostle sayth, There is a sinne vnto death, for the which a man ought not to pray: that is, deadly sinne, wherein a man dyeth without repentance: but for other sinnes not vnto death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of men repent themselues, it is lawfull to pray: <hi>Ergo,</hi> we may pray for those that are departed not in deadly sinne: for this place is properly to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of praying or not praying for the dead: because so long as a man liueth he may be prayed for, because all sinnes are pardonable in this life, <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. ibid.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. First, a sinne vnto death is not onely finall impenitencie, but sinne also against the holy Ghost, such as was the sinne of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and of the Pharisees. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though we should vnderstand it of finall impenitencie, yet it is but a so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>y argument, some of the dead ought not to be praied for: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the rest may,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:20636:164"/>
Thirdly, the text cannot be vnderstood of praying for the dead: for the text sayth not, If any man see that his brother hath sinned not vnto death, but, If he see him sinning: but the dead doe neither sinne, nor are seene to sinne. Fourthly, whereas you say, that all sinnes are pardonable in this life, our Sauiour Christ saith contrary, that the sinne against the holy Ghost can neuer be forgiuen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, nor in the world to come. <hi>Plura. apud. Fulk. ibid.</hi>

                           <p>TO pray for the dead, is a worke neither pleasing before God, because he hath no where commanded it, nor auailable for them that are departed, because they haue their iudgement alreadie. While we liue, let vs one pray for another, but when we are gone, the praiers of the liuing helpe vs not.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. The ground of this popish opinion of prayer for the dead, is their superstitious deuise of Purgatorie: for none els doe they hold it lawfull to pray for but for the soules onely in Purgatorie. But there is no Purgatorie, as we haue shewed before, after this life: our purging is onely in this life: Christ hath by him selfe purged our sinnes. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. Christ his bloud is the chiefe and onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of our sinnes: there are also other inferiour and ministeriall purgings, whereby that onely soueraigne purging is made beneficiall, and applied vnto vs: as the inward operation and worke of the spirit is compared to fire, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.11. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.13. There is also a purging fire of affliction compared by the Prophet to fullers sope, <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.3. There also shall be a third purging fire in the day of the Lord, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. when as the corruption and mortalitie of our bodies shall be purged away, and then shall our mortalitie put on immortalitie, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.53. Other Purgatorie after this life we acknowledge none. Seeing then that there are no soules in Purgatorie, and for none els it is lawfull to pray but for the soules tormented in Purgatorie: it followeth, that we are to pray for none at all that are dead.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. No prayer is acceptable to God without faith. We must pray without wauering and doubting, <hi>Iames.</hi> 1.6. But so can we not pray for the dead: for we cannot tell in what case they are for whom we pray, whether they be in heauen, hell, or purgatorie, and therefore we cannot assure our selues that our prayers are heard, but must needes pray with great doubting and wauering of the mind: <hi>Ergo,</hi> such praiers are in vaine, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.7.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. Our praiers profite not the dead, because there is no place after this life for repentance or remission of sinnes: for this should be the end and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of our praier, that they might be released of their sinnes, and eased of their paine. There is no remission of sinnes after death, because there is no true repentance: repentance there is none, because there can be no amendment of life, which alwaies followeth repentance: for <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> that was a preacher of repentance, bid not onely the people to repent, but to bring forth fruites worthie repentance, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.2.8. So saith the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> If the wicked
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:20636:164"/>
will returne from his sinnes, and doe the thing that is lawfull, he shall liue and not dye, 18.21. There are two parts then of repentance, as <hi>Isay</hi> sayth, Cease to doe euill, learne to doe well, 1. <hi>Isay.</hi> 16.17. But there is no place of working out of the bodie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> then no repentance.</p>
                           <p>To this <hi>Augustine</hi> agreeth: <hi>Non est apud inferos poenitentia ad salutem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiens, ecce nunc tempus est salutis, nunc tempus remissionis. In hac vita poenitentiae tantum patet libertas, post mortem nulla correctionis est licentia: De tempor. serm.</hi> 66. In hell, or among the dead, there is no repentance vnto saluation: behold now is the time of saluation, the time of forgiuenes: In this life onely haue men libertie to repent, after death there is no place for amendment. What is become now (I pray you) of your Purgatorie repentance? after this life there is no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be had, because there is no remission of sinnes: no remission of sinnes, because there is no repentance: there is no repentance, because there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Rhemist.</hi> Our Sauiour saith, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.32. that blasphemie against the spirit shal neither be forgiuen in this world, nor the world to come: <hi>Ergo,</hi> some sinnes may be forgiuen in the world to come.</p>
                           <p>Ans. <hi>Mark</hi> expoundeth <hi>Mathew:</hi> He saith, It shall neuer be forgiuen, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.29. So that not to be forgiuen either in this world or the world to come, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but neuer to be forgiuen: for if it be not forgiuen in this life, it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be forgiuen.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarm.</hi> Yea, but <hi>Mathew</hi> must expound <hi>Marke,</hi> because he setteth it downe more fully, and <hi>Marke</hi> doth but abridge the Gospell written by S. <hi>Matthew, De Purgat. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Ans. But why should not <hi>Mark</hi> rather expound <hi>Mathew,</hi> seeing he writ after him? and we vse to expound the former writers by the later, not contrariwise.</p>

                        <head>AN APPENDIX OR AN APPERTINENCE TO this part, concerning the burials and funerals of the dead.</head>
                        <p>THere are certaine poynts, wherein there is no great variance or dissension betweene vs. First, we confesse, that it is meete and conuenient, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Christians, being departed, should after a seemely and comely manner be brought to the graue: as <hi>Dauid</hi> commendeth the men of <hi>Iabesh Gilead,</hi> for burying the bodie of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5. The brethren also tooke the bodie of <hi>Stephen</hi> &amp; buried it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.2. Secondly, it is not to be denied but that lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and sorow may be made for the dead, obseruing S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, that We mourne not as those that haue no hope, that is, excessiuely, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.13. where S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not simply forbid Christians to sorow, but not as the Gentiles. The brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also made great lamentation for <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 8.2. Thirdly, we doe also graunt, that according to the diuers customes of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys, it is not vnlawfull to vse some comely rites and ceremonies in the buriall of the dead; not for religion, but for orders sake: as among the Israelites, the mourners were wont to goe about in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:20636:165"/>
the streetes, <hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 12.5. And Christ commended the woman in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, for anoynting of him against his buriall, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>But beside these poynts by vs confessed, and acknowledged; there are other more waightie matters, as touching the order of funerals, wherein we worthily and iustly dissent from our aduersaries.</p>
                        <p n="1">

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>16</label> 1 They doe attribute much to the places where men are buried, as in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Churchyards, but especially vnder the Altar, <hi>Rhemist.</hi> as the soules of the righteous doe rest in Christ, who is that altar, vnder the which the Apostle sawe the soules of Martyrs: so for the correspondence to the place in heauen, their bodies are commonly layd vnder the altar, where the sacrifice of the body of Christ is daylie offered, <hi>Annot. Apocalyps.</hi> 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>Ans. The altar of the Crosse was the onely place where the bodie of Christ was sacrificed: neither need it to be often offered in sacrifice, but it sufficed once onely to haue been done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25.27. And in the Communion, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no sacrifice, but of praise and thanksgiuing. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. It is kept onely in remembrance of the death of Christ, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. And how should it be auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the dead, seeing it profiteth not all the liuing, but onely those that are present, which doe eate and drinke the holy elements of bread and wine in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the bodie and blood of Christ giuen and shed for them? So saith the scripture, Doe this, as oft as you doe it, in remembrance of me, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. The doers therefore, agents, and receiuers, haue the present benefite, not they which are absent: how then can the dead receiue any solace by it? It profiteth then not a whit to be layd in Churches, or Churchyards, or other hallowed pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they call them: for all places are alike: neither helpeth it the dead to be buried in one place more then another: for God shall command the sea, and all other places to giue vp their dead, <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> 20. The very heathen did confesse as much: one sayth, It skilleth not, <hi>humíne, an sublimè putrescam:</hi> whether I rot vnder,<note place="margin">Theodor.</note> or aboue the ground. And another thus writeth, <hi>Coelo tegitur, qui non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet vrnam:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lucan.</note> Heauen is a couering to him that hath no other coffin. It were a foule shame then for Christians, to exceede the very Gentiles in their superstitious conceits. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Si aliquid prodest impio sepultura preciosa, oberit pio vilis, aut nulla:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">De cura pro mortuis cap. 3.</note> If sumptuous funerals profite the wicked, then homely or no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials doe hurt the godly. Therefore as it helpeth not a wicked man to be buried in one place, more then another, so it doth not hinder or hurt the godly and righteous man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 We condemne also their superstitious ceremonies which they vse at their <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>17</label> funerals, as the burning of Tapers, which signifieth, say they, that the soules of the dead are aliue, <hi>Bellarm. de purgator. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, this superstitious vse of setting vp candles, was directly forbidden in the <hi>Elibertine</hi> Councel, Canon. 34. Of the like sort also were other supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vsages, as the going about of the belman to will the people to pray for their soules, the ringing or iangling of bels to bring their soules to heauen, with queere songs and other melodie to commit the bodies to the ground, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:20636:165"/>
their soules to the protection of Saints. We denie not, but comely and decent orders, voyde of superstition, may be vsed, according to the fashion of the countrey: as <hi>Iacobs</hi> bodie was embaulmed after the manner of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <hi>Genes.</hi> 50.2. At the buriall of their Kings, the Israelites vsed to burne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, <hi>Iere.</hi> 34.5. The Iewes manner was to wash the bodies of the dead, to winde it vp in a linnen cloth, and burie it with spices and odors: So our Sauiours bodie was buried after the manner of the Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.40. We reade also that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> was put into a coffin or chest, <hi>Genes.</hi> 50.26. Of these and the like customes, <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth a rule, writing vpon those words in the Gospell, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.40. As it was the manner of the Iewes to burie: <hi>Non mihi videtur Euangelista sic frustra dicere voluisse: ita quippe admonuit, in huiusmodi officijs, quae mortuis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibentur, morem cuius<expan>
                                 <am>
                                    <g ref="char:abque"/>
                                 </am>
                                 <ex>que</ex>
                              </expan> gentis esse seruandum: in Iohann. tract.</hi> 120. Me thinketh the Euangelist sayd not thus without cause: hereby letting vs to vnderstand, that in performing such dueties of buriall to the dead, the manner and custome of euery countrey is to be kept.</p>
                        <p>The Iewes also had a custome, with some companie or frequencie of people, to bring their dead to the ground, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12.5. And in the while, to vse some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the people concerning death and mortalitie which came in by sinne, and of the wrath and mercie of God. <hi>Syrus. interp. in Mark.</hi> 14.3. Neither doe we see, why it is not lawfull now among Christians, at funerals and burials, to haue some godly sermon and exhortation, to put the people in mind of their end, and to comfort them with the hope of the resurrection, as also to giue God thankes, for those his faithfull seruants, that did glorifie him by their life, and by their godly departure. This seemeth also to haue been the commendable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church in ancient time: as <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Exposit. in Psal.</hi> 103. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>Pauca nos cogit dicere temporis angustia, quod &amp; nouit charitas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra debere vos exequijs fidelis corporis solenne obsequium.</hi> The shortnes of the time causeth me to be briefe, and you know, that we are to performe a solemne dutie to the bodie of our faithfull brother. The sermon seemeth to haue been made at some funerall. The Iewes also, the buriall being ended, did comfort those that mourned, and eate and dranke with them, and gaue them the cup of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.31. Both which customes may be kept and retained without any superstition. But other customes and ceremonies, that doe sauour of impietie, and doe any way implye prayer or commendation of the soules of the dead, ought to be left and abolished.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Another abuse in popish funerals, is their superstitious and often remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the dead: for they haue their weekes mind for the dead the seuenth <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>18</label> day, nay their halfe weekes mind the third day, their moneths mind the thirtith day: and beside, their anniuersarie or yeeres minde. I pray you what neede all this? Where doe they finde, that wee should mourne for the dead a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, thirtie dayes together, much lesse a whole yeere? <hi>Ioseph</hi> mourned but seuen dayes for his father, <hi>Genesis</hi> 50.10. So did the <hi>Gileadites</hi> for <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Samuel</hi> 31.13. The Egyptians in deede mourned threescore and tenne
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:20636:166"/>
daies, when <hi>Ioseph</hi> mourned but seuen: that we may see a manifest difference betweene the moderate mourning of the faithful, and the excessiue lamentation of infidels. But the popish yeeres mindes doe farre exceede the Egyptians stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mourning: there being fiue times 70. daies in a yeere. Yet yeerely stipends, erected for weekely, monethly, quarterly, or yeerely sermons we mislike not: being ordained for the instruction of the people, without any relation to the soules of the dead, otherwise, then to giue God thankes for them, and those good things which the Lord wrought by them.</p>

                        <p>Answere. There can be no such conclusion gathered out of these words: The Lord will shewe mercie, according to his truth and promise, to those that are mercifull: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is meritorious to be mercifull: for here the reward dependeth of Gods promise and truth, not vpon the worthines of the worke: Indeed <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> saith, as it followeth in that place, I will recompence this benefite, because you haue done this thing. They might deserue kindnes at the hands of <hi>Dauid,</hi> because one good turne requireth another: but before the Lord there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or desert. Secondly, to burie the dead is a worke of charitie, and therefore commanded, as all other dueties of charitie are. The things then commanded, we doe of duetie, we are bound to doe them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not meritorious: So saith our Sauiour Christ, Doth the master thanke his seruant for doing that which he was commanded? I trow not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.9.</p>

none but for those, for whom they are hired to pray? And if praier be a worke of charitie, and if by their praiers they can deliuer mens soules out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, why doe they not extend their charitie to all in praying for them?</p>

It is like they would. But surely all their Masses should neither haue profited the one: nor the want of them haue hindered the other. Marke, I pray you, what <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Praeclaras exequias in conspectu hominum purpurato illi diuiti turba exhibuit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulorum:</hi>

And thus it is lawfull, profitable, and expedient for the Church to Canonize Saints, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. The Patriarkes and Prophets were Canonized for Saints in the old law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. So <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <hi>Stephen</hi> &amp; other were Canonized: therfore it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that the Lord would haue the same order still continued in his Church, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, neither in the old nor the new lawe, were any set vp to be Saints, with intent to be worshipped, called vpon, temples to be consecrated in their names: but onely the scripture giueth testimonie of them, as of holy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men: and so may we also honour the blessed Martyrs, whom the cruell Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of <hi>Rome,</hi> and since them the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue sent through fire and other torments to heauen. Secondly, when they haue as good testimonie for their Saints, as we haue for the holy Patriarkes and Prophets, they may be bold to pronounce them to be holy blessed. Thirdly, your argument followeth not, vnles you will say, that the Church may doe all things now, which the Prophets and Apostles did then: They may as well make scripture, and more Canonicall bookes by the same reason, as make and Canonize new Saints.</p>

                           <p>THat none of the Saints are to be adored or worshipped, their images or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, or praiers to be made vnto them, or any such honor to be giuen them, it shall afterward appeare more at large: And therefore they ought not to be Canonized to any such end or purpose. We also grant, that the number of Gods Saints and elect is encreased daylie: and we are sure in generall, as the scripture testifieth, that the death of his Saints is precious in the sight of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.15. And that all are blessed that dye in the Lord: But particularly we are not able certainly to determine of any: the matter is to be left wholly vnto God, and we in the meane time to hope the best.</p>

But this none can doe: nay, it were great rashnes and want of charity for any so to take vpon them. <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, Why condemnest thou another mans seruant? hee standeth or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to his owne master, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. No man can iudge whether the seruant stand or fall, but his Master: Ergo, if the Church presume to determine of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection or damnation of those that are departed, she is nowe a Mistres and Lady rather of the Saintes, then they Lords or patrones to her, as the Papistes holde they are.</p>

The iudgement then of men, who are saued, and who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, is reserued for the comming of Christ: Therefore it is great presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for men to preuent the time, and to take vpon them to bee Iudges in Gods place. Againe, our Sauiour Christ saith, that To sit at his right hand or left, in his kingdome, was not his to giue (meaning as he was man) but it shal be giuen to them for whome it is prepared of my Father, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.23.

                              <hi>Augustine</hi> also consenteth: <hi>Non separatio iam cuique tuta est, illius erit se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratio, qui non nouit errare: Nos in hac vita difficile est, vt nos ipsos nouerimus, quantò minùs debemus de quoqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praeproperam ferre sententiam.</hi> It is not safe for men now to make separation (of the good and bad) it belongeth to him, that can not erre: We in this life do hardly know our selues, howe much lesse ought we to iudge rashly of others? <hi>exposit. in Psalm.</hi> 139. Here are two reasons giuen, why it is not lawfull for men to iudge of the election or reprobation of men: first their iudgement is subiect to error, and therefore the matter must be referred to God, who erreth not: Secondly, we can not iudge our selues, much lesse can we iudge of others. Ergo, no man liuing ought or is able to define either who are Saints in heauen, or who are damned in Hell.</p>

                           <p>FIrst, if saintes were to be registred and Canonized as they say: yet it should not belong to the Pope, but to the whole Church.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1 The Pope hath no authoritie ouer the whole Church: no nor yet in any other Bishoppes dioces, no more then they haue in his: Let him be content with his owne dioces (and it were to be wished, that he could rule that well) the whole world is too large a prouince for him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 The whole Church hath power to excommunicate and deliuer vp to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, 1. <hi>Corinth</hi> 5.<hi>4.</hi> and to cut off the prophane and wicked from the Church of God, as heathen and publicanes, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17: Ergo, to iudge who are members of the Church, and saintes of God, is a matter which appertaineth to the whole Church. 3 Before <hi>Anno.</hi> 800. in the time of <hi>Carolus magnus,</hi> there was no saint publiquely Canonized by the pope, as <hi>Bellarm.</hi> confesseth: but the truth is, this custome of Canonizing saints beganne not till more then 1000. yeare after Christ, til <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. his time, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. I pray you then, were there no saints before? if there were, who canonized them?</p>
                           <p>Secondly: So much as is to be knowne of saints and holy men, euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is to acknowledge, without any publike decree or determination of the Pope or any other: for the word of God giueth rules, whereby we may discern the righteous from the vnrighteous: Christ speaking of false prophets, sayeth, By their fruites ye shall know them, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.16. And againe, he fayth thus to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, By this shal men know that you are my disciples, if you loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.35. By these rules, it is easie for euery Christian to iudge who for the present time, are the true disciples of Christ, who otherwise.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, it is a most impudent and shameles saying, that the Pope can not erre in canonizing of Saintes: 1 Miracles are no sufficient proofe of a saint: for many, that shal be condemned in the day of Iudgement, haue had power to do straunge workes, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.22, 23. 2 What better argument can wee haue of this, then common experience?

                           <p>WE can finde in the worde of God but two kindes of worship or adoration: a religious worship only due vnto God: and a ciuill honour vsed amongst men. As for the Angels and saints, we do honour them with loue, not with ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:20636:170"/>
We do also reuerence the holy men vpon earth, as the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were in times past, with a ciuill adoration or worship of loue, not with a religious seruice. There is also a due reuerence &amp; estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such things as are sanctified to holy vses, as of the Tabernacle, Arke, Altar, Sacrifice in the Law: such now are the Sacraments, which are duely to be reuerenced, yet not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, or kneeled vnto. So we conclude, that all religious seruice and worship belongeth onely vnto God, and it were great idolatrie, to giue it to any other, <hi>Fulke annot. Apocal.</hi> 19. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. The scripture is plaine: <hi>Math.</hi> 4 10. Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.

                              <hi>Bellarm.</hi> answereth to the first, that <hi>Peter</hi> of modestie refused the homage of <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. <hi>Peter</hi> giueth this reason, why he would not haue <hi>Cornelius</hi> so to do, I also am a man (saith he:) thereby letting him to vnderstand, that such kind of worship ought not to be giuen to any man: The same reason is rendered <hi>Acts.</hi> 14. by <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas,</hi> why they refused sacrifice: We also (say they) are men. If <hi>Peter</hi> did of modesty refuse <hi>Cornelius</hi> worship, then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did for modesty sake onely likewise refuse to be sacrificed vnto, which I am sure they will not graunt.</p>

                              <hi>Bellarm.</hi> to the second saith, that <hi>Iohn</hi> did well in worshipping the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and the Angell did well in refusing to be worshipped: for though the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of right are to be worshipped, yet they do well to refuse it, for reuerence to the humanitie and manhoode of Christ.

For they say, that Iohn was deceiued in the person of the Angel, taking him for Christ, &amp; is forbidden by the Angel to worship him as God: but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> altogether freeth <hi>Iohn</hi> from all error, and commendeth his dooing: whereas it is certaine, that <hi>Iohn</hi> knew well enough that he was an Angell, but being carried away in the ecstasie of his minde, did for the present time forget himselfe. And that the Angell did not of modestie refuse to be worshipped, but absolutely and simply, it is made manifest by his answer to <hi>Iohn,</hi> Worship thou
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:20636:171"/>
God: He would not haue the Apostle to worship him, but God.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to the third saith, that the Apostles did well in refusing to be sacrificed vnto: because to offer sacrifice is an external act of worship to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed onely to God, <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. What reason haue they to burne incense vnto saints and their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, rather then to offer sacrifice? For it appeareth in the law, that the burning of incense was more precious, &amp; a more high point of the Leuitical seruice, then was the offering of sacrifice. 1. The Altar of incense was more curiously made, being ouerlayed with fine golde, and was called the golden altar, the other for burnt offerings, the brasen Altar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.26.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <hi>2.</hi> The altar of incense was placed in the Tabernacle neare vnto the most holy place, the other altar stood at the doore without, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.26.29. <hi>3.</hi> The ministers were diuerse: the priests offered sacrifice in their courses, but <hi>Aaron</hi> onely and his successours the high priests burned incense, Exod. 30.7. <hi>4.</hi> Vpon the brasen altar incense was offered with other sacrifices, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 2. But vpon the golden altar no burnt sacrifice or any oblation, but onely incense was offered vnto God. 5. Of all offrings &amp; oblations, it most liuely prefigureth the sacrifice of atonement wrought by Christ vpon the crosse, who therefore is called by the Apostle, A sacrifice of sweete smelling sauour vnto God, Ephe. 5.2. Seeing then that the offering of incense was a more soueraigne thing in the Lawe, then was the oblation of sacrifices: there is small reason for it, that our aduersaries should reserue the lesse, that is, the offering of sacrifices for the Lord, and participate the greater &amp; more worthie seruice, that is, censing of odors &amp; perfumes vnto saintes, as <hi>Bellarm.</hi> doth, <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 2. If sacrifice were not then to be offered to saints, much lesse are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be made now vnto them: for to cal vpon God is a greater thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sacrifice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. <hi>ver.</hi> 8.14. If saints can not chalenge the lesse, that is, to haue sacrifices, they haue no right to the greater, namely, to bee called vpon and prayed vnto.</p>
                           <p>Lastly, <hi>Augustine</hi> sayeth, <hi>Non sit nobis Religio cultus hominum mortuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quia si piè vixerunt, non sic habentur, vt tales quaerant honores, sed illum a nobis coli volunt, quo illuminante laetantur meriti sui nos esse consortes: honorandi ergo sunt propter imitationem, non adorandi propter religione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Let vs not make it any part of Religion to worshippe men that are dead: for if they liued well, they are now in that state, that they need not, neither do require any honour at our handes: but they would haue vs to worship God: by whose illumination or reuelation, they may vnderstand, and do reioyce, that we are partakers and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the same faith.

                           <p>Ans. 1. He taketh that for graunted, which is chiefely in question: for it is idolatry to pray vnto any other but vnto God: Call vpon me in the day of trouble, <hi>Psalme</hi> 50.15. It is not lawfull to pray vnto saintes, therefore not to vow.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. To make vowes is a more strict and binding act of religion, then prayer is: for in euery vow there is a prayer: we pray God to giue vs grace to performe the thing vowed: and there is beside a full purpose of the heart with a solemne promise, whereby we bind our selues to the perfourming. Again we may make petition &amp; request vnto mortal men, but vowes we can make none vnto them: It would not therefore follow, though saints might be prayed vnto, that they are also capable of our vowes.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is also lawfull (they say) to sweare by the name of Saintes, because all is referred to the honour of God; as hee that sweareth by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, sweareth also by him that dwelleth therein. <hi>Rhemist. Mathew</hi> 21. <hi>sect.</hi> 8.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. In this place Christ reproueth the Pharisies for their swearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and condemneth it by this argument: that howsoeuer they thought it a smal matter to sweare by the Temple, yet in effect they did sweare by God himselfe. See the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the boldnes of these men, that dare iustifie swearing by creatures by the same reason, that Christ condemneth it. 2. Our Sauiour saith nothing but this, that in euery othe there is an inuocation of the diuine power, and therefore whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sweareth by a creature, committeth idolatrie, in making it his God.</p>

                           <p>Againe, the vowes of Christians are not to binde them selues to go in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, or to offer vnto this Saint or that, this Image or that, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>alius pallium, alius oleum, alius ceram,</hi> one voweth a cloke, another oyle,<note place="margin">De tempor.

                           <p>Argum. 1. The <hi>Shunamite</hi> fell downe and embraced <hi>Eliseus</hi> feete, <hi>2. King.</hi> 4.27: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Popes feete ought to be kissed.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1 Your popes must be first as holy men as this Prophet was, who was thus reuerenced for his holynes, before they can challenge the like honor.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 This reuerence to the prophet was voluntary in the woman, not looked for or exacted by the prophet, as the pope looketh for it of duty.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Heere is no mention made of kissing of feete, but onely that she caught him by the feete, which was partly a signe of her ioy, that she had met with the prophet, partely by this sodain and disordered gesture, the prophet percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that she was troubled in minde, for <hi>Gehazi</hi> would haue thrust her away, but he said, Let her alone, for her spirite is troubled within her.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 This is no warrant for the pope to offer his feete to be kissed of Kinges and Emperours, because the woman fell downe at the prophetes feete: think you, that if the King of Israel had so done, the prophet would haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it?</p>

                           <p>Ans. What arrogancie is this, that the pope a mortall and sinfull man, should challenge that honor which was done to Christ being God in the flesh, and void of sinne?

                           <p>THe kissing of the feete, was an humble and lowly gesture, which was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily vsed toward our Sauiour Christ, who was God in the flesh, and in his body and humanity annexed to his Godhead, as God to be worshipped: but it is too diuine, and too lowly an homage to be offered to any mortall man: and holy men in times past refused it, when any carried away with immoderat zeal and admiration of their person, were ready to giue it vnto them.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. When <hi>Cornelius</hi> fell downe at <hi>Peters</hi> feete, the holy Apostle would not suffer him to do it. The pope is of a cleane contrary spirite to <hi>S. Peter</hi>: for he refused it beeing offered: the Pope holdeth out his toe, and offereth it to be kissed, and vrgeth men thereunto.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2 If such kissing of feete be commendable, how commeth it to passe that the pope only hath holy feete to kisse; and not other Bishoppes and Clergy men, as well as he?</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. <hi>Moyses</hi> rehearseth only the couenant, which the Lord made with these holy men and their seede, as the wordes following do shew, To whome thou swarest by thine owne selfe, and swarest vnto them, I will multiplye your seede: <hi>Moyses</hi> therefore pleadeth not the merits of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> but vrgeth and presseth the promise of God, and couenant made with them.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. The saints do pray one for another here vpon earth, and do one desire an anothers prayers: as <hi>S. Paul Rom. 15. Ephes. 6.

                           <p>Ans. 1.

Wee do not desire the godly liuing to pray for vs, as our Mediators, or as though by their worthines we are brought into the fauour of God, as you say the saints do: and therefore your argument followeth not, from the prayer of the liuing to the prayer of the dead. 3.

                           <p>Ans. The scripture euery where teacheth that we must beleeue in God, and that they are cursed that put any confidence in man, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.5.

                           <p>THe bodies of Martyrs are reuerently to be brought to the ground, in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of our hope of their resurrection, and their memorie is to be honored, as in praising God for their constant martyrdome: so the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sayth, Right precious in the sight of God is the death of his Saints, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 116. As also in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their steps, and propounding vnto vs their good example: but to adore and worship their bones, to kisse, and kneele downe at their sepulchres, is to too grosse idolatrie, and not to be vsed amongst Christians.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 The Lord did of purpose himselfe burie the bodie of <hi>Moses</hi> in a secret place, which was neuer knowne to the Israelites: and this reason is generally rendered by most writers, lest the people of Israel should worship his body, and so commit idolatrie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the adoration of the bodies of Saints displeaseth God: <hi>Argum.

                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that though the people of Israel might by that meanes
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:20636:177"/>
haue fallen into idolatrie, yet the people of God may now more safely honour reliques, because they are not so prone to idolatrie.</p>
                           <p>Ans. Experience of popish idolatrie proueth the cleane contrarie: for the like superstition and worshipping of images was neuer so common and vsuall, no not in the most corrupt times of that Church, as now it is in poperie.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Our Sauiour Christ reproueth the Scribes and Pharisees, calling them hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, because they did garnish the sepulchres of the Prophets, whom their forefathers put to death, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.29. But their doctrine they neglected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not. Such hypocrites are the Papists at this day, who commit a double fault: for they contemne the doctrine of the Apostles, whose memories they would seeme to honour: and againe, in the superstitious honour and worship, which they yeeld vnto them, they exceed the bonds of Christian pietie.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Their bodies were not to be worshipped when they were aliue, much lesse now they are dead. What are they now but earth, dust and ashes? according as the Lord sayd to <hi>Adam,</hi> Thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou returne, <hi>Genes.</hi> 3.19. What is this els, but to worship the earth, euen dust and ashes? So <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> saith: <hi>Timeo adorare terram ne damnet me, qui fecit coelum &amp; terram:</hi> I am afraid to worship the earth, lest he condemne me, that made both heauen and earth. Onely in Christ (sayth he) I finde, <hi>quomodo sine impietate adoretur terra,</hi> how the earth, that is, his body, may be worshipped without any impietie: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because of the neere coniunction and vnion of his humane nature with the Godhead in one person: for otherwise of it selfe the bodie of Christ is Gods creature and workmanship, and not capable of diuine worship. This then is the priuiledge that Christ hath, more then all Saints and Martyrs beside, that in him onely the humanitie is adored.</p>

                           <p>WE denie not, but that the bodies of the dead, before they be interred, may bee conueyed vnto the place of their buriall, as <hi>Iosias</hi> was carried being dead by his seruants from <hi>Megiddo</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where a sepulchre was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 23.30. But either for the dead to be remoued to be buried in some one place more then another, for the holinesse thereof: or the bones of Saints to be raked out of their graues, and translated, with intent to shrine them, and set them vp to be adored: they are superstitious customes, and not vsed of ancient time among the people of God.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. That the place profiteth not the dead, but vnto them it is all alike wheresoeuer they are buried: we haue shewed afore, 1. <hi>part. controuer.</hi> 9 <hi>quaest.</hi> 2. <hi>part.</hi> 4. The example of <hi>Augustines</hi> mother is notable, and worthie the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: She had with great care prouided her a sepulchre neere vnto her husband, who dyed at <hi>Thagasta</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and was there buried, and was purposed her selfe to lye by him: but the Lord so disposed, that she left her life at <hi>Hostia</hi> in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> and being readie to depart, she sayd thus to her sonnes: <hi>Ponite hoc corpus vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque, nihil vos eius cura conturbet:</hi> Burie my bodie where you thinke good, take no great care for it. And being asked, if it grieued her not to leaue her body so farre off from her owne citie, she gaue this godly answere: <hi>Nihil longe est à Deo, neque timendum est, ne ille non agnoscat in fine seculi, vnde me resuscitet: August. lib. confess.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. No place is neerer to God then other, neither am I to feare, lest the Lord should not as well raise me vp in this place, as in mine owne citie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> in respect of the dead, it skilleth not where they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. The other custome of translating of reliques to be worshipped, is farre more impious and superstitious: for hereupon it commeth, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue been deceiued with false reliques: yea one and the selfe same relique is sayd to be in diuers places. As of S. <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> head: his face, they say, is at S. <hi>Iean Angelz:</hi> the rest of his head at <hi>Malta:</hi> his skull at <hi>Nemours:</hi> his braine at <hi>Nouium Rastrouiense:</hi> his iaw bone at <hi>Vesalium:</hi> a peece of his eare at S. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride:</hi> his forehead and haires in <hi>Spayne</hi> at S. <hi>Saluadores:</hi> and yet for all this his whole head is to bee seene at Saint <hi>Siluesters</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Amiens</hi> in <hi>France: Fulk. Matthew</hi> 14.2. Thus they haue mangled also the bodie of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> halfe (they say) is at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> halfe at Saint <hi>Paules:</hi> his head at Saint <hi>Iohn Laterane:</hi> his neather iawe with his beard at <hi>Poycters</hi> in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> at <hi>Triers</hi> many of his bones. <hi>Fulk.

here is, and abusing of simple people? How can their whole bodies bee in one place, and yet their parts and bones in another? And where doe they learne thus to dismember their bodies, and to rake them out of their graues? The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of the bodies of Martyrs, is to suffer them quietly to rest in their graues, and not to rot aboue the ground. <hi>Iosias</hi> honoured the Prophets sepulchre, and would not remoue his bones: herein therefore they dishonour the Martyrs, and offer violence to their bodies, thinking falsely that they doe great worship vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>

                              <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, that hee which would now renewe the ceremonies of the Iewes, that are as it were buried: <hi>tanquam sopitos cineres eruens, non erit pius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor aut baiulus corporis, sed impius sepulturae violator.

                           <p>Argum. 2.

                           <p>Of such cosoning trickes <hi>Augustine</hi> complained in his time, speaking of runnagate Monkes, he saith: <hi>Alij membra martyrum, si tamen martyrum, vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: Alij fimbrias suas, &amp; phylacteria magnificant:</hi> Some doe boast of reliques of Martyrs, which they carrie about, &amp; perhaps they are no such reliques: some doe extoll their habite and Monkish weede: <hi>De opere Monachorum, cap.</hi> 28.</p>

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:20636:179"/>
righteous? which worke first I doe (sayth Christ,) then he himselfe doth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I make him to doe it. <hi>Quod vtique in illo, sed non sine illo Christus operatur:</hi> Mans conuersion is wrought by Christ in man, &amp; not altogether without man, because Christ working in vs, doth enable vs by his grace to worke out our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2.12: yet is it not our selues that worke, but the grace of God in vs. Then it followeth, he shall doe greater workes then these: <hi>Prorsus maius hoc esse dixerim, quam est coelum &amp; terra:</hi> The redemption and conuersion of men, is a greater worke then the heauens or the earth: <hi>Tract in Iohann.</hi> 72. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> therefore doth properly vnderstand this place, not of outward miracles, but of the wonderfull conuersion of the heart, which we are sayd to worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ worketh it in vs.</p>

                           <p>WE both agree, that the power of working miracles was giuen of God: but herein we differ, they think that this power was inherent in the Apostles, and that hauing once receiued this power of God, they could execute it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: like as a man hauing the power of sense and mouing by nature, moueth and seeth when he list himselfe. But we hold against the Pelagians, <hi>Gratiam dei ad singulos actus dari,</hi> that the grace of God is daylie infused, and we haue need of it for euery act: it is not sufficient once generally to haue receiued it. So then the Apostles were but the instruments of Christs working: he is better sayd in them and by them to worke miracles, then they in and by him. Neither doth it followe, that they are dead instruments: for the horse (I trowe) that draweth in the plough is no dead instrument: yet he hath neede for euery boute and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to haue a driuer and a guide: truely we are as vnfit for the Lords yoke by nature, as the horse is for the plough: and therefore haue need of the Lords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall direction.

Secondly, it was her faith that healed her, for many that thronged Christ, touched his garments, but receiued no benefite: neither was there any vertue in his garments when the souldiers parted them amongst them.

                           <p>To the second: first, the napkins brought from <hi>Paul</hi> had no such vertue in them: for the text is plaine, that they were wrought by the hands of <hi>Paul.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not all that touched them were presently healed.

Images they confesse they haue, but no Idols, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                              <p>First, S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. That an Idoll is nothing: that is, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a thing that is not: as such were their heathenish Idols, <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Ans. First, the place is not so vnderstood: for the Apostle sayth, That things offered to Idols also are nothing, which were not made to represent any thing: But his meaning is this, that of themselues they are nothing to breede offence, neither were it needfull to shunne eating of Idoll sacrifices, or to abhorre an Idoll, but that they are abused and turned to the seruice of diuels, as it followeth in the next verse. Therefore an Idoll is not sayd to be nothing, because it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth a thing imagined, but that of it selfe, being but wood, or stone, or such like, it were not offensiue, if it were not abused to idolatrie. Secondly, all the portraictures of the Heathen were not Idols in this sense: for <hi>Iupiter, Mars, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, Hercules,</hi> whose images they had, were men sometime liuing. Thirdly, you haue images representing nothing: as the pictures of Angels, of God the Father, of the holy Ghost, which haue no shape nor likenes. Againe, you haue also your imagined Saints, as <note n="o" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 1. de sanctor. beati. ca. 20.</note> S. <hi>George,</hi> S. <hi>Christopher,</hi> for there were neuer any such: and therefore you haue Idols as well as the Heathen.</p>

                              <p>Ans. You flatly controll the law of God, which simply forbiddeth any simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to be made of things in heauen or in earth to worship God by.

                              <p n="1">1. Such images of the Trinitie among the Papists, are made to resemble the diuinitie and Godhead: for to what purpose els should such images be made? <hi>Fulk.

They picture God the Father like an old man: because in that forme he appeared to <hi>Daniel:</hi> but how knowe they whether it were God the Father, rather then God the Sonne, who is as old as God the Father, or then the whole Godhead? They commend also the image of God the Father with the world in his hand: which is a lying image, and maketh simple people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the world was made onely by God the Father, which was the worke of the whole Trinitie. Some of the Papists themselues, as <hi>Abulensis, Durandus, Peresius,</hi> doe hold, that the image of God ought not to be made, and that it is rather tolerated, then allowed in the Church.</p>
                              <p>As for the images of Christ in the forme of a Lambe, and the holy Ghost in shape of a Doue, <hi>Bartholomaeus Caranza,</hi> a papist, sheweth that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the sixt generall Synode, Canon. 28.

And againe, the image, which is made of his bodily shape, is no more the image of Christ, then of any other man, <hi>Fulk. Act.</hi> 17. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</p>
                              <p>But some will say, if Christs image cannot conueniently be made, because it expresseth not his Godhead; by the same reason we cannot make a picture of a man, because his soule being inuisible cannot be painted.</p>
                              <p>Ans. The reason is not alike: for he that pictureth a man liuing, setteth forth the life, beautie and motion of the bodie, by which effects, by a consequent, the soule is resembled, which causeth and worketh these things in the bodie: but in the bodily shape of Christ, there cannot be made to appeare any such noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious signes of his Godhead.</p>

of Saints to be reuerenced, because they are their Images, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                              <p>Ans. First, man is a liuely image of Gods owne making, images of Saints are the workes of men. Secondly, no image can so liuely represent a Saint, being but a dead thing, as man who hath a liuing soule is the image of God. Thirdly, we doe reuerence men with ciuill honour, not with religious worship, as they doe their images. Fourthly, though Gods image in man were to be worshipped: yet it would not followe, that Saints images should: for all diuine worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to God: but the Saints themselues, though they were aliue, are not to be worshipped, much lesse their images.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 4. The chiefe <hi>Iconomachi,</hi> that is, enemies or oppugners of Idols, say they, are the Iewes, Samaritanes, Mahometanes: yea the diuell himselfe loueth no images, <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Ans. First, it followeth not, the Iewes and Turkes abhorre images, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christians ought to loue them: for the heathen hated many vices, which are also to be abhorred of Christians. Secondly, they were not the first <hi>Iconoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> Image haters: for <hi>Moses</hi> was an <hi>Iconomach,</hi> when he caused the golden Calfe to be burnt to powder: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> an <hi>Iconomach,</hi> that brake downe the brasen serpent: <hi>Iosiah</hi> an <hi>Iconomach,</hi> that caused the Idols to bee destroyed, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 23. Nay, God himselfe was the first <hi>Iconomach,</hi> that forbiddeth Images and Idols to be made in the moral law. Thirdly, I pray you where did the Iesuite learne, that the diuel hateth an image? I am sure the scripture speaketh contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that what was offered to Idols was sacrificed to diuels, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.20.</p>

                              <p>THat Images or Idols are not at all to be reuerenced or worshipped, or to be made, or set vp in Churches, or in any other place for any religious, or rather irreligious vse: thus out of the holy scriptures we make it plaine.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 1. The making of any similitude or likenes, to fall downe before it and worship it, is flatly forbidden in the second commandement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> they are not to be worshipped. So likewise, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Isai.</hi> 40.18. and in many other places in the old Testament, Worshipping of Images, which is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, manifestly forbidden in the new Testament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.20. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Ergo,</hi> not lawfull.</p>
                              <p>Ans. One <hi>Catharinus</hi> a great Papist, sayth, that the commandement in the lawe against images, was but temporall, and to continue but till the establishing of the new Testament. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vtterly misliketh this answere, being most absurd, for the morall lawe is perpetuall, <hi>De imaginib. sanct. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. They doe giue therefore a more deliberate answere: that the scriptures doe reproue and condemne the idolatrie of the heathen, which worshipped their images as Gods. But so doe not they: they make no account of them, as they affirme, for their matter or forme, but for that relation they haue to the things whose ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they are, <hi>Rhemist.

                                 <pb n="352" facs="tcp:20636:183"/>Ans. First, the Iewes also in their golden Calfe had a relation to that God that brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 32.4.5. The like relation had <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> in setting vp of his Calues, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 12.28. for they were not so mad as to thinke that a Calfe brought them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And it appeareth yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Aaron</hi> sayth, To morowe shall be the Lords holy day: the word is <hi>Iehouah:</hi> which name the Iewes only ascribed vnto God: So <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Micah</hi> his mother sayth, that she had consecrated the shekles of siluer to the Lord <hi>Iehouah,</hi> to make a molten Image: wherefore in their Images they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, and yet were they reproued for their idolatrie. The like relation the Gentiles also had in their Idols, as <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth: <hi>Non ego illum lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem colo, &amp;c. adoro, quem video, sed seruio ei quem non video. Quis est ille? Numen quoddam inuisibile quod praesidet illi simulachro.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">in Psal. 96.</note> I doe not worship that carued stone or Image: I reuerence that I see, but I serue or worship that I see not: that is, a certaine diuine spirit, which is president in that image. Wherefore popish idolatrie can no more be excused by this shift of reference or relation, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Iewes or Gentiles, that pretended the same colour.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 It may be proued by the practise of the popish Church in England, that simply without any such relation or signification they commanded Images to be worshipped. <hi>Thomas Man</hi> Martyr troubled, because he beleeued not in the Crucifixe.<note place="margin">Fox p. 815. artic. 7.</note> 
                                 <hi>Robert Raue</hi> of <hi>Dorney</hi> molested, because he sayd, that an Image gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with mans hand, is neither God, nor our Ladie, but made for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Saints: nor wee ought to worship any thing, but God and our Ladie, and not images of Saints,<note place="margin">Fox. p. 850.</note> which are but stockes and stones. Mistresse <hi>Alice Dolie</hi> brought into trouble for saying, We should not worship that thing that hath eares,<note place="margin">pag. 984.</note> and eyes, and can neither see, nor heare. These good men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we see, were persecuted in those daies for denying worship to Images, as they were Images. So then the popish doctrine was (as it appeareth) that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were simply to be worshipped.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 2. <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> 9.20. Worshippers of Idols of siluer and gold are there condemned: which can be no other but the Papists: for that prophecie is to be fulfilled in the latter times towards the end of the world, after the opening of the seuenth seale and blowing of the sixt trumpet. But there is no knowne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world, nor hath not been many a day, that worshippe Images, but the popish Synagogue.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 3. Man is the image of God, and yet is not worshipped: how much lesse ought we to worship carued images, which are but made with mens ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? As <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Opera hominum non colenda, meliores sunt artifices:</hi> The han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die workes of men are not to be worshipped, the workmen themselues are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet not worshipped. What foule idolatrie is this, to preferre the workes of mens hands, before the worke and image of God, to despise men, and haue in so great regard dead stockes and stones.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 4. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth: <hi>Noui multos esse sepulchrorum &amp; picturarum ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratores:</hi> I know there are many which worship sepulchres and pictures. Of these

he warneth men to take heed, <hi>Noli consectari turbas imperitorum:</hi> Followe not such vnlearned and vnskilful multitudes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that <hi>Augustine</hi> wrote thus when he was a young man, and not fully conuerted, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. A sillie shift: yet we will vouchsafe an answere, though it be worthie of none. Let vs heare what <hi>Augustine</hi> thought when he was old, and stayed in iudgement: <hi>Iam verò artifex melior est eis, quem te tamen puderet adorare: melior &amp; tu,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">in Psal. 113</note> 
                                 <hi>quamuis ea non feceris, quoniam, quae illa non possunt facis, melior &amp; bestia.</hi> The workman is better then the image, who gaue fashion and shape vnto it, yet thou wouldest be ashamed to worship him: thou thy selfe art better, for thou canst doe many things which that cannot: nay a bruite beast that heareth and seeth is better.

                              <p>WE haue shewed before that Images ought not to be worshipped at all, and that all religious worship is due onely vnto God: wherefore to vs this question is superfluous, with what religious worship Images are to be adored: for no religious worship at all is due vnto them: yet let vs vouchsafe the while, to see the contradictions that are amongst them, and the absurdities that they are driuen vnto.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 Our <hi>Rhemists</hi> confesse, that Images are not at all to be worshipped with any diuine honour, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>sect.</hi> 5. But it was decreed in the idolatrous Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> the second, and maintained by <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Bonauentur, Caietanus,</hi> and other papists, that the image of God is to bee worshipped with the same worship that is due vnto God. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> commeth not much short of them, that sayth, <hi>improprie,</hi> improperly Images may haue the same worship: as the Kings ambassadour improperly is honoured as the King. I pray you how farre are these men from making their Images Gods? for they say they are the Lords deputies and Vicegerents, as the ambassadour is for the King.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="354" facs="tcp:20636:184"/>Againe, the <hi>Rhemists</hi> affirme, that the Images of Christ are not to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or accounted of, but for the respect and relation they haue to our Sauiour, <hi>Annot.

So the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councel determineth, <hi>Sess.</hi> 25. <hi>Honos, qui eis debetur, refertur ad prototypa, quae illae repraesentant:</hi> The honor due vnto them is to be referred vnto those things which they represent.

                              <p n="2">2. Let vs see their absurdities. First, they hold that all images are not to be worshipped alike: for they make 3. degrees of religious worship; the highest, which they call <gap reason="foreign">

                              <p>Thus it commeth about, that a Roode of wood representing Christ, is more to be honored, then an Image of our Ladie of siluer; and Her image, if it be but of stone, is more to be reuerenced then a Saints image of gold: and thus the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of nature, which is giuen these things by creation, is inuerted.</p>
                              <p>Againe, whereas beside these three deuised worships, which are properly due (as they say) to the Saints, not to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Argum. 2 The Crosse of Christ was found out, say they, in <hi>Constantines</hi> time the great, by a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge miracle: for there were three crosses digged vp, which had beene a long time buried in the earth: the two crosses vpon the which the 2. theeues suffered, the 3. whereon our Sauiour hung: They brought them al three to a woman that then lay very sick, they laid the two first to her, and she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned as she was; then they applyed the third, and she was presently made whole. <hi>Bellarm. ex Ruffino: Ergo,</hi> the Crosse is holy and to be worshipped.</p>
                              <p>Ans. The inuention of the Crosse by <hi>Helena Constantines</hi> mother, seemeth to be a forged and fabulous storie.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. <hi>Eusebius</hi> that writeth of the life of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the Actes of <hi>Helena</hi> and registreth diuerse matters of lesse importance, yea hee sheweth howe the

Mount Caluarie, where the heathen had built Idolatrous Temples, was purged, and in that place (say they) the Crosse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was found, yet he maketh no mention at all of the inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Crosse: which it is very like he would not haue omitted, if there had bene any such thing.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The most auncient author that writeth of this matter, is <hi>Ambrose, deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitu Theodosii,</hi> which oration <hi>Erasmus</hi> thinketh to be forged in <hi>Ambroses name.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. There is great disagreement amongst writers about this storie. <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayeth, the Crosse was knowen by the tytle that <hi>Pilate</hi> fastened to it. <hi>Sozome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> say, the letters were worne out, and it could not be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the tytle. <hi>Paulinus</hi> sayth, the way to discerne it, was reuealed to <hi>Helena: Ruffinus</hi> ascribeth the deuise to <hi>Macarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem: Paulinus</hi> saith, it was knowen by raising vp a dead man to life: <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> by restoring a sick wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to health, <hi>Fulk annot. Iohn 19 sect. 2.</hi> Thus we see of what small credit this storie is. And be it graunted, that there might be some such thing found: yet they must bring better proofe for that miraculous inuention, before we wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it.</p>

                              <p>WE are not taught any where in the worde of God, to giue any religious worship to any creature, nor to adore stockes and stones, no nor the very Crosse it selfe, whereon Christ was crucified, if it were nowe to bee seene or had.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 1. If there had belonged vnto the Church any religious care of it, the Apostles would (no doubt) haue procured the safe keeping thereof, and not haue suffered the Church to want it 300. yeeres: and it had beene an easier sute for <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to begge the Crosse, then the body of Iesus.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 2. If the Crosse were to be adored, we are vncertaine which it is, and where to be had; and so might worship a common peece of wood, for the wood of the Crosse: for there is no doubt but this relique is forged and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyted as the rest be. <hi>Euegrius</hi> saith, the Crosse was at <hi>Apamea: Ruffinus,</hi> that it was left at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that <hi>Helena</hi> sent a peece of it to <hi>Constantinople</hi>: and in many other places there are peeces of the Crosse to bee seene, which if they were all laied together (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith) would fill a shippe: for why? <hi>Paulinus</hi> witnesseth, that the Crosse remaineth whole at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as though it had been neuer touched, though innumerable peeces be dayly cut off from it, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of men. But this fable that goeth vnder the name of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the Papistes themselues are ashamed of.</p>
                              <p>But if the true and right Crosse were to be had; why might it not be serued, if people beganne to abuse it to Idolatrie, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> serued the brasen serpent? he brake it in peeces, when the people began to make an Idol of it.</p>

                                    <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>43</label> see is had in great honour amongst our aduersaries: They kneele downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their crucifix, weare it in their bosomes next to their heart, carry it in their iourneyes, set it vp to be adored in their churches.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 1. As adoration was done vnto God in olde time, at and before the Arke and Tabernacle, so it may be done now, at, or before a crucifix, relique, image, <hi>Rhemist. annot. Heb. 11. sect. 9.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Ans. 1. It is not al one to worship God at or before a thing, as to worship and adore the thing: the Israelits worshipped God, in, at or before the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yet did they not worship the Tabernacle, as you do the crucifix.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. They might worship God before the Arke, because they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so to do: but it is not lawfull to fall downe before a crucifix, because all such images are flatly in the 2. commandement forbidden.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 2. The signe of the crosse appeared to <hi>Constantine</hi> in the ayer, he caused the crosse to be carried before him as an ensigne in battail: When the <hi>Iewes</hi> had leaue of <hi>Iulian</hi> to build the Temple, there were Crosses seene euery where in their garmentes, and many such apparitions haue there beene of the Crosse: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is to be honoured and worshipped, <hi>Bellarmine cap.</hi> 28.</p>
                              <p>Ans. 1. What if <hi>Constantine</hi> caused the Crosse to be carried before him, stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it in his coyne, set vp his picture with the Crosse in his hand? all this we grant was done, &amp; may be done againe: It was but a ciuil, no religious vse of the Crosse: He worshipped it not, vnlesse you will say, he set vp his owne image with the Crosse in his hand to be worshipped.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As for the apparitions of the Crosse (though wee think many of them to be forged) yet wee deny not, but that the Lord hath and may yet shewe, what signes and tokens it pleaseth him in the Heauen, and the earth: yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that the signe of the crosse should therfore be worshipped, because it was shewed to <hi>Constantine,</hi> no more then other signes and strange sights that many times appeare in the aire.</p>
                              <p>For the other apparition of Crosses in the <hi>Iewes</hi> garmentes, wee will

require it with another, and yet you shal gaine nothing by it. <hi>Anno. 1505.</hi> vnder the raigne of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> there appeared diuerse tokens of bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy crosses, the nayles, the spunge, the speare, and other signes of Christs passion, in the garments of men and women, yea in their rockes, while they were a spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, reported by <hi>Francis Mirandula, Carion, Functius, Melancton, Flaccius</hi>: But the Popish Chronologers make no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, as <hi>Christianus Masseus,</hi> &amp; others of that profession. As the Crosses in the Iewes garments, that went about to establish their ceremonies againe, did shew, that do what they could, the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that is, the preaching of his Crosse should take place, as it did: so these signes in <hi>Germany</hi> did porte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that the gospel in <hi>Germany</hi> should be preached, though the Papistes striued neuer so much against it. But it is a farre fetcht conclusion, to inferre heereupon, that the signe or Image of the Crosse is to be adored.</p>

                              <p>THe Image of the Crosse of Christ, is neither to be painted, carued, grauen, for any religious vse, nor to be adored or worshipped: but men so doing do fal into the grieuous and high offence and sinne of idolatrie.</p>
                              <p>Argu. 1. The Scripture neuer calleth the Crosse, whereon Christ suffered, the holy Crosse, as the papistes do, but rather cursed: for <hi>S. Paul</hi> proueth that Christ became accursed for vs, because he dyed vpon the Crosse, according to the scripture, Cursed is euery one that hangeth on a tree. Howe then is it nowe honored, which was then accursed? And if all crosses are worthy honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Christ his Crosse, then why not all nayles, and speares? for with them he was pearsed; al thornes also, because of his crowne of thornes: yea, &amp; al horse-mangers too, because he was laid in a Cribbe?</p>

                              <p>Ans. First, we must haue better scriptures then Apocryphal stories to build our faith vpon: The good angels of God haue power from God to driue away euill spirits, though they vse no externall signes: yet it followeth not, that euery man may do that which is granted to the Angels, though we should admit the storie. Secondly, <hi>Dauid</hi> not so much by the sound of his Harpe refreshed <hi>Saul,</hi> as by his godly songs and musicke chased away the spirit: neither did the euill spirit depart from him, but he for the while found some ease: his phantasticall and melancholy fits which Sathan wrought vpon, being by his pleasant harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie somewhat allayed. Thirdly, all this being granted, yet haue they not proued by these examples, that Pagans and Infidels, by the signe of the Crosse, may chase away euill spirits.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. That things are hallowed and blessed by the signe of the Crosse, they also proue it, because the Crosse being an holy signe in it selfe, doth communicate holines vnto the things signed with the Crosse: <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 130.</p>

the sacrifices of the wicked, though they lay vpon the Altar, were not thereby sanctified, but were an abomination, being not offered in a right faith: Nay, there is no outward ceremonie so holy, as that it can impart the holines to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: as it is shewed, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.13.

                           <p>Argu. 1. Paradise was built in the East, <hi>Genes.</hi> 2.8. and therefore we ought to pray that way, for desire we haue to our Country.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="363" facs="tcp:20636:188"/>Ans. 1. Paradise was then Eastward vnto <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> being in the Wildernes, when he wrote this storie: but it cannot be East to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an nations: for Paradise being planted in <hi>Eden</hi> which was part of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> must needes be West to the <hi>Persians,</hi> South to the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Tartarians,</hi> North to the <hi>Aethiopians</hi>: wherefore this reason is not generall for all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Christian nations. Secondly, it skilleth not where that earthly Paradise is situate: our heauenly Paradise is in heauen, which is euery where open to all true beleeuers.</p>
                           <p>Argu. 2. Wee looke for Christ to come in the East to iudgement, therefore we pray toward the East: As the lightning shineth from the East to the West, so shall the comming of the Sonne of man be. <hi>Math. 27.24.</hi> Therefore he shall appeare toward the East. <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. By that similitude of the lightening, the sodainnes of his appearing, not the place is declared. Secondly, it is great presumption to define that which the Scripture hath not reuealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christes comming is onely generally set downe, he shall come in the cloudes, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.30.

                           <p>TO vs it is no matter, which way Churches are builded, we may turne our selues in praier as well toward any one parte of the heauens, as an other: Neither doe we refuse to pray in Churches builded toward the East. But that our Oratories and places of praier ought rather to be builded that way, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; out of the Scripture it cannot be proued, and we holde it as a meere su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious opinion.</p>
                           <p>Argu. 1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth men euery where to lift vp pure handes. 1. <hi>Tim. 2.8.</hi> He saith, In euery place, without exception, whether toward the East or the West, or wheresoeuer.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If any place were more daungerous then other to pray in, it is not so safe, and perhaps more perilous to pray toward the East for Idolaters were wont to turne them toward the East, and to worship the Sunne rising. <hi>Ezech. 8.17.</hi> And for this cause the holy place in the Tabernacle was toward the West. <hi>Exod. 26.27.</hi> And it was the custome of the Iewes to pray Westward, least they should be entised to worship the Sunne rising in his strength. And therfore the Iesuite maketh but a bad argument: The Iewes praied toward the West, <hi>Ergo.</hi> christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans must pray toward the East: nay rather contrary, because they turned their backe to the East, for feare of Idolatry; Christians, if any place were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded more then other, ought vpon the same ground also to follow the same custome, for as much as all men by nature are prone to Idolatrie: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:20636:189"/>
of their so praying, seemeth rather to be morall, then ceremoniall: This I say not, as though I commended the Iewes superstitious praying toward the West, but onely to shew that they haue better reason for their custome, then our aduersaries haue for their superstitious turning toward the East.

But where learne they that our Churches ought to haue a sanctuary, as the Iewish Temple had? that was an euident type, and is now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in our Sauiour Christ, who is now entred into the heauens, as the high Priest then entred into the holy place to make atonement for the people. <hi>Heb. 9.24.</hi> This therefore is very grosse, to reuiue and renew again Iewish types and figures. And if herein they wil imitate the building of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:20636:189"/>
haue a Sanctuary, why doe they not also build toward the West, as the Temple was? why bring they not their Altar downe into the body of the Church? for in their holy place there was no Altar. And indeed, Altar we acknowledge none, as afterward shalbe proued. But we see no reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why the communion Table may not be set in the body of the Church, as well as in the Chauncell, if the place be more conuenient and fit to receiue the Communicants. But I pray you why is your Altar rather set in your Sanctuary, then the Fonte or Baptistery? they are both Sacraments, as well Baptisme as the Lords Supper: why should one be preferred, as holier then the other?</p>
                              <p>Secondly, all things in the Church ought to be done vnto edifiyng, and therefore we allow no such partitions, as doe hinder the edifiyng of the people and exclude them from hearing: as in popish Churches the Priest is pued or mued vp by himselfe a great way off, that his voice can hardly be perceiued of the people: The Minister is so to stand and turne himselfe as he may be best heard and vnderstood of the people: as <hi>Ezra</hi> had a pulpit of wood to stand in when he read the Law, <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> 8.<hi>4.</hi>

The Apostle speaketh expressely of participation of the sacrifice of Christs death, (as it is manifest in the 2. verses next following) which is by a Christian faith, and not in the Sacrament onely, whereof none can be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers that remayne in the ceremonial obseruations of the Leuitical sacrifices. For the Apostle speaketh manifestly, <hi>verse 12.</hi> of the suffering of Christ without the gate: Christ therefore is the altar, yea our Priest and sacrifice too. You abuse this place to proue your materiall popish altars, which are many: but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, we haue an altar, speaking of one.</p>

                              <p>Argum. 1. The Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> was ordained euen for the prayers of priuate men: and <hi>Salomon</hi> prayeth vnto God, that they might be heard. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. So <hi>Anna</hi> prayed in the Tabernacle, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.

                              <p>Ans. 1. See what Iewish arguments here are: because the Lord gaue an especiall blessing to his Temple amongst the Iewes, that was the onely place for sacrifices, and so also a peculiar priuiledged place for prayer: therefore hee will binde and tye himselfe to some certaine place now. But our Sauiour sayth cleane contrary vnto the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> The houre co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth when ye shall neither in this mountaine, nor in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> worship my Father, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.21.

                              <p>Argum. 1. The Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> was not only built for sacrifices and prayer, but for the Arke of God also: as <hi>Dauid</hi> sayeth to <hi>Nathan:</hi> Now I dwell in an house of Cedar trees, and the Arke of God remaineth within curtaines. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2.

                              <p>Ans. 1. When you haue a commandement to build Churches for reliques, as they had to build a Temple for the arke, ye may be bolde to do it.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. To build a Temple for the arke, was all one as to build an house for the Lord: for it was the Mercieseate of God: it pleased the Lord to dwell betweene the Cherubims, there to shewe euident tokens of his presence. And whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> consulted to build an house for the arke, the Lord doeth thus answere him by his Prophet: Shalt thou build me an house for my dwelling? verse 5. So the Temple was made in the honour of God, being made for the Arke. It
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:20636:192"/>
was all one, for the Arke to dwell there, and the Lord him selfe to dwell there: This argument therefore maketh nothing for them.</p>

                              <p>Argum. 1. No diuine worship is to be giuen to Saints, therefore no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be made in their names For it is part of the diuine worshippe to haue Temples.</p>

Dei, lib. 8. cap. vlt.</note> Wee doe not ordaine Temples, Priesthoodes, or sacrifices for Martyres: for not they, but their God, is both their God and ours: None therefore is to haue a Temple but God. But marke I pray you their distinction: They say, that Religious houses as they are Temples, are onely consecrated to God, but as they are <hi>Basilica,</hi> palaces, sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildinges, the selfe same Churches may be dedicate to Saintes. <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Ans. If one and the same Church may be consecrate both to God and to some saint beside, I pray you who is the principal patrone of that church: God or the saint? You will say I am sure, God is. But I will proue the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath the name of the faint: It is called by the name of <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul,</hi> or some other, not by the name of God: Thus they are not contented to make saintes Gods fellowes, but will euen thrust him out of place, giuing vnto saintes the honor of Gods house.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. How names are to be giuen to places, wee can not better learne, then of those auncient founders of names the holy Patriarches: As <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 22.14. calleth the mountaine <hi>Iehouah-iireh,</hi> The Lord hath seene. So <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> giueth holy names to the place where he met the Angelles, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.2. and where he wrestled with the Angell, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. They as we see gaue holy and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names vnto places, not made peculiar for Gods seruice, but onely for ciuil vse for the places to be called and knowen by: how much more ought churches and houses of God to be called by his name?</p>
                              <p>We therefore conclude, that Churches ought not to bee erected in Saintes names, to worship them thereby, and make them our Patrones, mediators, and presenters of our prayers: for this were great Idolatrie: Euen like as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then called their Temples by the names of their Idolles, <hi>Venus, Iupiter, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and the lyke: Yet wee refuse not to call our Churches by the names of Saintes, as they haue beene called of olde, because wee are not inuentors
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:20636:193"/>
of names; and termes inured by continuall custome can hardly be left. Wee vse them only as ciuil termes to distinguish places by: if any otherwise vse them, for any Religious purpose, they do amisse. And yet we deny not, but that the names of holy men may be safely remembred, by thankesgiuing vnto God for such excellent instruments, and setting before our eyes their good example. And concerning the names which haue bene superstitiously giuen in times past vnto Churches and other places (though it were to bee wished, that they neuer had beene so giuen) yet now we vse them (setting apart all superstition) as ciuill names of differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as <hi>S. Luke</hi> describeth the ship of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wherein they were carried, whose badge (saith he) was <hi>Castor</hi> &amp; <hi>Pollux, Act.</hi> 28.11. In a ciuil matter of description, hee refuseth not to vse the names of the heathen goddes. <hi>Augustine</hi> also giueth a good rule concerning such names. He speaketh of the names of dayes, which were called after the names of heathenish Idols, as the 4. day in the weeke, which we call Wednesday, was then called and is yet in the Latine toung,<note place="margin">In Psal. 93.</note> 
                                 <hi>Dies Mercurij,</hi> Mercurie his day. <hi>Sic dicitur, a paganis, &amp; a multis Christianis, sed nolumus vt dicant, et vtinam corriga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur: melius de ore Christiano ritus loquendi ecclesiasticus procedit.</hi> So it is called of the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of many chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but I would not haue them called so, and I wish they were amended: for a Christian kinde of speaking best becommeth a Christian. <hi>Sed si quem forte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                              <p>So say wee, it were to be wished, that we had names void of al shew of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition: but seeing for our speaking we must be ruled by custom, let vs know that those saints, by whose names places are called, are no Gods, nor Gods fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, nor patrons, or Mediators for vs, nor any way to bee worshipped: But they are the fellow seruants of all faithfull Christians, to bee reuerenced with a Christian duety of loue, not a religious worship of seruice.</p>

                           <p>Argum. 1. The Tabernacle of the Iewes was of exceeding beauty: the Curtaines therof, of silke; the vessels, euen to the snuffers for the Lampes, were of golde, the Priests garment had a breastplate of golde, set about with precious stones: Therfore why should not the Temples of Christians be in like sort ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and set foorth? as <hi>Isay</hi> prophecieth, that the Glory of Lebanon shal come,

                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. First, if the Iesuite had turned his argument and reasoned thus: the temple of the Iewes was gorgeous, and sumptuous, and beautifull to the eye: therfore Churches of Christians ought not to be so now: he had reasoned much better: for their seruing of God was externall; now God will be worshipped in spirit. All things were done vnto them in types and figures: the outward glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their temple was a liuely figure of the spirituall beautie of the Church of Christ. Secondly, where you would haue the prophecie of <hi>Isay</hi> to be literally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, you haue made a good argument for the Iewes: for then they shall haue their sanctuarie restored againe, which the Prophet speaketh of by name. And if that place of <hi>Isay</hi> haue a literall sense, why not that also, 54.10. I will lay thy stones with Carbuncle, and thy foundation with the Saphires: I wil make thy windowes of Emeraudes, and thy gates shining stones?

                           <p>THat the Churches of Christians, and places of praier, ought decently to bee kept, yea and with conuenient cost and seemely beautie to be built and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and Church vessels with other necessarie furniture, to be of the best, not of the worst sort, we doe both commend it, and practise it: for so we learne by the example of our Sauiour, that cast out of the temple sellers of doues and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney changers, and would not suffer them to carrie vessels through it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.15, 16. that the house of praier ought to be reuerently regarded: but yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that such immoderate and excessiue cost should be bestowed vpon the walles of the Church and Idols, to garnish and beautifie idolatrie, and poore people in the meane time to want.

                           <p>Argum. 1.

                           <p>Secondly, your popish hallowing of Churches hath nothing like vnto it, but the name: for they vse a number of foolish ceremonies, &amp; many of them grosse superstitions, in the dedication of their Churches.</p>
                           <p>First, there are twelue Crosses painted round about in the Church, &amp; twelue burning Lamps set ouer against euery one of them, one against one: hereby (say they) the twelue Apostles are signified, that by the preaching of the Crosse gaue light to the whole world. Secondly, they vse oyle in anoynting their Altar, and other vessels, shewing hereby that they are consecrate to holy vses. Thirdly,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:20636:194"/>
they sprinkle water, burne incense, set vp Taper light: this sheweth (sayth the Iesuite) that the place is consecrate to prayer, and other holy actions. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they sprinkle ashes round about the Church, and write in the floore the Greeke and Latine Alphabet from one side of the Church to the other. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth (say they) the preaching of faith, which is the foundation and ground of all righteousnesse, which was first taught in the Greeke and Latine tongue.

                           <p>First, they offend in the number of their foolish ceremonies, exceeding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the manner of the Iewish dedication: so that vnto them it may bee sayd, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians</hi>; How turne you againe to impotent and beggerly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments? 4.9.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, they haue no warrant for their friuolous shadowes and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.17. which are but shadowes of things to come, but the bodie is in Christ: we haue the bodie, what need any more shadowes?

                           <p>Arg. 1. First, for the hallowing of these creatures to holy vses, and making of them actually holy, they alleadge that saying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.5. Euery creature of God is good and is sanctified by the word of God and prayer: <hi>Ergo,</hi> these creatures may be sanctified to holy vses, as the water also in baptisme, and bread and wine in the Eucharist: for the Apostle speaketh not here onely of the common benediction of meates, but of a more high and exact applying of creatures to holy vses, <hi>Rhemist.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> here speaketh only of the common &amp; ordinarie vse of Gods creatures, as of meates &amp; drinks for euery mans priuate vse &amp; he sheweth how they are sanctified by the word of God, which permitteth vnto the faithfull the free vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by praier: not that they are vnclean by nature, but by pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <pb n="374" facs="tcp:20636:195"/>
of sinne: and by this meanes are made holy and cleane. Secondly, we confesse also, that some things set apart for the seruice of God, are more specially called holy, as the Arke, Altar, &amp; Temple: but it is not lawfull to seuer what creatures we will from the common vse, and consecrate them to the seruice of God, but such as are appoynted by his word; as water in Baptisme, and bread and wine in the Lords Supper haue the warrant of Gods word, as none of your popish trumperie haue: neither are these creatures so consecrate holy in themselues, to conferre or impart their holines to other things, but are so called in respect of the holy vse, for the which out of the word of God they are appoynted.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. For the efficacie and power of these hallowed things, they thus reason. The bitter water giuen to the adulterous woman caused her thigh to rot, if she were guiltie, otherwise it made her fruitfull. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. <hi>Elisaeus</hi> healed the bitter water with casting in salt: the Apostles healed the sick with annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with oyle, <hi>Rhemist. Bellarm. ibid. Ergo,</hi> these sanctified creatures may doe the like.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, the bitter water of it selfe had not that power, but by vertue of that oth, with the which the woman was charged. Againe, it hath the warrant of the word, as yours haue not. Secondly, <hi>Elisaeus</hi> and the Apostles had the spirit to worke miracles, so haue not you: and they might haue done that they did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such meanes. Againe, it was common salt, and ordinarie oyle which they vsed, not blessed before, after your popish manner.</p>

                           <p>FIrst, we hold that no such things ought to be separated for holy vses, because they haue not the warrant of the word of God: for all things that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are so sanctified by the word of God and praier, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.5. But they haue not the word of God for their warrant, neither doe they vse any prayer of faith, but a superstitious kind of crossing. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were consumed with fire, because they offered strange fire, not taken from the Altar: that is, they presumed of their own authoritie, without Gods commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to consecrate a strange element to Gods seruice, and were punished, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous without Gods word, to consecrate any such things.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the sprinkling and washing with holy water: <hi>Augustine</hi> thus writeth of the same or like custome of washing: <hi>Ne ad ipsum baptismi sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum videretur pertinere,</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, though such things were rightly halowed, yet haue they no such power: Christ sheweth the way, wherby euill spirits are chased away: by praier and fasting, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.9.

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. First, when you can proue that such miracles are wrought at the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Saints, as the scripture testifieth of this poole, men may be bold to goe vnto them for their bodily health, as we see there is resort vnto Bathes: but not for any religion. Secondly, the Grecians, that visited <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were Iewes that dwelt amongst the Gentiles, or Proselytes, which were bound to visite the temple at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Thirdly, the Eunuch went not vp in pilgrimage to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but to worship: for there was yet no other knowne place of the world, where God was worshipped.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, their solemne processions, especially vpon Palme Sunday, with carrying the Sacrament about, strawing of rushes, bearing of palmes, setting vp <label type="milestone">

                        <p>Ans. First, your processions are horrible abusings and prophanations of the Lords institution, who ordained his Supper to be eaten and drunke, not to be carried about in procession like an heathenish Idol. Secondly, that which the people and Christs disciples did, they had warrant for out of the scripture: but who required this theatrical pompe at your hands? The riding of Christ vpon an asse was before prophecied of, <hi>Zachar.</hi> 9. and the childrens crying out in the temple, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. The cutting downe of palme branches was a ceremonie belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the feast of Tabernacles, truly accomplished by our deliuerance in Christ.

                        <p>FIrst, that no places ought to be freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted or resorted vnto for religions sake, or more holines, or for the health of the soule: we proue it out of the word of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="376" facs="tcp:20636:196"/>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sayth, That in euery nation, he that feareth God is accepted with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Ergo,</hi> one nation is as holy as another. And now our Sauiour saith, That God will not be worshipped at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or in Mount <hi>Garrizin,</hi> but in spirit and truth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. He therefore that seeketh places to worship God in, as though he were rather to be found in one place then another, hath left the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worship.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> thus writeth concerning pilgrimage: He wisheth men to seeke them teachers and instructors, by whom they might be taught: <hi>De erat in ea terra, quam incolebas: quae causa vtilius cogeret peregrinari?</hi> But is there no teacher in the countrey where thou dwellest? what better cause canst thou haue to trauell, and goe in pilgrimage to seeke one in other countries? <hi>De vtilit. cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>Thus he would haue men to play the pilgrimes, not to runne gadding to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and Images, but to seeke for teachers and instructors.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the popish pompous processions are both superstitious, in reuiuing and renewing the Iewish ceremonies, such as the feast of Tabernacles was, which are all now abolished as shadowes by the comming of Christ. And they are plainly idolatrous, for they carrie about their breaden god in procession, and make an Idol of a piece of baked wheate: but <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, The Sacrament ought to be receiued with thankesgiuing in the Churches and congregations of Christians, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.33. not to bee carried about to bee gazed vpon in the fields. Seemely processions, voyd of superstition, which are vsed for ciuill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, as to maintaine the limits and bounds of townships, and withall by the sight of Gods blessing vpon the creatures to bee stirred vp to thankfulnes, we neither mislike nor condemne.</p>

Turkish Emperour, do notably testifie: but those superstitious and pope-holy warres, though sometime they had good successe, yet in the end all went to wracke. And as their cause was not good, so neither were the meanes that they vsed: for they brought S. <hi>George,</hi> and S. <hi>Denys</hi> into the field against the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and left Christ at home If the Israelites could not be deliuered from the Philistims by the presence of the Arke, but thirtie thousand fell before them, and all because of their sinnes: let not men thinke that popish Saints can defend them, while their liues remaine vnreformed at home.</p>

That the heathen are not to be prouoked to warre, but vpon iust cause: that is, when they prouoke vs; it appeareth by the example of the Israelites, who as they came from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> sent vnto the King of <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> that they might haue leaue to walke through their land: but they not granting so much, yet the people of God offered them no violence, but went a longer iourney a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11.17.</p>

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, God giueth not his graces in respect of times, but according to his owne pleasure. Times of praier he chooseth often, and of other godly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, not for the worthines or holines of the times, but for the better disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his seruants in such exercises, to receiue them: yet this was not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obserued: for God appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> keeping of sheepe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> following his herd, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. Secondly, wee grant that the Lords day being commanded of God, and so discerned from other daies, may be said to be holier then the rest, in respect of the present vse, but not in the nature of the day: for then could it not haue been changed from the last day in the weeke to the first: as water in Baptisme is holier then other waters, because of the sacred vse, not in it selfe, as by a qualitie of holines inherent. And as for other festiuall daies, which haue not the like institution, they are appoynted onely of the Church, for Christian policie &amp; orders sake, for the exercise of religion.

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, though we refuse not some other festiuall daies, yet we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge none necessary, more then are of the holy Ghosts appointing in the Scripture. Secondly, we deny that the constitutions of the Church for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes do bind Christians, in respect of the dayes them selues, in conscience to keepe them, otherwise then they may giue offence by their contempt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the holesome decrees of the Church: for it selfe in it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is indifferent, neither can the Church make a thing necessary in nature, which God hath left indifferent: nothing bindeth absolutely in conscience, but that which is necessary by nature: wherefore keeping of holy dayes, being not enioyned but left indifferent in the word, bindeth no otherwise then we haue said. Thirdly, the example of <hi>Esther</hi> sheweth that the Church hath authoritie to appoint for ciuill vses, dayes of reioycing: that festiuall day then begun did not binde the obseruers in conscience, no otherwise then they were bound in all lawfull things to obey their gouernours, for their consent was required, and they promised both for themselues &amp; their seede to keepe that day. <hi>Esther. 9.27.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that they were not bound absolutely in conscience to obserue it.</p>

                           <p>WE holde, that as the Lords day was instituted of God, so the manner of celebrating and keeping it holy, is to be learned out of the word, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther custome nor authority ought to giue liberty for such workes vpon the Lords day, as are not warranted by the word.</p>
                           <p>First, we graunt that we are not so necessarily tied to the rest of the Sabboth as the Iewes were: for those things are abolished which appertained to the Iewish Sabboth: First, the prescript of the day. Secondly, the ceremonious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of the Sabboth in the sacrifices and other rites of the Law. Thirdly, the typicall shadowes and significations of their Sabboth, as first it betokened their rest in <hi>Canaan</hi>; then the rest and peace of the Church by Christ, <hi>Hebre.</hi> 4.3.<hi>5.</hi> Fourthly, the strickt and precise rest, wherein Christians haue more liberty then the Iewes had: and againe, they obserued their rest, as being properly and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and in it selfe a sabboth daies duty; but we doe consider it, as being referred to a more principall end: as making of vs more fit for spirituall exercises.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we allow these workes to be done: First, <hi>opera religiosa</hi> or <hi>pietatis,</hi> the religious workes, and conferring to piety: as the Priestes did slaye the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices vpon the Sabboth, and yet brake not the rest of the Sabboth, <hi>Math. 12.5.</hi> so the people may walke to their parish Church, though somewhat farre off: the Pastor &amp; Minister may goe forth to preach, yea, and preaching is of it selfe a labour of the body, to study also and meditate of his Sermon, to ring the bels to call the people to the Church: all these are lawfull, as being helpes for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of religion. Secondly, <hi>opera charitatis,</hi> the workes of mercy are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as to visite the sicke, the Phisitian to resorte to his patient, yea, to shew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to brute beastes, as to helpe the sheepe out of a pit, <hi>Math. 12.11.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>opera necessitatis,</hi> the workes of necessitie, as the dressing of meat and such like, <hi>Math. 12.1.3.</hi> Our Sauiour excuseth his Apostles for plucking the eares of Corne, when they were hungry.

But as for other seruile workes, as to keepe Faires and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets vpon the Lords day, to trauell themselues, their seruants, and beastes vpon the Sabboth, it is flat contrary to the commaundement of God, and the practise of the Church, <hi>Nehemiah 13.16.</hi> where there is no extream and vrgent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: so that it is not to be doubted, but that as the keeping of the Lords day is a moral commaundement; so also the manner of the obseruing thereof in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it, and resting therein is morall: the ceremonies of the rest being aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that is, the Iewish strictnes thereof, and the opinion which they had of their rest, as being simply a part of the sanctifying of the Sabboth. But we doe consider it, as referred vnto more principall duties, and obserue it, not as of it selfe pleasing God, but as making vs more fit for spirituall exercises. Contrary to these rules, we acknowledge neither power in Ordinaries, nor priuiledge in custome, to dispence with the sanctification of the Sabboth.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. They did not appoint a new sabboth of their owne authoritie: for first they knew by the scripture, that one day of seauen was to be obserued for euer, for the seruice of God and exercise of religion, although the prescript day accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law were abrogate: for the Lord before the morall law was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, euen immediatly after the creation, sanctified the seauenth day, shewing thereby, that one of the seauen must be obserued so long as the world endured. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, they knew there was the same reason of sanctifiyng the day of Christs resurrection, and the restitution of the worlde thereby, as of sanctifiyng
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:20636:199"/>
the day of the Lords rest, after the creation of the world. Thirdly, they did it by the direction of the spirite of God, whereby they were so directed and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that although they were fraile men by nature, and subiect to error: yet they could not decline in their writings and ordinances of the Church, from the truth, which assurance of Gods spirite in the like measure the Church hath not: but so farre forth is promised to be led into all truth, as she followeth the rule of truth expressed in the Scriptures. Wherefore the Church hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to change the Lords day, and to keepe it vpon Munday or Tuesday, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other day: seeing it is not a matter of indifferency, but a necessary prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ himselfe, deliuered by the Apostles: for the Lords day began in the Apostles time, and no doubt by their Apostolike authority directed by the spirite of Christ, was instituted, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.

                           <p n="1">1. WE graunt, that the Sabboth may be so applied, both to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce things already, as vpon that day done: as the resurrection of Christ, and the descending of the holy Ghost. Some think also that Christ vpon that day was baptized,<note place="margin">August. de tempor. ser. 154.</note> vpon that day turned water into wine, fed fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand with a few loaues, came vnto his Apostles after his resurrection the dores being shut, and that as vpon this daye he shall appeare to iudgement: but vpon what ground I know not: Certaine it is that vpon this daye Christ
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:20636:199"/>
rose againe, and that the holy Ghost came downe then vpon his Apostles. We denye not but that the keeping of the Lords day holy, may fitly bring vnto our remembrance these things: yea and that it may be a type and symbole vnto vs in some sort, both of things spirituall, as to betoken our ceasing and resting from the workes of sinne, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.10. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. as also of things to come, as the kingdome of heauen is called a Sabboth, <hi>Isai.</hi> 66.23.</p>
                           <p>But we dare not, neither will affirme, that the Sabboth was ordained &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for any such end: for the commandement of the Sabboth now to vs is onely moral, not typical or ceremonial, as the Iewish Sabboth was: but looke wherein the Sabboth was moral to the Iewes, so it is kept still: As in these two poynts it was morall to them: first, to be a signe betweene them and the Lord, and to distinguish them from other people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.17. And so also the right keeping of the Lords day is a notable outward marke of difference betweene the Church of God &amp; all others. Secondly, that vpon the Sabboth they should resort together, and heare the lawe read and preached, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. And for this cause, namely, the exercise of religion, are Christians chiefly bound to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. It may (I say) fitly be drawne to resemble heauenly and spirituall things: but that is not any end of the institution. The Iewes had two kind of types, <hi>typos factos,</hi> and, <hi>typos destinatos,</hi> types made and applied, and types appoynted and ordained of God to shadowe forth some notable thing: as the Paschall Lambe, was <hi>typus destinatus,</hi> of our Sauiour Christ, as they were not to breake a bone of the Lambe, so was it accordingly performed in Christ. They had also many types beside, that were not destined to signifie any certaine thing: of such S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10, 6, 11. So wee say of the Sabboth, that it is not <hi>typus destinatus,</hi> it is not instituted for any shadowe or signification, though it may be fitly applied to such an vse.</p>

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, we grant that all sinne, as of theft, adulterie, and the like, are in their owne nature alike, at what time soeuer they are committed, yet they may be made more hainous by the circumstances: as of the place, as sacriledge is greater then common theft, so why not of the time?</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if that which is no sinne vpon the worke-day, be a sinne vpon the Sabboth, as to digge, to plough, to cart, then that which is a sinne of it selfe, as to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:20636:200"/>
steale, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adulterie, must needs be greater &amp; more hainous being done vpon the Sabboth: for beside the sinne, he also prophaneth the Sabboth, which is the breach of another commandement. Thirdly, the internall act of religion is properly commanded in the sanctifying of the Sabboth: for it cannot be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the externall act of going to Church, and hearing the word, vnlesse a man be inwardly in the deuotion of his heart prepared for those holy exercises. So inward grace is more sought for vpon the Sabboth, not in respect of that inward desire which we haue vnto them, which ought alwaies to be alike fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in vs, if it were possible, but because of those outward meanes, of hearing the word, publique prayer, receiuing the Sacraments, which are vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both: for the which we ought more especially to prepare &amp; examine our selues, <hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 4.17. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.28.</p>

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, we grant that this opinion is very ancient, &amp; that in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time it was receiued in many Churches: and they thought it as vnlawfull to bow the knee vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lords day, <hi>Tertul. lib. de coron. Militis. Die dominico ieiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare nefas ducimus, &amp; de geniculis adorare:</hi> We count it vnlawfull to fast vpon the Lords day, and to pray kneeling. But the Papists obserue not the one, why then should they binde themselues to the other? <hi>Ignatius</hi> maketh fasting vpon the Sabboth as great an offence, as the killing of Christ himselfe, <hi>Epistol. ad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipp.</hi> But, I trust, they will not say so.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the reasons why fasting is not to be vsed vpon the Lords day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Iesuite setteth downe none, I will supplie out of <hi>Augustine:</hi> first, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> (saith he) <hi>ad significandam requiem sempiternam (vbi est verum Sabbatum) relaxationem,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Epistol. 86.</note> 
                              <hi>quàm constrictionem ieiunij aptius conuenire.</hi> I thinke, that to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the eternall rest, which is the true Sabboth, libertie rather, then the vrging of fasting doth most fitly agree. But to this we answere, that this signification of eternall rest, is no essentiall part of sanctifying the Sabboth, nor no end of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, as we haue shewed afore, though it may haue such an application: and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:20636:200"/>
therefore this reason proueth not such a necessitie of not fasting vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. Secondly, <hi>Die dominico ieiunare magnum est scandalum:</hi> It is a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to fast on the Lords day, because the Manichees made choise of that day to fast in: <hi>Per quod factum est, vt ieiunium Sabbati horribilius haberetur,</hi> By the which (sayth he) it came to passe, that the fast of the Sabboth was more abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Augustin. ibid.</hi> But this reason now bindeth not vs, because the name and heresie of the Manichees is now worne out, and therefore there is no feare of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny scandale to arise that way.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, we grant that the Lords day is not the fittest time for publique fasts: first, because it is a day of reioycing: so we reade that the people in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> his time, were forbidden to mourne and weepe, after the lawe was read vnto them by <hi>Ezra,</hi> because it was a day of ioy and mirth, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.11. Secondly, the day of solemne and publique fasting ought to be set a part from other dayes, and to be proclaimed solemnely, and to be spent wholly in spirituall exercises, euen as the Sabboth, with vacation and rest from other bodily labours, as we may reade, 2. <hi>Chronicl.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.1. And therefore any day is more fit then the Sabboth, because that is a holy day alreadie vnto the Lord: but when we will humble our selues before the Lord by fasting and prayer, some day would onely for that purpose bee consecrate vnto GOD: that may be as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie sacrifice: whereas wee are bound of necessitie to keepe the Lords day.</p>
                           <p>But concerning priuate and particular fasts, when men by themselues haue occasion to giue themselues to prayer, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.5. Such priuate exercises may be better performed vpon the Sabboth, because of the ordinarie exercises of the word, which are notable meanes to kindle and stirre vp true deuotion in him, which at that time will humble himselfe: yea and publike fasts, though not ordinarily, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is iust occasion, may be kept vpon the Sabboth: as we reade <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. how that <hi>Paul</hi> continued his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till midnight: whereof <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Necessarius sermo resicien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di corporis causa interrumpendus esse non visus est profecturo Apostolo:</hi> The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary preaching of the Apostle, he thought not good, for the refreshing of their bodies to breake off, being readie to depart. We conclude therefore, that it is lawfull to fast vpon the Lords day, though it be not alwaies expedient. And <hi>Augustine</hi> very well determineth this matter: <hi>Ego in Euangelicis, &amp; Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis literis video praeceptum esse ieiunium: quibus autem diebu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, wee graunt that it is expedient for the Church to keepe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of the Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension of Christ, and of the comming of the holy Ghost; and the dayes instituted for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof, no doubt, ought to be had in greater account, then any other holy dayes instituted by the Church. Secondly, it cannot be proued, that they were prescribed by the Apostles, or if they were, but as indifferent ceremonies, which are subiect to alteration, and in the which the religion or worship of God dooth not consist. Certaine it is, that before the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, there were not many festiuall dayes kept, in so much, that the feasts of the Natiuitie of Christ, Easter, Pentecost, were not vniformally obserued for many yeares after, as appeareth by diuerse Councels.<note place="margin">Concil. Aurel. 4. c. 1. Tolet. 10. cap. 1.</note> And before <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> time, there was great contention betweene the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Bishops of the East, about the celebration of Easter: they alleadging the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> the other of Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> wherefore it is like, that the Apostles appointed no such certaine dayes: for then the Church would not haue broken them.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Pentecost, whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, was the feast of the Iewes, which with other solemnities of theirs the Apostles obserued not as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian religion, but taking occasion of the meeting of the Iewes in those festiuall dayes: and so doe we obserue those holy dayes for order and edification of Gods people, that vse to assemble at such times, <hi>Fulk. Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>sec.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, what cause is there, why Easter and Whitsontide should be tied to the Lords daye, and the Natiuitie of Christ, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, was vpon the Lords day, should indifferently bee kept vpon any day? but that hereby wee vnderstand, that it is an indifferent matter, whether they should bee kept vpon the Lords day, or any other, and whether vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any certaine daye, or to bee left to the discretion of the gouernors of the Church to be obserued as any other occasion shall be offered, <hi>Fulk. annot.

                           <p>Lastly, we shewed <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion, in the first part of this question, how hee vnderstandeth that saying, <hi>Psalme</hi> 118.

                           <p>THis is another principal fault, which we finde &amp; complaine of in their holy dayes: that they haue pestred the Church with such a number of Saints and Saints dayes.

                           <p>THere are no dayes necessarie to be kept, but those that are of the Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: the rest, being voyde of superstition, may be celebrated as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: and therefore not to be commaunded with the like strictnes, as is the Lords daye. There is greater libertie vpon holy dayes for bodilie labour, then vppon the Sabboth: for bodilie rest vppon the seauenth day is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of GOD: bodily labour vppon all other dayes permitted, and may without offence of conscience bee vsed, when it is not by the lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the gouernors of the Church vppon iust occasion restrained, as during the time of publike praiers and fastes, hearing of the word, and such like.</p>
                           <p>The rest of the Sabboth, so far as it helpeth our preparation and fitnes to spirituall exercises, and is a part of sanctifying the Lords day, bindeth sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie in conscience, because it is the commaundement of GOD: but the rest vpon holy dayes doth not in it selfe binde vs, no otherwise then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of offence, that may arise by our contempt of the constitutions of the Church.</p>

                              <hi>Augustine</hi> maketh three degrees of festiual dayes: in the first and highest degree he placeth the Lordes day: <hi>Quomodo Maria virgo, mater domini, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatum tenet inter omnes mulieres, ita inter caeteros dies, haec omnium dierum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter est.</hi> As amongst women, the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> the mother of our Lord is the chiefe, so this day is the mother and chiefe of al other dayes, speaking of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both of Christians, <hi>de tempore serm.</hi> 36.</p>
                           <p>In the next place or degree he putteth the festiuals of Christ, and the holy Ghost, as the commemorations of his Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: as in his sermon vpon the Ascension day hee thus saith, <hi>Conditoris basilica huius S.

                           <p>THe Christians in time of persecution had their <hi>antelucanos hymnos,</hi> their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and timely songs and hymnes: they met together to worship God, before the Sunne rise, because they could not safely, neither were suffered to assemble in the daye time.

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, wee say of this, as we did of the vigiles of the Church before: that Christians in those dayes in their night assemblies vsed candle light: but it followeth not, that the vigiles being now left, we should burne
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:20636:204"/>
candles at noone daye: and that this was their custome, to burne their lampes onely in the night, <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth, where hee speaketh of those that did vowe <hi>ceram ad luminaria noctis,</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, it is vtterly vntrue, that the lampes in the Tabernacle burned all day: the contrarie is proued, that they were lighted in the euening, and so burned all night, for those that kept the watch in the Temple, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.11. and that in the morning againe they were put out, 1. <hi>Sam. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. The Priest shall set the lampes on fire, <hi>inter duas vesperas,</hi> betweene the two twilights, that is, the euening and morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.8. And hee shall dresse them to burne from the euening to the morning, <hi>Leuitic.</hi> 24.3. That therefore which the Iesuite made for an argument for himselfe, wee will vrge against him: that seeing the lampes amongst the Iewes, who abounded in types and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, were burnt onely in the night, and not vpon the day; it is shame for those that would bee counted Christians, in superstitious customes, to exceede and goe beyond them.</p>

FIrst, that fasting of our Sauiour Christ, and the holy Prophets, was miraculous, and no more to bee imitated then Christs walking vpon the Sea,<note place="margin">In. Psal. 90. praefat.</note> or raising of the dead, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Non tibi dicit, Non eris discipulus meus,</hi> hee saith not, Thou shalt not bee my Disciple, vnlesse thou walke vpon the sea, or raise the dead: but learne of mee, because I am humble and meeke. Yet if any of them can fast so many dayes, as they did, without eating any thing at all, wee giue them good leaue.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that it was not an Apostolike tradition, it appeareth, because it was not vniformally kept of the Church,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5 cap. 26.</note> a long time after them: For as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> witnesseth, some fasted one day, some two dayes, some fourtie houres day and night. But if it had been necessarily enioyned and prescribed by the Apostles, such varietie of custome could not haue sprung vp, at the least not haue been suffered in the Church. Thirdly, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, that the Wednesdaies fast was an Apostolike tradition,<note place="margin">Epiphan. Heres. 75.</note> and to obserue the feast of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:20636:204"/>
the sixe dayes of Easter, with bread, salt, and water: which obseruations, are not kept amongst the Papists themselues, yet haue they as good testimonie of antiquitie to bee Apostolike traditions, as the Lent fast. Fourthly, in <hi>Augustines</hi> time there was no necessarie enforcement for euery man to keepe Lent: <hi>Si aliquis,</hi> saith hee, <hi>ieiunare non potest, eleemosyna sine ieiunio bona est.</hi> If any man be not able to fast,<note place="margin">Serm. de temp. 62.</note> almes without fasting is good and profitable. Wherefore seeing the Lent fast was then voluntarie, it is euident that it was not an Apostolike prescription, which should haue bound all men necessarily.</p>

                           <p>Ans. 1. FOr prayer and fasting to bee vsed at such times as Ministers are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, we doubt not but it is an Apostolik tradition, because we find it written in the Actes of the Apostles: But it was fasting from all meat and drinke, which the Apostles vsed, not abstinence from flesh onely, as vpon your Imber dayes. Neither do you obserue those dayes of fast for any such purpose: For your Imber dayes are kept amongst you, though there bee no orders giuen in the whole dioces.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Prescript and set times of ciuill abstinence from some meates, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the common wealth, as your Lent and Imber daies, are still retained in England, and no otherwise, we condemne not: But to appoint ordinary tymes of necessary and Religious fasting, without special cause, was of the auncient Church accounted heresie in <hi>Montanus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This also was the practise of the Church of God in the olde Testament,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5 cap. 18.</note> vpon speciall occasion, not at set, and ordinary times, to enioyne publike fasting, as the prophet sayeth, Blowe the Trumpet in <hi>Sion,</hi> sanctifie a fast, call a solemne assemblie, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.15. which sheweth that their publike fastes were not vsuall &amp; ordinary, but especially sanctified, and solemnly proclaimed.</p>
                           <p>As for the fixed and set fasting dayes in the weeke, in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, onely the Churches of Rome kept the Saturdayes Fast, all the East Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and many of the West obserued it not: And whereas some alleadged, that <hi>Peter</hi> fasted vpon Saturday, beeing the next day, which was the Lordes day, to encounter with <hi>Simon Magus, Augustine</hi> saith, it was <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio plurimorum,</hi> the opinion of many, <hi>quam tamen falsam esse perhibent

A Third abuse in popish fasting, is the difference that they make betweene meates and drinkes: as the forbidding of flesh-eating vpon fasting dayes for more holines, and the eating of egges, butter, &amp; cheese in Lent: as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed at <hi>Lucerna</hi> in <hi>Heluetia,</hi>

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, now Antichrist sheweth himselfe in his colours, making it as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, to forbid the vse of some meates for religion, now vnder the Gospel, when God hath made them all lawful and free, as God himselfe might forbid the vse of some, for obedience in Paradise or signification in the Lawe. Secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the doctrine of diuels, to command to absteine from meates, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.3. Againe, let no man condemne you in meate and drinke. <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.16. The <hi>Rhemist.</hi> answere, that the Apostle speaketh in the first place against those heretikes, that condemned meates as euill by creation, such were the Manichees, and in the second, against the Iudaicall obseruation of meates. But they onely prohibite the vse of some meates for the chastising of the bodie.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, not onely the Manichees and other heretikes preferred some meats before other, as more holy, but euen the Papists also in the prescript times of their fasts, doe command to absteine from meates for pietie and religion: And therefore they are counted most holy amongst them that neuer eate flesh. And <hi>Durand</hi> testifieth, that fish in interdict dayes, is rather vsed then flesh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause flesh and not fish was accursed in the dayes of <hi>Noah.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Durand. lib. 6. cap. de alijs ieiunijs.</note> Yea they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand abstinence from meates vnder paine of damnation: what is this else, but with the old heretikes to condemne the creatures of God themselues? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the popish prohibition of meates, is more superstitious, then was the Iewes: For they prohibited such meates, as by the lawe were counted vncleane, as to eate beastes that died alone, or were torne with beasts, or strangled, or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched any vncleane beast, as likewise they inioyned pennance to them, that did eate or drinke, where a dogge or cat had lapped, or a mouse had been drowned and such like, <hi>Fulk. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4 <hi>sect.</hi> 6. I pray you how farre are they now from the superstition of the Iewes? Nay they goe beyond them: for the legall difference of meates for signification, was instituted of God for those times.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:20636:205"/>
But this superstitious distinction of meates vnder the Gospel, which giueth vs the free vse of all the creatures of God, which are sanctified by the worde and prayer, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.5. is brought in by Antichrist, who is an enemie vnto God.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Neither doe they abstayne from flesh and other meates for chastising of the flesh: for they permit the vse of all other meates vpon their fasting dayes, that may prouoke lust, flesh onely excepted, as the eating of spices, and other dayntie and delicate confections, the drinking of wine, and all kind of fish. Euen like as <hi>Augustine</hi> reporteth of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that would drinke no wine, nor eate flesh:<note place="margin">De morib. Manich. 2. cap. 13.</note> but in stead of wine they had <hi>Pomorum nonnullorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressos succus vini speciem satis imitantes, at<expan>

This was the <hi>Manichees</hi> fast: and this is the popish custome in their fastings at this day. Agayne, if they forbare some meates for chastisement of the body, why might it not bee as lawfull to eate butter, and egges, in the time of Lent, as vpon other fasting dayes: but that they make difference of the times, as one being holyer then an other, and so also a difference of meates, some being more agreeable to holy times, then other?</p>
                           <p>Wherefore to conclude this poynt: Ciuill abstinence from flesh, as for policies sake, and the better mayntenance of the common wealth, that there should bee a vent for fish, as well as for flesh, and that euerie man might liue of his trade and calling: as also for the health of the bodie, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne from hurtfull meates: as likewise to keepe a temperate and sober dyet, and to take heede of surfetting and drunkennesse: These kindes of abstinence, in making difference of meates, wee mislike not: but for pietie or religions sake to distinguish them, it is to too great supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                           <p>Ans. FIrst, for chastising of the bodie, it is lawfull to abstayne either wholly for a time, or in respect of the quantitie or qualitie of the meates, which may more prouoke carnall lusts, not in the prohibition of the whole kind, as the Papists doe of all flesh, bee it neuer so grosse or small in quantitie. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:20636:206"/>
it is lawfull for chastising of a mans body to abstaine from any kinde, as of wine, fruites, spices, flesh, so that the vse of them be not forbidden, as though in the very abstinence there were religion, <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi>

                           <p>Answ. it is no more dishonour for Christ to be borne of a sinner, then to haue taken his flesh, and lineally descended, according to his humanity, of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> that committed incest with <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> which was an harlot: <hi>Math.</hi> 1.3.5.

                           <p>Ans. That God is able clearely to rid his children from sinne, &amp; to preserue them from falling thereinto, we denie not: but, seeing you haue no scripture for this priuiledge, that should be bestowed onely vpon <hi>Marie,</hi> to be free from sin: but rather the contrary is proued out of scripture, That all haue sinned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. it is too rash and bolde an assertion, contrary to the will of God, to ascribe any thing to his power. He is as able to exempt all from sinning as one: vnlesse therefore you can shew some especiall warrant out of Gods word, for <hi>Maries</hi> freedome, by your reason, all the children of God shall bee freed from sinne as wel as <hi>Marie,</hi> because God is able to doe it.</p>

to be he that saueth the people from their sinnes, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. not that preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth onely.

                           <p>Ans.

                           <p>THat <hi>Marie,</hi> as she was an entire Virgin before the birth of Christ, so that she continued also a Virgin all her life after, we doe verily think, and condemne their opinion that holde the contrarie: but that she vowed or purposed Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, before the message of the Angel was brought vnto her, it is rashly without scripture, nay rather agaynst it, affirmed.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. The text is playne, that they had a purpose to consummate their mariage: When as <hi>Marie</hi> was betrothed to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> before they came together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>Math.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was a meaning to come together, if she had not in the meane time been found to be with childe of the holy Ghost: for otherwise, it shuld seeme to haue been a mockery on <hi>Maries</hi> behalfe, to promise mariage to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> without any purpose to performe the duety of mariage. But if it were done with both their consents, then mocked they with God, who instituted mariage for some ende and purpose, which could not be attayned out of mariage: for they should haue maried neither for auoyding fornication, nor for procreation, which are the two chiefe ends of mariage: as for the third, which is mutuall comfort, it ariseth of the former.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. It was not the manner among the Iewes to vow Virginitie, but
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:20636:208"/>
it was rather a shame and reproch to remayne and die a Virgin: and therefore <hi>Iephthaths</hi> daughter lamented her Virginitie, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11.38.

They buried her in <hi>Gethsemani:</hi> and for three dayes together the Angels were heard to sing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious songs: At three dayes ende also Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> came; who being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to see her bodie, and not finding it in the graue, they thereupon assuredly deemed that her body was assumpted into heauen, <hi>Rhemist.

                           <p>Argum. 1. It is best agreeable to the priuiledge of the mother of God, not to see corruption, <hi>Rhemist. ibid.</hi> Seeing also her sonne was exempted from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>&amp; natura Mariae excipitur,</hi> the nature of <hi>Marie</hi> must be excepted: <hi>caro enim Iesu est caro Mariae,</hi> the flesh of Iesus is the flesh of <hi>Marie.</hi> And seeing Christ came to fulfil the law, which sayth, Honor thy parents: it is very like, <hi>eum in morte speciali gratia eam honorasse,</hi> that he did honor her by special grace in her death. These reasons and other are to be read in a forged booke amongst <hi>Augustines</hi> works, bearing title, <hi>De assumptione Mariae.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Answ. First, there is no credite to be giuen to the forged writings which passe vnder the name of Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> out of whom they doe reporte the assumption of <hi>Marie,</hi> nay their owne lesson, which they reade vpon the Assumption day, doth controll and confute the other. First, that story saith, that without doubt she was taken vp in bodie. But your lesson leaueth it as vncertayne, whether she were raysed vp in body or not. Secondly, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged story sayth, she was buried in <hi>Gethsemani,</hi> which was in mount <hi>Oliuet:</hi> your lesson sayth, that the place of her buriall is in the midst of the valley of <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> which is betweene mount <hi>Oliuet</hi> and the Citie, <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi> Secondly, it followeth not, because Christ tooke flesh of the Virgin, that therfore she should also as well be exempted from corruption: for hee tooke flesh also of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and other his progenitors, who by the same reason should bee made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. And if she were priuiledged by beeing the mother of Christ, from seeing corruption, why not also from hauing anie sinne? for her Sonne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh saw neither. Thirdly, Christ also both did and might honor his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he was man, though so great a priuiledge bee not graunted vnto her.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:20636:209"/>
The reuerence, which was to be done to his mother, was in regard of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and so was he obedient vnto them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.51. and so long as he liued in the flesh: and therefore he did care for her euen vpon the crosse, commending her to the disciple whom he loued. But he neither was to honour her as he was God, and therfore not to free her from corruption, which had been a work of his Godhead: and the natural affection and honour due vnto parents ceaseth after this life. It were then too grosse a conceit, to think that Christ hath such regard now of the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> in heauen, as he had of her, being his mother, in the dayes of his flesh: for Christ, as he is not now knowen after the flesh, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.16. so neither knoweth he any after the flesh.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. We doe allow all praise giuen vnto the Virgine, without the dishonour of God and her Sonne and Sauiour Christ: we doe acknowledge the honour that God vouchsafed her, not to be a meritorious or principall efficient cause of our redemption, but onely an holy vessell, and instrumentall cause of the conception and birth of Christ, by whose only merite and worthines our redemption is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, as by a proper and principall, and onely meritorious efficient cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefore, those are blasphemous titles which are giuen vnto her, to call her the ladder of Heauen, and gate of Paradise, and such like: and so in a manner to make her our redeemer. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, She was more happie, in that she conceiued the faith of Christ, then in conceiuing the flesh of Christ.<note place="margin">De sancta virgine cap. 3.</note> If then these titles be vnmeet for her, in respect that she receiued the faith of Christ, which is
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:20636:210"/>
common to al the children of God, then are they more vnfit, in that she concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the flesh of Christ.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It is great presumption to thinke that the Virgine Mary may command her sonne in heauen: seeing she had no authoritie to command him vpon earth, in any thing pertaining to his office, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.4. And now likewise that carnall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of children to their parents ceaseth in the kingdome of God.</p>
                           <p>As for that superioritie &amp; higher kind of honour which she hath aboue al the Saints beside, we finde no warrant out of scripture. She is respected now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, not as she bare the flesh of Christ, but as she liued by faith in Christ: she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so reioyced in God her Sauiour. The scripture therefore maketh one condition and estate of all that shall be saued: and sayth generally of all, of others as well as the Virgine Christs mother, That they shall be as the angels in heauen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.30. Yea, our Sauiour sheweth, that Whosoeuer doth the wil of God, is his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, brother and mother, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.50. By the which we learne, that other the faithfull seruants of GOD may by their faith in Christ, be as well accepted of God, as if they had borne Christ in the flesh. Where then is that high dignitie, which she hath, as the mother of Christ, aboue all Saints? <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Tu concinis sine fine choris coniuncta, Angelis &amp; Archangelis sociata:</hi> Thou (O Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) doest reioyce being ioyned vnto the heauenly quire,<note place="margin">Serm. 35. de assumpt.

But this letteth not, but that there may be other inferiour mediatours, though not in that singular sense, <hi>Rhemist. annot.</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Argum. Christ is the only Sauiour and Redeemer of the world, yet the name of Sauiour and Redeemer is giuen to men in the scriptures, as <hi>Iud.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Othniel</hi> is called a Sauiour, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.35. <hi>Moses</hi> a Deliuerer or Redeemer: and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out derogation to him, that in more excellent manner is the onely Sauiour of the world: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there may be also many mediatours, in an inferiour degree to that singular mediatour, to offer vp our praiers, <hi>Rhemist. ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ans. 1. If Christ be sufficient to procure all grace and mercie vnto vs, what neede then the mediation or inuocation of Saints? for wee must either doubt of his power, in ioyning other helpers with him, or make question of his good will and readines to helpe vs, in making other mediatours vnto him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They make other mediatours and intercessors beside Christ, euen in that high and singular degree: for not onely Christ by their doctrine, by his merites procureth grace, but other Saints also by their merites are our mediatours: as it is plaine to see in that popish praier, <hi>Tu per Thomae sanguinem, &amp;c.</hi> By the blood of <hi>Thomas,</hi> which for thee he did spend, make vs, Christ, to climbe, whither <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> did ascend. In this blasphemous prayer and a thousand such, they pray on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Christ as God, not as mediatour, men departed, and many of them no Saints, they make their onely mediatours by their owne proper merites. See <hi>Fulk. ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, their Saints are not onely intercessors for grace, but conferrers of grace and helpe, which is the highest degree of mediation. They appoynt se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall patrones amongst the Saints for all purposes: S. <hi>Apollonia</hi> for the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach: Saint <hi>Rooke</hi> for the pestilence: Saint <hi>Petronill</hi> for the ague: Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi>

And thus doe they not onely (as they beare vs in hand) pray for these graces and blessings, but they haue power themselues to bestow them.</p>
                  <p>Ans. 3. Concerning the name and title of Sauiour and Redeemer, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: first, men are called in the Scripture, Deliuerers and Sauiours, in respect of some temporal deliuerance, not of the spiritual or eternal redemption, which belongeth onely to Christ: but you make your Saints mediators of eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Secondly, they whom the Scripture calleth Redeemers and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, were appoynted by God for such temporall deliuerance: but you cannot shewe the like appoyntment for Saints to be mediators of eternall saluation, though in an inferiour degree to Christ. Thirdly, seeing the name of God and Christ is giuen to men in the scriptures, as to Princes and Prophets: why may you not as well say, that there may be many Gods and Christs properly, though in an inferiour degree to him which is only God and Christ, as to appoynt other inferiour Redeemers, Sauiours and Mediators?</p>

                        <p>Ans.

the new testament, &amp;c. And in Baptisme these: In the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. These are the formes of the Sacrament, and very words of consecration, though spoken in a strange tongue, without further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the name of God, or giuing of thankes, or without a Sermon, which we require (as they say) as necessarie to the essence of a sacrament, <hi>Rhemist.</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11 <hi>sect.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sacrament. cap.</hi> 19.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. First, wee denie not, but that to blesse here doth signifie to sanctifie or consecrate: but that is not done by a magicall murmuration of words ouer the Sacrament, but by the whole action according to Christs institution, in distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting, receiuing, giuing of thankes. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the words which Christ vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the institution, we rehearse them not, as a magicall charme to be sayd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the bread and wine to conuert their substance: but to declare what they are made to vs by force of Christs institution, namely, his bodie and blood.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="Protestant_doctrine">
                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>WE doe not hold, that it is an essentiall part of the Sacrament, alwayes to haue a sermon before it, as they vnderstand a sermon; which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were most conuenient, and alwaies to bee wished: but this wee affirme, that the Sacrament cannot be rightly ministred, vnlesse there be a declaration, and shewing forth of the Lords death, not only in the visible action of breaking &amp; distributing the elements: but also in setting forth the end of the Lords death out of the word of God, with an exhortation to thankfulnes, which is alwaies obserued amongst vs in the dayly celebration and receiuing of the Sacrament. Concerning the words of the institution, we also grant, that they are necessarily to be vsed in the celebration of the Sacrament: but not as the Papists vse them: For first, they make them not all of one value, but out of the whole institution, picke out certaine consecratorie words, as they call them: as, This is my bodie, This is the cup: whereas the other words, Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye, doe this in remembrance: doe as well belong to the institution, as the other. Secondly, they say, that the words of institution doe not serue any thing at all for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the people, to shew them the right vse of the Sacrament, but onely for benediction and consecration of the elements, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 19. Thirdly, they doe hold, that only by the pronouncing of those words, the elements are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated: whereas by the whole action, and cerebration of the Sacrament, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, receiuing, inuocation, thankesgiuing, according to Christs institution, the consecration is performed vpon the elements, <hi>Fulk.</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>Arg. 1. That the words of institution rehearsed, do helpe as well to admonish &amp; stirre vp the people to a thankful reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of the death of Christ, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate &amp; blesse the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, it is manifest: whereas Christ saith, as the words are vsually rehearsed, Doe this in remembrance of me: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, That by
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:20636:213"/>
receiuing the sacrament, we doe shew forth the Lords death, 1. <hi>Corinth. 11.26. Ergo</hi> the people are by the words pronounced, instructed and admonished, and taught the right vse of the sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. that the words of institution doe helpe toward the benediction or consecration of the Elements, we deny not, but not by them alone, but praier also and thankesgiuing, and the whole action beside of receiuing. To the consecration or sanctifiyng of any creature, two things are required: the word of God, and praier, <hi>1. Timoth. 4.5.</hi> Neither the word sanctifieth without praier, nor praier without the word. <hi>Ergo</hi> to the sanctifiyng &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrating of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the bare rehearsall of the institution sufficeth not, without inuocation and praier.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Accedat verbum ad elementum, et fiet Sacramentum.</hi> Let the word be ioyned to the element, and it is become a Sacrament. And in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, he sheweth what word he meaneth: <hi>Faciente verbo, non quia dicitur, sed quia creditur, hoc est verbum fidei, quod praedicamus.</hi> The word effecteth this, not because it is spoken or vttered, but because it is beleeued: this is the word of faith, saith the Apostle, which we preach: thus farre <hi>Augustine tract in Johan. 80.</hi> Wherefore it is not the muttering of a few words in a strange toung, after the manner of enchaunters, that by any secret force giuen vnto them hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to consecrate: but the vnderstanding, hearing, and beleeuing the institution of Christ, with calling vpon the name of God, and thankesgiuing before him.</p>

                        <p>Argum. 1. If the sacraments confirme vnto vs the promises of God in his word, then must they of necessitie be more euident, and better known vnto vs, then is the word of God: for that which is lesse knowen, and not so notorious, cannot perswade vs of that, which we haue better knowledge of.

                        <p>Ans. 1. It is strange to see, that you should now contend for the euidence, and plainenes of Scripture, which you haue locked vp from the people, with
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:20636:215"/>
no other pretence, then because they are hard and obscure, and dangerous ro be read of the simple. Secondly, you doe not well in comparing the word and the sacraments together: for they cannot be diuorsed or separated: for the word giueth life to the sacraments, the sacraments againe giue liuely testimony and witnes to the truth of the word. But let this be the question, not whether the writing by it selfe, and the seale by it selfe are of greatest force: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an instrument with a seale be not of greater euidence and strength, then without it: So the word of God, which doth but beate vpon the sence of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, must of necessitie, not in it self, but in respect of vs, worke more effectually, being sealed by the sacraments, where we receiue instruction by two other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ours, the sight, and the taste.</p>

                        <p>THat the Sacraments are ordeined of God, to be pledges and seales of his promises made vnto vs in Christ, that as verily as the externall elements are applied to the outward man, so our soules spiritually are refreshed with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope of the remission of our sinnes in Christ, and so the sacraments to be seales onely of the righteousnes of faith, and not giuers or workers of grace in vs: it is euident out of the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Abraham</hi> receiued the signe of circumcision, as the seale of the righteousnes of faith, <hi>Rom. 4.1.</hi> Circumcision then was to <hi>Abraham</hi> a seale of the righteousnes of faith, that is, that he was iustified by faith. <hi>Ergo</hi> so are all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sacraments.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. The Apostle setteth forth the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to shew how all men are iustified before God, and what is the vse of the sacraments in all men: and therefore it is no extraordinary or exempt case, but the common case of all the faithfull, that righteousnes (saith the Apostle) might be imputed to them also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.<hi>11.</hi> Secondly, although <hi>Isaac</hi> with many other, were first circumcised, and after iustified: yet this is perpetuall, they were no more iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by circumcision, then <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was iustified before he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but by faith onely: and therefore the Sacraments are seales of the iustice of faith, whether the iustice of faith goe before, or follow after.</p>

                        <p>Ans. 1. To the first we answer, that the text ioyneth with the Sacrament, the inuocation of the name of God, to the which saluation is promised, <hi>Rom. 10.13.</hi> to wash away sinnes: wherefore that place maketh nothing for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. It is not vnusuall in the Scripture to call the signe or Sacrament by the thing signified: as, <hi>Exod. 12.11.</hi> the Paschall Lambe is called the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:20636:216"/>
Passeouer, whereas it was but a signe and memoriall thereof. So Baptisme is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The lauer of regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. because it is a sure signe of our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the holy Ghost. Secondly, the Apostle in this place expoundeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: for he saith, that We are washed by water in the word: that is, the outward element doth send and referre vs to the word and promise of God, whereof it is a seale.</p>

                        <p>THe sacraments haue no power to giue or conferre grace to the receiuer: neither are they immediate instruments of our iustification: instrumentall meanes they are to encrease and confirme our faith in the promises of God: of themselues they haue no operation, but as the spirit of God worketh by them, our internall senses being moued and quickened by those externall obiects. Neither doe we say, that the sacraments are bare and naked signes of spirituall graces: but they doe verily exhibite and represent Christ to as many, as by faith are able and meete to apprehend him. So to conclude: looke how the word of God worketh being preached, so doe the sacraments: but the word doth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise iustifie vs, but by working faith at the hearing thereof: So sacraments doe serue for the encrease of our faith: faith is not a seruant and handmaide to the sacraments, (as the Iesuite declared by the homely similitude of the fire and drie wood) but faith is the more principall, and the sacraments haue no other vse or end, then as they are helpes for the strengthening of our faith.

                        <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. The iust shall liue by faith: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he liueth not, that is, he is not iustified by any worke wrought, as by the sacraments, but onely by faith: faith therefore giueth life and efficacie to the sacramentes, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained absolutely in themselues.

                        <p>Argum. 2.

Secondly, it is an absurde thing to hold, that he that hath vtterly and maliciously renounced Christianitie, and blasphemed Christ himselfe, should still retayne this Character of Baptisme, as a cognisance of his christendome. Thirdly, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is not reiterable, that is, to be iterated or repeated, not because it leaueth an indeleble character in the mind of the baptized; which is but a meere deuise and fansie: but because, as it sufficeth once to be borne in the flesh, so once to be borne agayne, and to be regenerate by the spirit (of the which regeneration, Baptisme is a seale and pledge) it is sufficient. As for confirmation, and orders, we acknowledge them to be no sacraments: and therefore to haue no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleble character.</p>

                        <p>THat by Baptisme and some other sacraments, there is imprinted in the soule a marke or character, which can neuer be blotted out, no not by Apostasie: and that this is the cause why Baptisme cannot be iterated, we holde it to bee a meere deuice, and inuention of men.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. Where the end and fruites of Baptisme are vtterly extinguished, there can not remayne any character or badge, or signe of Baptisme: The fruits of Baptisme are repentance, and regeneration by the spirite: But it is possible for these, in some that are baptized, to be vtterly lost, as in them that fall away by Apostasie, they cannot bee renewed by repentance, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.6. therefore in such, there is not to bee found any character, badge or signe of Baptisme, which they haue vtterly renounced: onely the memoriall thereof is kept before God, they being so much worse, then they that were neuer bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, because they haue wilfully reiected their profession.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. The cause why Baptisme is but once to bee giuen, is not, as they alleadge, because it leaueth such a sure mark behind, so deeply dyed in the soule, that it cannot be blotted out. There are other causes that come nearer the truth: 1. As God is but one, who maketh a couenant with vs in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and the fayth but one, into the which we are entred by that sacrament: so Baptisme is one and the same, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.5. 2. The institution of God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cause, who hath appoynted the other sacrament often to be receiued, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.25. but for the iteration of Baptisme, we haue no such comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. 3. Baptisme commeth in the place of Circumcision: as that was but once administred, so likewise it must be in the other. 4. In Baptisme God maketh a perpetual couenant with vs, which he alwayes reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth, &amp; therfore neede not to be put in minde, by the often vsing of that sacrament.

                        <p>Argum.

The Altar must be cleansed seuen daies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.37. <hi>Iob</hi> offered seuen bullocks &amp; seuen rammes for his friends, <hi>Iob</hi> 42. So in the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> 7. Churches, 7.

                        <p>Answ. First, the number of seuen is sometime applyed, to describe myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of wickednesse, as well as of godlinesse: As the beast with seuen heades, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.8. is called a mysterie, or as your vulgar Latine hath it, a sacrament. And with greater reason may we conclude, that this beast with seuen heads, is Antichrist, with his seuen Popish sacraments: then you out of <hi>Naamans</hi> seuen times washing, can picke out seuen sacraments. But if you will needs make a mysterie of seuen: it may as well be a mysterie of iniquitie as of godlines, euen the mysterie of the beast with seuen heads, as wee haue sayd. Secondly, what though the number of seuen, and of some other numbers, be sometime mysticall and significatiue, when it pleaseth the Lorde in his word so to applie and appoynt them? doth it therefore follow, that men vpon their owne heads, may superstitiously apply numbers to sacraments, prayers,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:20636:219"/>
fastings, times, as though there were any religion in numbers, or that the Lord had the rather respect vnto such things because of the number?</p>

                     <div type="Protestant_doctrine">
                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>THis worde or name, Sacrament, may be taken two wayes: first, generally for any mysticall signe or symbole, which may represent an holy thing: and so we will graunt, that there may bee not onely seuen Sacraments, but seuen and seuen: which are more properly symboles and signes, then sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As the couering of the head in the woman is a symbole of subiection, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. the Sabboth day a symbole or sacrament of the heauenly rest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. In this sense <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth the mysterie of the Trinitie a sacrament: yea hee sayth, the sacrament of fire, because therein in some sorte, by the vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided and inseparable properties thereof, the heate, light,<note place="margin">De symbol. lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> and shyning brightnesse, the Trinitie, sayth he, is shadowed foorth. Wherefore euery signe or symbole of a holy thing, that hath a spiritual signification, either found in scripture, or deuised by men, is not by and by a sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if we will take a sacrament in the strict and proper sense, there are especially three things required thereunto: First, that they doe not onely signifie, but exhibite and represent vnto vs after a liuely manner, the spirituall things which are signified. Secondly, they must haue the institution &amp; perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all commandement of Christ. Thirdly, the sacraments of the new law must succeede in the place of the olde. Hereupon we will inferre, that there are but two sacraments in the new Testament, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. These two alone are not onely signes of heauenly things, but seales and pledges vnto vs thereof, whereby our fayth is strengthened, and our hope confirmed in the promises of God: as the remission of sinnes is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Baptisme, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. the death of Christ shewed foorth in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.26. The like commendation is not giuen of any other of their sacraments.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. Christ onely commaunded these two sacraments to bee vsed for euer in his Church: to such spirituall purposes, as Baptisme is instituted and commaunded, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. the Lords Supper likewise, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. Many other ceremonies Christ vsed himselfe, as lifting vp of hands, the tempering of clay and spittle, his Apostles imposition of hands, and anoynting with oyle: But he hath not layd his commaundement vpon these ceremonies, enioyning vs perpetually to keepe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he hath charged vs with the other two.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 3. The sacraments of the newe Testament succeede in the roume of them of the olde: Baptisme standeth in stead of Circumcision, the Lordes Supper is come in place of the Paschal Lambe. But they cannot shew what old sacraments, those fiue other newly inuented, confirmation, orders, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, matrimony, extreame vnction, doe succeede and supplie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are none. And beside, if all these should be sacraments, and so seuen in all:
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:20636:220"/>
we should haue more in number then the Iewes had, which is not to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: for they had but two ordinary sacraments, Circumcision and the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe: two extraordinarie, as their baptisme in the red sea and the clowde, and their eating of the Manna, and drinking of the rocke, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 10.2.3. So they should haue but foure sacraments, for your seuen. Other legall rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices they had, and many typical shadowes and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, but no more sacraments then we haue heard.</p>

In diuers respects one sacrament may excell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as Baptisme excelleth the rest, because of remission of sinnes thereby effected, or, as we say, represented.

                        <p>Answer. First, that Baptisme and the Eucharist exceede all the other, we do easily admit; for we holde them to be no sacraments: and therefore we stand not vpon their seuerall priuiledges. Secondly, neither Baptisme is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the Lords Supper, because it representeth the remission of sinnes: for that also is insinuated in the other: for how can we shew foorth the Lords death, which is done in that sacrament, vnlesse we call to minde the benefits purchased by his death, as remission of sinnes? Neither doth the Eucharist goe beyond Baptisme, in regard of a more full presence of Christ: for he is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise present in one sacrament, then in the other, presenting himselfe in both spiritually to be apprehended of the worthy receiuer: as for that carnal and grosse presence of the body of Christ in the sacrament, we acknowledge none: as afterward it shall more fully appeare, when wee come in order to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

                           <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth, that Christ is no otherwise present in the Eucharist, then in the preaching of the word, for the manner of his presence: <hi>Eucharistia

                        <p>THat the one sacrament should be so much extolled aboue the other, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lords Supper to be preferred before Baptisme, as the more worthy and excellent sacrament, we finde no such thing in the word of God: but that both of them are of like dignitie in themselues, and to be had equally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently in most high accompt: thus it is prooued.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1 They are both commaunded and instituted by the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of our Lord Iesus Christ: neither is one by the first institution aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced aboue the other. Secondly, there is the same matter and substance of both sacraments, Christ Iesus with all his benefites. Thirdly, one and the same end of them both, which is the increase and strengthening of our fayth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are both of equall dignitie and worthynes.</p>
                        <p>Let them say now, which is the more worthy thing, Baptisme, or the word preached: no doubt, they will preferre Baptisme: for they holde that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doe giue grace by the worke wrought, and so doth not the worde: yea, they are offended, because we say, that the sacraments are no otherwaies instruments of our iustification, then the word preached is, but that the one worketh by the hearing, the other by the senses of seeing, handling, tasting: but they all serue to one end, namely, to beget and increase fayth in vs. This our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion they vtterly mislike, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de sacram. cap.</hi> 2. Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that they preferre Baptisme before the word. We then thus reason out of <hi>Augustine:</hi> He thus writeth: <hi>Dicite mihi, quid plus videtur vobis, verbum dei, an corpus Christi? respondere debetis, quod non sit minus verbum dei:</hi>
                           <q>Tell me, which is the chiefer in your opinion, the word of God or the body of Christ? (&amp; that is the sacrament of his body:) ye must answere, that the word of God is not inferior: <bibl>

Hence we frame this argument: The word of God is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent to the sacrament of the Lords bodie: Baptisme is equiualent to the word of God, by our aduersaries own confession. <hi>Ergo,</hi> also it is of equall value and dignitie, with the other sacrament.</p>

                  <head>THE SECOND QVESTION OF THE PARTES, which are the matter and forme of Baptisme.</head>
                  <p>AS touching the matter, that is, the externall element vsed in Baptisme, there is no question betweene vs, but that it ought to bee plaine and common water, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, Can any man forbid water, that these should not bee baptized? Wherefore wee condemne the foolish and vngodly practises and inuentions of heretikes, that either exclude water altogether, as the Manichees, with others; or doe vse any other element, as the Iacobites, that in stead of water, burned them, that were to be baptized, with a whot yron: or as the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> which are called <hi>Abissines,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bez. Matth. 3. vers. 11.</note> that vsed fire in stead of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: misconstruing the words of the Gospell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.11. That Christ should baptize with the holy Ghost and with fire: which is not literally to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, but thereby is signified the internall and forceable working of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which kindleth zeale and loue in our hearts as fire.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the forme of Baptisme: we all agree, that no other is to be vsed, then that prescribed by our Sauiour Christ: to baptize in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sonne, and holy Ghost: that it is neither lawfull to change this forme in sense, as many heretikes haue done, nor yet in words, as to leaue out any of the three persons in Trinitie, and inclusiuely to vnderstand them by naming of one: for whereas some alleadge that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. Bee yee baptized in the name of Iesus Christ, for remission of sinnes; to proue, that it is lawfull onely in the name of Christ to baptize, wee are to vnderstand, that the forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is not in that place expresly set downe, but the scope onely and end of Baptisme, which is to assure vs of remission of sinnes in the name of Christ, as <hi>Beza</hi> very well noteth vpon that place. The point of difference betweene vs, concerning the forme of Baptisme is this.</p>

                     <head>The Papists.</head>
                     <p>THey are bold to affirme, that this forme of Baptisme, to baptize in the name <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">error </seg>99</label> of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, is not fully concluded out of Scripture, but deliuered by tradition: for (say they) the commandement of Christ, to baptize in the name of the Trinitie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. may bee vnderstoode thus: to baptize them into the faith of the Trinitie, or by the authoritie of the Trinitie. And it were sufficient, by those words, to doe and performe it in act, without saying the wordes; were it not, that wee haue otherwise learned by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this very forme of wordes is to bee kept, <hi>Bellarmine de baptism. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>

                     <head>The Protestants.</head>
                     <p>WE neede no tradition for this matter; the very forme which is to bee vsed in Baptisme, is plainely proued out of the Scriptures: for that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:20636:222"/>
of Christ, Goe and baptize, &amp;c. doth necessarily imply a forme of speech to be vsed. Wee grant, that in the Scriptures, this word (name,) is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for power, vertue, authoritie, as <hi>Act.</hi> 3.6. In the name of Iesus arise and walke. So also, as there is a Baptisme with water, there may be a baptizing with fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. Wherefore if part of the commandement bee to bee taken properlie and literally, as this, Goe and baptize, why not the rest also, In the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost? If then the whole commaundement bee properly and plainely vnderstoode: how can they baptize in the name of the Trinitie, vnlesse the Trinitie bee spoken and named?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it appeareth also out of other places of Scripture, that this forme was vsed in the Apostles time: As <q>
                           <bibl>
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47.</bibl> Can any man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid water, why these should not be baptized, which haue receiued the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, as well as wee?</q>
As if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> should haue reasoned thus: these haue receiued the giftes of the holy Ghost: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may be also baptized in the name of the holy Ghost. Likewise, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.2. When the brethren at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> had answered <hi>Paul,</hi> that they had not heard, whether there were a holy Ghost: he saith vnto them, <q>Vnto what then were you baptized?</q> By this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatorie it appeareth, it was their manner to baptize in the name of the holy Ghost, and so consequently of the whole Trinitie. Wee haue no cause then to flie vnto tradition, this matter being so plainely decided by the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Augustin. tract. in Iohann</hi> 80. Vpon those wordes of our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.3.

The forme then of Baptisme, is the word, which Christ spake: and where else speaketh Christ, but in the scriptures? <hi>Ergo</hi> the forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, is the word of Christ, prescribed and commanded in the scriptures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way therefore with your vncertaine and deceitfull traditions. Our Baptisme is builded vpon a surer foundation: namely, the word of God.</p>

                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:20636:222"/>Argum. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5.
Our sauiour Christ saith, <q>Vnlesse a man bee borne of water and the spirite, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of GOD:</q> 
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> it is necessarie to saluation to bee baptized.
<hi>Bellarm. ibid. Rhemist. in hunc locum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. First, it is not necessarie by water here to vnderstand materiall water, but the purifying grace of Christ, which is called the water of life, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.11. Water then is here added as an Epithete of the spirite, because it clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and purgeth as water: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.38. He that beleeueth, out of his bellie shall flowe riuers of waters of life. <q>
                           <hi>Quid aqua sit,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine, euangelium interroga</hi>
                        </q>. Inquire of the Gospell, what this water is. Then it followeth,<note place="margin">Tract. in Epistol. Iohann. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>vers.</hi> 39. This spake hee of the spirite, which they that beleeued in him, should receiue. By water then it is no rare thing, to vnderstand the spirite. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Why may not water bee here figuratiuely taken, to expresse the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the spirite, as fire is added to the spirite, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. He shall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with the holy Ghost and with fire. What greater necessitie is there in this place, to vnderstand water literally, then fire in the other?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as you expound these wordes of Baptisme, so yee doe applie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53. to the other Sacrament: Vnlesse you doe eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, you shall not haue life in you.
<q>If this bee spoken of the Sacramentall eating and drinking of Christ</q>, as the <hi>Rhemists</hi> take it: then belike there is as great necessitie of the Eucharist, as of Baptisme: and so indeede <hi>Augustine</hi> sometime thought,<note place="margin">Cont. 1. Epistol. Pelag. lib. 4. cap 4.</note> that the one was as necessarie to saluation as the other.
<hi>Sine Christi carne &amp; sanguine, nec par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uuli vitam habere possunt in semetipsis.</hi> Without the flesh and blood of Christ, neither can infants haue life in themselues. And therefore it was the custome of those times, to giue of the Sacrament to children: <hi>Paruulis adhuc &amp; infirmis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Psalm. 64.</note> 
                        <hi>stillantur quaedam de sacramentis</hi>: some part of the Sacrament is instilled and powred into the mouthes of young and tender children.</p>
                     <p>But our aduersaries in no wise will admit that the Eucharist is as necessarie as Baptisme: wherefore they doe thus comment vpon our Sauiours wordes: that they also doe eate the flesh of Christ and drinke his blood, which ioyne in heart and desire to be partakers of the Sacrament, and so mystically, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually doe receiue it, <hi>Rhemist. Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>sect.</hi> 8. And why, I pray you, may there not be as well a mysticall and spirituall receiuing of Baptisme without the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as of the Eucharist or Lords Supper, seeing this place, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.53. doth as necessarily enforce the receiuing of this Sacrament, as that place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5. doth lay a necessitie of Baptisme?</p>

                     <head>The Protestants.</head>
                     <p>WEe acknowledge no greater necessitie in Baptisme, then in the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: both which wee grant to be necessarie as helpes and proppes, and profitable meanes to increase our faith: but not so simplie neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:20636:223"/>
as that without them (there being no neglect, or contempt had of them) it were impossible to be saued.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 1. The children of the faithfull are holy already, euen before they are baptized: for they are within the couenant, and to them also belongeth the promise. The Lord saith, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seede, <hi>Genes.</hi> 17.7. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the children of the faithfull are holy, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.14. If the Lord then be the God also of children, &amp; if they be holy, being borne of the righteous seede, how can they possibly perish, although they die vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized?</p>
                     <p>Argum. 2. Circumcision was as necessarie to the Israelites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Baptisme is to vs: but their children, which died before the eight day, when they were to bee circumcised, perished not: for <hi>Dauid</hi> doubteth not to say of his child that died the seuenth day, I shall goe to him, hee cannot returne to me, 1. <hi>Sam</hi> 12.18.23. He pronounceth that the child was saued. <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither children dying without Baptisme now are condemned.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 3. The holy Ghost may be giuen without Baptisme, so it bee not contemned and neglected, when it may be had: therefore life eternall may be had without Baptisme: for the holy Ghost is able without the sacrament, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate vs, and bring vs to eternall life.</p>
                     <p>The first is proued, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. Who can forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which haue receiued the holy Ghost, as well as wee? They had the holy Ghost before and without Baptisme, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Adhuc lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente Petro,</hi>

                     <p>Argum. 4. You your selues make two exceptions: of Martyres and them that doe penance, which may be saued without Baptisme: <hi>Ergo</hi> Baptisme is not simplie necessarie. And if our Sauiour speake of Baptisme, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5. as yee say he doth: there is no priuiledge for any, no not for Martyres, for all must bee borne of water and the spirite: that is, say you, baptized.

                     <p>They affirme, that Martyrdome, and penance or contrition, doe by the very act or worke wrought remit sinnes, and iustifie the workers, and not in respect of the faith onely, which is in Martyrs or penitent persons. <hi>Bellar. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de baptism.</hi>

                     <p>Argum. The Innocents, which were slaine by <hi>Herod,</hi> were saued onely by their Martyrdome, they had neither faith, nor workes. So the theefe vpon the Crosse was not onely iustified by his faith, but by the act and worke of contrition.</p>
                     <p>Ans. First, it is not necessarie to hold all those children to be Martyrs, and so to bee saued: for <hi>Macrobius</hi> writeth, that one of <hi>Herods</hi> sonnes, which was nursed in those parts, was slaine among the rest: the infants which were saued, were within the promise, and belonged to the couenant, and so could not bee lost: their saluation depended of their free election before God, it was not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the very act of their dying.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the theefe also vpon the Crosse was iustified by his faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in Christ. And therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> doth chiefely commend his faith: <hi>Tunc fides eius de ligno floruit, quando discipulorum emarcuit:</hi> Then his faith did as it were bud and flourish out of the tree of the crosse, when the faith of the Disciples withered.</p>

                     <p>Argum. 1. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.3. That if a man giue his bodie to be burned, and haue no loue, it profiteth not.
<hi>Ergo</hi>

                     <p>Argum. 2. Neither is the bare worke of sorrowe and contrition in it selfe acceptable to God: for there is a worldly repentance that causeth death, there is a godly repentance not to be repented of, which worketh in vs care, zeale, feare, desire, which are the fruites of faith, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.10.11. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is faith onely that maketh all our workes to be accepted of before God: for without faith, it is vnpossible to please him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6.</p>

                     <p>Ans. First, there is not the like strict necessitie of Baptisme, as there was then of Circumcision: for if euery man childe were not circumcised the eight day, the Lord threatned to cut him off from among the people, <hi>Genes.</hi> 17.14. But Baptisme is not tied or limited to any such time or number of dayes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there was great necessitie, which enforced <hi>Zipporah</hi> to circumcise her childe: for they had neglected the time, and passed the stint of dayes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord strooke <hi>Moses</hi> with sicknes: and being not able himselfe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that duetie, his wife in great haste taketh the childe and cutteth him, to saue her husbands life: but shee in great indignation cast away the fore-skin from her, knowing that shee was constrained to commit an vnwomanly act. There cannot bee any such necessitie of Baptisme, as there was then of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; which was to be done within a certaine compas of dayes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may as well proue by this example, that a woman may baptize, the Bishop, Priest, or Deacon standing by (which notwithstanding you hold vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnlawfull) as that it is lawfull for her to baptize: For <hi>Zipporah</hi> did it in the presence of <hi>Moses.</hi>

                     <p>Argum. Without faith it is impossible to please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. We hold that a man is iustified by faith. <hi>Ergo</hi> children, if they haue no faith, are neither iustified, neither yet doe please God, <hi>Bellarm.</hi>

                     <p>THat infants neither haue faith in themselues, nor yet are profited or furthered to their saluation by the faith of others, it is thus proued.</p>

                     <p>Argum. 2. There is no habituall or potentiall faith that pleaseth God: but the iustifying faith is alwaies actuall, working by loue, <hi>Galath.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Ergo,</hi> children haue either no faith, or it must needes bee an actuall or working faith.</p>

                        <p>Ans. First, if sinne in baptisme were wholly remoued, not onely the guilt, but the very staine and blot of sinne: how commeth it to passe, that many which are baptized, doe fall afterward into deadly sinnes, yea there is no man, that liueth without sinne? If sinne once haue been vtterly expelled and banished out of the flesh, how commeth it in againe? if their iustification haue once clearely rid them from sinne, how can they be subiect to it againe? for the grace of iustification, being once obtained, can neuer bee lost: the giftes of God are without repentance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Scripture is true, that Christ by his blood, cleanseth, washeth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away our sinnes: not by actually purging vs from all corruption, but in freely acquiting and discharging of vs before God, both of the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sinne: so the Scripture saith, Blessed are they, whose iniquities are forgiuen, and to whom the Lord imputeth no sinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7.8. Our sinnes therefore may be truely forgiuen, though some corruption of sinne doe still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in vs.</p>

                        <p>THere are three things to bee considered in sinne. First, the staine or blot, corruption or remnant of sinne in vs. Secondly, the guilt, fault, and offence of sinne. Thirdly, the punishment and stipend due vnto it. By our spiritual wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the blood of Christ, whereof Baptisme is a seale, both the guilt and punishment of our sinnes are not onely hid and couered in Gods sight (as our aduersaries doe falsely charge vs to say:) but they are truely forgiuen vs for Christs sake, and shall neuer be remembred any more.

                        <p>Heereupon their saying ariseth, that <hi>Baptismus est prima tabula post naufra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium:</hi> that Baptisme is the first boord of refuge after shipwracke: &amp; <hi>Poenitentia est secunda tabula post naufragium:</hi> penance is the second boord of refuge: So that if a man do fall after Baptisme, he must vse other helpes and meanes for the remission of sinnes: for Baptisme is not auaileable for sinnes afterward commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 18.</p>
                        <p>Argum. It is impossible, saith the Apostle, for them that haue beene once lightened, and tasted of the heauenly grace, if they fall away, to bee renewed by penance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. that is, they which fall away from faith and grace, after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, cannot be baptized againe, or be illuminated, or renouated, by so easie a cleansing of sinnes, as the Sacrament of Baptisme did yeeld: Ergo, Baptisme is not auaileable for remission of sinnes, which men fall into afterward, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 18.</p>
                        <p>Ans. The Apostle speaketh not of this or that kinde of Repentance, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of all, shewing, that there is no hope of remission nor grace to repent left for those which fall into the grieuous sinne of Apostasie, which hee heere descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, for they crucifie againe the Sonne of God, and make a mock of him, ver. 6. And that the Apostle vnderstandeth the sinne of Apostasie, &amp; the sinne against the holy Ghost, it appeareth by comparing that other place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. with this: for there they are said, to tread vnder foote the sonne of God, and to despite the spirit of grace. The Apostle then cutteth off such from all hope of grace, and repentaunce: not onely barreth them from some speciall kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

                        <p>THe externall act of Baptisme neither wipeth away sinnes going before, or comming after: but it is the inward working of the spirite of God, which by the vertue of Christs death, testified and shewed forth in Baptisme, that washeth away our sinnes. And Baptisme is a seale of remission of sinnes, for the confirmation of our faith, euen of those which are committed after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, as well as of sinnes done before: and although the ceremonie of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme be not repeated, yet the vertue of Gods spirit testified thereby, remaineth to our liues end.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. He that shall beleeue and be baptized, shall bee saued. Wee reason thus, Baptisme is a seale of that faith, whereby men are saued, or to the which saluation is promised: but that faith belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth remission of all sinnes, both past and to come: therefore Baptisme also sealeth vnto vs the remission of all our sinnes, going before or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. Baptisme is a signe and seale of our mysticall washing in the blood of Christ: But all our sinnes both before and after are washed away by the blood of Christ: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Baptisme doth assure vs of a perfit remission of all our sinnes.</p>
                        <p>So saith <hi>Augustine: Eodem lauacro regenerationis, &amp; verbo sanctificationis, omnia prorsus mala hominum regeneratorum sanantur, etiam quae posterius hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana ignorantia aut infirmitate committuntur.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh not of diuerse Baptismes, but of diuerse operations, and ministeries, in one and the same Baptisme: for <hi>Iohn,</hi> as all other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters doe, did but giue water: and Christ working together with them, giueth the holy Ghost. But it will be answered, that <hi>Iohn</hi> saith not, he dooth bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but hee shall baptize: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ did not baptize together with <hi>Iohn</hi> by his spirite.</p>
                     <p>Ans. The same <hi>Iohn</hi> in another place speaketh of Christ in the present tense. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.33. This is hee which baptizeth with the holy Ghost: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ did both then baptize with his spirite, and afterwards also more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, when the giftes of the spirite began to bee shed forth more plentifully vpon men.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> baptized twelue men at <hi>Ephesus</hi> with Christs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, that had receiued <hi>Iohns</hi> before, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.4.5. <hi>Ergo, Iohns</hi> Baptisme was not the same that Christs was, <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. There can be no such thing gathered out of that place; for those words in the fifth verse: When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus, are part of the narration which <hi>Paul</hi> maketh of <hi>Iohns</hi> manner of Baptisme: so that the sense is this, they that heard <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine, were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus. It is not so to be read, as though they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized againe of <hi>Paul,</hi> but he laieth onely his hands vpon them, that had before receiued the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn.</hi>

                     <p>THat <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme was not diuerse from Christs Baptisme, but was all one with it in propertie and effect, and that they which were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> were baptized into the name of Christ, and therefore needed not againe to bee baptized; thus it is made manifest out of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme differed not in the matter of the Sacrament, for he baptized with water as Christs Apostles did. There was also the same forme of both, the word of God: for <hi>Iohn</hi> also taught the people to beleeue in Iesus Christ that was to come, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.4. There was also the same scope and ende of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme: For hee preached the Baptisme of repentance, for remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was the same with the Baptisme of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 2. If the Baptisme instituted by Christ were another Baptisme, then <hi>Iohns</hi> was, and yet hee himselfe was baptized of <hi>Iohn:</hi> then it would followe, that wee are baptized now with another Baptisme, then Christ himselfe was, for hee receiued <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme: but this were very absurd, to say, that there is not the same Baptisme of the head and the members, of Christ and his Church: <hi>Ergo, Iohns</hi> Baptisme all one with Christs.</p>

                     <p>First before Baptisme, they haue deuised these toyes to bee vsed. First, they doe exorcise, coniure, and exufflate the euill spirite from the partie to bee baptized. Secondly, they touch the eares and nostrels with spittle, that his eares may bee opened to heare the worde, and his nostrels, to discerne betweene the smell of good and euil. Thirdly, the Priest signeth his eyes, eares, mouth, breast,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:20636:229"/>
forehead, nostrels, with the signe of the crosse, that all his sences thereby may be defended. 4.

                     <p>Secondly, these ceremonies doe accompany Baptisme it selfe. 1. The Font and water therein is consecrated and halowed, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and holy Ghost. 2. Hee is thrise dipped in the water, to signifie the being of Christ 3. dayes in the graue.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, after Baptisme, they haue this vse, 1. He is anoynted with holie Chrisme in the top of the head, &amp; thereby is become a Christian. 2. A white garment is put vpon him, to betoken his regeneration. 3. A vaile is put vpon his head, in token that he is now crowned with a royal Diademe. 4.

                     <p>AGainst these Popish ceremonies, which they vse in baptisme, we doe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It is contrary to the rule of the Gospell, that there should bee such types, shadowes, significations, brought into the seruice of God, as they make in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: for seeing we haue the body which is Christ, all such shadowes ought to be abolished, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In one sacrament they haue forged and found out many, as their chrisme, oyle, salte, spittle: which they make not onely seales of holy things, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and conferrers of grace, which is more then any sacrament can haue: and it is contrary to the scripture: for the spirit of GOD is as the winde that blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where it listeth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. It is not tyed to creatures, elements, externall signes, as they include the spirite (as it were) in these outward things, which haue power (as they affirme) to giue wisedome, strength, power against the diuell, and such like. But Saynt <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, that the weapons of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not carnall, 2. <hi>Corinthian.</hi> 10.4. The meanes whereby Christans both obtayne spirituall graces, and shend them from euill, are spirituall: For if in Christ Circumcision auayle not any thing, which was notwithstanding insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of God: but fayth is all in all, <hi>Galath.</hi> 5.6. Much more vaine and vnauaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are the deuises and inuentions of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This beggerly company of ceremonies doth also deface and impugne the sincere and pure institution of Christ: None of all those ceremonies were vsed when Christ himselfe was baptized, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. which notwithstanding had beene most fitte, considering the worthynes of his person that was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Neither did Christ giue any such thing in charge to his Apostles, but
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:20636:230"/>
biddeth them onely preach, and baptize in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. nor yet were any such ceremonies in vse in the Apostles time.

                        <p>Argum. 1. The figures must be inferior to the things that are figured and represented: the sacraments of the law were figures of the sacraments in the Gospel: therfore they ought to be inferior. But vnles the bread &amp; wine should be the very blood &amp; flesh of Christ in the sacrament: their sacraments in the law should not only not be inferior, but far superior to ours. As for example, the Paschal Lambe is in nature to be preferred before bread, and the slaying of the Lamb did more liuely represent the death of Christ, then the breaking of bread, the eating of flesh doth also better set forth the spirituall nourishing, then the eating of bread. Wherefore, vnlesse we beleeue a reall presence in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their sacrifices, in dignitie and excellencie should farre exceed and excel ours, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de. sacram. Eucharist. ca.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. It is not true, that their sacraments were figures of ours: But S. <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that both their sacraments and ours doe figure out and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the same thing, as the spiritual eating and drinking of Christ, 1. <hi>Corint.</hi> 10.2.3 Our sacraments are indeed figures correspondent and answerable to theirs, and theirs also had a certaine reference and relation to ours: but they were not types of ours: for then our sacraments should bee the body of theirs, whereas Christ is the bodie both of their sacraments and ours. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sayth, that Baptisme is an antitypon, a figure answerable to the sauing of the eight persons in the flood: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. They are correspondent one to the other, and had mutuall relation and respect one to the other. But that was not properly a type of Baptisme, but both Baptisme and that are figures and signes and liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of our saluation in Christ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the reall presence of Christ onely commendeth the sacrament, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth it before the rytes of the law, which in all other respects are better: by this argument Baptisme still remayneth inferior to the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the law: for you affirme no reall presence in Baptisme, as you do in the Eucharist: and in all other respects it must needes giue place to Circumcision: for the cutting of the flesh is a more liuely representatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the washing by water: and the flesh of man is in nature more precious then water. So by this reason,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:20636:231"/>
though you haue wonne credite for the Eucharist, yet you haue lost it for Baptisme.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 We answere therefore, that although the reall presence bee set aparte, yet our sacraments are more excellent then theirs. First, the price and woorth of thinges in their nature are not to be weighed in a sacrament, but they must bee considered in respect of the vse, to the which they are ordayned by the institution. Flesh, you say, is better then bread: so is wine and milke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then water in their nature: but in Baptisme water is better then they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ hath now set it apart for a more holy vse. Secondly, the slaying of the Lambe doth more liuely represent, say you, the death of Christ, then the breaking of bread.</p>
                        <p>Answ. We graunt, that if breaking of bread had beene vsed in the law, it had not been then so significant as the slaying of beasts: but the breaking of bread now in the light of the Gospell, in this abundance of knowledge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, being a signe of a thing already done and finished, must needes be more pregnant and liuely in representation, then the killing of sacrifices in the law, which were types of things to come, the mystery of the Gospel being not yet opened to the world. Wherefore our sacraments are more excellent then theirs, in respect of the more cleare light and fuller signification, which they haue by the word of God, &amp; the preaching of the Gospel ioyned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: We neede not deuise any other way of excellencie for our sacraments, then this, which we haue sayd, agreeable to the scriptures, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.1.</p>

                              <bibl>
                                 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.55.</bibl> Christ sayth, My flesh is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke in deede: he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, and I in him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, this place must be vnderstoode not of any spirituall eating or drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Christ without the sacrament, but is properly meant of the manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eating of him in the sacrament. First, <hi>Vers.</hi> 51. The bread, sayth Christ, that I will giue: he speaketh of a thing to come, for the sacrament was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward instituted: but if this bread were to be taken for his word, and the eating thereof for beleeuing in him; in this sense the bread was giuen already.</p>
                        <p>Answ. Christ also speaketh in the present tense, <hi>vers.</hi> 32. My father giueth you the true bread from heauen: &amp; I am the liuing bread that came down from heauen: if any man eate of this bread he shall liue for euer, <hi>vers.</hi> 51. Hee sayth not, he that shall eate, but, he that euen now eateth. And afterward he speaketh of the time to come;
<q>The bread that I shall giue, because his death and passion was not yet finished: therefore he sayth, The bread that I shal giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the worlde:</q>
But he speaketh euery where of the eating of his flesh in the present tense, <hi>vers.</hi> 35.50.51.53. which cannot bee vnderstoode of the sacramentall eating, the sacrament being not yet instituted, but of a spirituall manducation.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="Catholic_doctrine">
                        <pb n="447" facs="tcp:20636:231"/>
                        <head>The Papists.</head>
                        <p>SEcondly, those words being applyed to the sacrament, must needes also bee vnderstood properly and literally, for the very eating of the flesh of Christ, &amp; drinking his blood, not tropically, or figuratiuely.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The flesh of Christ, which Christ promiseth to giue them to be eaten, he preferreth before the Manna, which their fathers did eate in the wildernes: the true bread which he giueth them, is more excellent then the bread of Manna. But if the bread in the sacrament doe but signifie the flesh of Christ, and be not it in very deede, it should be no better then Manna, which also did signifie and shew foorth Christ, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>Ans. Christ compareth not the spirituall substance of Manna, with his flesh and blood, but the corporall foode, which being receiued into the belly, and not receiued into the heart by fayth, hath no power to giue eternall life. For, <hi>vers.</hi> 32. Christ sayth, that <hi>Moses</hi> gaue them not Manna from heauen: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he meaneth the corporall foode, not the spirituall substance of Manna, for as it was a sacrament of Christ, it was heauenly bread. Againe, <hi>vers.</hi> 49. Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernes and dyed. He speaketh of the materiall foode, for they that did Manna spiritually by fayth, died not in soule.</p>
                        <p>Ans. Now on the contrary side we will prooue, that this place contayned in the sixt chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> cannot be so vnderstoode as they expound it.</p>
                        <p>First, Christ speaketh not onely of the sacramentall eating of his flesh, and drinking of his blood, but generally of the spirituall participation by fayth, whether in the sacrament or without, which is wrought in vs by the holy Ghost.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If it be vnderstoode of the sacrament, then it will follow that no man can be saued, vnlesse he doe receiue the sacrament:
for Christ saith, <q>
                              <bibl>
                                 <hi>vers.</hi> 53.</bibl> Except you eate my flesh and drink my blood, you cannot haue life in you.</q>
This, I am sure, they will hardly grant, that the Eucharist also should bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, as they make Baptisme, to saluation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If Christ hath relation to the sacrament, then must it of necessitie bee ministred in both kindes, for in euery place he ioyneth both these together, the eating of his flesh and drinking of his blood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> also thus writeth vpon these wordes,<note place="margin">Tract in Iohan 26.</note> 
                           <hi>Hoc est manducare illam escam, &amp; illum bibere potum, in Christo manere, &amp; illum manentemin se habere.</hi> This it is to eate that flesh, and to drinke that drinke, to abide in Christ, and to haue him abiding in vs, but this may be done without the sacrament, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not necessary to vnderstand it of the sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, though we should graunt that this whole treatise <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be referred to the sacrament, yet the wordes must be taken figuratiuelie, for the spirituall eating and drinking of Christ in the sacrament, and not otherwise.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Vers.</hi> 35. Christ so expoundeth his owne words:
<q>I am the bread of life, he that commeth to me shall not hunger, and he that beleeueth in me shall not thirst.</q> To eate then, and to drinke Christ, is to beleeue in him.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="448" facs="tcp:20636:232"/>2 Christ vnderstandeth another manner of eating of his flesh, then the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did. But they imagined that Christ would giue his very flesh and blood to bee eaten: And therefore they went away offended, and sayd, This is an hard saying, <hi>vers.</hi> 60. Therefore Christ to correct their erronious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, sayth vnto them, that his words were spirite and life, that is, spiritually to be vnderstoode, <hi>verse.</hi> 63.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Augustine</hi> interpreteth those wordes of Christ, as if he had sayd, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiter intelligite, quod locutus sum,</hi> You must vnderstand spiritually, that which I haue sayd. You shall not eate this body which you see, nor drinke that blood,<note place="margin">In Psal. 98.</note> which shall be shed for you. <hi>Sacramentum vobis aliquod commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daui, spiritualiter intellectum viuisicabit vos:</hi> I haue commended a certaine mystery and sacrament vnto you, which being spiritually vnderstood shall quicken you.</p>

                        <p>ARgum. 3. Christ in the institution of this sacrament, sayd vnto his Apostles, after hee had giuen thanks and blessed: <hi>Hoc est corpus meum:</hi> This is my bodie: that is, that which is contayned in this bread, or vnder the formes of this bread, is my very body, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 9. So that these wordes must needes be taken properly, not to bee a trope or figure.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It is not the manner of the scriptures to set down flatte precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and directorie rules in obscure termes, or figuratiue speeches, but plainely and euidently: therefore it is not like, that Christ, being now to prescribe vnto his Apostles the perpetuall lawe and forme of this sacrament, would speake obscurely.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Though he spake by parables and signes to the Pharisies, yet there was no cause why he should so doe, none being present but his Apostles, <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. It is very well, that you will now (though I thinke vnawares) grant vnto vs, that the precepts and rules in scripture are set downe simply and playnely: wherefore the scriptures cannot bee so hard and obscure, as you would beare vs in hand they are: for if the precepts and rules of fayth be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in scripture expressed, as you seeme to confesse, what reason haue you to keepe back the people from the reading of scripture?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It is false that the scriptures vse no figures nor tropes, in the declaration of the lawes and sacraments of the Church: for sayth not Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the sacraments of the Iewes, <hi>Petra erat Christus,</hi> the rock was Christ, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. that is, signified Christ? Likewise in the 17. <hi>vers.</hi> We that are many are one bread: that is, our spirituall vnitie and coniunction is represented, in that we are partakers of one bread.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Sometimes our Sauiour would speake darkely, being alone with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, thereby to stirre them vp more diligently to attend vnto his wordes,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:20636:232"/>
as when he biddeth them beware of the leauen of the Pharisies, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.15. Yet this speech of our Sauiour Christ vttered in the hearing of his Apostles, This is my bodie; was neither so darke nor obscure, that the Apostles neede much bee troubled about the vnderstanding. Nay, many things being spoken in borrowed and metaphoricall wordes, are vttered with greater grace, and carrie a fuller sense: When Christ sayd, I am the doore, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.9. I am the vine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.1. he spake by figure as he doth here, for neither was he a vine, or a doore, as the bread was not his bodie: Yet which of the Apostles was there, that vnderstoode him not, when he called himselfe a vine, and a doore? Neither could they doubt of our Sauiour Christs meaning here.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Contra.</hi> Now on the other side, we will make it playne, that these words of Christ, are spoken tropically:</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Where Christ sayth according to Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> This cuppe is the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in my blood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.23. we must needes admitte a double trope or figure: for first, the cuppe is taken for that which was contayned in the cuppe. Secondly, the wine in the cuppe was not the newe Testament, but a signe of the new Testament. If then in one parte of the sacrament hee spake by a figure, why not also in the other, when he sayth, This is my bodie, that is, a liuely signe and seale thereof?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It is no vnusuall phrase in the scripture, to say (this is) that is, signifieth as <hi>Genes.</hi> 17.10. Circumcision is called the couenant it selfe, where it was a signe onely of it. And <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. the Lambe is called the Lords passeouer, which it betokened onely: In the same sense Christ sayth, This is my bodie: that is, exhibiteth and representeth vnto you my bodie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Augustine</hi> so expoundeth these wordes, <hi>Non dubitauit Dominus dicere,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Aug. cont. Adimant. cap. 12.</note>
                           <hi>Hoc est corpus meum, cum daret signum corpus sui:</hi> Christ doubted not to say, This is my bodie, when hee gaue a signe and sacrament of his bodie.</p>

                        <p>THat Christ is present with all his benefites in the sacrament, wee doe willingly graunt, neither doe we thinke that the elements of bread and wine are bare and naked signes of the bodie and blood of Christ, but Christ is verily by them exhibited vnto vs, and spiritually by fayth, we are truely made partakers of his precious bodie &amp; blood: not that Christ descendeth from heauen to vs, but we ascend by faith and in spirit vnto him: yea, we confesse as much as <hi>Bernard</hi> sayth, whose speech they themselues allow, <hi>In sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri veram carnis Christi substantia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sed spiritualiter non carnaliter:</hi> that the very substance of Christs flesh is exhibited vnto vs in the sacrament, but spiritually, not carnally.

                        <p>Argum. 1. In the receiuing of the sacrament there is a double coniunction, we are ioyned to Christ, &amp; make one body also amongst our selues:
so saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                           <q> 
                              <bibl>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.17.</bibl> We are made partakers of the body of Christ, and wee that are many are one bread, and one body: but our participation with the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall bodie of Christ is spirituall.</q>

                        </p>
                        <p>Arg. 2. If the body of Christ be in the sacrament, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it eaten, &amp; torne with the teeth: And what is eaten goeth into the belly, &amp; is cast out into the draught, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.19. I pray you what is now become of the body of Christ? doth it passe the same way that other meates doe?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarm.</hi> answereth, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>ad argum.</hi> 5. that they are the accidents of the bread and wine which are eaten, and chawen, or rent by the teeth, &amp; not the body of Christ: and yet the body of Christ goeth down into the stomack, but no further: but when the formes of bread &amp; wine begin to be corrupted there, the body of Christ goeth away, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. This is new learning, that the accidents of meate are chawen in the mouth, &amp; not the meate it selfe: &amp; that the formes only, not the substance is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, &amp; corrupted in the stomack. Say also that men are nourished with accidents &amp; not with the substance: If the priest chance to drink too deepe of the chalice, and so become drunk, I pray you what is it, that maketh him so light headed? Is it, think you, the accidents onely of wine? Surely a drunken man would not say it. If a Mouse chance to creepe into your pixe, and fil her hungry belly with your God-amight: what is it that the Mouse feedeth vpon? trow you they bee accidents onely? for you say that the consecrated host goeth no further then the stomack: and yet it is too much that the housel of Christians should be hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a mouses belly. These are but ridiculous and light questions, yet such, as haue troubled your grauest and sagest heads, and remayne vnanswered.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> denieth, that the body of Christ being eaten, goeth any further then the stomack: But our <hi>Rhemists</hi> goe further; they say, that we are made a peece of his body and blood: They should rather haue sayd, that his body and blood is made a peece of vs,<note place="margin">Rhemist. 1.

                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that the carnall presence of Christ doth not draw him out of heauen: his naturall bodie remaineth there still: yet by his omnipotent power, he can make his bodie to be in many places at once, <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>Ans. If Christs bodie be in heauen and in earth, and in many places at once; it must either be his owne naturall bodie which was borne of the Virgine Mary, or he must euery day create himselfe a new bodie: but this were to too absurd to be granted, that euery day there should be a new Christ. Neither can the first be admitted: for a natural bodie hath a natural presence: but so hath not Christs bodie in the Sacrament: for it is not there naturally, being without shape or forme, neither visible nor sensible. And how can it stand with the propertie of a true naturall bodie, to be in a thousand places at once? for so must Christs needs be, and in more too, seeing he is kept and hanged vp in euery popish Church. And further, if <hi>totus Christus,</hi> whole Christ, be in the Sacrament, both with his bodie and soule: you must either graunt, that there are many whole Christs, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is in many places at once: or els if there be but one whole Christ, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie must be dispersed euery where as his Godhead is: and so are you against your wils become <hi>Vbiquitaries.</hi>

                        <p>Argum. 4. The fathers in the law did eate the same spiritual meate, and drinke the same spirituall drinke in their Sacraments that we doe, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.2.3. but they did not eate the flesh of Christ, nor drinke his blood, but onely spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by faith: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no more doe we.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 5. There remained wine still after the consecration and distribution amongst the Apostles: for Christ saith, He will drinke no more of the fruite of the vine, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.29.

                        <p>Lastly, we must vnderstand, that this their deuised and forged opinion of the reall presence of Christ, is of no antiquitie in the Church: neither was there any question about it for a 1000. yeeres after Christ, til the time of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who liued about <hi>Anno.</hi> 1060. who was sore troubled, for maintaining the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the carnall presence, and vnder Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. and <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 2. was constrained twise to recant:<note place="margin">Fox. p. 1152</note> yet there was no publique lawe or decree made in the Church concerning transubstantiation, till the Councel of <hi>Laterane,</hi> which was held vnder Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1215.</p>

                              <note place="margin">114. Error.</note>THere are two difficulties or impossibilities, which doe hinder the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christs bodie in the Sacrament: First, it would follow, that a natural bodie, such as Christs is, might be in two places at once: for they say, that it is in heauen, and in the Eucharistall at once. Secondly, that a naturall bodie may be in a place, and yet not occupie or fill a place: for if Christs bodie be in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it occupieth no place: the compasse of a thinne and round cake is not answerable to the proportion of Christs bodie.</p>
                           <p>Notwithstanding both these difficulties, it is agreeable both to the power and good pleasure of God, that the bodie of Christ should be included in the Sacrament, <hi>Bellarm.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Argum 1. It is possible for the bodie of Christ to be in many places at once, and it also standeth with his will: as <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. Christ appeared to <hi>Saul,</hi> either vpon the earth, or in the ayre next to the earth: for how could he either heare the voyce of Christ sitting in heauen, or see the light so farre off? <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ was in two places: he appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> vpon earth, and he was at the same time in heauen, from whence he shall not moue till the day of iudgement, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. de sacram.

                           <p>Ans. First, the text is plaine, that Christ spake from heauen, from whence the light shined, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. he was neither in the ayre nor vpon the earth. Secondly, doe you make question, whether <hi>Paul</hi> could see a light, or heare a voyce from so farre;<note place="margin">23.</note> seeing that the Sunne, whose bodie is so farre distant from vs, doth disperse his beames ouer the face of the earth; and the voyce of the thunder is hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:20636:234"/>
Thirdly, and why was it not as possible, that Christ from heauen should be heard of <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was seene of <hi>Stephen</hi> sitting on the right hand of God? <hi>Act.</hi> 7.56.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. The bodie of Christ may be where it pleaseth him, and yet shall not need any naturall place, or occupie any roome: he is able to bring a Camel through the eye of a needle, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.26. He also came through the doores in to his Apostles, rose out of the sepulchre thorow the stone, was borne, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe being shut: therefore he may as well, and is no doubt, present vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shapes of bread and wine in the Sacrament, <hi>Rhemist. Math.</hi> 26. <hi>sect.</hi> 11. <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de. Sacram. cap.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. Christ sheweth in that place, that it is as impossible for a rich man, that is high minded, and trusteth in his riches, to enter into heauen, as for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell to passe through the eye of a needle: but it is possible with God to giue rich men humble and lowly minds, and so make them fit for his kingdome, as to make the Camell lesse, and so draw him thorow a needle. It is not proued out of this place, that God can or will draw the huge bodie of a Camell through a needle, remaining still of that bignes: no more then that it is possible for God, to bring a proud, rich, arrogant man to heauen, his affections not altered: both these are impossible to God, because they are contrarie to his wil and ordinance: the one is against the law of iustice, to bring a wicked man to heauen: the other against the law of nature.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. For the other three examples: it is not proued out of scripture, that the bodie of Christ pearced the doores, the graue, stone, or his mothers wombe: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the doores were found shut after Christs entrance, the graue couered, and his mother remained a Virgine still: for all these passages might giue place for a while to the bodie of Christ, and returne againe to their place: as the red sea was diuided till the Israelites passed, and afterward the waters came together againe. And concerning the last instance of the birth of Christ, it is certaine out of the scriptures, that Christ opened the wombe of his mother in his birth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.23. Hetherto therefore they haue proued nothing.</p>

This we say: that Christ is almightie, and yet can doe nothing against his owne will, his word, or glorie: as to dishonor his glorious bodie, and to bring it within the compasse of a piece of bread, that it may be deuoured of cats, dogges, rats, mice, or which is worse, to be eaten of wicked men the members of the diuell: although the question be not so much betweene vs, what Christ is able to doe of his absolute power, but what he will doe according to his word, <hi>Fulk. Math.</hi> 17. <hi>sect.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. It standeth neither with the power or will of God, to doe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his word: For it is impossible that God should lye, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18. And this
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:20636:235"/>
thing, not to lye, is not a wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of power, but a signe of greater power in God. But it is plainly declared in scripture, that Christ hath a true naturall bodie, and is in all things like vnto vs, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.17. Therefore neither can his bodie, being a true humane bodie, as ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Angel sayd, He is risen, he is not here, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.6: but it had been no good argument, to say, he is risen and gone to another place, and therefore he is not here, if so be the bodie of Christ might be in many places at once. The scripture then hath defined it, that Christs bodie is in one certaine place: wherefore to say, that Christ hath a true naturall bodie, and yet retaineth not the naturall properties of a bodie, is to speake <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories,</hi> that he hath, and hath not a true naturall bodie: and this were to make God a lier.</p>

                           <p>Argum. 2. The reall and carnall presence of Christ in the Sacrament, is a thing superfluous, needles, and vnprofitable. First, the fauour of God in the remission of sinnes through Christ, is as well sealed vnto vs in Baptisme, as in the Lords Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what neede then the carnal presence in the one more then in the other? Secondly, that Christ is in bodie present in the Sacrament, is not perceiued by any sense: for they neither tast him, see him, nor feele him: it must be then a worke of faith: but by faith Christ is as well apprehended being absent, as being supposed in this manner to be present: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this kind of presence is needles.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. It is an inglorious, vnworthie and vnseemely thing, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and impassible bodie of Christ, should be inclosed in the formes of bread and wine, deuoured and chawed, eaten and gnawed of mice, subiect to mould and rottennes, to be spilt vpon the ground, burnt in the fire: for all these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences must needes follow vpon the carnall presence.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarm.</hi> It is no more inglorious or impossible for these things now to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the bodie of Christ, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was for him to be carried in his mothers womb, to be swathed in swadling bands, and to be subiect to iniuries which were done to his bodie vpon earth.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, as though there be the like reason of the passible bodie of Christ, while he liued in the world, which was buffeted, whipped, pearced with nayles, crucified; and of his glorious and impassible bodie now, that it may in like manner be rent and diuided. Secondly, neither was it possible that Christs pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible bodie should be subiect to the like infirmities, as to rottennes, corruption, consumption in the fire, as his bodie is now in the Sacrament. If it were then verified in Christ, Thou shalt not suffer thy holy one to see corruption:
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:20636:235"/>
for his bodie did not putrifie or corrupt in the graue: much more is it true in the glorious bodie of Christ, that it cannot suffer any such things: How then are you not ashamed to affirme, that the bread and wine are made in the Sacrament, the very bodie and blood of Christ: seeing those elements, if they be kept long, will waxe sower, and mouldie, and fall to corruption? which things once to thinke of the glorious bodie of Christ, were great impietie.

                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. First, your argument followeth not, Christ could giue a glorious forme to his passible bodie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he can take away the essentiall properties of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie, and yet keepe a true bodie stil. Or thus, Christ could glorifie his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die not yet glorified: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he can or will dishonour his glorious impassible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: by enclosing it vnder the formes of base creatures to be deuoured of dogs and mice: which is honoured and worshipped of the Angels and Saints in heauen. Secondly, the question is not so much of Christs power, as of his will: therefore you conclude not aright, Christ is able to doe it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he will.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. He that seeth water turned into wine by the power of Christ, need not to doubt how he changeth bread into his bodie, <hi>Rhemist. Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, when you can bring any warrant out of scripture for your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conuersion, as we haue for this miracle, we will giue eare vnto you. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and when it shall appeare to the senses, that the bread is changed into flesh, as the water was knowne to be turned into the wine, by the colour and tast: we shall then no more doubt of this conuersion of the bread, then they did of the other of water. Thirdly, if Christ could alter and change the substances of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: what reason haue you to giue such an omnipotent power to euery priest, with a fewe words to doe as much, as Christ himselfe could when he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:20636:236"/>
Fourthly, all this proueth but an abilitie and power in Christ, not a will or purpose, to worke any such change or conuersion.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 3. Though the substance of bread and wine be chaunged, yet the formes remaine still for these causes. First, because if the formes also should be changed, there should be no sensible signe left, and so no Sacrament. Secondly, the faith of the receiuer is the better tried this way: who beleeueth the flesh of Christ to be present, though he see it not. Thirdly, Christ would not haue the formes altered, because man abhorreth to eate humane flesh in the proper shape, <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p>Ans. First, your first reason is insufficient: for neither doe the bare and naked signes or accidents of the elements make a Sacrament, but the substance of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for betweene the Sacrament and the thing thereby represented, there ought to be some conueniencie and agreement: namely, as the bodie is nourished by bread and wine, so doth the soule feed vpon the bodie and bloud of Christ. But they are not the accidents of bread and wine that nourish vs, but the substance: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not the accidents but the substance is the visible signe. Likewise in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, it is not the forme or outward accident of water, that is the signe, but the substance of water that washeth.</p>

It is a more liuely operation of faith, to beleeue in Christ absent in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then present in earth, although he appeare not to the senses. And Christ is indeed properly the obiect of faith, as he is now in heauen: Hope (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) entreth into that which is within the vaile, whither our forerunner Iesus is entred for vs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. Faith and hope therefore doe leade vs to things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vaile, that is, things in heauen, and not vpon the earth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. What a strange saying is this, that Christ giueth his flesh to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Sacrament, yet hideth it vnder the formes of bread and wine, lest men should abhorre to eate it? for is it to be thought, that Christ would command any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely thing, or contrary to humanitie? How could the Apostles command the Gentiles to abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strangled &amp; blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as, by your doctrine, they did eate dayly in their assemblies, the raw flesh and blood of Christ? And how is it that Christ now forgetteth his owne rule, He that doth the truth (sayth he) commeth to the light, that his deedes may be made manifest? <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.21. But Christ now flieth the light, &amp; shrowdeth himselfe vnder the shape of bread and wine, and wil not shew his flesh. These therefore are but sillie causes which you haue rendered, why Christ would haue the substance of bread onely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and not the accidents.</p>

                        <p>AS the name of transubstantiation is straunge, and newly deuised: so is the meaning thereof most vnreasonable: that in the Sacrament, the substance of bread should be conuerted into the bodie of Christ, the formes onely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: An opinion contrary to scripture, reason and common sense.</p>

                           <pb n="457" facs="tcp:20636:236"/>Argum. 1. As Christ said, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. (pointing to the bread) This is my body: so he sayth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.35. I am the bread: but in this place he was not changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bread: why then in the other place should the bread be turned into his body? for the speech is all one.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. The bread in the Eucharist after the consecration, is subiect to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers changes and alterations, and so likewise the wine: for they may be boyled and made hot, they may be infected with poyson: for it is certaine that <hi>Victor</hi> the 3. Pope, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. Emperour, were poysoned with the Sacrament: the wine may waxe sower and turne to vineger: the bread may putrifie and breed wormes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the substance of bread and wine remaine still: for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents cannot be subiect to such alterations: and to say that Christs bodie may be thus handled, it were great impietie, <hi>Argum. Pet. Martyris.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth: <hi>Materia substituitur à Deo in ipso instanti, in quo desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt esse illae species:</hi> God supplieth some other matter in the very instant, when the formes begin to be changed, <hi>Cap.</hi> 24. <hi>argum.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>Ans. Is not here good geare, thinke you, that if a man should come to poyson the Sacrament, that is, the bread and wine, which are alreadie consecrate, and made the bodie of Christ, God should supplie by a miracle some other matter for him to worke vpon, and so God himselfe should be accessarie vnto that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked act? Or if a sillie mouse should be so bold as gnaw vpon a consecrate Host, that then likewise some other matter and substance should for that instant be appoynted: and so God shall make miracles for mice? And why, I pray you, may not the substance of bread still remaine, as well as another substance to be put in the stead thereof?</p>
                        <p>Arg. 3. When Christ spake these words, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> the bread was transubstantiate, before, or after, or while the words were spoken. Before, they will not say, for the elements were not then consecrate: nor after, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christs words, This is my bodie, had not been true in that instant when they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Neither was the transubstantiation wrought in the while of speaking: for then should it not haue been done all at once, but successiuely, and one part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, as the words were spoken one after another. But this is also contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the opinion of the Papists, that would haue it done all together.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 4. It is against the nature and propertie of accidents and externall formes to be without a subiect, or substance, wherein they should rest: such are the whitenes and roundnes of the bread, the rednes and sweetnes of wine: if bread be gone, what is become of the roundnes and whitenes, and so of the wine. If a man aske what round or white thing is this, or what red and sweete thing is this, shewing the cup: what shall be answered? we cannot say, it is bread, or wine: for there is none left. And I am sure, they will not say, that the bodie of Christ is either round or white, or such like: and yet somewhat there must needes be, that must take denomination of these accidents.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 5. You say, the very flesh of Christ that did hang vpon the Crosse,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:20636:237"/>
is in the Sacrament: but that cannot be: for that flesh Christ tooke of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Mary: this sacramentall flesh is made of bread: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not the same flesh which was crucified vpon the Crosse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarm.</hi> The bodie of Christ is made of bread, but not as any matter or materiall cause thereof, but as the wine was made of water by our Sauiour Christ.</p>
                        <p>Ans. And I pray you how was the wine made of the water? was not the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the very matter which was turned into wine? for one of these three changes and mutations it must needes haue: first, either the water was annihilate and turned to nothing, and so the wine was created of nothing, which I am sure you will not graunt: secondly, or els there was a mixture of wine and water, the one being mingled with the other: which is likewise false, for it was very good and perfect wine: neither, I thinke, will you easily admit, that the bodie of Christ and the bread are mingled together in the Sacrament. Thirdly, there remaineth but the third kind of change, that is, the conuersion of one substance into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the water was changed into wine: and so is the substance of bread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into the substance of Christs bodie, if you will haue any chaunge at all: and thus Christ hath gotten by your helpe a breaden bodie: another from that, which he tooke of the flesh of the Virgine.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the diuersitie of opinions, which this grosse conceit of the carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ hath hatched, doe easily shew and demonstrate vnto vs, what we are to thinke of this popish doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Some doe hold, that the elements doe still remaine in their owne nature in the Sacrament, and that together with them the bodie of Christ is carnally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Others doe teach, that there remaineth no more bread and wine, but onely the verie naturall bodie of Christ: of each opinion there are three sorts.</p>
                        <p>First, of them that hold the elements not to be chaunged. 1. Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the bodie of Christ and the elements are locally ioyned together, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that instant onely, or els because of the vbiquitie and omnipresence of Christs humanitie: of which opinion are the Lutherans.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some there were, that thought onely so much of the bread to be changed into the bodie of Christ, as was receiued of the faithfull: and that part which the wicked receiued, to be bread still.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Others taught, that the bread was assumed in the Sacrament to the person of Christ, euen as his humanitie: so that Christ was bread by consecration, as he was man by his incarnation: an horrible and monstrous opinion, which is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vpon <hi>Rupertus</hi> the Abbot. <hi>Iohannes Parisiensis</hi> also came neere this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who likewise affirmed, that the bread was assumed to the person of Christ, and vnited vnto him, yet not immediatly, as the other taught, but by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meanes of the humanitie of Christ.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, of those that maintaine the conuersion of the elements. First, some would haue the forme onely of bread chaunged not the matter, as <hi>Durandus.</hi>
                           <pb n="459" facs="tcp:20636:237"/>
Secondly, some contrariwise, would haue the matter altered, and the forme to remaine. Thirdly, the Iesuits affirme the bread wholly in substance, both in matter and forme to be changed, the outward formes and accidents onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. <hi>ex Bellarm. lib. 3. de sacram, Eucharist. cap. 11.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus men, when they begin once to leaue the truth, the Lord leaueth them to themselues, and they runne mad in their owne inuentions, not finding any end: and so it is iustly come vpon them, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith of the heathen:
<q>Because when they knew God, they did not glorifie him as God, neither were thankfull: they became vaine in their own imaginations, and their foolish hart was full of darkenes: when they professed themselues to be wise, they became fooles, <bibl>
                                 <hi>Rom. 1.21.22.</hi>
                              </bibl>
                           </q>
We therefore leauing these shalow pittes of humane inuentions, which will holde no water, will betake vs to the fountaine of truth. This then, to conclude, is our definitiue sentence, and full determination, according to the Scriptures, that Christ indeed is verily present in the Sacrament, neither by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of the bread into his body, either wholly, or in parte, nor by assumption of the bread to the vnity of his person; nor yet by the coniunction of his body and bread together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he doth verily exhibite himselfe, with all his benefits, spiritually by faith, to be eaten and drunke of the worthy receiuer, as we haue sufficiently proued before out of the Scriptures.</p>

                        <p>Argum. 1. Christs words which were spoken ouer the bread, This is my body, were true as soone as he brought them forth, before he said, Take, eat, and so likewise of the cup: therefore it was a Sacrament, before they did receiue and eate it, and had beene a Sacrament still, if it had not bene receiued at all at that time. <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. Those wordes of Christ, This is my body, were not spoken before he brake the bread and distributed it: but first as <hi>S.

                        <p>Secondly, the institution of the Sacrament consisteth partly of a promise, partly of a precept: the promise is this, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> This is my body: the precept, <hi>Accipite, manducate,</hi> Take, eate.

                        <p>THe Eucharist is no sacrament beside or without the vse thereof: so that, though some form of words be pronounced ouer it, if it be not receiued and eaten and drunk, it is no sacrament: neither is that which remaineth after the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution, the Eucharist being ended, either of the bread or wine, any part of the sacrament, but so much onely as is taken and vsed.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. It is no Sacrament, vnlesse it be vsed according to the institution as Christ hath commanded it: but to the institution it belongeth on the behalfe of the Minister, to blesse, break, and distribute it: on the behalfe of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants to take,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.24.26.</note> eate, and drinke it: in them all, thereby to shew the Lords death, and to doe it in remembrance of Christ.

                        <p>Argum. 2. The Sacraments of the new testament are alike, and of one and the selfesame kinde, there is one way of instituting and consecrating both: but the water in baptisme is no part of the Sacrament, but during the solemne acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of baptizing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterward it returneth to the common vse, so much as is not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is so also in the Eucharist: for as Christ saith to his Apostles: <hi>Ite, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizate:</hi> Goe and baptize, so that it was no Sacrament, vnlesse some body were baptized: euen so he saith, <hi>Accipite, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="1">1. WE deny not, but that Christ vsed vnleauened bread, at the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his last Supper, hauing immediately before eaten the Paschall Lambe, which we doubt not but he kept, according to the Lawe, with sweete bread: yet in the time they are greatly deceiued, affirming, that all the Iewes eate the Passeouer like wise ouer eeuen, and crucified Christ on the morrow, which should haue beene, and was vnto them (as they say) a chiefe festiuall day.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, that Christ eate the Passeouer the 14, day at eeuen, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Law: but the Iewes had a contrary tradition: they would in no wise keepe two festiuall daies together: and therefore because the sixteenth daie was their Sabboth, they would not haue the feast of vnleauened bread vpon the fifteenth day (though it were so appointed by the law) to auoide the concurrence of two holy daies together, but deferred it till the next
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:20636:239"/>
day, which was their Sabboth, and eate the Passeouer the eeue before, which was the 15. day at night; whereas Christ reforming that abuse, kept the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the eeue before according to the Law, that is, the 14. at night: It appeareth then, that the next day following, which we call Friday, wherein Christ was put to death, was not kept of the Iewes as a holy day.</p>
                        <p>First, the text saith, they would not put Christ to death vpon the feast day, fearing the tumult of the people, <hi>Mark. 14.</hi>2. Secondly, if they had kept it holy as the Law commaunded, they should haue done no seruile labour therein, that is, no work of the body, <hi>Leuitic. 23.7.</hi> But what could be a more seruile worke, then to crucifie Christ, to carry the Crosse, and pitch it in the ground, and such like; which the Iewes would not haue done vpon that day, which they were as straightly to keep as the Sabboth? It is also called the preparation of the Sabboth, <hi>Mark. 15.43.</hi> Wherein they were wont to prepare against the Sabboth what was needfull: but such workes of preparation could not haue bene done in that great festiual day. <hi>Augustine</hi> also saith, that the day of Christs suffering was not <hi>Pascha, sed praeparatio Paschae,</hi> It was not the Pasch, but the preparation to it:<note place="margin">De consen. Euangel. li. 3. cap. 13.</note> it is not therefore true that it was kept holy of the Iewes, the day of Christs passion, neither that they did eate the paschall Lambe the same eeue that Christ did, but the night following.</p>
                        <p>If they shall obiect that place, <hi>Mark. 14.12.</hi> where the Euangelist saith, It was the first day of vnleauened bread, when Christ eat his passeouer: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Iewes began then to eate sweet bread. We answere, that the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist hath relation vnto the right time of keeping the Passeouer, as it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Law, and obserued by Christ: not to the corrupt custome of the Iewes. Wherfore we graunt that Christ might eate vnleauened bread, but not in such manner and order, as they say.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it was not of the substance of the institution to eate vnleauened bread, no more then to eat it at night, and to receiue it sitting, we are not more bound to the one, then to the other. Againe, Christ vsed vnleauened bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the vsuall bread at that time: so we do vse that which is the vsuall bread in our time. And <hi>S.

of the Sacraments and words of consecration: which being vttered, immediatly the elements are changed into the body and blood of Christ: wherefore these words are not to be read historically for the instruction of the people, but they are onely consecratory wordes, to be pronounced ouer the elements: <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist. 1.

                        <p n="1">1. WE acknowledge no such consecration at all, by vertue whereof the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are conuerted and transubstantiate into the body of Christ, as we haue before shewed. A consecration we graunt, which is a setting apart of the elements, which before were common, to holy vses, and by the vetue of Christs institution, to be made vnto vs signes of holy things.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, those are not the onely words of consecration, This is my body, and, This is the cup of my blood, and yet Christs wordes shall be true: for we must not dismember the sentence: Christ saith, Take, eate ye, this is my body: it is then made his body to be taken and eaten: by taking then and eating, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments also are consecrated, not onely by saying of the words: ye must not then diuide the words of the institution, for then they shall no more consecrate, then if you should pronounce but two of your consecratory words, as, This is, or, My body, and leaue out the rest.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that these are not the onely words of consecration, it appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both the bread was broken and distributed, and the Cuppe also, before Christ spake those words, as <hi>Math. 26.26.</hi> for first Christ saith, Take, eate, and, Take and drink, before he said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either, This is my body, or, This is my blood: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ye well tell yourselues, which are your consecratory wordes for the Cup, whether those that <hi>Mathew</hi> setteth downe, This is my blood of the newe testament: or as <hi>Luke</hi> hath, This Cup is the new testament in my blood.

                        <p>Ans. 1. The death of Christ, and so remission of sinnes purchased by the same, is properly represented vnto vs in both Sacraments: yet in a diuerse respect: for as to be borne is one thing, to be fed and nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>FIrst, we doe truly affirme and teach, that an especiall and principall vse of the Eucharist or Communion, is to strengthen and assure our faith of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes: and yet we deny not, but that it hath other vses beside: for as in Baptisme not onely the washing away of our sinnes is shewed forth, but it also betokeneth our dying to sinne, and rising to newnes of life, <hi>Ro. 6.3.4.</hi> So in the Lords supper whole Christ with all his benefites is exhibited vnto vs, as it is a pledge vnto vs, not onely of remission of sinnes, but that Christ is become our righteousnes and sanctification, <hi>1. Cor. 1.30.</hi> that he will assist vs with his spirite, and replenish our harts with grace, <hi>Ioh. 4.14.</hi> yea, the spirituall eating and drinking of the flesh and blood of Christ, is a pledge vnto vs of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of life eternall, <hi>Ioh. 6.54.</hi> But that amongst the rest, it also assureth vs of remission of sinnes, thus it is proued.</p>
                        <p>Argum. Christ after <hi>S. Mathew</hi> saith, This is the blood of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is shed for many for remission of sinnes, <hi>Math. 26.28.</hi> But the new testament includeth a promise of remission of sinnes, <hi>Iere. 31.34.</hi> Yea our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour setteth it downe in plaine termes: for why els should our Sauiour make expresse mention of forgiuenes of sinnes, if this sacrament did not serue for that vse?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we doe holde, that to haue a liuely faith in the promises of God, with repentance for our sinnes, and a full purpose to amend our liues, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent preparation for the Communion: and that this sacrament is a soueraigne remedy for a troubled conscience. Neither ought men to refraine from the Communion, till they haue fully satisfied for their sinnes, as the Papists teach, and are cleered in their conscience of all their sinnes: for so, few or none at all, should be admitted to the Lords table: but in whom faith hath alredy wrought repentance in some measure, he may safely receiue the sacrament for his further comfort, and assurance of remission of sinnes.</p>
                        <p>Argum. <hi>Iohn. 6.35.</hi> He that beleeueth in me, saith Christ, shall neuer thirst: <hi>S. Paul</hi> also exhorteth men to examine themselues, <hi>1. Corin. 11.28.</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, as himselfe expondethu it, then to proue whether they be in the faith, <hi>2. Cor. 13.5.

                        <p>Argum. 1. Christ is all and whole in euery parte of the sacrament, his blood by a certaine concomitance is in the bread, &amp; his flesh by the like conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitance is in the cup, for otherwise Christ should be deuided: But euery spirit, sayth the Apostle, that dissolueth Iesus, is of God, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.3. Wherefore hee that receiueth in one kinde, is as well partaker of whole Christ, and of the full grace and effect of the sacrament, as if hee receiued in both, <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 21.</p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. We denie any such concomitance of the blood and flesh of Christ in the sacrament: for he is not in his carnall presence with his very flesh and blood there included, as we haue shewed before: the bread and wine are signes
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:20636:242"/>
onely of his body and blood, and therefore Christ is not diuided, they being the signes onely and not the thing signified.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The place alleadged out of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> is greatly abused and corrupted by them, while they choose rather to follow their olde blinde latine translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the authenticall Greeke text: the words in the originall are, Euery spirite that confesseth not Iesus Christ: not, euery spirite that dissolueth: And this may appeare to bee the true reading, by the opposition in the former verse, Euery spirite that confesseth Iesus, is of GOD: therefore this is the best reading, Euery spirite that confesseth not Iesus: as being set opposite and contrarie to the other verse. Againe, the <hi>Rhemists</hi> vnderstand this place after their owne reading, of the dissoluing of the humanitie and diuinitie of Christ: not of any such separation of the flesh and blood of Christ, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.</hi> supposeth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 This their deuice of concomitance ouerthwarteth the institution of Christ: For he sayth, the bread is his body, the wine his blood: but by their rule, the bread is his blood, and the wine his bodie. And be it graunted, that the blood of Christ is in the bread, yet how can any man be sayd to drink it in bread? We vse to eate bread, not to drink bread: his blood therefore cannot be there, because it cannot be drunke there.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.30. Christ brake bread to his disciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. the Apostles brake bread: <hi>Ergo,</hi> to communicate in one kinde is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the example of Christ and his Apostles, <hi>Bellarmin. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Eucharist.</hi> 24. <hi>Rhemist. Iohn.</hi> 6.11. And Christ sayth, Whosoeuer shall eate this bread, shall liue for euer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.58. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is sufficient to receiue in one kinde.</p>
                        <p>Answer: 1. To the two first places, we say, that it is not necessary to vnderstand the breaking of bread in the sacrament: but the vsuall bread ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was accustomed in their daylie repasts and feasts after thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to be broken. Or, if we take it for the sacrament, the breaking of bread is by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> taken for the whole mysterie, as it is an vsuall phrase of speech in scripture: for otherwise wee will conclude as well, that Christ and the Apostles did but consecrate in one kinde, which they holde for a great absurditie, as that the other receiued but in one kinde: But their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that although the people must communicate in one kinde onely, yet the Priest must consecrate both, <hi>Rhemist. annotat. Iohn.</hi> 6. <hi>sect.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To the second place wee answere: First it is not vnderstoode of the sacramentall eating of Christ, but of the spirituall manducation of him, which may be done without a sacrament: For whosoeuer eateth this bread, shall liue for euer: but whosoeuer eateth the sacrament, shall not liue for euer. Secondly, seeing the eating and drinking of Christ are so often ioyned in this chapter, as <hi>vers.</hi> 53.55.56. they might well know, that drinking is here to be vnderstoode, though it be not expressed.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 3. In many countries there is no wine to bee had, as in the cold Northerly countreies: and therefore they cannot communicate according
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:20636:243"/>
to the institution: whereupon that there might be an vniformitie in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it is most meete that where wine may bee had, they should notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be content to receiue it in one kinde, <hi>Bellarmin. cap.</hi> 28. Also there may arise much inconuenience in graunting the cuppe to the people, as in spilling and sheading the wine, which after consecration is the blood of Christ, <hi>Rhemist. annot. Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>sect.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>Answ. 1. As in some countries there is no wine to bee had, so wee finde that in certaine places and regions of the world there is no bread, such as Christ vsed,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 27.</note> made of wheate or the like grayne: as in some places amongst the West <hi>Indians,</hi> they haue a certaine kinde of bread made of rootes called <hi>Cazabi,</hi> as <hi>Benzo</hi> witnesseth. Wherefore by this reason of vniformitie, wee should not communicate at all, either in bread or wine, seeing that as some countreyes are destitute of wine, so other are of bread: but all this not withstanding, the sacrament may be duely administred in all places in both kindes: and where they haue neither bread nor wine, neither can possibly prouide them, they may safely vse such other elements, as doe stand them in the like stead: as in the place of bread, that which commeth nearest to the vse thereof: and for wine, some other precious liquor, that is to be had, as in <hi>Russia</hi> in stead of wine they vse a certaine drink like vnto that which we call <hi>Metheglen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 As for the other reasons of the inconueniences in spilling the wine, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the cuppe, the hanging of it on mens beards, &amp; other such friuolous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations: as they were no let or hinderance, why Christ notwithstanding did not institute the sacrament in both kindes, and the Church accordingly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, as we reade, the Corinthians did communicate in both kindes: so ought they to bee no reason, why Christians should not receiue in both kindes nowe.</p>

                     <div type="Protestant_doctrine">
                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>WE holde it to be an Antichristian practise of the Church of Rome, to take away from the people the cuppe in the sacrament: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they sometime minister the cuppe to the people, yet they vse no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration ouer it, neither giue it as any parte of the sacrament, <hi>Fulk. annotat.</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.10. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. They doe therefore offer great wrong to the people of God, in depriuing them of the one halfe of the communion.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53. Christ sayth, Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man and drink his blood, you haue no life in you. Here wee see both eating and drinking are ioyned together: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christians ought to doe both. This place maketh strongly against our aduersaries, who doe expound it of the sacramental eating and drinking of Christ.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. Christ instituted the sacrament in both kinds, giuing charge and commaundement to all Christians in the same manner to celebrate it:
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:20636:243"/>
for he sayth, Drinke ye all of this. If our aduersaries answere, as they doe, that this was spoken to the Apostles: by the like reason they may say also, that when Christ sayd, Take, eate; he spake vnto his Apostles, and so the people shoulde neither receiue bread and wine, but the Ministers onely.</p>
                        <p>Agayne, Saynt <hi>Paul,</hi> the best expounder of our Sauiour Christ, declareth the right vse of the Lords Supper in both kindes for all Christians: for hee wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the whole congregation, and Church of the Corinthians, not to the Pastors and teachers onely: and to euery Christian he sayth, Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cuppe, <hi>vers.</hi> 28.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 3. The Priest that saith Masse, you allow to consecrate and receiue in both kindes, because hee must expresse liuely the passion of Christ and the separation of his blood from his bodie in the same: <hi>Rhemist. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat. Iohn.</hi> 6.58. By the same reason all the communicants ought to receiue in both kindes, because they doe all shewe foorth the death of Christ, and sheading of his blood in the sacrament: 1. <hi>Corinthian.</hi> 11.26. And seeing the cuppe is a signe of the blood of Christ shedde for remission of sinnes, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.28. for as much as the thing signified, that is, the remission of sinnes, in the blood of Christ, is common to all faythfull Christians, why should they not as well be partakers of the signe?</p>
                        <p>Argum. 4. This prohibition for lay men, not to receiue in both kindes, is but a late deuise of the Church of Rome, not past two hundred yeare olde, decreed no longer agoe then in the Councell of <hi>Constance, Fox. pag.</hi> 1150. yet after that, he Councel of <hi>Basile</hi> graunted the vse and libertie of the cup to the <hi>Bohemians, Fox. pag.</hi> 694.</p>
                        <p>Thus they take vpon them to ouer-rule mens consciences, now restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, now againe graunting libertie, binding and loosing at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Augustines</hi> time there was no such separation of the cuppe from the bread: but both were indifferently vsed in the communion: <hi>Cum cibo &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi> saith he, <hi>id appetant homines vt neque esuriant, neque sitiant,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Tract. in Iohan. 27.</note> 
                           <hi>hoc veraciter non praestat, nisi iste cibus &amp; potus, &amp;c.</hi> As men by their meate and drink doe prouide, that they neither hunger nor thirst: so this spirituall meate and drink worketh the same effect in vs. Whereupon it followeth, that seeing in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacrament is contained and signified the full and sufficient nourishment of our soules by the flesh and blood of Christ, it must needes be resembled by the outward full sufficient nourishment of our bodies, which is not by eating alone, but by eating and drinking.</p>

Although the body of Christ were present in that manner vnder the accidents of bread and wine, yet vnlesse Christ bee so present, that the elements or the accidents of the elements be ioyned and vnited vnto him in one person, as the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and humanitie make but one person, hee is no more to bee adored, then God the father is to bee worshipped in the Sunne or Moone, in the which he is verily present. But to say that the visible formes and elements are ioyned in an hypostaticall vnion to Christ, as his humanity is to his Godhead, it is great blasphemie. 3. A reuerent estimation and discerning of the Lordes bodie we graunt in the sacrament; in preferring the elements before all other meates and drinkes, because of their mysticall signification, as wee preferre the mysticall washing in Baptisme before all other: but to kneele, holde vp the handes, and to worship a peece of bread, wee count it grosse and abominable Idolatrie.</p>

                        <p>THat the sacrament is not to be adored with any godly worship, but onely to be duely reuerenced as an holy mysterie: thus wee prooue it by the worde of God.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. In the first instituting of the sacrament, the Apostles receiued it sitting, not kneeling, by taking of it, not lifting vp their handes to it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they did not adore it, neither is it by vs to be adored.</p>

                        <p>FIrst, we are taught by the word of God, that by eating the bread, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the cup in the Sacrament, not by gazing, looking, lifting vp, turning, hanging vp bread in pixes, or by any such meanes, but onely as we haue saide,

                        <p>Secondly, it is a foule absurditie to make any representation of Christs death, by bare gestures, shewes, and actions of the bodie without any Sacrament, as they doe in their popish pageants vpon Christs Passion daye: for at that time there is no Sacrament consecrated, <hi>Eckius. cap.</hi> 15.

                           <p>Argum. 1. Christ is a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedech:</hi> but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> priesthoode did consist in sacrificing in the formes of bread and wine: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the eternitie of Christs priesthoode standeth in the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of his bodie and blood in those formes: there doth therefore still remaine a proper external sacrifice in the Church, <hi>Rhemist. annot. Hebr.</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 8. <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. We confesse, that <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was a type of our Sauiour Christ, and that he was a Priest after <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> order: but not in any such respect, for offering in bread and wine: for the text saith, hee brought forth bread and wine, he offered it not: he brought it forth for the refreshing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and those which were with him, <hi>Genes.</hi> 14.18.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He brought forth bread and wine, and not the formes onely of bread and wine, therefore your sacrifice in the formes onely is not after his order.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. If <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> bringing forth of bread &amp; wine were a sacrifice or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and a type of the like sacrifice to continue for euer in the Church, it must also haue been a propitiatorie sacrifice for the remission of sinnes, as they say the sacrifice of the Masse is, which was thereby signified: but there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie sacrifice for remission of sinnes, without shedding of blood, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.22. Therefore <hi>Milchisedechs</hi> act, being without blood, was no such sacrifice, and consequently none at all.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Apostle to the Hebrues sheweth, wherein Christ was a Priest after <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> order, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. First, in that <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was both king &amp; Priest, verse 2. so is Christ. Secondly, in respect of the eternitie of his Priesthoode: we doe not reade either of the beginning of his dayes, or end of his life, nor of any change of his priesthoode, vers. 3. Al which is most truely verified in Christ. Thirdly, <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was a type of Christ, and his Priesthoode of Christs, because of the excellencie thereof aboue the Leuiticall Priesthoode: for <hi>Leui</hi> paide tithes in <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> and therefore was inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and was blessed of <hi>Melchisedech</hi> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> the lesse of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: so is the Priesthoode of Christ aduaunced farre aboue <hi>Aarons</hi> order. If in any other materiall point <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> Priesthoode had resembled Christs, as in this oblation of bread and wine, the Apostle would not haue omitted it.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Therein consisted the proper act of <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> priesthoode, for the which he receiued tithes of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but, as the Apostle saith, he receiued tithes, and blessed <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the tithes were due not for any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he offered, but for his blessing. The same therefore was the proper act of his Priesthoode.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. They alleage that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.3. Euery high Priest is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to offer giftes and hostes, wherefore it is necessarie that he also haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:20636:247"/>
to offer. Christ then hath a certaine host in externall and proper manner, as other Priests haue, but this visible and externall act of sacrificing he doth not exercise now in heauen: therefore it must needes bee meant of the perpetuall oblation of his body and blood in the Church: for somewhat he must alwaies haue to offer, <hi>Rhemist. Hebr.</hi> 8. <hi>sect.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. The Apostle saith not, that it is necessarie that Christ should still haue somewhat to offer in sacrifice: but that it was needefull for him to haue somewhat, which he had alreadie offered: for the verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, signifieth not the present tence, but the time past: whereby is vnderstoode the oblation which hee had already offered once, and which neede not bee repeated, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.27. For as herein hee is like to other Priests, that hee must haue somewhat to haue offered, so is he vnlike also in this, that they by reason of their infirmitie had need to offer often: but Christ our high Priest did it but once, as in that place the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sheweth.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The gift which the Apostle in this place attributeth to Christ,<note place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> was his bodie, which hee calleth the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pight and not man. But that bodie of Christ, which they say is offered vp in the sacrifice of the Masse, is not of that nature: for it is made by the ministerie of man: for euery one of their sacrificing Priests is able to make the bodie of Christ: but this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which Christ had to offer, was made onely by God, without the helpe of man, as the Apostle saith. Againe, say, if you dare, that the bodie which you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is the true Tabernacle and temple of God: for then it would followe, that God dwelleth in temples made with hands, that is, by the ministerie of man, contrarie to the Scriptures: seeing you affirme that the bodie of Christ is no otherwise present but by the ministerie of the Priest. And what a goodly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle is this for God, thinke you, which you shut vp in a pixe, and hang vp in your Churches? A mouse may eate it, the fire may consume it, corruption may take it: would God suffer his Tabernacle thus to be defiled? Wherefore vpon these premises we conclude, that what you offer in your popish sacrifice, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the proper gift belonging to Christes Priesthoode.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. The Apostle saith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.10. Wee haue an altar, whereof they haue no power to eate, which serue in the Tabernacle. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we haue not onely a common table to eate meere bread vpon, but a verie altar in the proper sense to sacrifice Christs bodie vpon. <hi>Rhemist. annot. Hebr.</hi> 13. <hi>sect.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, the Apostle speaketh of the sacrifice of Christs death, whereof we are made partakers by faith: which they can reape no benefite by, which remaine in the ceremoniall obseruations of Leuiticall sacrifices. Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is our Priest, altar and sacrifice: for verse 12. the Apostle maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the suffrings of Christ: he meaneth not then the Communion table, which is vnproperly called an altar, or any materiall altar beside, but the altar onely of Christs death. Secondly, if wheresoeuer in Scripture this worde (altar) is read, it must be taken for a proper materiall altar, we shall haue also a
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:20636:248"/>
material altar in heauen, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.3. which I am sure they wil not grant. Thirdly, the Apostle saith, We haue an altar, which is but one, whereas popish altars are many: it cannot therefore be vnderstoode of such altars.</p>

                           <p>THat there are spirituall sacrifices remaining yet vnto Christians in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of religion, we doe verily beleeue, being so taught by the Scriptures: such are the sacrifices of praise and thankesgiuing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. The sacrifice of almes and distribution, verse 16. the mortifying also of the flesh, is a kinde of crucifying, and so a spirituall sacrifice, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.14.

                           <p>Argum. 1. The very flesh, and true naturall bodie of Christ, is not, as wee haue shewed before at large, in such carnall and corporall manner present in the Sacrament: therefore it cannot in the Sacrament be sacrificed, and offered vp.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. This sacrificing of the bodie and blood of Christ is contrarie to Christs institution: for he saith onely, Take yee, eate yee, drinke yee: he saith not, Sacrifice yee, or lift vp, and make an oblation of my bodie. Neither doe those wordes, <hi>hoc facite,</hi> doe this, giue them any power to sacrifice: for to whome he saith, Eate yee, drinke yee, to the same also he saith, Doe yee. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if doe yee, be as much as, sacrifice yee: all Christians, for whome it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to eate and drinke the Sacrament, by this rule haue authoritie to sacrifice. Againe, the words are, Doe this in remembrance. We remember things absent, and which are alreadie done and past: if then there be a present sacrifice in the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ, it cannot properly be said to be a memorie of his sacrifice.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. The Apostle saith, that Christ neede not to offer himselfe often, but that he hath done once in the end of the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. And with one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, hath hee made perfite for euer them that are sanctified, 10.14. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ cannot be sacrificed againe: for that were to make his sacrifice vpon the crosse imperfect.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth: that the Apostle here speaketh of the bloodie and painefull sacrifice of Christ vpon the crosse, which was sufficient once to bee done: but this taketh not away the vnbloodie sacrifice, which is but an iteration of the former, whereby the fruite and efficacie of that first oblation is applied vnto vs, <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de miss. cap.</hi> 25.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, the Apostle excludeth all manner iterations of the sacrifice of Christ, for otherwise, if Christ should now bee often howsoeuer sacrificed, the difference would not hold betweene the sacrifices of the lawe which were often
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:20636:248"/>
done, and the sacrifice of Christ, which was once to be performed: for their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were also in a manner iterations and commemorations of the sacrifice of Christ. The Apostle then thus reasoneth, They had many iteratiue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoratiue sacrifices of Christs death: <hi>Ergo,</hi> we haue not now. Secondly, that is but a foolish and false distinction of the bloodie and vnbloodie sacrifice, as they vnderstand it: for there can be no proper vnbloodie sacrifice of Christ, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he be offered vp, otherwise then by dying, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27.28. Therefore he is not offered vp in the Sacrament, because now he dyeth not. Thirdly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neede wee inuent a new kinde of sacrifice, for the application of Christs death: for to that end Christ hath appointed the preaching of the word, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Sacraments: wherby the death of Christ with al the benefites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are most fruitefully applied vnto vs, <hi>Galath.</hi> 3.1. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.26.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 4. <hi>Augustine</hi> in a certaine place allegorizing the parable of the prodigall child, thus writeth, <hi>Vitulum occidit,</hi>

                           <p>FIrst, we hold it to be a great blasphemie to say, that the Priesthood &amp; sacrifice of Christ vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crosse, is not that sacrifice or Priesthood into the which the old sacrifice &amp; Priesthood was translated &amp; changed. The Apostle proueth the contrary: for that sacrifice, whereby the new Testament is established, is that,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:20636:249"/>
whereunto the old sacrifice and Priesthoode is translated: but this is done by the singular sacrifice of Christ, who is the suretie of a better testament, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Ergo,</hi> his singular sacrifice vpon the crosse, is that whereinto the old Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call sacrifices are changed, and no other. Againe the Priesthoode after <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedechs</hi> order is that, into the which the old Priesthoode is changed: but the Priesthoode of Christ vpon the Crosse was after that order. <hi>Ergo.</hi> But here they are not ashamed to denie, that the sacrifice of Christ vpon the Crosse was after <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> order, but doe most impudently and blasphemously affirme, that it was after the order of <hi>Aaron, Heskin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. And thus euery vile masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger shall be more properly a Priest after <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> order, then Christ himselfe.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, none but Christ is a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedech:</hi> for vnto whome the Lord saide, Thou art a Priest for euer after the order of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech,</hi> to him the Lord saith also in the same Psalme, Sit thou at my right hand, Psal. 110. But this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not agree to any popish Priest: therefore not the other. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Apostle maketh this difference betweene the Priesthoode of the lawe and the Gospell: because then there were many Priests, they being prohibited by death to continue: but Christ is the onely Priest of the New Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he dieth not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 23.24. If they answer, as they doe, that although there be many Priestes, yet it is but one Priesthoode, because Christ concurreth with them in the actes of the Priesthoode, <hi>Rhemist.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We answer, first, Christ concurreth with his faithfull ministers in the actes of their Ministerie: but no such Priesthoode doe wee acknowledge. Secondly, so Christ concurred in the actes of the Leuiticall Priesthoode, and the sacrifices of the law that were rightly offered: wherefore this concurrence of Christ dooth no more take away the multitude of Priests in the Gospell, then it did in the lawe.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, concerning the name of Priests in their sense, as it implieth an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of sacrificing, we vtterly abhor it: secondly, but as it is deriued of the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Thirdly, as for the word (<hi>sacerdos</hi>) which may be englished a sacrificer, we finde it no where in the New Testament giuen to the ministers of the Gospell, and so much <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> confesseth, <hi>cap.</hi> 17. And therefore vnfitly and vnproperly agreeth vnto them. If some of the fathers haue confounded the names of <hi>Sacerdos</hi> and (<hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi>) they are not to be commended. The word <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> a sacrificer, being a proper name of the Leuitical Priests, cannot properly be attributed to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospell. To conclude, this word (Priest) as it is the English of <hi>(Sacerdos)</hi> we doe not approue: but as it giueth the sense of <hi>(Presbyter)</hi> from whence it is deriued, we condemne it not: for so it signifieth nothing else but an Elder.

                        <p>Ans. FIrst, Christ instituted no sacrifice, as we declared afore, but onely a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in remembrance of his death and passion. Secondly, the Sacrament rightly administred, serueth to assure our faith of remission of sinnes by the death of Christ: but it doth not by it owne vertue conferre remission of sinnes, neither profiteth by the worke wrought: for the Apostle sayth, That without faith it is impossible to please God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6. wherefore no action is accepted of God not proceeding of faith.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, neither doth the celebration of the Sacrament profite the dead, as we haue shewed before, that it is in vaine to pray for them.</p>

                        <p>Argum. All these superstitious obseruances are cleane contrarie and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the institution of Christ.

Secondly, neither doth the similitude of a medicine conclude: for you cannot proue that the Sacrament not receiued hath vertue in it, as a medicine hath: for faith is requisite to the worthie receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which is not necessarie in the applying of a medicine: and yet it is not properly called a medicine, vnlesse being made, it be also applied, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued doth heale.</p>

                           <p>THeir owne authors doe testifie, that euery patch of their Masse was thrust in by Popes later then the Apostles: as by <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>1. Gregory</hi> the <hi>1. Gregory</hi> the <hi>3. Innocentius</hi> the <hi>3. Honorius</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> with many other: yea, <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>1.</hi> confesseth, that one <hi>Scholasticus</hi> made the most part of the Canon. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was not deuised by the Apostles. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that <hi>Gregory</hi> setteth not downe any one man, by this name <hi>Scholasticus,</hi> but meaneth generally some notable learned man: and in this sense <hi>S.

                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. This deuise of the Iesuite is rather to be laughed at, then to be confuted: who euer heard before, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> and the other Apostles were <hi>Scholastici,</hi> Schoolemen? what is this els, but to set the spirite of God to schoole, in saying that the Apostles being men endued with the holy Ghost, were brought vp in Schooles? Againe, <hi>Gregory</hi> findeth fault with the said <hi>Scholasticus,</hi> that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Canon, he would put in his own praiers, and leaue out the Lords praier: but if this <hi>Scholasticus</hi> had beene <hi>Peter,</hi> I think <hi>Gregory</hi> would not haue beene so bolde, as to haue rebuked him.</p>

                     </q>
What great blasphemie is this, to offer bread &amp; wine for the redemption of the Church, for the which Christ in great loue offered vp himselfe?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Priest saith, <hi>Worshipping the memoriall of the Virgine:</hi> But Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Sacrament to be kept in remembrance of himselfe, and not for the worship of Saints.</p>

                     <hi>Thus the merites and praiers of Christ are excluded.</hi>

                     <q>We beseech thee (saith the Priest) to receiue this oblation, which we beseech thee in all things to make blessed:</q>
Heere the Priest is made a mediator betweene Christ and his Father: desiring God to sanctifie the body &amp; blood of his sonne.</p>

                     <q>5. <hi>Who the next day afore he suffered:</hi> But the Scripture saith, The same night, <hi>For this is my body:</hi>
                     </q>
Heere they haue put in <hi>enim,</hi> of their owne, and left out, <hi>quod pro vobis datur.</hi> Such is their boldenes, that they are not ashamed to change the words of our Sauiour Christ.</p>

                     <hi>6. He saith further:</hi> 
                     <q>The holy bread of eternall life, which vouchsafe thou with a pleasant countenaunce to beholde:</q>
The bread of eternall life is Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if this be he, how dare ye presume to offer him vp to his Father?</p>

                     <q>As thou didst vouchsafe to accept the righteous giftes of Abel, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Abraham.</q>
Heere the sacrifice of Christ is compared to the sacrifice of beastes: and the Priest seemeth to attribute as much efficacie to the one, as to the other.</p>

This is a plaine vntruth, and a flat lie, as we haue shewed alredy, that <hi>Melchisedech</hi> sacrificed bread and wine.</p>

                     <q>Command thou these to be brought by the hands of thy holy Angell, vnto the high altar in heauen.</q>
What an absurd thing is this, that he should desire that to be carried into heauen which he eateth and deuoureth? And if this be the body of Christ, what need the help of an Angell to carry it vp to heauen? is not Christ able to lift vp his own body? or what need that to be conueied to heauen, which was neuer from thence?</p>

                  <p>If then I should be demaunded at once, which of all popish blasphemies and heresies I thinke most abominable, contrary to the faith, and to be abhorred of all good christians: (though I know that there are many of this kinde) yet I would redily answere the Masse: the inuention whereof, I am wel assured, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ascribed but to the deuil himselfe, the author of all lies and blasphemies.</p>

But as for them, it is a shame to see, how without all feare, the <hi>Rhemists</hi> in their annotations vpon the new testament, doe bely and slander our Church: I will for example sake note a fewe places.</p>

Ioh. 20.22.</hi> The faculty of the Priesthoode co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting in remitting of sinnes, is heere bestowed vpon the Apostles, <hi>Rhemist. annot.

Trident. sess. 14. canon. 1. Bellarm. lib. 1. de poenitent. cap. 10.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. 1. If the power of remission of sinnes were heere first instituted, how could the Apostles baptize or minister the Lords supper before, without power to remit sinnes to the penitent? Christ therefore in this place doth but renewe and confirme the authority of their Apostleship, which was granted to them before, <hi>Math. 18.18.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="503" facs="tcp:20636:259"/>Secondly, this power here giuen, is principally exercised by preaching of the word of God, and denouncing publikely or priuately the promises of God, for remission of sinnes to the penitent, or the threates and iudgement of God, in binding the sinnes of the obstinate and impenitent: So <hi>Luke 20.24.</hi> Christ commandeth his Apostles to preach repentance and remission of sinnes in his name.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we confesse also a iudiciary power of the keies, in binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which is exercised in ecclesiasticall discipline, in punishng and absoluing according to the word of God: as the incestuous person was bound, when he was deliuered vp to Sathan, <hi>1. Cor. 5.5.</hi> he was loosed againe, when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the Church, <hi>2. Cor. 2.7.</hi> But neither this nor the other was commended to the Church as a Sacrament.</p>

                     <p>TRue repentance we doe acknowledge, which is a dying to sinne, and a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in newnes of life, <hi>Rom. 6.4.</hi> But a Sacrament of repentance we finde none in Scripture, and therefore we deny it.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 1. In euery Sacrament there is an externall sensible element, as water in Baptisme, bread and wine in the Lords Supper: but there is none in their penance: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarm.</hi> answereth, that the words of absolution and confession, are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes in penance: it is not necessary it should be a visible signe: it is a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signe being audible, <hi>cap. 11.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. 1. There must be the word beside the element: as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Accedat verbum ad elementum,</hi> Let the word be ioyned to the element: and it maketh a Sacrament: the word it selfe cannot be the element: for the same thing cannot both sanctifie and be sanctified. And if the audible word be the element, by this reason the preaching of the word also shalbe a Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Argu. 2. There was repentance and absolution of sinnes both, in the olde testament: for both <hi>Dauid</hi> confessed and was sory for his sinne, and the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> pronounced forgiuenes from God, <hi>2. Sam. 12.13.</hi> so likewise <hi>Iohn</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched repentance for remission of sinnes, and the people came and confessed their sinnes: heere were all things necessary for true repentance, yet was it no Sacrament all this while, as they themselues confesse, which they holde to be instituted after Christs resurrection, <hi>Trident. concil. sess. 14. cap. 1.</hi> Why then should it be rather a Sacrament now, then before?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Augustine</hi> thus writeth, <hi>Sacramentum ideo dicitur, quia aliud videtur, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud intelligitur:</hi> It is called a Sacrament, because one thing is seene,<note place="margin">Serm. de baptis. ad infantes.</note> another vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode.

                     <p>Ans. FIrst, we say not, that by the bare memory or remembrance of baptisme, sinnes after committed are done away: but that the sacramentall force of Baptisme doth extend it selfe to our whole life, that is, to be a seale vnto vs of remission of all our sinnes in the blood of Cbrist.

Secondly, Confession and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of our sinnes vnto God, and in some cases, where the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not satisfied, to the Minister or some other faithfull man, we do willingly graunt: but that it is necessary to make generall confession of sinnes to the Priest, that place proueth it not: for <hi>Iohn</hi> had had shriuing worke enough for many yeeres, to heare euery mans particular confession: Thirdly, that sitting in sackecloth and ashes, was no satisfaction for sinne, but an outward signe of true sorrow for sinne.</p>

THe argument is not from the cause to the effect, but from the effect to the cause: for Christ doth not reason thus, she loued much, therefore many sinnes are forgiuen her: but contrariwise, Many sinnes are forgiuen her, therefore she loueth much.

And our Sauiour sayth in plaine words in the last verse, That her faith had saued her, whereof her loue was an effect.</p>
                     <p>Argum. That the contrition of the heart is no meanes of our iustification, nor a meriting cause or procuring of remission of sinnes: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6. To him that beleeueth faith is counted for righteousnes: And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> declareth the blessednesse of that man, to whom God imputeth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without workes: It is faith then onely that obtaineth remission of sinnes: and a man is iustified without any respect had to his workes.

                     <p>Argum. 1. This wonderfull power of remitting and retaining of sinnes, which was giuen to the Apostles and their successors, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22. were giuen them in vaine, if no man were bound to seeke for absolution at their hands: which can not be had of them without distinct vtterance to them of our sinnes: for they cannot rule the cases of conscience, vnlesse they haue exact knowledge and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of their sinnes, <hi>Rhemist. ibid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. 1. God hath not made his ministers in Christs stead iudges of cases of conscience, as though there were in them an actual power to remit and absolue sinnes: but their office is onely to declare and set forth vnto all penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the promises of God for remission of sinnes, &amp; the seueritie of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against impenitent persons: which is especially performed in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and applying of the word either publiquely or priuately: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Gospell committed vnto him, The word of reconciliation, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A man therefore may by their ministerie, which are the preachers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, finde remission of sinnes, without a particular declaration thereof: neither is it necessarie for them to haue so exact a knowledge of our sinnes, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are not absolute iudges of the conscience, but the ministers and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of reconciliation, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And Ministers are not to stay while suite is made vnto them for their helpe, but they ought to exhort and desire men to be reconciled to God by their ministerie.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 2. As the Priests in the law had onely authoritie to discerne the lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the people, and therefore Christ sendeth the lepers to the Priest, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.14. so men must reueale the spirituall leprosie of sinne to the Priest, <hi>Rhemist. ibid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. First, the leprosie was not healed by the Priest, but onely declared to be healed: so sinnes are declared to be forgiuen by the Priest, not properly forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Secondly, the Priest receiued not knowledge of all diseases, but of this, that was contagious: therefore it would not followe hereupon, that all sinnes are to be confessed to the Priest: but such as are notorious, where publique confession is by Church discipline inioyned: and such confession we denie not. Thirdly, the argument followeth not from the Priests of the law, to the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: for the Priesthood of the law is translated wholly vnto Christ, who hath all knowledge to discerne, and power to heale our spirituall diseases.</p>

                     <p>COnfession of sinnes, such as the scripture alloweth, we doe acknowledge: as namely these foure kinds: There are priuate confessions, either to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as <hi>Daniel</hi> confesseth, 9.4. or for the easing of our conscience, to man also,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:20636:264"/>
as to him whom we haue offended, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.24. Or to any other faithfull man, the Minister or some other, that we may be holpen and comforted by our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prayers, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16. There are also two kinds of publique confession, either of the whole congregation together, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.3. or of some one or more, that make publique confession of their sinne, for the satisfying of the congregation, whom they haue offended: which belongeth to Ecclesiasticall discipline, 2. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 2.6. But this particular confession of all sinnes, yea of them that are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and to none but the Priest, is an Antichristian yoke and too heauie for Christians to beare.</p>
                     <p>Arg. 1. It is not necessarie to make confession at all vnto men: the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> confessed onely vnto God, Against thee O Lord onely haue I sinned, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.4.
<hi>Augustine</hi> also sayth, <q>
                           <hi>Quid mihi cum hominibus vt audiant confessiones meas, quasi ipsi sanaturi sint languores meos?</hi> What haue men to doe to heare my confessions, as though they were able to heale my sores? <bibl>

                     </p>
                     <p>Argum. 2. If a man otherwise cannot finde ease of conscience, but will open his sinnes to men: it is not alwaies necessarie he should seeke to the Minister, though it be most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if he be a fit man: any other faithful godly man may serue: for so the Apostle biddeth vs, Acknowledge our faults, not to the priest, but one to another, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16.
Whereupon <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth, <q>
                           <hi>Peccata nostra debemus non solùm Deo sed etiam sanctis &amp; Deum timentibus confiteri:</hi> We must confesse our sinnes not onely to God, but to men also that feare God</q>: He sayth not, <hi>Sacerdotibus,</hi> onely to the Priests, <hi>Homil.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 3. Such a particular enumeration of sinnes is not necessarie, neither is it possible: It sufficeth, where our sinnes are kept from our sight, to say with the Prophet, Cleanse me from my secret sinnes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Quot habes in corde compunctiones facinorum, tot habe illic punctiones confessionum:</hi> Looke how many sinnes doe pricke thy conscience, so must thy confession be. It is an vncomfortable doctrine to teach men to labour to remember all their sinnes, and to make a particular catalogue of them: they haue worke enough to be eased of those sinnes that lye heauie on the heart.</p>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:20636:264"/>
which had before time been vsed in that Church: for it was found out, that a certaine woman of the citie, vnder this pretence of confession, had vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full companie with the priest to whom she confessed: whereupon the good man abolished that custome, seeing more harme then good to come by it.<note place="margin">Beza an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith.

                        <q>The priest as a cunning phisition, must first know how to cure his owne sinnes, before he can helpe another, <bibl>

 But such an one cannot be had in euery parish: for many times the parish priest is worse then he that commeth to be confessed: such an one, <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, is not to bee taken, and therefore men should not in that case bind themselues to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish priest.</p>

                        <p>Argum. 3. Our praiers, fastings, almes, and what workes soeuer, are neither meritorious, nor satisfactorie: for when we haue done all, we are but vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruants, and we did no more then was our duetie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10.</p>

                        <p>Ans. WEe acknowledge, that in notorious sinnes, and offensiue to the Church, as this of the young mans was, inward repentance is not sufficient, but that after sharpe discipline, by the outward testification of sorrow, and publike confession, satisfaction must bee made to the Church: but it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not that this course should be taken for all sinnes, which a man repenteth him of. And yet wee graunt that outward signes of our sorrowe are alwaies necessarie in true repentance, not as satisfactorie meanes to redeeme our sins, but onely as infallible tokens and effects of our repentance. As <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Satis durus est, cuius mentis dolorem oculi carnis nequeunt declarare:</hi> Hee is hard harted, the griefe of whose minde, the eyes of his flesh doe not shew forth, <hi>de poenitent. cap.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>Argum. There are but two essentiall partes of repentance, and true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion vnto God: To turne from our sinnes, and leade an holy life. So saith the Lord by the Prophet, If the wicked will returne from his sinnes and keepe all my statutes, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.21. This is all God requireth, without any other penall workes: wherefore ceasing from sinne and amendement of life, which necessarilie include the true sorrow and conuersion of the heart, are sufficient for repentance.</p>

                        <p>Ans. 1. SOme kinde of mulctes Church discipline is not to deale withall: as bodily punishment, and pecuniarie fines, which are to be imposed at the discretion of the magistrate. Secondly, we grant a wholsome vse of the keyes in Church discipline, in punishing and clensing of notorious offenders in the open face of the congregation: but priuately to enioyne men penance for their secret sinnes is an Antichristian yoke.</p>
                        <p>Argum. True repentance is a free worke, not of compulsion, or coaction: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth men to iudge themselues, that they bee not iudged,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:20636:267"/>
1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.31. But now when penance is laid vpon a man, and not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarilie taken of himselfe, hee is iudged rather of another, hee doth not iudge himselfe.
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <q>
                              <hi>Quem poenitet, punit seipsum, prorsus aut punis aut punit Deus, vt ille non puniat, puni tu.</hi> Hee that repenteth, punisheth himselfe: either thou punishest, or God: if thou wilt not haue God to doe it, punish thy selfe.</q>
A man therefore must punish himselfe, he must not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of another in his repentance to Godward: for of outward chastisement to the world, now is not the question.</p>

                        <p>Ans. 1.

But it followeth not, that the Church therefore may dispence with any necessarie part of repentance towards God. Secondly, whereas you say, the Apostle, notwithstanding his rebuke was sufficient, might haue kept the young man still in temporall punishment: it is cleane contrarie to the Apostles owne rule, who perswadeth the Corinthians to forgiue him, least he should bee ouercome of too much heauines, vers. 7. The Apostle therefore would neither forgiue nor release him, before they had forgiuen him, and hee had satisfied the whole Church, verse 10. Neither would hee keepe him longer in punishment, hauing once sorrowed sufficiently, verse 6. The Apostle therefore did neither binde nor release him at his owne pleasure, but as hee sawe repentance to bee wrought in the offender.</p>

                     <p>Argum. What is to be thought of such punishing of the carkasse, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.23. He calleth it voluntarie religion or superstition in not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the bodie: when men doe not vse such outward exercises of fasting and abstinence for the chastisement of the flesh, to subdue it to the spirit, but with an opinion of meriting thereby, preferring them before the faith and conuersion of the heart, as the papists doe.</p>

So then true repentance is especially an inward worke of fayth, rather then an exercise of the body, and it ought alwayes to continue. Wherefore it consisteth not in such laborious workes, which if a man should long endure, he should end his life sooner then repentance.</p>

                     <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.32. This is a great sacrament: Matrimonie is here a signe of an holy thing, representing the coniunction of Christ, and his Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> a sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Answ. 1. The wordes are thus to be read rather, This is a great mystery. Or if we reade sacrament, they haue no great aduantage, seeing they are not ignorant, that the originall word, Mysterie, which they translate sacrament, is attributed to other things then sacraments: as 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.16. Mysterie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse: <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17.5. A mysterie great Babylon. Neither doe they themselues much vrge this argument. 2. The Apostle sayth not, that Matrimonie is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, but I speake of Christ and his Church, <hi>vers.</hi> 32.3. Matrimonie we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to be instituted of God, and to be a signe of a holie thing: yet no sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for so was the Sabboth ordayned of GOD, and signified the rest in Christ, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.8. yet was it no sacrament. Wherfore al significatiue and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call signes are not sacraments.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 2. Matrimonie giueth grace of sanctification to the parties maried. They shalbe saued in bearing of children, if they continue in faith and loue, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.15. These are the graces giuen by matrimonie. <hi>Ergo,</hi> a sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Answ. 1. We denie that any sacraments giue or conferre grace, they are instruments only of grace. 2. We also grant that by matrimonie God giueth to the faithfull this speciall grace to liue in holines &amp; purenes, from the filthy pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the flesh: but the sacraments are seales of spirituall graces, and serue for the increase of fayth: it is not sufficient to bee a meanes of any common gift, but of the spirituall and iustifiyng grace to make a sacrament. 3. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if by fayth and loue here, they vnderstand only the fidelity and duety of wedlocke, they are not those spirituall graces, whereof sacraments are seales: if wee take them for the true faith and loue, which are the common graces of the faythfull, as the very meaning is, they are as well to be had out of wedlock, as in it.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 In euery sacrament there ought to be an external sensible element, as the matter, and a sanctifiyng word, as the forme: But in matrimony there is neither. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is no sacrament.</p>

                     <p>Ans. 1. The sacrament is one thing, and the receiuers another: therefore the maried parties cannot be the sacramental matter, being the receiuers. 2. It is not euery word that sanctifieth, but the word of God, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. but these words, I take thee, are no parte of the word: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they want also the forme of a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3.

                        <p>FIrst, that there is no cause of vtter dissolution of mariage by way of diuorce, but onely adulterie and fornication: it is plaine by our Sauiour Christes wordes, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.9. where neither infidelitie nor any cause beside is excepted, but onely fornication.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sometime was of opinion, that the wife might be dismissed for infidelitie: but he reuoketh and retracteth that opinion, <hi>Lib. retract.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. For elsewhere he flatly concludeth thus: <hi>A viro non fornican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te non licere omnino discedere:</hi> that it is not lawfull for a woman at all to leaue her husband, if he committe not fornication, <hi>De adulter. coniug.</hi> 1.7.</p>
                        <p>And yet further, to make this matter more playne, we acknowledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause of lawful diuorse in mariage but that only, which is prescribed in the Gospell, namely, for adultery or fornication, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.9. There is notwithstanding another cause whereby the mariage knot may bee dissolued,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:20636:271"/>
though not for fornication: as when one of the parties doth wilfullie renounce, leaue and forsake the other vpon no iust cause, but either of lightnes or for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers religion, as when an Infidel forsaketh a Christian, a Papist a Protestant, an heretick a true professor, or vpon any other vnlawfull or vniust cause: for the Apostle sayth playnely, A brother or sister is not in subiection in such things, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.15. that is, is freed from the yoke or bond of mariage.</p>
                        <p>First, it is plaine that the Apostle is so to be vnderstoode in this place: for the word, which he vseth is, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is no longer a seruant, or in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is to be taken in the same sense, as if he should say, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, he or she is no longer bound or tyed: which word the Apostle vseth, <hi>vers.</hi> 39. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the Apostle hath relation here to the fourth verse, where hee sayth the wife, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, hath no power of her own bodie, &amp; the husband likewise: But now, saith he, the infidel partie hauing wilfully separated himself, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the innocent partie is no longer in subiection, that is, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, hath now power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his owne body: and is now become <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, free, exempt from the mariage knot or bond, in which sense the Apostle vseth the word, <hi>verse</hi> 39.</p>
                        <p>Secondly we must know what kinde of desertion it is, that causeth a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mariage, and in what manner. First, it must be <hi>malitiosa desertio,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious departure without any iust cause: But when as the husband is absent by consent about necessary affayres, as the Merchant beyond the seas: or is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in some waightie busines, as in warfare, in ambassage, or such like: or is viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly deteined in prison or captiuity, amongst the Turks or elswhere: In these &amp; the like cases the wife is bound to waite &amp; expect the returne of her husband, vnles she be otherwise aduertised of his death. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t partie must vse all meanes to reconcile, reclaime, and bring home agayne the wilfull and obstinate partie so departing, if it be possible. Thirdly, if he continue in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie, and departe, hauing no purpose to returne, the matter must be brought before the iudge or Magistrate in such cases: who after publike citation of the obstinate partie, and certaine knowledge that he refuseth wilfully to appeare being cited, and is not otherwise letted to come, may with mature deliberation pronounce the innocent partie free and at libertie to marrie, according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, A brother, or sister is not bound in such things.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, neither is Saint <hi>Paul</hi> contrary to our Sauiour Christ, who alloweth no diuorce but onely for fornication: for that is a diuers case from this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> treateth: And there is great difference betweene lawfull diuorse, and vnlawfull and wilfull desertion: for there the innocent partie first clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the priuiledge of separation: here the guiltie partie first separateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: there diuorse is sued, and required: here the innocent partie seeketh no diuorse, but seeketh all meanes of reconciliation: So that properly the setting free the innocent partie in this case, cannot be called a diuorse. Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speaketh of lawfull diuorce, not of euery dissolution of mariage: for then mention should haue beene made in that place of naturall death and departure, which is confessed by all to be a dissolution and breaking off of mariage.</p>

Neither doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> denie, that mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age may be dissolued, while they liue, without breaking of wedlock: but that, although the knot holde during their life, yet by death it is dissolued.

                        <p>Ans. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of other separations, which are caused by dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in mariage, and not of diuorse for adulterie: for he sayth, If she depart: not If she be put away: neither was it so vsual a thing for reconciliation to be sought after solemne diuorse. Againe, he sayth, Let not the woman depart, as being in her choyce, whether she would depart or not: but in the case of fornication, she was to depart, or rather be put away, whether she would or not.</p>

                        <p>Ans. NEither is this rule perfect: for by this reason, he that is indeed a degree further off, shall be in the same degree: for if the vncle and the nephew be remoued but the second degree, and Cosin germanes are but distant in the second degree, as they say, the vncles sonne shall be in the same degree with his cosin, as his father is, which is not to be admitted.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore in collaterals we preferre the Ciuill account of degrees: that is, so many persons, the stocke of the kinred excepted, so many degrees. These then are the rules of marriage.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the right line ascending and descending, all degrees are forbidden.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In collateral consanguinitie the prohibition reacheth to the third degree: as it is not lawfull to marrie the vncle, or the Aunt, who are in the third degree from their nephew.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In collateral affinitie the prohibition is extended to the fourth degree: for affinitie is alwaies a degree beyond that consanguinitie, by the which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in: as it is vnlawfull to marrie the vncles wife, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.14. which is in the fourth degree from her nephew, being one degree beyond her husband, who is the vncle in the third degree. And this is to be obserued, that there is no affinitie in the first or second degree, but the neerest is in the third: as the wiues or hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands father, brother, or daughter, which are all in the third degree: the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is in the first, the wife the second, and they in the third.</p>

                        <p>Ans. 1.

                        <p n="2">2. Although this example of theirs both in marrying many wiues and so neere of kinne, cannot be altogether excused or iustified in them: yet because the law of nature was not yet so cleerely knowne, as afterward by the giuing of the law, which is nothing els but an exposition of the law of nature; the offence was not so great in them, but might better be tolerated: because as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, it was neither <hi>Contra morem illorum temporum, nec contra praeceptum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>WE affirme that it is vtterly vnlawfull for any Christian to marrie within the degrees prohibited: neither can any humane power dispense with such marriages: but the equitie of that lawe being grounded vpon nature, is in force for euer.

                        <p n="1">1. COncerning <hi>Abrahams</hi> marriage what is to be thought, we haue shewed before: but it is a plaine case, that the vncle is no more to marrie his niece, then the nephew his Aunt: and this being by name prohibited, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18, 14.20.2. the other also is necessarily included: for the same rules for degrees of kinred doe proportionably hold both in men and women: wherefore such mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is vnlawfull, neither to be contracted, and if it be, to be dissolued.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Concerning the marriage of brothers and sisters children, there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter question. First, it cannot be proued that <hi>Zelophehads</hi> fiue daughters married their vncles sonnes, that is, their Cosin germanes: for the Hebrewes call the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, sonnes: as <hi>Iethros</hi> daughters are called the daughters of <hi>Raguel</hi> their grandfather, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.17. So it is very like that their husbands were their vncles sonnes sonnes, as in the 12. verse it may be gathered, where the text sayth, They were married into the families of the sonnes of <hi>Manasses:</hi> therfore not into one familie. But as touching the question in hand, the marriage of Cosin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes seemeth also by some analogie to be forbidden by <hi>Moses</hi> law: for if the degrees of affinitie be limited to the fourth degree: as it is not lawfull for a man to marrie his wiues daughters daughter, <hi>Leuiticus</hi> 18.17. why should not the line of consanguinitie hold to the fourth degree likewise? And so neither the sonne to marrie his fathers brothers daughter, or the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sonne: for heere are also foure degrees: the sonne, one: the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:20636:275"/>
father two, the fathers brother three, the brothers sonne foure. Yet this we grant, that this analogie or proportion is not so strong, nor doth conclude so necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the other. Wherefore we thus determine of this matter, that it is well that the marriages of Cosin germanes are restrained by humane lawe, and so they ought to be: which kind of marriages may lawfully be hindered, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract loosed: but the marriage being consummate and finished, it is not for this cause to be dissolued.</p>

                           <hi>Augustine</hi> also writeth very well of this matter, <hi>Quis dubitet, honestiùs hoc tempore consobrinarum prohibita esse coniugia, etiamsi id diuina lex non prohibeat: cuius enim debet causa propinquitatis verecundum honorem, ab ea contineat quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis generatricem libidinem?</hi> Who doubteth, but that the marriage of Cosin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes is honestly forbidden, though the diuine lawe doe not prohibite it? for to whom a man oweth a shamefast reuerence for kinred sake, he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine his lust.</p>

                     <p>FIrst we graunt, according to the Apostles saying in this place, that virginitie is also a fitter state of life for the seruice of God, yet not simplie, but for those onely that haue the gift of continencie: for they which cannot abstaine, may and doe serue God with a more quiet mind being married, then many popish virgines which burne in the lust of concupiscence. Secondly, yet it followeth not, that virginitie is a more holy and cleane thing in it selfe, and more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious before God, then marriage is: for this were to make marriage vnholy &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane: whereas it is not the act of marriage, but the abusing thereof, that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vncleannes with it: before God in themselues, neither is more holy then other.</p>

                        <pb n="538" facs="tcp:20636:277"/>Argum. God commanded the people to abstaine from their wiues, when he was to appeare vnto them in Mount Sinai, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.15. And <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high priest would deliuer the shewbread to <hi>Dauid</hi> and his companie, he asked if the young men had kept themselues from women: <hi>Ergo,</hi> marriage is not lawfull at all times, <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ans. First, these places alleadged doe rather proue, that men in those interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted times ought not at all to come at their wiues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the solemnization of marriage should be restrained: but I thinke they would be ashamed to forbid men their wiues companie so long together, as fiue or sixe weekes at the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, and eight or nine weekes at Easter: why then should not the one bee as lawfull as the other? Secondly, the abstinence from their wiues was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then, as a legall and ceremonial kind of sanctification, as was also the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their clothes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.10. And the companie of women was at some times counted as a legall pollution, not as a sinfull or vncleane act of it selfe: as the women after childbirth were commanded to purifie themselues, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 12. from a legall pollution onely, not from any sinfull or vncleane act: for then it had been a manifest iniurie to that holy birth, that <hi>Mary</hi> purified her selfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.22. Wherefore seeing it was a legall kind of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it is not to be intruded &amp; imposed vpon Christians now. Thirdly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they proue that this kind of abstinence is necessarie alwaies before the receiuing of the Sacrament, though sometimes we denie not but it is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: for it was not alwaies required, no not of the priests in the lawe, when they were to offer incense or sacrifice. For whereas the high priest, which was alwaies but one, was bound morning and euening to offer incense vnto the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.8. He could not obserue this rule, vnlesse he had been inioyned perpetuall abstinence, which we see by the law was not imposed vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This doubt somewhat troubled <hi>Augustine:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Quaest. sup. Leuitic. 15.</note> for first he sayth, That it must needes followe, seeing the high priest was married, and did sometime goe in vnto his wife, that the offering of incense should some dayes be intermitted: but in his retractations he misliketh his former solution, and thus determineth, That the high priest first offered the morning incense, and afterward went in to his wife, and so was vncleane,<note place="margin">Retract. lib. 2. cap. 85.</note> 
                        <hi>vsque ad vesperam,</hi> but vntill the euening, not after the euentide, and then he offered the euening incense. To take this answer for this time, though it be insufficient: for the Hebrew word, which is translated the euen, or euentide <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, signifieth the twilight, when the Sunne is set, when light and darknes are mixed together: but the incense was renewed before the Sunne set: yet I say, admitting <hi>Augustines</hi> solution, the high priest did not abstaine one whole day before he offered: much lesse many dayes, much lesse many weekes, much lesse some moneths: as the popish Church prescribeth by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting so many daies.</p>

                     <p>THat not onely the publique solemnitie of marriage at some times may haue intermission, but all matrimoniall actes ought to cease, as when men either priuately doe giue themselues to fasting and praier, <hi>1.

                     <p>Argum. 1. It disgraceth the holy institution of marriage, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calleth honourable, <hi>Heb. 13.4.</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> counteth the fruits of marriage, which are the children of the faithfull, holy, <hi>1.

                     </p>
                     <p>Argu. 2. The <hi>Tridentine</hi> Chapter maketh but two holy times in the yeere, the Natiuitie and Ester: during which times, they would not haue matrimonie solemnized: and I pray you, why is Pentecost left out, is it not as festiual a time as the other?</p>
                     <p>Could there be a more holy place, then Paradise? or a more holy time, then while man was in his innocency? yet euen then and there Matrimonie was instituted.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Is not the Sabboth or Lords day an holy festiuall time? and as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any is? what if I said more holie, for this onely immediately was instituted of God: but marriage may notwithstanding be fitly solemnized vpon that day, the abuses and disorders, which commonly fall out in such assemblies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off: for <hi>Augustine</hi> is of opinion, that the marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile,</hi> was <hi>die Dominico,</hi> vpon the Lords day:<note place="margin">Serm. de temp. 159.</note> And it is most fit that matrimony should be solemnized in the face of the congregation, which is vsually assembled vpon that day: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it may as fitly and conueniently at any time be kept and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, excepting the respects aforesaid.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Argum. <hi>1. Timoth. 4.14.</hi> Despise not that gift which was giuen thee through prophesie, with the laying on of hands. Holy orders giue grace by an externall ceremonie and worke: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a Sacrament, <hi>Rhemist. in hunc locum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. It cannot be proued out of this place, that imposition of hands giueth grace: for this was an extraordinary gift which <hi>S. Paul</hi> speaketh of, and doth not alwaies follow imposition of hands. Secondly, this gift was not giuen by the very ceremony of imposition of hands, but through prophesie and reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghost: for it was reuealed vnto the Church by the spirite of prophecie, that <hi>Timothie</hi> was a chosen vessell of God: therefore <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, That worthie thing which is committed vnto thee, keepe through the holy Ghost, 2. <hi>Tim. 1.14.</hi> The holy ghost was both the conferrer of that grace, and the preseruer of it. Imposition the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hands was but an outward signe of the presence of Gods spirit vpon those that were lawfully ordeined: for al vpon whom hands were laid, receiued not the holy ghost, but such only as were appointed of God:
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:20636:281"/>
And therefore the Apostle chargeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to lay hands sodenly on no man, <hi>1. Timoth.</hi> 5.22. which caueat was not needfull, if vpon whomsoeuer he had laid his hands, they should immediately receiue the holy Ghost.</p>

                        <p>YOur seuen popish orders we do not at all receiue into the church, much lesse can we abide, that they should be sacraments: The lawfull ordeining of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, teachers, and Deacons, we doe acknowledge, but no sacrificing Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, nor no ministring Deaconship at the Altar: such orders as we haue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we doe not take to be Sacraments, much lesse yours, that are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to be abolished.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. Sacraments must haue their institution from Christ: so haue not your orders: for Christ instituted onely Apostles and Disciples: Presbyters, and Deacons were founded by the Apostles: who notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding had no commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to constitute new Sacraments.

                        <p>Secondly, your Sacrament hath neither outward element, nor word of insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: if you say, laying on of hands is the externall signe: we answere, that the visible signe in a Sacrament must not onely be an externall action, but a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall element, as water in Baptisme, and bread and wine in the Lords Supper.

                        <p>Argum. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.14. The sacrament of extreme Vnction in this place is playnely promulgated by the Apostle, being instituted before by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. For here is remission of sinnes promised to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward element, that is, the anoynting of the sicke with oyle: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a sacrament, <hi>Rhemist.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. This anoynting of oyle, was a signe onely of the miraculous gift of healing, that was then in the Church, and therefore was no longer to continue, then the gift it self. But it is not like, will they say, that euery one of the Elders had this miraculous gift of healing. Answer: Though euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Elder perhaps had it not, yet the whole company of the Eldership might haue it, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the gift of prophesie giuen to the Eldership, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.14. And it is not like that the Apostle would haue promised health by calling for the Elders, if the gift had not beene generall in euery congregation.</p>
                        <p>Ans. 2. Neither is remission of sinnes annexed to the element, but to the generall doctrine of prayer made in fayth. The prayer of fayth, saith the Apostle, shall heale the sicke.</p>

                        <p>EXtreme Vnction is no conuenient ceremonie at all to be vsed in the Church, as tending to superstition, and breeding a vayne confidence in terrene ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: much lesse is it to be holden for a sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. It hath no institution from Christ: For they themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. there is but a preparatiue to the sacrament of extreme Vnction, <hi>Rhemist.</hi> the promulgation and publishing thereof is set forth by the Apostle, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. But this is not to be admitted, that Christ was a preparer of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments onely, and that they were perfited and finished by his Apostles: Nay, they were not to adde any thing to the institution of sacraments, but to take them as Christ deliuered them, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.</p>
                        <p>Agayne, the place in <hi>Iames</hi> maketh nothing for their popish aneeling: for the Apostle would haue al the Elders called: but one priest is sufficient to bring your oyntment box. Secondly, if any man be sick, sayth Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> though it be not deadly or mortall sicknes, but whensoeuer he is sicke: But your Vnction is neuer ministred before the poynt of death. Thirdly, here health is certainely promised: But not one amongst tenne recouereth after your popish aneeling.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. Christ vsed sometime clay, and spittle, sometime other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in healing the diseased, as the Apostles vsed oyle: why, I pray you then, may not they be sacraments as well as this? For they were signes of healing but for a time: no more was the anoynting with oyle.</p>

                  <head>THE CONCLVSION OF THIS treatise concerning the sacrament.</head>
                  <p>THus, I trust, we haue made it pliane by scripture, and euidence of argument, that there are but two sacraments onely, Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord, left and enioyned to the people of God by our Sauiour Christ: for foure things are required to make a sacrament: First, the authority of Christ in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it. Secondly, the element or external signe, as the matter. Thirdly, the word of institution, as the forme. Fourthly, the end and vse, to be a seale of our fayth for remission of sinnes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Concerning the efficient cause, we finde that two sacraments onely in the new testament, are commanded by Christ to be vsed for euer in the Church, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper: which both by his owne example and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as also his precept and commandement were established.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There must be an outward visible elementall signe, as is water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, bread and wine in the Lords Supper. But so is there not in the fiue popish sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: For in some there is no signe at all, as in Matrimonie, where they are driuen to say, that the parties that are maried are the signes: In some there is a signe, but not visible, as in absolution, the audible voyce of the priest ponoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the words of absolution is, they say, the outward signe: But in all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Christs institution, we finde a visible signe. In some there is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signe, but it is an action or gesture only, no material element, which is not sufficient, so is the imposition of hands in giuing of Orders. In some there is a materiall signe, as Chrisme in Confirmation, oyle in extreme Vnction, but they are not of Christs institution.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They also want a word of institution: In Penance the priest sayth, I doe absolue thee, after particular confession made of his sinnes. In Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words are, I signe thee with the signe of the Crosse, and confirme thee with the Chrisme of saluation, in the name of the Father, Son, &amp;c. In Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I take thee to my wife. In giuing of Orders, Receiue thou power to offer vp the body of Christ. In extreme Vnction, God by the vertue of this oyle forgiue thee thy sinne. These, they say, are the wordes of the institution: But they can shew no word of God for them: for it is not euery word that sanctifieth, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the word of God, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Wherefore, seeing they haue no word of institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are no sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they want the true vse and end of a sacrament, which is, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our fayth for the remission of sinnes: for in some of these there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at all had to the forgiuenes of sinnes: As Matrimonie doth but performe, say they, the graces of mariage, as fidelitie, mutuall loue, and such like. Orders doe conferre the power of priesthood. Here is no signe or assurance of the grace of iustification. In the rest, remission of sinnes is ascribed to other instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall meanes, then to fayth onely, as to satisfactorie workes in Absolution,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:20636:284"/>
to Chrisme in Confirmation, to oyle in extreme Vnction. Wherefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, because they are no seales of the righteousnes of fayth, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth a sacrament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. that they are no sacraments of Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but superstitious ceremonies deuised by men.</p>

And that the counsell of God is most iust herein: for as the Potter may dispose of the clay, as it seemeth best to himselfe, to make of it a vessell of honor or of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at his pleasure: so the Lord hath as great right to deale with his creature. And seeing all things ought to be subdued to the glory of God, which is set foorth in the destruction of the rebellious, as in the election of the faythfull: it was necessary and requisite, that the Lord should get vnto himselfe both wayes a glorious name: therefore he saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17.

                        <p>Ans. 1. GOd indeede electeth all that shall be saued, not with any condition on their behalfe, but on his owne behalfe: for vnto them, whome hee chooseth, he will giue grace to obey, will to beleeue in him, and to doe that hee appointeth. Secondly, this place is expounded by that other of Saint <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 1.4. God hath chosen vs in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy: vpon the which words <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Elegit nos, vt essemus sancti, non quia futuri eramus, sed vt essemus, &amp; secundum bonam volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem suam, non nostram, quae bona esse non posset, nisi ipse secundum bonam volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem suam, vt bona fieret, subueniret:</hi> He hath chosen vs, that we should be holy, not because he saw we should be holy, but to the end we might be holy: and according to his good pleasure, not after our owne will, which could not bee good, vnlesse he according to his good will should assist vs to make it good. See then, our holines and obedience is a fruite and effect of our election, no cause thereof: neither is there any free will or good disposition in man, till God make it free and good.</p>
                        <p>Argum. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. Our election is not of the willer, nor of the runner, but of God, that sheweth mercie. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the mercie of God is the onely ground of our election: for if our faith or workes should be foreseene, then it were of the willer and of the runner, which the Apostle here denieth. And to this purpose the Apostle bringeth in the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> ouer whome the Lorde had cast his lots: <hi>Iacob</hi> haue I loued, <hi>Esau</hi> haue I hated, before they were yet borne, or had done either good or euill: as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,<note place="margin">In epistol. ad Rom. 9.</note>

                           <p>Ans. OVt of this place it is gathered, that there are degrees of sinne, and that the more heynous sinne is worthie of more grieuous death and condemnation: but that concupiscence, or other lesse sinnes deserue not death, it is not hence proued: seeing the Scripture saith, That the wages of all sinne is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</p>
                           <p>Argum. That no sinne is veniall or pardonable of it owne nature, but that the least deserueth death, if God should deale with vs, according to the exact rule of his iustice, it thus appeareth. First, if all sinnes are not mortall, Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for all sinnes: for he by his death did satisfie onely for sinnes, that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued death: but Christ died for all sinnes, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.19. Secondly, all transgression of Gods lawe is sinne, and deserueth the curse of God, <hi>Galath.</hi> 3.10. But all sinne is the transgression of the lawe, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.4.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Augustine</hi> and other of the fathers doe vse this terme of veniall sinnes, but not in their sense, as though any sinne in it owne nature deserued pardon: but
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:20636:288"/>
by veniall sinnes, they vnderstand the lesser and smaller faultes, which are more easilie forgiuen at Gods hand, then the greater. <q>
                                 <hi>Sunt venialiae peccata,</hi> there are certaine veniall sinnes, without the which a man cannot liue, saith <hi>Augustine: Propter omnia peccata baptismus inuentus est, propter leuia oratio dominica:</hi> For all sinnes Baptisme is a remedy, and the Lords praier for the lesse: <bibl>
                                    <hi>De sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo lib.</hi> 1.6.</bibl>
                              </q>
 By veniall sinnes he vnderstandeth the smaller sinnes, which are not pardonable in their owne nature, for then it were not necessarie to aske forgiuenes for them in the Lords praier: they would vanish away of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Wherefore wee cannot receiue this popish distinction of veniall and mortall sinnes, as they vnderstand it: as the Scripture vseth to speake, wee doe not greatly mislike them; that is, by grace and mercie in Christ, all sinnes euen the greatest, are not onely pardonable, but pardoned vnto vs, <hi>Isay</hi> 1.18.

But most perfitly is this sinne described, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. where there are set downe three circumstances that make this sin: first, the person; he must be such an one as hath been lightened with grace, and been in outward appearance sanctified: therefore Iewes, Turkes, or Infidels, cannot commit this sinne; because their mindes were neuer illuminate by the truth. Secondly, his affection must bee considered, which is most deadly and hatefull in the highest degree: blaspheming the spirite, and despiting the same, crucifying and persecuting Christ againe as it were, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. Wherefore they which offend of ignorance, or infirmitie and weakenes, or which fall not into horrible blasphemies, are not guiltie of this sinne. Thirdly, it is the trueth which they hate and detest, which sometime they loued, and were thereby sanctified: They count the blood of the testament as an vnholy thing. Blasphemie then against the holy Ghost, is an horrible hatred and detestation of the trueth, and grace of Gods spirite, whereby hee that now blasphemeth, was before illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, this sinne not onely easily shall not be forgiuen, but not at all, as our Sauiour saith, Neither in this worlde, nor the world to come, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.32.

Here also mention is made of mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, for one to supply anothers want: but he that doth supererogate to another of the abundance of his good workes, hath no need to haue his wants supplied by another mans deseruings: therefore there is no mutuall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating betwene them, which is the thing whereof the Apostle speaketh in this place.</p>
                           <p>Argum. That no man is holpen by another mans deseruings, but all that a man can doe, is little enough and not sufficient for him selfe; it is plaine in the Gospell: where our Sauiour saith, That when we haue done all that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we are vnprofitable seruants, and did no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was our dutie, <hi>Luke 17.10.

                           <p>We may also remember the parable of the Virgins, <hi>Math. 25.</hi> where the fiue wise refuse to giue of their oyle to the fiue foolish: least (say they) there will not be enough for vs and you.

WE acknowledge a dutifull reuerence &amp; feare of God alwaies remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the godly: but it is farre from that seruile and slauish feare, which is caused onely by the remembrance of hell fire and eternall iudgement: <hi>Augustine</hi> doth thus resemble the matter: The chaste wife (saith he) and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous doe both feare their husbands, <hi>sed casta timet ne discedat vir, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera, ne veniat</hi>: But the chaste wife is afraid least her husband should depart,<note place="margin">In Psal. 127</note> the adulterous is afraid least he should come.

by the grace of God, he is able to doe it. The first stirring then and motion of the heart, they say, is of God.

                              <hi>Eckius</hi> setteth downe foure steps or degrees to iustification. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our calling is onely of God, by inspiring of grace into vs: this is the first degree. The second is in our owne power, to giue assent vnto grace once inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Thirdly, to obtaine that, which by so assenting we doe desire, is onely of Gods gift, and this is the third degree, <hi>gratiae gratum facientis,</hi> of grace which maketh vs gracious, or acceptable. The fourth degree of perseuerance in the grace of saluation receiued, is partly in our power and free will, partly of the grace of God.</p>
                           <p>Our <hi>Rhemists</hi> thus define the matter: Man, they say, was neuer without free will: but hauing the grace of Christ he is truely made free, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, though our election, calling, or first comming to God, lye not wholly or principally vpon our owne will or workes: yet our willing or working of any good to our saluation, is the secondary cause; Gods speciall motion, grace and assistance is the principall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>So then this is their sentence, that neither our free will is so corrupt, that it had neede wholly to be assisted by the grace of God, but that it worketh some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of it selfe: nor yet so perfect, that it is able of it owne strength to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine saluation: But their plaine meaning is this, that Gods grace and mans free will do worke actiuely together, as the <hi>Rhemists</hi> note. The Gentiles, though they beleeued specially by Gods grace and preordination, yet they beleeue also by their owne free will, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>sect.</hi> 2.</p>

Euery man that hath this hope, sanctifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> man hath free will to make himselfe a vessell of saluation, or damnation. And this teacheth vs, that man may sanctifie himselfe by his free will, working together with the grace of GOD, <hi>Rhemist. in vtrumque locum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. First, these places of scripture doe not proue, that there is any freedome or libertie in mans will to doe good by nature: but that our will being enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Gods spirit, consenteth vnto grace, not of it selfe, or by it owne power. This then is the difference betweene vs: We hold that our free will is wholly corrupt by nature, and can doe nothing, vnlesse it be holpen by grace: They say, that there is some strength left by nature in free will, and it worketh together with the grace of God.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. If there be no free will vnto good, what need exhortations, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, precepts, lawes, reward, punishment, seeing nothing is left in a mans owne power? <hi>Eckius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. Though all good things doe come of God, and we haue no power in our selues to doe that which good is, yet this hindereth not exhortations,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:20636:294"/>
teaching, industrie and labour, no more then the doctrine of predestination doth: For as God giueth all grace, so he bestoweth them by meanes: faith is the gift of God, yet it commeth by hearing. The staffe of bread is the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, yet for all that the husbandman must not leaue tilling of his ground. So our will is directed by the grace of God vnto goodnes: but wee must vse the meanes notwithstanding, whereby the grace of God worketh in vs.</p>

                           <p>THat it may fullie appeare wherein the chiefe poynt of this controuersie lyeth, we will first shewe what manner of free will we denye not to be in man.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. We confesse that our first parents had free will before their fall, both to choose the good, and refuse the euill: as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Magnas liberi arbitrij vires homo cum conderetur, accepit, sed eas peccando amisit:</hi> Man by creation had great strength in his free will: but hee vtterly lost it by his sinne.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We acknowledge a free will in man, that is, a gouernment of reason, <hi>Non per quod sit idoneum, quae ad Deum pertinent, sine Deo, inchoare &amp; perficere, sed tantùm in operibus vitae praesentis,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth: Not a free will, whereby men are able to begin or finish any worke to Godward, without his grace: but onely in the affayres of this life: as to labour, to eate, to drinke, to build, to plant, and to doe other affayres of this life. These things hath God left vnto mans discretion, whom he hath endued with a reasonable soule: yet so, that al these things are gouerned and directed by the generall prouidence of God. And therefore in all these actions, we must say as the Apostle teacheth vs,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.15.</note> If the Lord will, I will doe this or that.</p>
                           <p>But in the preparing of our will vnto good, the generall prouidence of GOD is not sufficient, but there must be also a speciall influence of his grace.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. A free will to doe euill also we graunt, free from compulsion or coaction, of it selfe inclined to euill without any enforcing: as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Liberum hominis arbitrium ad malum sufficit, ad bonum parum est,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">De corrept. &amp; grat. c. 11</note> 
                              <hi>nisi adiuuetur ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotente bono:</hi> The free will of man sufficeth vnto euill, but it is of small force vnto goodnes, vnles it be holpen by the almightie Good.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Neither doe we so denye free will in good things, as though men were violently forced, and compelled against their will to the kingdome of GOD, as the Papists doe charge vs, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. But God so chaungeth our willes, that of vnwilling hee maketh vs willing: as <hi>Augustine, Ex nolentibus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes facit:</hi> and giueth vs grace most gladlie to embrace Christ: as our Sauiour sayth, If the Sonne make you free, then are you free indeede.
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:20636:295"/>

Wherefore two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in our will and thoughts, the naturall power of willing and thinking, and the goodnes and holines of our thoughts: the first is in vs, and is properly ours by the gift of God: but the other commeth onely of God by his grace. The will, the vnderstanding, the thoughts are ours, but the goodnes is meerely and entirely wrought by the spirit of God: So that in respect of the goodnes inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into our mindes, our willes are altogether passiue; in respect of the generall power and naturall motion of willing, thinking, and vnderstanding, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so actiue.</p>
                           <p>The seuerall poynts then, wherein we and our aduersaries dissent about free will, are these.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. They say, that man was neuer without free will, but it is made more free by grace, <hi>Rhemist. Iohn.</hi> 8. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. that is, our free will is not altogether corrupt, but there remaineth some freedome therein, euen before grace.</p>
                           <p>Ans. Cleane contrarie to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who denieth that in his flesh dwelleth any good thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. but sayth, he by nature was wholly sold vnto sinne, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. How then can there remaine any goodnes in our will without grace? <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> consenteth, <hi>Laborant homines inuenire in voluntate, quid boni sit nostrum, quod non sit ex Deo, quod quomodo inueniri possit ignoro:</hi> Men doe labour to finde some goodnes in the will, that is of our selues, and not of God: but I am altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant how any such thing should be found.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The beginning of our calling, and the first motions and stirrings of the heart are of grace, but to consent is wholly in our power: so belike God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the good worke and we continue it. This is right the old Pelagian heresie:
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:20636:295"/>
                              <hi>Gratiam Dei non ad singulos actus dari:</hi> That the grace of God need not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at euery assay: but it is enough if God giue a hint, and shewe vs the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and we will performe the rest. This heresie is confuted by <hi>Augustine, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol.</hi> 106. And in another place, <hi>Nos eam gratiam volumus,</hi> saith he, <hi>qua non solum reuelatur sapientia, sed amatur, non suadetur bonum, sed persuadetur:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">De grat. Christ. 1.10</note> We vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that grace, by the which wisedome is not only reuealed, but loued, we are not moued and stirred only to good things, but throughly perswaded. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not God that beginneth the good worke in vs onely, but also continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and finisheth it: for all things are by Iesus Christ, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.7. no good thing in vs but by him.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. They also renew another heresie of the Pelagians, who taught: That, what men are commanded to doe by free will, <hi>facilius impleri per gratiam,</hi> is but more easily performed by grace. What els doe the <hi>Rhemists</hi> say,<note place="margin">Haeres. 83.

So grace helpeth them only more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, fully, or easely to beleeue. Whereupon it followeth, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue without grace, though not so especially.</p>
                           <p>Now then, we are to proue against our aduersaries, that our free will hath no power at all of it selfe to will or doe that which is good, no further then it is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not onely in part assisted, but wholly directed by the spirit of God.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2.13. God worketh in vs both the will and the deede: yea and the thought to, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. He sayth not, God and we worke, but he himselfe worketh: he is all in all.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.44. No man commeth to me, vnlesse my father draw him. But he is not drawne that giueth assent of his owne accord: for so they say, that God first toucheth the heart with his spirit, and then it is in the power of man to giue consent. But the scripture speaketh otherwise: how that God draweth vs, he draweth our will, and maketh vs to giue assent vnto his grace. He it is that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the stonie heart, and giueth an heart of flesh, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he prepareth and addresseth the will wholly. For like as a stone hath no fleshy nature in it, no more hath the naturall will of men any goodnesse dwelling therein.</p>

                           <p>Ans. WE must consider of what kinde of faith Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh: not of a liuely or iustifying faith, but of a dead faith, which in deede is no faith, neither can possiblie receiue any life or quickening, to bee made a true and right faith. The words then are thus to be read, and distinguished: So faith without works is dead: that is, this kinde of faith, which neither wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, nor euer shall: Not thus, Faith is dead without workes: as though a true faith were quickened by works. But euen as the bodie is dead, hauing neither soule, nor the operations thereof, life, motion, sense: so this vaine speculatiue kinde of faith is dead, both wanting the spirite and soule, that is, hauing not one sparke of true faith, neither the operations and fruites thereof, which a liuely faith sheweth by loue, as the soule worketh life and motion in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: for a liuely faith can neuer bee without workes: And a dead faith will neuer haue workes, but remaineth dead for euer.</p>
                           <p>Wee must not therefore thinke, that it is one and the same faith, which sometime is dead without workes, and againe is made aliue and quickened, when workes come: But wee must vnderstand two kindes of faith: one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together voide of good workes, which is onely a faith in name, and a verie dead faith. Another is a liuelie faith, alwaies working: and this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer become a dead faith, so neither can the other bee euer made a liuelie faith.</p>
                           <p>Argum. That charitie is not the forme or any cause of faith, but the effect rather and fruite thereof, we doe learne out of the word of God: Christ saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18. Hee that beleeueth, shall not bee condemned, but is alreadie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from death to life, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.24. Faith then is able to saue vs, and alone iustifieth vs before God without loue (which alwaies foloweth a true faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is not ioyned, or made a partner with it in the matter of iustification) But faith could doe nothing without the forme thereof: <hi>Ergo,</hi> charitie is not the forme of faith. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also faith: Faith which worketh by loue, <hi>Galath.</hi> 5.6. The being and substance of faith is one thing, the working another: Loue onely concurreth with faith in the working, it is no part of the essence or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith.</p>

We neede not, saith the Apostle, to ascend to heauen, or descend into the deepe, to bring Christ from thence: it is the word of faith, which wee preach.

                              <p>Ans.

                              <p>Answ.

The reward is of mercie, not of desert; of grace, not of merite: for life eternall is the meere gift of God through Iesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. But the wages of sinne is death. Where the Apostle doth set a manifest difference betweene the reward of the righteous, and the iust recompence of the wicked: for life eternall is the free and gracious gift of God, not deserued: but eternall damnation is the due debt of sinne. Wherefore the Papists doe bid open battell to the Apostle, in saying, that the one is as due by debt as the other.</p>
                              <p>Argum. 2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, 2. <hi>Timoth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                              <p>Answ. God rendreth heauen as a iust Iudge, not to the merite and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of our workes, but to the merite and worthines of Christ, and as due to vs by his promise made to vs in Christ. The reward therefore of heauen is of the mercie of God, who hath freely promised it vs in Christ: It is of his iustice, in that he is faythfull and iust in keeping of his promise made to vs. So that it is a debt, not in respect of any desert in vs, but in regard of his owne promise. As <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth:

                           <p>FIrst, it is a great blasphemie, to say, that Christs passions in themselues deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not that glory, which he hath purchased for vs: neither that there was any comparison betweene them: for then, how could he haue fully satisfied the wrath of God? Christ hath payed the ransome for our sinnes: Wee are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his precious blood, as of a lambe vnspotted, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. His blood was the price of our redemption: therefore, of it selfe meritorious: It was not in respect of Christ, of grace; but of merite in him: Vnto vs his redemption is of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24.

                           <p>Secondly; it is another great blasphemy to match and compare in the way and maner of meriting, Christs workes and ours together.

                                 <hi>Non sine aliqua fide donabat, &amp; orabat:</hi>

How shall they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeued? Seeing then <hi>Cornelius</hi> had fayth, his iustification also was begun: for so soone as fayth commeth, it iustifieth.

                           <p>Argum. Before fayth come, there can be no workes of preparation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God: because Without fayth it is impossible to please God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6.</p>

Of the second Saint <hi>Iames</hi> intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: A man is iustified by workes, and not of fayth onely, 2.24. <hi>Rhemist.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. This your deuice of first and second iustification, is but a new deuice, not yet 60. yeare olde: your second iustification is nothing els, but the effect &amp; fruits of iustification before God, and a declaration, that wee are iust before men. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> do speake of one and the same iustification by faith: But they take the word diuersly, for Saint <hi>Iames</hi> by iustifiyng meaneth nothing els, but a testifiyng or declaration of our iustification before men: And in this sense is the word taken, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.19. Wisdome is iustified of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that is, declared to be iust.</p>

                           <p>FIrst, iustification and sanctification are two diuers things: We are iustified by fayth onely by the imputation of the righteousnes of Christ, <hi>Roman.</hi> 4.7. We are sanctified, when by fayth working by loue we walke in newnes of life. These two are perpetually distinguished in the scriptures, I meane iustification, and sanctification, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.11. and <hi>Galath.</hi> 5.25. If wee liue in the spirite, let vs walke in the spirite. Our iustification is the liuing in the spirit, our sanctification the walking in the spirite.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, our workes can be no cause of the increase of our iustification, and the grace of God in vs: But both our iustification and sanctification are the free gifts of God: For what hast thou, that thou hast not receiued? 1. <hi>Corint.</hi> 4.7.

                                 <hi>Gratia iam non erit gratia, quia secundum merita datur, nam merces fidei auctae erit merces coeptae:</hi> Thus grace shalbe no grace: for it is giuen according to merite: for the increase of fayth or iustice, is made the hyre or wages of fayth, that is begun.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the scripture speaketh but of one iustification, which glorification followeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Whom he iustified, them also hee glorified: vnles you will haue another iustification to come after our glorificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Likewise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.

                           <p>Ans. 1.

                           <p>WE acknowledge an inherent iustice in all faithful men &amp; beleeuers: but it is imperfect, not able to iustifie them before God: it is no other then san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which is a fruit of iustification.

                           <p>Answ. 1. We are sayd to be saued by hope, not because wee are thereby iustified, but because by hope we do expect and waite for our saluation, which is not yet accomplished: as it followeth, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. If wee hope for that wee see not, then doe we with patience abide for it.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. <hi>Galath.</hi> 5.6. Fayth, that worketh by charitie. Fayth then hath her whole actiuitie and operation toward saluation of charitie: It doth not therefore iustifie vs alone, but fayth and charitie together, of the which chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the more principall, <hi>Rhemist. ibid.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Answ. We graunt, that it is a working fayth that doth iustifie, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle here sayth: but not as it worketh, but as it apprehendeth and beleeueth. Charitie is a principall effect of fayth, and followeth it: how then can fayth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue actiuitie from charitie? the effect doth not giue life to the cause.
You know <hi>Augustine</hi> often sayth, <q>
                                 <hi>Opera non praecedunt iustificandum, sed sequuntur iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum:</hi> Workes goe not before vnto iustification, but followe in him that is already iustified.</q>
But if charitie should beget fayth, then workes proceeding of charitie, should goe before fayth by the which wee are iustified. The Apostle sayth, Without fayth it is impossible to please God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither doth charitie please God without fayth: Fayth giueth actiuitie to charitie; how then can it receiue that which it giueth?</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.24. We see how that of deedes a man is iustified, and not of fayth onely: <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are not iustified by fayth onely, <hi>Rhemist.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Answ. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is not contrary to his fellow Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who concludeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. that We are iustified by fayth without workes: that is as much to say, as by fayth onely. And he excludeth not onely workes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of the law: but euen workes of grace, which God hath ordayned, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi> 2.10. Therefore S. <hi>Iames,</hi> in saying we are not iustified by faith onely, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that iustification, whereby we are made iust before God: for then he should impugne Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> principles. But by iustifiyng, or being iustified, he vnderstandeth nothing els but to be declared iust, as well before men as in the
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:20636:305"/>
sight of God: which declaration is testified and shewed forth by our workes proceeding of faith. Thus the word iustified is taken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. That thou maist be iustified in thy words: that is, knowne or declared to be iust. <hi>Augustine</hi> also sayth, <hi>Iustificabuntur, id est, iusti habebuntur:</hi> They shall be iustified, that is,<note place="margin">De spiritu &amp; lite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>WE are not enemies to good workes (as our aduersaries falsely charge vs:) nay we preach good workes, we exhort to good workes, we establish good workes, teaching the right vse of them out of the word of God: which is not to concurre, or be ioyned with faith in our iustification, but to follow neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily and issue out of faith, as liuely testimonies thereof, to the glorie of God, the example of others, and our comfort: but faith it is onely, which, as a liuely instrument ordained of God, doth assure vs of our iustification by grace in Christ.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. Saluation is ascribed onely to beleefe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. But it is the propertie of faith onely to beleeue, not of hope or charitie: the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of hope is by patience to abide, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. The operations also of loue are set forth, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. Where amongst other, Loue is sayd to beleeue all things: that is, mutuall loue amongst men is not mistrustfull, but taketh all things in good part: but to beleeue the things of God, it is the propertie onely of faith: as <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon those words of the Apostle, How shall they call vpon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on whom they haue not beleeued? <hi>In his duobus tria illa intuere: fides credit, spes &amp; charitas orant:</hi> In these two behold those three: faith beleeueth,<note place="margin">Enchirid. cap. 7.</note> hope and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie pray. Faith therefore onely beleeueth, and so consequently onely iustifieth, <hi>Enchirid. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. Our iustification and saluation is of the meere grace and mercie of God, not at al of any merite or desert in vs: <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are iustified only through faith: for it is of grace that we are saued through faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.8. That all is to bee ascribed onely to the mercie and grace of God, the Apostle euery where sheweth: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.12. It is not in him that willeth or runneth, but in God that sheweth mercie. We are iustified freely by grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. What hast thou that thou hast not receiued? <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Intelligenda est gratia Dei per Iesum Christum dominum nostrum, qua sola liberamur à malo:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">De corrept. &amp; grat. c. 2.</note> We must vnderstand the grace of God by Iesus Christ, by the which we are onely deliuered from euill. <hi>Si quid boni est, magni, vel parui, donum tuum est, nostrum non est nisi malum: si quid boni vnquam habui, à te recepi:</hi> If there bee any good in vs, much or little, it is thy gift: nothing is ours but the euill in vs: <hi>Ergo,</hi> all good things are of God, and onely of his grace: and therefore our iustification.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 3. There are many euident places, which doe attribute our iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to faith without workes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28.11.8. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.8.9. In all these places
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:20636:306"/>
in plaine termes, We are sayd to bee iustified by faith without workes.

really imparted vnto the other: whereupon it followeth, that the humanitie of Christ is euery where, because it is verely vnited, and made one person with the Godhead in Christ. This opinion the Papists would be thought to detest and abhorre: and the Iesuite bestoweth great paines by sundrie arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it: as by diuers places of scripture, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.

                        <head>The Protestants.</head>
                        <p>IT is true Catholique and sound doctrine, that the humane and diuine nature are truely vnited in Christ, and doe make but one person, or hypostasis, neither by confusion of the natures, nor conuersion of one into the other, but by vnitie of person: for as the bodie and soule make one man, so God and man is one Christ. And the better to vnderstand this mysterie, we must set downe these three posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Though the two natures in Christ be so vnited, that they make but one person, yet neither the natures are confounded, nor yet the properties: but as Christ is both God and man, so there is in him a double power, will, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, one humane and created, the other diuine and vncreated.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By reason of this vnion, all the excellent graces of the spirit in the highest degree, and aboue measure, are giuen and bestowed vpon the humanitie of Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.34. but such notwithstanding, as destroy not his humane nature, but are qualities created, as his humanitie also was created.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is also a mutuall communication of the proprieties of both natures each to other, though not really in respect of the natures: So we say <hi>in Concreto,</hi> in the concrete, that is, taking the whole person of Christ, that <hi>Christus homo,</hi> that is, the man Christ is omnipotent, is euery where: and <hi>Christus Deus,</hi> that is, Christ being God, died for vs, was buried, rose againe: but in the abstract it is great blasphemie to say; that the Godhead of Christ died, was buried, or rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or that the humanitie of Christ is omnipotent, or in euery place.</p>
                        <p>The Vbiquitaries now hold, that there is a reall communication of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of both natures: &amp; therfore doubt not to say, that the flesh and bodie of Christ is euery where in all places at once. The Papists in outward shew are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to that opinion: but indeed, and in truth, as it shall now appeare, they are not farre off from being in the same error.</p>
                        <p>First, the same arguments which they vrge against the Vbiquitaries, doe returne vpon themselues: for although they will not say, that Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is euerie where, yet they hold that it may bee in a thousand places at once, yea and more to, if the Sacrament be at once in so many places ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated: for Christs bodie is reallie and verely in the Sacrament. But those places alleadged, He is risen, he is not heere, and the rest, doe proue that
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:20636:307"/>
Christ can be but in one place at once. This their opinion also is against the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Christs ascension, and abiding in heauen till the day of iudgement: for if the same bodie wherein Christ sitteth in heauen, be in the Sacrament; either when he is present in earth, he is absent in heauen, contrary to the scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. which sayth, The heauens must containe him till that all things be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: or els, if he be in both places at once, they must needes make his bodie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and so destroy the nature of his humanitie, which can be but in one place. If they say it is another bodie and flesh, which Christ by his diuine power ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to bee present in the Sacrament, that were much more absurd: for then Christ should haue many bodies, and other flesh then that which was borne of the Virgine Mary. We see then they are not farre off from the opinion of the Vbiquitaries.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <note place="margin">Annot. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal. 6. sect. 1.</note>2. The <hi>Rhemists</hi> doe approue that argument, whereby <hi>Hierome</hi> proueth that the Saints may euery where be present at their bodies &amp; monuments:
<q>They follow the Lambe, whither soeuer he goeth: but the Lambe is in euery place: therefore they that be with the Lambe Christ, be present euery where.</q>
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth, that the Lambe Christ in humanitie must be euery where: for how can he be present els in innumerable places at once, where any reliques or monuments of Saints are? Neither can they excuse this vbiquitarie presence of the humanitie of Christ and the soules of Saints, by their agilitie and celeritie: because they can quickly passe from one place to another: for if they must bee present at their monuments, whensoeuer they are called vpon, they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie be often in many places at once: for in one and the same instant, men may resort to their monuments which are in diuers places farre asunder. Thus they are driuen not onely to graunt an vbiquitie or omnipresence of the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Christ, but euen of Saints also: which those whom they call Vbiquitaries would neuer graunt.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The bodie of Christ is visible and palpable now in heauen, and hath a place according to the quantitie of his bodie: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth as much, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. But that bodie which is in the Sacrament hath none of these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is neither seene, nor felt, neither hath a place according to the quantitie of a bodie, for they close it vp in small round cakes. Wherfore destroying these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the humanitie of Christ, they may as well, and do in effect, take away the other, namely, the being of Christs bodie in one place: for it is as proper to the bodie of Christ to be seene and felt, as to be in one place at once.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> granteth, being vrged with that argument, that Christs soule was in Paradise after his passion, and therefore not in hell: he confesseth, that it was not impossible that Christs soule should be in two places at once, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Christi anima. cap.</hi> 15. Yea he sayth, that Christ may, if he will, turne al the world into bread, and the bread so made conuert into his flesh; and so his bodie may be as well in euery place of the world, as now it is in the Eucharist, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat cap.</hi> 11. What great oddes now, I pray you, is there between the opinion of the Vbiquitaries and of the Papists? but that they say, that the bodie of Christ
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:20636:307"/>
is euery where ordinarily by the power of the Godhead: the other say, his flesh is in many places at once by a miracle. The one sayth, Christs bodie actually is in euery place: the other, that it may be if Christ will.</p>

Christ was anoynted from his mothers womb, and then the spirit of God was vpon him: for the Angels that appeared to the shepheards call him Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.11. And <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth, The word was made flesh, full of grace and truth, 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 11. Therefore euen then he had receiued all abundance of grace and knowledge, <hi>Bellarm. de Christi anima. lib.</hi> 4.2.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. We grant, that our Sauiour was the Iesus &amp; the Christ euen from his natiuitie: not that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he actually straightwaies entred into those offices, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued plenarie power of all the graces of the spirit, but because he was euen from his mothers wombe consecrated and appoynted thereunto: for it no more followeth, because he is called Christ, that he then had his actuall anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then, that because he was called Iesus from his natiuitie, that he had actually performed our redemption. The full anoynting of the spirit was fulfilled in his baptisme, when the holy Ghost came downe in the likenes of a Doue: and then beginning to preach, in his first sermon at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he sheweth the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the prophecie of <hi>Esay,</hi> The spirite of the Lord is vpon me, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Neither doe the words of <hi>Iohn</hi> import so much, as they gather. The word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst vs, full of grace and truth: which is not to be vnderstood of the very first assuming of the flesh, but of the dwelling of the word in the flesh amongst vs, and so appeared to be full of grace and truth.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. Christ was the Sonne of God in his very incarnation, and euen then was the humanitie perfectly vnited to the Godhead: therefore immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon this vnion and coniunction of both natures in one person, must needes follow the fulnes of grace in the humane nature. Againe, <hi>Adam</hi> was created in perfect wisedome, therefore much more the second <hi>Adam, Bellar. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. If presently vpon the vniting of the two natures together, it had been necessarie that the humane nature of Christ should haue receiued whatsoeuer by the presence of the diuine nature was to be conferred vpon it: then Christ straight waies must also both in bodie and soule haue been glorified: for it can not be denied, but that as the bodie of Christ after the resurrection receiued
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:20636:308"/>
more glorie then before: so also his soule being the other part of his humanitie, was more glorified. By this it is euident, that the humanitie receiued not at once the fulnes of all grace and glorie, in the first vniting of the Godhead.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> was created perfect in bodie and soule: and if Christ therefore ought to haue the fulnes of the gifts of the soule in his creation as <hi>Adam</hi> had, why ought he not also to haue had a perfect bodie, as <hi>Adam</hi> was created with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? Wherefore as it was no dishonour to Christ to grow vp in stature of bodie, so neither was it to encrease in the gifts of the mind.</p>

                           <p>THat Christ was euen from his birth and first conception perfect God, and perfect man; we doe assuredly beleeue, and that in the very incarnation, the diuine and humane nature were vnited together. Also we graunt, that the Lord Christ might haue created to himselfe a soule full of all wisedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as he might haue made himselfe a perfect bodie: but seeing it pleased him to bee borne of a woman, and first to dwell in the bodie of an infant, wee doubt not to say, as the scripture teacheth vs, that he also Encreased in wisedome.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. He was in all things like to his brethren, onely sinne excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.4.15. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he grew vp and encreased in knowledge, according to the manner of men, which may be done without sinne.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The scripture sayth plainly, which cannot lye, that Iesus grew vp and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in wisedome and stature, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. And lest they should answere, that this encreasing was onely in the opinion of men: it followeth, And in fauour with God and men: he increased in wisedome, stature and fauour, not onely in shew before men, but in truth before God: and as verily and indeed he grew vp in stature, so also in wisedome.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Christ testifieth of himselfe, That neither the Angels nor the Sonne of man, as he is man, knoweth of the day or houre of his comming to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the father onely, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.31. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ as hee was man had not at once all fulnes of knowledge. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus expoundeth this place, <hi>Filius dicitur nescire, quia non sciebat ad dicendum alijs:</hi> The Sonne is sayd not to knowe, because he knewe it, not to reueale it to others, but to keepe it secret to himselfe.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, then by the same reason, the Angels doe knowe it also: but that they are charged not to declare it to men: for the text sayth, that neither the Angels, nor the Sonne of man knoweth the time. Secondly, in this sense also the father might be sayd not to knowe it: for neither hath he reuealed it to any. Lastly, although we doe affirme according to the scripture, that the child Iesus did increase in the gifts of the mind, as he did in the stature of his bodie: yet we do put great difference between him, and all other children that euer came into the world: for as his conception &amp; birth were not after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon manner; (for
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:20636:308"/>
he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued by the holy Ghost, &amp; brought forth without trauel and labour: as <hi>August.</hi> sayth, <hi>Nec concipiendo libidine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nec pariendo perpessa est dolore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing she felt no carnal desire; in bearing she suffered no payne:) So likewise,<note place="margin">De 5. haeres. cap. 5.</note> the holy and blessed babe, in the constitution both of bodie and soule excelled the common condition of all other infants: for as he was voyd of originall sinne, so he was without the effects and fruites thereof, which doe shewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in children: for neither suffered he the like pangs and infirmities in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, being in his infancie, as other children doe, that are vexed and tormented in bodie: neither was he subiect to the vnreasonable and brutish motions of the minde, which are in children. Therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Hanc ignorantiam &amp; animi infirmitatem, quam videmus in paruulis, nullo modo fuerim in Christo paruulo suspicatus:</hi> This kind of ignorance and infirmitie of minde, which is in children, I cannot thinke to haue been in the babe Christ.

                              <p n="2">2. We graunt, that both the birth of Christ, his rising out of the graue, his

                           <p n="1">1. The scripture doth ascribe the worke of our redemption and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to the blood of Christ vpon the Crosse, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the death of the bodie of Christ, without any further anguish in soule, was sufficient, <hi>Bellarm. de Christi anima. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. By the blood of Christ vpon the Crosse, must needes bee vnderstood all the parts and circumstances of his passion, both his sufferings in bodie and soule: for if it should be vnderstood properly, the blood of Christ onely were sufficient, and so his bodie and flesh should be excluded: and if the shedding of his blood be taken simply, we shal finde, that it was no part of his death: for his side was pearced, whereout issued water and blood, after he had yeelded vp the ghost, and all the torments of death were past: yea after he had vttered these words vpon the Crosse, It is finished, that is, he had payd the full raunsome for mankind, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19. <hi>vers.</hi> 30.34. Wherefore by his blood must be vnderstood, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> when one part is taken for the whole, all the other paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he suffered in his flesh.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="603" facs="tcp:20636:309"/>Secondly, yea and the paines of the soule to are by that speech fitly expressed: for the blood of euery creature, is the life thereof, <hi>Genes. 9.4. Leuit. 17.14.</hi> But the soule is the life of man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not vnproperly by the shedding of Christs blood, euen the vexation, and at the last the expiration of his soule, and so his whole passion both in body and soule is signified. Wherefore as in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alleadged, we read the blood of Christ, or the blood of the Crosse, so other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in more generall termes the Apostles call it, The dying of Christ, <hi>2. Cor. 4.10.</hi> And the suffrings of Christ, <hi>1. Pet. 4.13.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. If Christ, when he cried out vpon the Crosse, O God my God, why hast thou forsaken me? had felt the wrath of God, and despaired of his help, he should most greeuously haue sinned: <hi>Bellarm. ibid.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. It cannot be, that Christ thus cried out for the paine of bodily death: for then he had beene of greater infirmitie then many of his seruants, that in the midst of extreme torments neuer complained. And therefore it must needs be the burthen of the wrath and curse of God, that he endured for our sinne, that made him so to cry out vpon the crosse.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Neither doth it follow that Christ vttered those words in despaire, but only to shew the great anguish, trouble, and perturbation of his spirite, being vpon the crosse considered now as a meere man, his diuine nature and power repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and hiding it selfe for a time: and although in the vexation of his soule he thus cryed out, yet he was not altogether left comfortlesse in spirite, in that he said, My God, my God: which wordes must needs declare an inward confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and assured trust in God.</p>

                           <p>WE holde, it was necessary for our redemption, that Christ should not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffer bodily paines, but also feele the very anguish and horror of soule: that as by his death we are redeemed both body and soule, so he should pay the ransome for both in his body and soule.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That our Sauiour suffered great anguish in soule, the scripture testifieth: for before his suffring in his body vpon the crosse, being in the garden, he saith of himselfe, My soule is heauy vnto death: at the same time being grieuously trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: he sweat water and blood: and last of all, hanging vpon the crosse he cryed out. By those effectes it is euidently proued, that there was a greater feare in him, then of the death of the body: for many holy Martyrs haue without any shew of such griefe endured horrible torments in the flesh, and therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it followeth, that those things proceeded from the griefe of his soule, as the Apostle sheweth: <hi>Heb. 5.7.</hi> He offered vp praiers with strong crying and teares, to him that was able to saue him from death, and was heard in that which he feared. If it had beene onely feare of bodily death, what need such strong cries with teares? And the text is plaine, that he was heard, that is, saued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death which he feared: but he was not saued from the bodily death: for he died
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:20636:310"/>
and gaue vp the ghost: wherefore it was the great horror of soule that caused him to feare.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarm.</hi> answereth for all this, that it was the bodily death which he feared: but not of necessitie, because he could not otherwise choose, but willingly, he would abide this brunt also of the feare and sorrow of death: <hi>Voluit poenam mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roris &amp; timoris subire vt redemptio esset copiosae.</hi> And heerein he exceedeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men that haue suffered: for they are ridde from feare, because God giueth them greater comfort, and they regarde not the present torment: but Christ willingly and of his owne accord drew himselfe into this agonie of feare.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. That Christ as he was God, had determined and set it downe to dye for the world, it is not to be doubted of: but that as he was man, he had not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to escape death, as being ignorant of Gods determination, it is contrary to the Scriptures: which make mention of his earnest praier that he made thrice, that the cup might passe, <hi>Math. 26.</hi> Therefore Christ willingly entred not into that agony of feare in his humane desire, but as submitting himselfe and his will in obedience to his fathers will.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He is contrary to him selfe, in saying that Christs bodily sufferings were sufficient for our redemption, and yet graunteth, that Christ, <hi>vt redemptio esset copiosa,</hi> That our redemption might be more full, would abide also the smart of the feare of death: If he feared but the bodily death, as he saith, yet was he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in soule, and therefore besides bodily paine, he suffered anguish in his soule.</p>

                           <p>THat Christ our Sauiour by the vertue of his death, did ouercome hel and the deuill, we doe verily beleeue, which may be called a discent into hell: that he also suffered the torments of hell vpon the crosse, and so descended into hell for vs, to abide that bitter paine which we had deserued to suffer eternally, we doe also holde and teach: for what rather may be called hell, then the anguish of soule, which he suffered, when he being God, yet complained that he was forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God Furthermore, if descending into hell, be taken according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew phrase, For entring into the state of the dead: so we also graunt, that Christ descended into hell, <hi>Fulk Act. 2. sect. 11.</hi> But for the descending of Christ into hell, after your sense, to deliuer the Patriarkes from thence, when you can proue it out of Scripture, we will yeelde vnto you.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The soule of Christ which he committed into his Fathers hands, was in Paradise, where he promised the theefe should be with him, <hi>Luke 22.43.</hi> How then could his soule be three daies in hell, as you affirme, from the time of his death to his resurrection? <hi>Fulke Luke 11. sect. 4. Bellarm.</hi> answereth, that it was not impossible, that the soule of Christ should be in two places at once, <hi>cap. 15.</hi> which is an answere not worthy to be answered: for who hath taught them so boldly to builde their phantasies vpon Gods power, hauing no warrant not assurance of his wil? May not the Vbiquitaries by the same reason proue the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence of Christs humanity, because he is able to make his soule and body to be in many places at once, as well as in two: and so consequently by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is infinite as well in all places, as in many?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We beleeue that the Patriarkes and godly Fathers were in heauen or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, as well before the resurrection of Christ as after: for in as much as they were iustified by faith in his blood, they receiued the same crowne and reward of righteousnes that we doe, being iustified by the same meanes. This we haue proued more at large, <hi>controu. 9. quest. 1.</hi> Wherefore seeing there were none in hell, which they call <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> to be deliuered, there was no such cause why Christ should descend into hell. Therefore he descended not to deliuer the Patriarkes that remained in darkenes.</p>

Paul</hi> saith, was sufficiently manifested and made knowne vpon the crosse, <hi>Colos. 2.15. Thomas Aquinas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these, addeth a third, that as Christ died for vs to free vs from death, so it was conuenient that he should descend into hell, to deliuer vs from the descension into hell: as though Christ by his death did not fully deliuer vs from eternall

This place cannot otherwise be applied, then to signifie the burial of Christ, and his abode in the graue, and his rising againe the third day: of his soule it cannot properly be meant: for Christ saith, he will giue them the signe of <hi>Ionas</hi> in himselfe: but a signe is conspicuous, visible and apparent: how could then the descending of his soule be a signe vnto them, which they knew not, neither could see?

                           </gap>, then could he giue them, then, <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly, to be in the hart of the earth, is nothing els but to be within the earth, according to the Hebrew phrase, as <hi>Exod. 15.8.</hi> The hart of the Sea, that is, within the Sea: So Christs body was in the earth, it lay hid as it were in the bowels of the earth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This exposition is against themselues: for if Christ went downe to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hart and midst of the earth, which is the center, then he descended to the place of the damned: for neither <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> nor Purgatory, are in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lowest part of the earth by their opinion: but they themselues holde the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: for they say, that Christ by descending, deliuered soules out of the two vppermost hels, <hi>Limbus,</hi> and Purgatory, but not out of the nethermost hell, which is the place of the damned, <hi>Rhemist. Luke 16. sect. 8.</hi> Also it should follow of this their interpretation, that the soule of Christ was as long in hell, as his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the graue, which is against the opinion of many Papists.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. <hi>Luke 8.31.</hi> The Deuils desired Christ, that he would not send them into the deepe: what is that els but the lowest region of the earth, where hell is, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the lowest partes of the earth? <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ans. We deny not but that God hath prepared, and that there is a place of vnspeakable torments ordeined for the deuill and his angels, and all damned soules: but that this place should be in the center of the earth, the places allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged proue not: for the word <hi>Abyssus</hi> translated, the deepe, is sometime taken figuratiuely in a metaphore, as <hi>Rom. 11.33.</hi> O the deepenes of the wisedome of God: the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, not much varying in signification from <hi>abyssus</hi>: so the place of their punishment is saide to be a great depth, that is, a place of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable and vnspeakable miserie and horror. Neither must this word <hi>abyssus,</hi> of necessitie be referred to the earth, for there are <hi>abyssi maris,</hi> the depths of the Sea, <hi>Exod. 15.8.</hi> as well as of the earth.</p>
                        <p>The lower places which <hi>S.

                        <p>THat there is a locall place of torment prepared for the deuill and his angels, we doubt not, being so taught in the Scripture, <hi>Math. 25.41.</hi> A place of darkenes, <hi>2.

Farre distant from the heauenly mansions of the blessed, <hi>Luke 16.26.</hi> Neither doe we deny but that it may be in the earth, or wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer els it pleaseth God: but wheresoeuer hel is, there is but one: that deuision of hell into three or foure regions, we vtterly condemne, as a meere deuise of man without Scripture: and this we say, that the place of hell causeth not the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the wrath and curse of God: for euen out of hel God may make a man to feele the torments of hell, as we doubt not but our Sauiour Christ did for vs and our redemption vpon the crosse.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. It is possible to feele the paine of hell in the soule, although not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iob</hi> felt euen the hell of conscience in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for the time: yea our Sauiour bare the burthen of his fathers wrath vpon the Crosse, as we haue shewed before: Ergo, it is not the place that maketh hell.</p>
                        <p>Argu. 2. Hell is nothing els as the Scripture defineth it, but to be cast into vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkenes, There shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth, <hi>Math. 25.30.22.13.</hi> The darkenes causeth weeping &amp; horrible gnashing of teeth, the vnspeakable punishment both of body and soule: this darkenes is not the absence of the light of the sunne: for neither shall the Saints in heauen haue that light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neede it not, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.5. And it shalbe a place of darkenes to the damned angels, which haue no vse of the Sunne light: they also are reserued in chaines of darkenes, <hi>Iude 6.</hi> as they are no materiall chaines, so neither is it an outward darkenes: but the absence of Gods fauour and the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: as the people are saide to haue sit in darkenes, before the light of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by the preaching of Iesus Christ, did shine vnto them, <hi>Math. 4.16.</hi> But they much more shalbe and are kept in darkenes, that are condemned to hell, where they feele nothing but the horror of Gods wrath, his eternall and endlesse curse, with vnspeakable torments now in soule, and afterward both in body &amp; soule, without all comfort or hope of refreshing, vtterly excluded from the presence of God: wherefore it is not the place, but the wrath of God, and absence of his spirite, that causeth such endlesse and vnspeakable punishment.</p>
                        <p>Argu. 3. As for your distinction of hell, the brim whereof you say is <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> the middle parte, Purgatory, the lowest and nethermost hel it selfe, the place of the damned, in <hi>Augustines</hi> time it was not knowne: for first that the

                        <p>Ans. This place proueth, that the sonne of God, as he is the sonne, is of God: for to be the sonne of God, the word, the wisedome of God, <hi>1.

                        <p>THat we may fully know the state of this question, we must first set downe certain propositions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, we do worship one eternal, omnipotent, &amp; onely wise God, one and the same in power, essence, eternitie: but three in person, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost: there is the same nature, essence, and
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:20636:313"/>
deitie of them all, though they be distinguished in person: As there is one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the light, the heate thereof and the shining brightnes, <hi>Lucis, splendoris, caloris,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> putteth the example: which three differ amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in propertie and quality, yet haue one and the selfe same nature and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: God the father is as the light, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. God the Sonne is as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. God the holy Ghost is as the heate or fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. Thus these three are one in nature and essence, but three in person.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is somewhat communicable to them all, as the Godhead and diuine power and nature: Somewhat incommunicable, as the seueral propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of the persons: for it is proper onely to the father to beget, proper to the Sonne onely to be begotten, proper onely to the holy Ghost to proceede from them both. There is no essentiall difference in the Trinitie: for there is one es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and diuine nature common to them all. But there is both a real and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal difference: The persons differ one from another really, though not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. But the persons differ onely rationally or in respect from the essence of the Godhead: as the father and the sonne amongst men differ not essentially, for they are both men. But they are really, verily, and indeede distinguished; for it is one thing to be the father, another to be the sonne: yet from their owne essence their persons onely differ in respect and relation, not verily, <hi>non re, sed ratione:</hi> for the father is a man, the sonne also is a man: but in one respect he is a father, &amp; in an other he is man: so likewise of the sonne, yet one and the same, is both father and man; one and the same is both sonne and man: so is it in the Trinitie. Now to the poynt of the question, which wee haue in hand. The Sonne therefore in the blessed Trinitie is begotten of his fathers essence, and hath the whole essence of his father, not by propagation, partition, profluence, but onely by communication. The sonne is not <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Sonne of himselfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is sonne of the father: But he is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, very God of himself: The essence or Godhead of the Sonne is of himselfe, not of the father: for it is one and the selfesame essence, which the father hath. He is indeede, <hi>Deus de Deo, lumen de lumine,</hi> God of God, light of light: But not as he is God, is he of God, but as he is the Sonne. It is one thing for the person of the Sonne to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the essence of the Father, which we graunt: another thing, for the essence of the Sonne to be begotten, which we must not yeeld to. So we conclude, that Christ as he is the Sonne, is of God the Father, as he is God, he is of himselfe.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. The essence of the Father is of himselfe, not begotten of any: but the essence and Deitie of the Sonne is the same and all one with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not begotten of any other. Agayne, he is not God whose es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is not of himselfe: therefore if Christs essence be not of himselfe, he should not be God.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. Our Sauiour himselfe sayth, As the Father hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so hee hath giuen to the Sonne also to haue life in himselfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.26. The Sonne then hath life in himselfe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee is GOD of himselfe. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> vpon these wordes writeth: <hi>Non quasi mutuatur vitam, nec quasi particeps
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:20636:314"/>
vitae,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In Iohan. tract. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>sed ipse vitam in se habet, vt ipsa vita sibi sit ipse:</hi> He did not as it were bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row life of his father, neither is made partaker of life, but he hath life in himself, he is life vnto himselfe. But lest any man should thus mistake the wordes of the text, that because the Father gaue to the Sonne to haue life in himself, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee gaue him to be God: (for to haue life in himselfe is to bee God) <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> thus expoundeth them: <hi>Dedit filio vitam habere in se, breuiter dixerim, genuit filium:</hi> He gaue to his Sonne to haue life in himselfe, in fewe wordes, He begat his Sonne. As if we should say, the Father which hath life in himselfe, that is, is God, gaue to his Sonne to haue life in himselfe, that is, begat God the Sonne: he begat him not as he was God, but as he was his Sonne: yet because of the neere vniting and coniunction of the person with the Godhead and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power to haue life in himselfe, which really cannot be distinguished, but onely in respect, as we haue shewed: the Father is said also to giue vnto the Sonne to be God, and to haue life in himselfe, not directly or properly but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely and by a consequent, because his Sonne whom he begat from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, must also necessarily be God.</p>
                        <p>And that it cannot be the proper meaning, that God the Father gaue to the Sonne power to haue life in himselfe, it appeareth by the words themselues: for as the Father hath life in himselfe, euen so hath hee giuen to the Sonne: but the Father hath life in himselfe, without beginning from any other. <hi>Ergo,</hi> so hath the Sonne.</p>
                        <p>There should els be a contrarietie and repugnancie in the speech: for if Christ receiued life from his father, he could not haue it in himselfe. It must therfore of necessity be vnderstood of the person in the Trinity, not of the diuine essence. And so we determine that it is true in the concrete, <hi>in concreto,</hi> if wee say, <hi>Deus Pater genuit Deum Filium:</hi> God the Father begat God the Sonne, but not in <hi>abstracto, Deitas Patris genuit Deitatem Filium,</hi> that the Godhead of the Father begat the Godhead of the Sonne. But in respect of his person onely as he is the Sonne the second person in Trinitie, so is hee begotten and hath his beginning of God. But in respect of his diuine nature as he is God, hee is begotten of none, but of himselfe as God the Father is.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Answ. It followeth not, that because Christ is our priest and mediator as God and man, that therefore he should performe all the dueties of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as he was God: all the partes of his priesthood that required obedience, seruice, homage, subiection, as were his sufferings and sacrifice, he exercised as man: but the authority of reconciling vs to God, he wrought both as God and man.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. There is one God, and one Mediator of God and men, the man Iesus Christ, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.5. Why sayth the Apostle, The man Iesus Christ, but to signifie, that according to his manhood onely he is our Mediator. <hi>Bellarm. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>Ans. 1. You may as well conclude out of this place, that the Mediator is onely man and not GOD, as that hee is mediator onely as man and not as GOD: but if out of these wordes it may bee prooued, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is both GOD and man, as it necessarily followeth, (for how else can he be a Mediator of God and men?) it dooth as well follow that hee is Mediator both as God and as man. Indeede the Apostle sayth, The man Iesus Christ, not God and man, for the one he had sayd before, There is one God; in that speech including our Sauiour Christ, who is one God with his Father. Secondly, what Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is, it appeareth in the next verse, who gaue himselfe a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. As Christ therefore gaue himselfe a ransome, so is hee Priest and Mediator: but he gaue himselfe as he was God; as he was man, hee was giuen: <hi>Ergo,</hi> as God he is Mediator.</p>

                        <p>IN the office of the Priesthood two things must be considered, a ministerie, and an authoritie: In respect of the ministeriall parte Christ performed the office of his priesthood as man, but in respect of authoritie of entering into the holyest place, and reconciling vs to God, which was the principall parte of his Priesthood, he did performe it as the Sonne of God, as the Lord and maker of the house, and not as a seruant. And so we holde that Christ neither according to his humanitie alone, nor his Godhead alone, but that whole Christ is a Priest, both as God and man.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, God was in Christ, reconciling the worlde to himselfe, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ, as God, is our reconciler and mediator. Againe, Christ as he is without Father and mother, hath no beginning of his dayes, nor end of his life, so is hee a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedech</hi>: but Christ as he is God and man hath neither father nor mother: as he is God hath no beginning of dayes, and in his whole person no end of his life, therefore as God and man he is a Priest of <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> order.</p>

                        <p>IT is not in any wise to be thought, that Christ merited his glory, which is due to him in respect of his diuinity: but that by the glorious work of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hath declared himselfe to be a person worthy of all honour and glory, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 5.9. the place is so to be vnderstoode.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 1.

as though for our cause he onely had died: But it is now a diuided and halfe loue: for he died, as they say, partly to merite for himselfe, partly to merite for vs. But the scripture speaketh cleane contrary, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.9. For their sakes sanctifie I my selfe: he sayth not, partly for their sakes, partly for mine owne.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 2. All glory that Christ hath, was from euerlasting due to his person, because he is the eternall Sonne of God: As hee himselfe sayth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.5. And now glorifie mee with thine owne selfe, with the glory which I had with thee, before the world was, and this glorie was due vnto Christ so soone as he was incarnate by the right of his Godhead. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. When he bringeth in his first begotten Sonne into the worlde, hee sayth, Let all the Angels of God worship him. And the <hi>Rhemists</hi> themselues confesse, in their <hi>Annotat.</hi> vpon these wordes, that straight vpon Christs descending from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, it was the duetie of Angels to worship him. <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee merited not his glorification by his death, which was due vnto him euen at his first incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Argum. 3. If Christ merited his owne glorification, then hee also me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the hypostaticall vnion, that his manhood should bee ioyned to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in vnitie of person; for his glory, maiestie, and power giuen to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, doth issue and arise from the vniting of his Godhead therewith in one person: but his humanity deserued not to be vnited to the Godhead: <hi>Nemo tam caecus est,</hi> sayth <hi>Augustine,</hi> No man is so blind, that he dare say,<note place="margin">De corrept. &amp; grat. cap. 11.</note> that Christ by his well liuing merited to be called the Sonne of God.

in that time, not which shall immediately follow vpon the generall publishing of the Gospel, but which God hath appoynted. We must also consider who it is, that sayth, <hi>Then,</hi> namely, God himselfe, with whom a thousand yeares is as one day, and one day as a thousand yeares. Christ <hi>(Then)</hi> may come many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after, and yet it shall be true, that then shall the end be. But we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take the first sense, that <hi>(Then)</hi> is here taken indefinitely, as it is thorough the whole chapter, as <hi>vers.</hi> 21. Then shall be great tribulation, which cannot haue relation to that which he spake of before; for then it must be vnderstoode of the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> but our Sauiour meaneth by (<hi>Then</hi>) the time towards the ende of the world: as <hi>vers.</hi> 29. Immediately after the tribulation of those dayes, the Sunne shalbe darkened: Then shall the signe of the Sonne of man appeare.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. We see the Gospel hath been preached in great countreyes of late, which neuer heard the Gospel afore, as it is thought, <hi>Rhemist. Math.</hi> 24. <hi>sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Ans. 1. They speake doubtfully, they cannot tell: as it is thought, say they. 2. They meane the preaching of their Friers, in those newe found countreyes, which was not the preaching of the Gospel, but of vile superstition, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the people to God, but to robbe and spoyle them, and make a pray of them, killing &amp; slaying them without al mercy: reade <hi>Benzo in historia noui orbis.</hi> 3. We deny not but that the Gospell may be reuiued and renued in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, where notwithstanding it was planted many yeares afore: As this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of ours in ancient time called <hi>Britanie,</hi> was first instructed in the faith by the preaching of <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> as <hi>Gildas</hi> saith: or as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> saith, by <hi>Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Zelotes:</hi> yet after that, the foundation of the faith thus begun,<note place="margin">Fox p. 106.</note> it was confirmed afterward in king <hi>Lucius</hi> daies, by the preaching of <hi>Fagane</hi> &amp; <hi>Damiane,</hi> which at <hi>Lucius</hi> request were sent into the land from <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> B. of Rome: and so may it come to passe in other countreyes: a second preaching therefore taketh not away the former, but confirmeth and reuiueth it.</p>

                           <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. expoundeth that place of the <hi>Psalme,</hi> Their sound is gone forth into all the worlde, of the Apostles.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="618" facs="tcp:20636:317"/>Agayne, seeing the Apostolicall calling and gift is now ceased, neither are we to looke that men should be immediatly called from heauen, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell to all nations is an Apostolicall worke, for the which the Apostles also receiued the gifts of tongues: seeing now we haue neither A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike men, nor Apostolike giftes, wee are not to doubt, but that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and prophesie of the vniuersall preaching of the Gospell, is performed already.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. It appeareth in Ecclesiasticall histories, that the Apostles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed themselues into all partes of the worlde, euery where preaching the Gospell. <hi>Thomas</hi> preached to the <hi>Parthians, Medes, Persians,</hi> also to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Fox. p. 32.</note>
                              <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> in <hi>Mauritania, Africa,</hi> and in <hi>Britania: Iudas,</hi> called <hi>Thaddaeus,</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia: Mark,</hi> in <hi>Aegypt: Bartholomaeus</hi> to the <hi>Indians: Andrew</hi> preached to the <hi>Scythians, Sogdians, Aethopians:</hi> So that there were fewe or no knowen countreyes in the world, which heard not of the fame of the Gospell.</p>
                           <p>But here two things must be obserued: First, that the Gospel was to bee preached in the habitable or knowen world: the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>: Many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes are inhabited now that were not habitable then,<note place="margin">Matt. 24.14</note> or at the least not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited: wherefore it was sufficient, that the people of the world heard of the Gospel, howsoeuer afterward they were propagated into other vnknowen pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Secondly, as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Omnes gentes promissae sunt, non omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines omnium gentium:</hi> All nations were promised to heare of the Gospel, not all the men and inhabitants of euery nation.<note place="margin">Epistol. 80.</note> And so we doubt not but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did lay the foundation of fayth through the whole worlde, and were first planters of the Churches in euery nation. But their plantings were watered and encreased, and continued by others.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, seeing the world hath once already beene generally lightened with the truth of the Gospell, we are not to looke any more for a solemne lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ambassage to be sent from the Lord vnto all nations: But those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes rather, which somtime had the trueth, and now haue lost it, ought now to seeke vnto those places that haue it, as the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> went a long iourney to heare <hi>Salomons</hi> wisdome: They therefore that yet doe expect an vniuersall preaching, may sooner see Christ comming in the cloudes, then haue their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation satisfied.</p>

                           <p>Argum. <hi>Malachie</hi> 4.5. I will send you <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet, before the great and fearefull day of the Lorde. These are also the two witnesses spoken of, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 11.3. Which shall be slaine and rise vp againe the third day. <hi>Ergo, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> and <hi>Henoch</hi> shall come before the day of the Lorde, <hi>Bellarm. de Roman. pontif.</hi> 3.6.</p>
                           <p>Ans. First, the prophesie of <hi>Malachie</hi> was fulfilled in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who came in the spirite of <hi>Elias,</hi> as it is thrise in the Gospell applied: once by the <hi>Angel, Luk.</hi> 1.16. twise by our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.14. &amp; 17.13.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, it is not properly vnderstoode of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> but onely in an allegorie. First, the Prophet speaketh of the great and fearefull day of the Lord: but the comming of Christ was the acceptable time.</p>
                           <p>Ans. Here the Iesuite bewrayeth great ignorance: As though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ in the flesh, as it brought comfort to the Elect, &amp; to as many as were ordeined to saluation, was not also hastening of the iudgement of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wicked: and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, The axe was laide to the roote of the tree, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. and that Christ came with his fanne in his hand, verse 12. The Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26. applieth that saying of the Prophet: Once againe wil I shake not onely the heauens, but the earth, to the preaching of the Gospell: wee see then in what sence the first comming of Christ is called a fearefull and terrible day.</p>
                           <p>Ans. Secondly, by the two witnesses, is vnderstood the small, yet sufficient number of the true seruants of God, which shall witnesse the truth euen in the whottest persecution of Antichrist: there is no mention made of <hi>Henoch</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias.</hi> And if you will needs vnderstand that literally, of their rising againe, why not the rest also, how fire shall proceede out of their mouthes to consume the wicked, and they shall turne water into blood? The meaning is nothing else, but that God will alwaies haue faithfull witnesses in his Church, which shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies stand vp, in the stead of the Prophets and holy men gone before.</p>

                           <p>LIke as the Pharisies deceiued the Iewes with vaine expectation of <hi>Elias,</hi> and so hindred their beliefe in Christ: so the Papists would not haue men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the manifestation of Antichrist, vnder this false pretence, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> must first come before Antichrist bee reuealed, which wee doe hold as a Iewish fable and popish dreame.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. The Prophesie of <hi>Elias</hi> comming is properly fulfilled in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and therefore wee are not to looke for any other accomplishment thereof: neither now is there any Paradise remaining but Heauen, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.4. And to affirme that <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> went vp to Heauen in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, before the ascension of Christ, out of Scripture it cannot be proued: it is
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:20636:318"/>
euident that they were taken vp aliue into heauen, but not that they continued aliue.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. The varietie of opinions concerning the personall appearance of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> declare that it is an vncertaine thing, and but deuised of men. <hi>Hilarye</hi> saith, they shalbe <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias: Chrysostome</hi> granteth that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> shall come, but not <hi>Henoch. Iustine</hi> thinketh that not onely <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> are aliue, but all those, whose bodies rose at the resurrection of Christ: <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polytus</hi> is of opinion, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine shall come with them and some say <hi>Ieremie</hi> also, whose death is not read of, <hi>Fulk. Apocal.</hi> 11. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. And thus it is no meruaile, if men run mad as it were in their foolish conceites, hauing no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for their opinions out of Scriptures.</p>
                           <p>The nation of the Iewes wee grant, according to the manifest prophesie of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> shall in the end be conuerted: but not in such sort, by the personall preaching of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> for the Apostle setting downe at large the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of their calling, would not haue left out so necessarie a thing.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Augustine</hi> by the two witnesses, vnderstandeth the two testaments, the Old and the new. But hee denieth vtterly, that any shall rise before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ:<note place="margin">In Apocal. Homil. 8.</note> as the Apostle saith, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.23.

                           <p>Ans. 1.

vnderstoode of the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> for at the comming of Christ, there shall be one and the same case of all, whether of those that giue suck, or of those that giue none.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it cannot be meant of the last tribulation in the world, because the words are, that as there was none such since the beginning of the world, so there shall be none such after. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there shall be tribulation after, though none such.</p>

                           <p>OVr hope and trust is, that the greatest persecution of the Church of God is ouerpast: because the kingdome or rather tyrannie of Antichrist beginneth to decay, and wee trust, shall more and more bee shaken, till it come to vtter ruine.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. The Scripture telleth vs, that hard vpon the end of the worlde there shall bee great securitie, men shall say, Peace peace vnto themselues, 1. <hi>Thesal.</hi> 5.4. They shall eate and drinke, marrie and bee married, as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah, Matth.</hi> 24.38. And therefore <hi>Luke</hi> saith, 21.34. Take heede you be not ouercome of surfeiting and drunkennes, least this day come vpon you vnawares, For as a snare shall it come, &amp;c. All this proueth, that there shall be rather generall securitie, as in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> then generall tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And there is greater danger of surfeiting &amp; wantonnes in time of prosperitie and abundance, then in the dayes of persecution.</p>
                           <p>Also the text is plaine, speaking of warres, troubles and persecutions, but the end shall not be yet, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.7. Wherefore it appeareth, that the troubles and persecutions of the Church, shall be well slaked toward the end of the world.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 2. Antichrist, though he shall not vtterly bee extinguished before the comming of Christ, yet shall be deadly wounded: and hee shall begin to be iudged euen in this world, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 16.6. God shal giue them blood to drink, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17.16. The ten hornes, that is the kinges of the earth, shall hate the whore and eate her flesh.

                        <p>Ans. 1. TRue it is, that the Saints shal iudge the world, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.2. But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christ shall giue sentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and is properly and onelie the iudge of the world: for the father hath committed al iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Sonne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.22. If all, then there is no part left for any other. The Apostles therefore and Saints are said to iudge, as Christ saith of his word, that hee will not iudge the vnbeleeuers, but his word shall iudge them in the last day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.48. That is, shall bee a witnesse against them, accuse them, lay in matter of iudgement against them. So the word preached by the Saints vpon earth, and practised in their liues, shall bee the condemnation of the worlde. And not onely so, but they shall bee aduanced to greater honor: They shall sit in thrones and seates: that is, they shall not stand amongst the wicked to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue sentence, but shall meete Christ in the ayre, and bee caught vp in the cloudes, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17. Yea, they shall in the sight and beholding of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into the kingdome of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.28. But in any other sence they cannot be iudges of the world: for shall we thinke, that Christ in that day shall neede vnder officers and iudges, as <hi>Moses</hi> did? <hi>Exod.</hi>

                        <p>Ans. FIrst, by that similitude Christ onely sheweth the suddennes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: therefore it must be prest no further, then to that purpose for the which it serueth. Secondly, our Sauiour saith plainely, that the kingdome of God commeth not with obseruation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20. either of time, or place: And therfore, when men say vnto vs, Behold here, or beholde there, we ought not to beleeue them, vers. 23. As though they would point out Christs comming with the finger, either in the East or West. Whereas <hi>Mathew</hi> therefore nameth the East and West, in the similitude of the lightening, <hi>Luke</hi> leaueth them out, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, As the lightening shineth from one part of the Heauen to the other, 17.24.

                        <p>Ans. 1. THe signe of the Sonne of man in the Heauens, is nothing else, but his conspicuous and glorious appearing, who shall come in great glorie, as a signe in the heauens to bee seene of all the worlde. It cannot signifie any such visible signe as they imagine: for <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.27. wee reade thus: Then shall they see the Sonne of man. So then, the signe of the Sonne of man, is the Sonne himselfe in his glorious appearing. Secondly, it is great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption therefore, so boldly to affirme, that it shall be the signe of the Crosse, hauing no Scripture for it. Other signes wee finde, that Christ hath appeared
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:20636:320"/>
with, as the signe of the rayne-bowe, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 10.1. with a two edged sworde, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1.16. with a booke in his hand, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 10.2. We haue better reason, that Christ may appeare with those signes, by the which he hath sometime she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed himselfe, then they haue for the signe of the Crosse.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 It is more like, that Christ at his comming should shew the markes and prints of the nailes and speare in his bodie, then the signe of the Crosse: for those were felt and seene in his bodie after his resurrection, so was not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it is a loose coniecture, and a vaine surmise, without any ground of Scripture, that the woundes are either now in heauen to be seene in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bodie of Christ, or that they shall bee beheld and looked vpon in the daie of iudgement. The wicked in deed shall behold him, whom they pearced: but it followeth not thereupon that he should appeare as pearced. How is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that either the bodie of Christ being perfectly glorified, should still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any spots or blemishes, or that they could be espyed in so glorious a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which with the brightnes thereof shall obscure the Sunne?</p>

                           <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth this iudgement: <hi>Sic voluit resurgere Christus, sic voluit quibusdam dubitantibus exhibere in illa carne cicatrices vulneris vt sanaret vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus incredulitatis.</hi> So it pleased Christ to arise, and to shew in his flesh vnto some that doubted, the skarres of his woundes, to heale and take awaie the wound of their incredulitie or vnbeleefe. This then being the onelie cause, why Christ would at that time haue the printes and markes in his flesh to bee seene, namelie to confirme the faith of them which doubted: the cause being now ceased, for is it to bee thought that there are any doubtfull persons in heauen, which may be confirmed by beholding Christs woundes, or shall vnbeleeuers finde any reliefe in the day of iudgement? The cause being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, wee haue no warrant to thinke, that there are any such skarres, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now to bee seene in the glorious bodie of Christ, or which shall appeare in the day of iudgement. And seeing there is no ground for this opinion, the shewing forth also of the signe of the crosse in that day, is also but a wandring and a foolish conceite.</p>
