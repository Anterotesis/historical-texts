            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hich words are part of an eminent Parable ſpoken by the King of the Jews in his Triumphant Proceſſion to Jeruſalem, which had rais'd great hopes in the Diſciples, and others his Countrymen who accompanied Him in that Glorious March,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53976:3"/>
that the Kingdom of God, which they had ſo long expected, and ſo earneſtly deſired, ſhould now appear, that the Kingdom ſhould even now <hi>be reſtored unto Iſrael,</hi> i. e. in their carnal conceits, that He would now in a moſt ſolemn manner proclaim Himſelf a Mighty Monarch, make Jeruſalem the Chief Seat of his Empire, promote them to the Higheſt Places of Truſt and Dignity, and that they ſhould enjoy all the meaſures of Softneſs, Eaſe, and Plenty under his moſt Peacefull, Proſperous and laſting Reign. To correct the Vanity of this fancy, in his more immediate Approach to this Famous Metropolis, He tells them of a certain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, <hi>i. e.</hi> One born Heir to a Crown, who went into a far Country to take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a Kingdom, of his returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his Countrymen in an Eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the mean time of his commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Care a certain Fund of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which they were to imploy in the way of Merchandiſe, that ſo He might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an improvement, and they a ſuitable Reward. The far Country ſpoken of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confuted their Error in thinking Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhould be the Chief Seat of his Empire, and by making his ſervants Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Merchants in his abſence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring an improvement at his Return, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53976:3"/>
had little reaſon to dream that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould priviledge Sloth and Idleneſs, or ſecure the injoyment of carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text give the reaſon why He went into a far Country; becauſe his Citizens hated Him, and manifeſted their Hatred in that Sullen undutifull Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which they ſent after, ſaying, <hi>We will not have this man to Reign over us. Stat pro ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione voluntas.</hi> Which well enough became the mouths of ſuch Turbulent, Rebellious Citizens as the Jews were in General, but is yet better ſuited to the rude humour, and ungovern'd Zeal of the Phariſees in Particular, who towards the latter end of the Jewiſh ſtate, and at the time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Appearance upon Earth, had work'd themſelves into the Management of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs both Sacred and Civil: nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſs'd, but was directed by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, nothing of weight but was influenc'd by their aſſiſtance: and what truſty Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they were appeared by their involving their miſerable Citizens into the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Calamities which ever befell a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſince the Creation.</p>
            <p>The Jews were always a moody head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong People, impatient of any kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Theocracy</hi> it ſelf could not pleaſe

them; for they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> who had wrought ſuch wonders for them in the land of Egypt, led them through the Red Sea, as upon dry ground, and fed them with food from Heaven in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. They made not ſuitable returns to <hi>Joſhua</hi> for conducting them into the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Land: they were prone upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to impeach their Judges. The Votes and Decrees of the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo dutifully receiv'd: at length having forc't God by their importunities to give them a King after the manner of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they ſoon repented their Choice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grew weary of Him, before He was well ſetled in his Throne, or had exercis'd any remarkable Juriſdiction over them. For their frequent Murmurings, Tumults and Rebellions God often puniſh'd them with Wars, Peſtilence and Famine; with in-bred Diſtempers and Forein Captivity. At the time of the Meſſia's appearance theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Citizens had forfeited all their ancient Charters, all the Priviledges they could challenge in the Right of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Faithfull, and were become Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Inſidel <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Meſſias appears as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done before in this great juncture of Hardſhips. They adhere to their Oppreſſors, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53976:4"/>
reject their Saviour; by libelling his Government in General, by throwing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon his Perſon in Particular, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son?</hi> by traducing his Life and Converſation, making Him a Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners; by making baſe Reflections upon his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Chief Miniſters; by undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Doctrines, as inconſiſtent with the Pomp and Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; by making him an Innovator, a Diſturber of the Eſtabliſh'd Religion; and laſtly (as the height of their Malice) by Proclaiming Him a Traitor and Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as having ſiniſter Ends to ſet up a fifth Monarchy, in Oppoſition to the fourth.</p>
            <p>But when our Saviour by his Exemplary Life, Peaceable Doctrines, and Mighty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles had overcome all theſe Falſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Accuſations: When by his willing ſubmiſſion to Authority, the painfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of the Croſs, his patient Comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under them, and the terrible Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which accompanied his giving up the Ghoſt, He had convinc'd the Centurion and others that He was a <hi>juſt man</hi> and no other than the <hi>Son of God.</hi> When their ſealing the ſtone and ſetting a Watch could no longer detain Him in the Grave; when their Sham-Plot in giving out <hi>that his Diſciples came by</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53976:5"/>
               <hi>night, and ſtole Him away whilſt they ſlept,</hi> could no longer obſcure the Glories of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; in ſhort when in the grief and anguiſh of their tormented Souls, they perceiv'd that He was gone into his far Country, there to be Inveſted with Majeſty and Dominion far above all Principalities and Powers, then to let the world ſee, that Citizens will be Citizens, Jews Jews, and Phariſees Phariſees ſtill, when all their Pretences were baffled, and they reduc'd to the laſt Effort of obſtinate Rebels, to own Rebellion for Rebellions ſake, then they Magiſteriouſly reſolve themſelves into the Sovereignty of their own Wills, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt all Government in a direct <hi>Nolumus Hunc, We will not have this man to Reign over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was it then in their choice whether He ſhould Reign over them, or not? Infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Rebels! thus to oppoſe their own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Wills againſt the Councels and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Heaven, where it ſtood Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Books of Eternity, <hi>that his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be an everlaſting Scepter, and his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion endure throughout all Generations.</hi> This mad Decree then could only ſhew the folly and impiety of theſe Rebellious Citizens: for the King whom they rejected did Reign over them. 1. In his Mercies, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53976:5"/>
of 3000 of them at one Sermon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peters</hi> their Prime Apoſtle, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Teacher. 2. In Judgement, at his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Advent, but firſt Eminent judicial Return, after his Glorious Inſtalment in his far Country; in the Deſtruction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, when theſe Rebellious Citizens, or their Deſcendents ſuffered all the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of temporal Calamities. 3. He ſhall Reign over them at his third and laſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Advent, when He ſhall come with all the Solemnities of Majeſty to judge the world, pronounce Sentence upon theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Citizens, and make them the Vaſſals of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Vengeance, the certain Doom of all unrepenting Rebels.</p>
            <p>From this ſhort Illuſtration of the Text I hope it appears how well it ſuits with the Buſineſs of the Day, a Day of Publick Thankſgiving for the Deliverance of his Majeſty, his Royal Brother, and the whole Government from the Helliſh Conſpiracy of Fanatical Republican Rage.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore, 1. Shew the Hatred of theſe Citizens to Monarchical Government in General.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inſiſt on the ſeveral ways they purſued in the carrying on this damnable Conſpiracy in Particular.</p>

            <p>Firſt, The Hatred of theſe Citizens to Monarchical Government in General. You have been already told that the Jews were always a Rebellious Generation, but never ſo bad, as when the Phariſees had got ſo much the aſcendent over them. I am ſorry to tell you that the frequent Tumults and Inſurrections which have infeſted the Reigns of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, gave occaſion to that Sarcaſtical ſaying; <hi>Rex Angliae, Rex Diabolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>um;</hi> but you may tell your ſelves that theſe Devils never acted more like Devils, than ſince they were poſſeſs'd and guided by the Turbulent Spirit of our Modern Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees the Presbyterians; who are the very Citizens that from their firſt Inſtitution have ſhewn their Hatred againſt Monarchs and Monarchy. And they muſt be content, which perhaps they Glory in, to bear a Principal part in moſt of the unnatural Wars and Commotions, which have happen'd in Chriſtendom, ſince they took upon them to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53976:6"/>
carry on their Bleſſed Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The reſt of the Schiſmaticks are but their Spawn, and conſequently included in this Denomination, though like a <hi>Cadmean</hi> Progeny, they have always fought againſt one another. And to the eternal honour of Presbytery be it ſpoken, that <hi>John Calvin</hi> confirm'd his Diſcipline the ſame year, that <hi>Ignatius Loyala</hi> the firſt Founder of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> was choſen their firſt General in a ſolemn manner; and that as He founded his Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in Treaſon and Rebellion, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens having prepar'd his way by expelling from <hi>Geneva</hi> their Lawfull Prince and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which violent Act was encourag'd, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and confirm'd by <hi>Calvin;</hi> ſo has it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince been carried on by Schiſm and Sedition. Never was it receiv'd into any Church, but it preſently diſſolv'd the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Unity of Faith, and broke the Bond of Peace; never into any State which it did not embroyl and throw into very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Convulſions; never into any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which it did not divide, and ſet at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance; never did it get poſſeſſion of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man, whom it did not ſtrangely tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with Pride and Moroſeneſs, made him unfit for civil Society and common converſation. Are not the Writings of the Leaders in this Schiſm, not only ſtuff't

Eſtates in Chriſtendom, where it got foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with Rebellion, Civil War and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from its firſt Riſe at <hi>Geneva,</hi> to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move into <hi>France,</hi> from thence into the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, from thence into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from <hi>Scotland</hi> to its unfortunate Arrival into this Iſland.

               <hi>Heylin</hi> and others who have writ the Hiſtories of Presbytery and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi> I ſhall only at preſent lay to their Charge all the Bloud that was ſhed, all the violence that was acted, during our late unnatural Wars: that they were the Dethroners and Murtherers of their Glorious Sovereign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloak of Juſtice, and Mock-formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Law. A Villany of ſo deep a Dy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Roman Conclave bluſhes at it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was never debated and reſolved, but in the Deep Infernal Councels of a Presbyterian Conſiſtory: and is there not at this day great reaſon to charge them home with this Maſterpiece of all Iniquity, ſince they have taken ſuch great Advantage of the late Popiſh Plot, that the guilty Papiſts had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt made them innocent? and there have not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53976:8"/>
been wanting ſome Church-Trimmers, ſtill retaining a fellow-feeling for the Cauſe, who from the Pulpit have endeavour'd to clear them, and lay the Guilt of that Horrid Murther chiefly upon the Popiſh Prieſts; though they cannot find the name of one Papiſt in the whole Liſt of true-Proteſtant Regicides. But ſuppoſing the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> did invent and direct in the Tiring Room, what they acted on the open Stage: This will be ſo far from excuſing, that it adds to their Crime, and makes them paſs for what they would be loth to be thought, fools as well as ſomething elſe. For no man dares ſay a Presbyterian is the leſs dangerous for being influenc'd and guided by <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Councels. May we not now expoſe their Bloudy and Treaſonable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices to the world, ſince almoſt five and thirty years have expired, ſince the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of that execrable Parricide, and they have not yet Repented? Since almoſt four and twenty years have run out, ſince His Majeſties Happy Reſtauration, whom theſe abandon'd Citizens forc't into a far Country, not to receive a Kingdom, but to be expos'd to all the Hardſhips and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of Exile and Baniſhment, and they have not yet Repented? Since all this time they have owed their Lives, too plentifull
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53976:9"/>
Fortunes, and dangerous Liberty to a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Act of Oblivion at firſt, and repeated Acts of Indulgence ſince, and they have not yet Repented? Since all along His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtics Mercifull, Peacefull and Godlike Reign, theſe Ungratefull Vipers have been warm'd with the Sunſhine of his Favours, ſome of them received into places of Truſt and Dignity, and they have not yet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented? An Obſtinacy and Ingratitude not to be met with, but in an apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel who cannot, and a Presbyterian who will not Repent. Laſtly ſince they were even now Acting the ſame dire part over again, and we are (God be Praiſed) in the very Act of offering up our moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Praiſes and unfeigned Thanks to God Almighty for the Deliverance of His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, His Deareſt Brother, and the whole Government, from the Helliſh Conſpiracy of theſe Sons of Perdition: which brings me in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place to conſider the ſeveral ways they tryed to carry on this Devilliſh Conſpiracy in particular.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then, as His Majeſty obſerves in His Declaration, this Malevolent Party for ſeveral years laſt paſt made it their buſineſs to promote Sedition by falſe News, Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pamphlets, and other wicked Arts, whereby they endeavour'd not only to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53976:9"/>
His Government odious, His moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subjects ſuſpected to the people, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to excite a diſlike and hatred of His Royal Perſon. And this is the common Engine, which they have always plaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government. They have always had <hi>Martin-mar-prelats</hi> and <hi>Marvels</hi> to ſanctify Lies, Scurrility and Railing to the ſervice of <hi>the good old Cauſe.</hi> But of late we have been infeſted with ſwarms of Peſtilent Libels, which like Locuſts overſpread the land, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd the minds of the people, devoured all the little remains of Duty, Allegiance, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and common Honeſty; which ſwell'd their Breaſts with Diſcontents, Jealouſies, Revenge and Cruelties, and fitted them for the moſt Deſperate and Barbarous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They took the Advantage of a Popiſh Plot, and made an Army of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, with black Bills in their hands, as formidable as if <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf had been at the Gates. However pernicious that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was in it ſelf, it was by them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into more fatal Conſequences, and they ſoon made no other uſe of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, but as of a ſtale to carry on a Fanatical Conſpiracy. For theſe Maſters in the Trade were not now to learn what has been long ſince obſerv'd, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53976:10"/>
never ſuffered, no great Stateſman has ever been diſgrac't, nor the Church of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf (nay the Liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) ever wounded, but a dreadfull Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of Popery has ſtill preceded. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Hin<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> illae Lacrymae.</hi> For this Popiſh Plot, though from its firſt Diſcovery proſecuted with a very ſevere and rigorous Juſtice, was nevertheleſs under pretence of a partial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution thrown upon the King, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, all faithfull Miniſters of State, Judges of the Land, and Loyal Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nay at length the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was brought into the Conſpiracy for its own Diſſolution: in ſhort, no man could ſhew his fidelity to the Monarchy, by oppoſing their antimonarchical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but He was preſently blaſted with the odious Title of a Court or Church-Papiſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By this means they ſecured to themſelves Factious Elections for ſucceeding Parliaments; and none were now thought ſo fit to be entruſted with our Liberties and Properties, as either Old Commonwealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had formerly been the ſhamefull Betrayers of both, or elſe ſuch as by their untoward carriage in later Seſſions, had manifeſted their Diſcontents and Hatred to the Government. The unwarrantable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53976:10"/>
and Seditious Votes of the late Commons are well enough known to you all, yet you muſt give me leave upon this Occaſion to bring ſome of them to your Memories. And I ſhall begin with their pragmatical intermedling with the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a thing too Sacred to be touch'd by their unhallowed hands, their Sawcy, iterated preſſing it upon His Majeſty, after He had ſo often declared it was a point which in His Royal Judgement, ſo nearly concerned Him in Honour, Juſtice and Conſcience, that He could never conſent to it. And great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was there for His making that Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince 'twas always ſuſpicious, but is now manifeſt that the Diſinheriſon of His Royal Highneſs was carried on with that Violence, to facilitate the Dethroning of the King. To ſay nothing to the rude form obſerv'd in the penning of this Bill, that 'twas drawn up by a Perſon ſince accuſed of High Treaſon; to paſs by the Ingratitude of the Contrivers, againſt a Prince of ſuch Eminent Virtues; who has ventur'd His Royal Bloud as frankly for the good of His Country, as the meaneſt Subject in it, and who was even then Actually manifeſting His unalterable Loyalty and Affection to His Sovereign in reducing <hi>Scotland</hi> to their Obedience; and we have at this hour great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53976:11"/>
reaſon to be thankfull to Him for His Wiſe and Proſperous Conduct in that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; take the Villany of this whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure from this one inſtance; the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt arguments which I have hitherto met with, for the Excluding a Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor on the account of his Religion, are ſtolen out of <hi>Doleman</hi> the <hi>Jeſuis,</hi> which Book was written deſignedly to hinder King <hi>James</hi> a Proteſtant Succeſſor's coming to the Crown. <hi>Flectere ſi neque<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt ſuperos.</hi> And I do here publickly declare, what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways my judgement, that I do believe no humane Acts or Power in the world can <hi>de jure</hi> hinder the Deſcent of the Crown upon the next Heir of the Bloud, which is his unalterable Right by Religion, Law, Hiſtory and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Next call to your minds their ſtrange Illegal Votes. That if the King ſhould come to any violent Death, they would Revenge it to the utmoſt on the Papiſts. Whereby they both prompted any bold Enthuſiaſtick <hi>Hone</hi> to commit the Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parricide, and irritated the Rabble to the Maſſacre of innocent Perſons. That whoſoever ſhould lend the King any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon the ſeveral Branches of His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, ſhould be adjudg'd to hinder the ſitting of Parliaments, and be reſponſible
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53976:11"/>
for it in Parliament; whereby they not only took away all hopes of neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, tyed up, as much as in them lay, the hands of all Loyal Subjects, but moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as His Majeſty complains, would have reduced Him to a more helpleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, than the meaneſt of His Subjects. Their reſolving that the Proſecution of Diſſenters upon Penal Laws was grievous to the Subject, an encouragement to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom, whereby they aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Power of ſuſpending Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, of Licencing Riotous and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Conventicles, and added ſtrength and boldneſs to the Leaders of the Faction. If any Loyal Member, though never ſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for his Talent in ſpeaking, and other Abilities, ſtood up in the Defence of his King or Country, He was either rudely hiſſ't at, or run down with a Train of clamorous Speeches. How that they would have made uſe of an Impeachment to have reſcued a Profeſſ't Papiſt, and a notorious Traytor from Puniſhment. How impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately they Addreſſ't His Majeſty for Pardons and Penſions for a pack of Proſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Villains, whom they kept in pay to accuſe any man that ſtood in the way to their wicked Deſigns. How they Voted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53976:12"/>
ſeveral Eminent Perſons Enemies to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without Proceſs of Law, hearing their Defence, or any Proof, ſo much as offered againſt them. Laſtly, How that at the ſame time when they amuſed the People with Jealouſies, and apprehenſions of Tyranny and Oppreſſion, they aſſumed to themſelves an unpreſidented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arbitrary Power of taking into Cuſtody their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects, for Matters no way Relating to Priviledges of Parliament. How they had an Intercourſe with Traytors, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency with the common Agitator for the Conſpiracy. A Villain who declares King-killing a Glorious Act, hopes to ſee Regicides Rewarded by Parliaments, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues Erected to their Memories, and they ſtyled <hi>Liberatores Patriae, i. e.</hi> in the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Modern Stile <hi>Saviours of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And all this time we muſt be born in hand, and accurs'd for Tories and Papiſts if we will not believe them to be true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, the only Aſſertors of our Religion, Liberties and Properties, that they alone provided for the Safety of His Majeſties Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon, and the Dignities of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Theſe audacious Proceedings having forc't His Majeſty to an Interval of Parliaments, They obſtruct the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53976:12"/>
Courſe and Methods of Juſtice, by pack't <hi>Ignoramus Juries,</hi> whereby Faction and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon became ſecure and frontleſs, being now above the reach of the Laws, an Impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was Proclaim'd to the greateſt State-Malefactors, the Principal Conſpirator was Reſcued out of the Hands of Juſtice, and Triumphant Medals diſpers'd for his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: ſuch a bare-fac't Affront to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as can ſcarce be Parallel'd. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this Matchleſs Violation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Notorious known Diſſenters are brought to the Communion and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate them for Places of Truſt, and take Oaths to Conform to the Government which they intend to Deſtroy, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Perjured in the very Act of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And for this they have the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> that an Oath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth not in the ſenſe of the Impoſer, but the Taker. A more ſure and Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of Ruining our Church and State, than the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> with all his Equivocations, and Diſpenſations hath hitherto Attempted. For it is now no longer an open Enemy, but a Familiar Friend that hath done us this Diſhonour.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By their Republican Clubs, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous Rambles, and Deſcents into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53976:13"/>
Parts of the Nation to number the People, and try the ſtrength of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whilſt their Chief, like another <hi>Abſolon,</hi> takes his Glorious Progreſſes, addreſſeth to the Populace, and receives their Careſſes, inſinuates himſelf into the Minds of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and alienates their Affections yet farther from their Obedience to their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, By Bandying themſelves into an Accurſed Aſſociation, which was neither better, nor worſe, for worſe it could not be, than a tranſcript of the old <hi>Scotch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as that was of the <hi>Holy League of France,</hi> which laid three Kingdoms in Bloud, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the King, and diſſolv'd the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. Theſe were the Principal Methods which they purſued in the carrying on their Trayterous Purpoſes; but theſe failing, and their Villanies rendring them every day more and more odious in the ſight of all good Men, and the Unanimous Addreſſes of all Loyal Subjects from all Parts of the Kingdom, Proclaiming a Deteſtation and Abhorrence of their wicked Proceedings, and giving the greateſt aſſurances of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Affection to the King and the Eſtabliſh't Government, by a free and Generous Proffer of their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the Defence of Both, they became
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53976:13"/>
deſperate, and reſolving to truſt no longer to the ſlow Methods of Sedition, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to open force.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to my third Particular, that when theſe means fail'd, they reſolved with the deſperate Citizens in the Text, <hi>Nolumus Hunc,</hi> We will not have This King to Reign over us. And this was to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected either by raiſing an Army to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter His Guards and ſeize His Perſon, or by a Barbarous Aſſaſſination, and both theſe Deſigns were carried on by ſeveral Intereſts at the ſame time; the Particulars whereof are ſo Plainly and Methodically ſet forth in His Majeſties Declaration, which has now been twice Publickly read, that it ſuperſedes any further Relation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore very briefly conſider the Quality of this Helliſh Conſpiracy, and then ſet before your eyes that Scene of Horrour and Deſolation which had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread and blackned the Land in caſe it had taken Effect.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Quality, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ſo many Malignant Ingredients that it looks more like a Confederacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion, Morality and the common Sentiments of Humanity, than a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the Frame, Conſtitution and Adminiſtration of the Government. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53976:14"/>
Avarice, Revenge have often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch't men and led them into Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Aſſociations; but this ſeems to be the ſole Reſult of Abſtracted Malice, of men abandon'd to the Curſe of a <hi>Reprobate Mind.</hi> For what would they have enjoyed, which they had not, or what could they have deſired, which they might not have had? Was not the Chief of the Conſpiracy in the quiet Poſſeſſion of all Places of Truſt, Profit, and Honour, which could make him either Happy in himſelf, ſerviceable to the Government, or Gratefull to the People? Did not many of the Reſt owe their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Lives, and rais'd Fortunes to His Majeſties Grace and Bounty? Were not all of them even glutted with the Bleſſings of Peace, Plenty and Liberty? Here then is an unparallel'd Ingratitude againſt a Prince of the Higheſt Bounties towards them; whoſe whole Reign hath been ſo mild and mercifull, that He hath even Exceeded our Saviours Precept of Loving His Enemies, and doing good to thoſe who deſpitefully uſe Him. We want not ſome few Examples in Hiſtory of ſome Enthuſiaſtick <hi>Ravilla<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſo many Flagitious Villains to Complot the Murther of their Lawfull Prince, His Deareſt Brother, the Hopes of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, to Deſign the utter Ruine of the Loyal Intereſt, to carry this on for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, in ſo many deliberate Cabals and Conſultations, in defiance of Heaven, and ſo many Providential Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to continue all this while without any diſcompoſure of mind, or Remorſe of Conſcience, the Aſſaſſination to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd after ſuch a Barbarous Butcherly manner; this is ſuch a Villany and Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, not to be met with in the Chriſtian world, but in the more obdurate Hearts of Fanaticks, blaſted under the Curſe of an unconverted <hi>Saul,</hi> that all this time they thought they did God good ſervice; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Fanaticks whoſe Loyalty is Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, whoſe Religion is Treaſon, and whoſe very Goſpel is the Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; laſtly, but amongſt Fanaticks and Atheiſts transform'd into malicious Fiends by the Helliſh Divinity of that Monſter of a Prieſt the Author of <hi>Julian the Apoſtate,</hi> whoſe whole Book is as great an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> the Precepts of Obedience deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Chriſtianity it ſelf, as ever the Apoſtate

            <p>Secondly, Set before your eyes that Scene of Horrour and Deſolation which had overſpread the Land, in caſe this wicked Treaſon had ſucceeded. The King, His Royal Brother, the Miniſters of State, Judges and Principal Magiſtrates all ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd after a moſt inhumane, Savage man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the Government diſſolv'd, our Altars polluted, our Liberties enſlav'd, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties wreſted from us, and all things laid open to the Violence of implacable Men. And indeed who can ſay, had that Tragedy been begun, how far it would have gone, or where it would have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? For in caſe of Oppoſition it muſt have been ſeconded with ſuch a Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fire and Sword, as never before had been heard of in this Nation. Our ſtreets had been fill'd with the Cries of Widows, and the Fatherleſs, with Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Rapins, Inceſts, Adulteries, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, Maſſacres, and Conflagration. No Cruelties would have been thought Cruel enough to ſatiate the Revenge of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53976:15"/>
Rage upon I Papiſts and Tories. A ſudden Diſpatch had been the greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour we could have ask'd, or receiv'd from the hand of ſo baſe and mercileſs an Enemy. For what ſatisfaction would it have been to any Loyal Subject to have ſurviv'd the ruines of the Church and State, to have lived in a Land polluted and ſtain'd with Royal and Noble Bloud, to have had daily before his eyes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spectacle of his enſlav'd undone Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to have liv'd in perpetual fears of being made a Sacrifice himſelf. But it pleaſed that God who allotteth to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts and Rebels a portion with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, to Reſcue His Majeſty from the Paws of theſe Bloudy Miſcreants, and to lay both Parties of the Conſpiracy under the ſame Fate and Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to my fourth and laſt obſervation, the Folly and Impiety of Treaſonable Attempts. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their <hi>Nolumus,</hi> He whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Slaughter do's and ſhall Reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
            <p>That good Kings ſhould be the more immediate Care of God, ſeems agreeable to the Oeconomy of His Providence, and is confirm'd by Examples in all Ages. For They are His anointed, His Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53976:16"/>
ſet over us by His Appointment, and in theirs is involv'd the Fate of particular men. And therefore their publick Sacred Character entitles them to a ſpecial Right in the Divine Providence. Of this truth, our Gracious King has been a very rare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample through the whole Courſe of His Life; never did any Righteous King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more ſtrange and miraculous Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, nor He himſelf ever a Greater, than this laſt, when Mercy was turn'd into Judgement, and the Dreadfull Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> became to Him a Tower of Salvation. Which conſideration alone was enough to have deterr'd any, but ſuch bold Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> who were not afraid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fighters againſt God, from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the Life of a Prince, who had been hitherto ſo wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>But He ſhall Reign over them, Firſt in Judgement; in a legal Execution of thoſe Bloudy Conſpirators who would have murthered Him. They muſt ſuffer, or He cannot be ſafe: Mercy would here prove Cruelty, Pardon an affront to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the higheſt Ingratitude to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They are now under the command of thoſe Laws which they would have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53976:16"/>
deſtroyed, under the hands of thoſe Judges whom they had deſtin'd to Slaughter; and every Judge muſt remember that He is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. That which ſeems truly deplorable in their Fate, is the execrable Treaſon for which they die, and the Hardneſs and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which accompanies them at their Deaths. And wo be to thoſe wretched Guides, who led them into both; thoſe Betrayers of Souls, who inſtead of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to Chriſtian Confeſſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reſignation, have caus'd them to Publiſh ſuch Juſtifications as ſeem written with Deſign to incite their Accomplices to do the Work of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy here, whilſt they are anſwering for it in the other world: this conſideration makes the Hearts of all good Chriſtians ake. For never did any Criminals ſuffer for a more Flagitious Crime, upon clearer Evidence, fuller Conviction, fairer Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, juſter Condemnation, or fall under a more mercifull Execution, one of them receiving that mitigation of his Sentence, which He had formerly denyed to be in the Power of the King to grant. And therefore we muſt believe thoſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53976:17"/>
men are given over to believe a Lye, who impudently cry up their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and boaſt their Martyrdom. This can only demonſtrate the Incorrigible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Faction, and awaken the Magiſtrate into a vigorous Execution of the Laws againſt ſuch Boldneſs, as in the very Diſcovery and Proſecution of a Fanatick Conſpiracy, dares juſtifie Treaſon and Canonize Traytors.</p>
            <p>And therefore Secondly, He ſhall Reign over them, in making a right improvement of this great Advantage which God hath put into His hands. The wonderfull Deliverances He has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready receiv'd, do plainly ſay, that He is ſtill reſerv'd for ſome extraordinary Work in the world. And from His laſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Eſcape, we may eaſily Preſage what mighty Acts He ſhall perform for theſe Kingdoms in Particular. Now ſhall it be in His Power to ſubdue that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence of Puritaniſm, which for above theſe hundred Years has raged in this Nation, to cruſh the Seeds, and deſtroy the very Principles of Schiſm. To Him it is reſerv'd to bring the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> up to thoſe Glorious Heights, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53976:17"/>
She ſhall appear the Envy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Terrour of <hi>Geneva.</hi> To ſettle the Monarchy upon ſo firm a Baſis, that it ſhall be no more ſhaken by Republican Rage. His Sacred Perſon ſhall be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lyable to Violence, nor His Subjects to Oppreſſion. No more ſhall Majeſty be affronted by the Sawcy Votes of a Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Senate, nor we made Priſoners by our Repreſentatives. But long and ſecure ſhall He Reign in the hearts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of His People, and when He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns late to Heaven, leave the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Peace, and a well Eſtabliſh't Crown to His Succeſſor; Poſterity ſhall Praiſe His Memory, and Generations to come ſhall call Him <hi>the Father of His Country,</hi> and <hi>the Mighty Defender of the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it remains that we render unto God Almighty our moſt Solemn Thanks for the Comprehenſive Mercy we this Day Celebrate, in the Deliverance of His Sacred Majeſty, and the Government from the damnable Conſpiracy of Fanatick Rage. And we muſt pray that as God in His infinite Goodneſs has hitherto diſcover'd and defeated their Helliſh Devices, ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53976:18"/>
He would every day more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their Wicked imaginations. That Juſtice may overtake thoſe Trayterous Fugitives, whom Mercy could not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim. And let us never more be ſo far tranſported with the fears of a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> as to think our ſelves ſecure from a <hi>Fanatick Conſpiracy.</hi> This one falſe ſtep had like to have led us into Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. They are both formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſince we are plac'd between two Extreams, common Prudence bids us have a watchfull Eye over both, and not to give a palpable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the One, by applying all our Force againſt the Other. At this time the Diſſenters appear to me the moſt Dangerous. For the Papiſts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively contemptible as to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, their Intereſt is broken, we have ſevere Penal Laws in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and thoſe Laws in no danger of a Repeal, ſince both their Peers and Commons are made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Sitting in Parliament. But the Diſſenters are formidable as to their numbers, they boaſt themſelves in their ſtrength, they are Reſtleſs in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and Implacable in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53976:18"/>
And it is very memorable that we ſhould on the ſame day of the Month obſerve a Day of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for the Deliverance of the Church and Defender of our Faith from a Fanatick Conſpiracy, on which the Rebellious Commons in 41 firſt publiſh't their Order in Derogation of the Common-Prayer Book, and for the ſuſpenſion of the Laws Eccleſiaſtical, of which Violation our late Martyred Sovereign of ever Bleſſed Memory ſo often and ſenſibly complains in His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Aug. 12. 42. <hi>Wonderful art thou in thy ways O God!</hi> and <hi>thy Paths are paſt finding out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word then, as we are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for the Preſervation of His Majeſty hitherto, ſo let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore His Protection over Him for the time to come, that He may daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive freſh Acceſſions of ſtrength and Splendour, and be recompenc'd <hi>for the times, wherein He hath ſuffered Adverſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And let us evermore pay to ſo Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a King, and ſo much Beloved, of our utmoſt Expreſſions of Duty, Love and Obedience. Let us Eſteem
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53976:19"/>
and Honour Him as the Gift of God, and receive Him as a new Preſent from Heaven.</p>
