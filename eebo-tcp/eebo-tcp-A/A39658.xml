            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF I find it an hard Task to write on such a doleful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it cannot be imagined but your part must be abundantly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb facs="tcp:38287:3"/>
who feel over and over what is here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Could I tell how to administer Counsels and Comforts to you, without exasperating your Sorrows, I would certainly take that way; but seeing the one (in this case) cannot be done without the other, 'tis our Duty to submit to the method Providence hath prescribed to us.</p>
                  <p>The design of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourse, is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the truth of what seems a very great <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> to most men, namely, that the Afflictions of the Saints can do them no hurt,
<pb facs="tcp:38287:3"/>
and that the Wisdom of Men and Angels cannot lay one circumstance of their condition (how uneasie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it seems to be) better, or more to their advantage than God hath laid it. I attempt not by a flourish of Rhetorick to perswade you against the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations you can fetch from Sense and Feeling to the contrary, but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the false Reasonings of Flesh and Sense, by the allowed Rules of Scripture and sure Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>And methinks you, and every Christian, should
<pb facs="tcp:38287:4"/>
gladly entertain that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable conclusion, when you shall find the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it as <hi>strong,</hi> as the influences thereof are <hi>sweet</hi> and comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, <hi>Madam,</hi> the intent of the Redeemer's undertaking was not to purchase for his People Riches, Ease, and Pleasures on Earth; but to mortifie their Lusts, heal their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and spiritualize their Affections, and thereby to fit them for the eternal fruition of God. Upon this supposition the truth of this conclusion (how strange soever it seems) is firmly built.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:38287:4"/>It was not without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine direction, that the subject of the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was as pertinently, as seasonably, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to me by your dear Husband, in the day of your sorrows for your only Son. He took, I hope, his Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Comfort out of it before he died, and it is now left as a Spring of Comfort to you, who then mourned with him, and now for him.</p>
                  <p>Heavy Pressures call for strong Support, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seasons for rich Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. Your Burden is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed heavy, yet I must say
<pb facs="tcp:38287:5"/>
'tis much our own fault they are so heavy as we feel them to be: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measure of our delight in, and expectation from the Creature, is our sorrow &amp; disappointment when we part from it. The highest <hi>Tydes</hi> are always followed with the lowest <hi>Ebbs.</hi> We find Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Patience knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the same <hi>Precept,</hi> and Intemperance and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience as inseparably connected in our own <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> It may be we did not suspect our selves of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinful excess in the time of their enjoyment, but it
<pb facs="tcp:38287:5"/>
now appears the Creature was gotten deeper into our hearts than we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by the pain we feel at parting: Did we not lean too hard upon it, there would not be such shakings as we feel when it is slipt from us.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> 'tis high time to recal your thoughts and bound your sorrows, which the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations would greatly assist you in.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What is the very ground and reason of our excessive sorrows for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s it not this, that they are
<pb facs="tcp:38287:6"/>
                        <hi>perishing</hi> and <hi>transitory?</hi> that is, that you find them to be as God made them. And can you expect that God should alter the Laws of Nature to please and humour us? It is as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to our Relations to die, as it is to <hi>Flowers</hi> to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the <hi>Moon</hi> to wane.</item>
                     <item>2. That there is no such necessary connection betwixt these things, and our comfort, that whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God removes the one, he must needs remove the other with it. Christ and Comfort are indeed so u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, but nothing beside him is or can be so. I
<pb facs="tcp:38287:6"/>
hope you will shortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the truth of this Conclusion, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts God will give you in the absence of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts you have lost. Can you not now have as free access to God as before? Yea, do not these very Afflictions send you often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into his presence? And if God meet you in those duties (as in days of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress he uses to meet his People) then it will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to you that your Joy and Comfort lives, though your Husband and Children be laid in their Graves.</item>

                  <p>THese are part of <hi>David</hi>'s last words. The last words of dying <hi>Saints,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of dying <hi>Prophets,</hi> are pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38287:10"/>
memorable, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily remarkable; and such are these acknowledged to be, by all Expositors: 'tis a golden Sentence, a divine Oracle, fit to be the last words of every dying Saint, as well as of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are called his <hi>last words,</hi> not simply, and absolutely, as though he breathed them forth with his last breath; (for he spake many things afterwards) but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are the last he spake as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> by divine inspiration, or because he had them often in his mouth, to his last and dying day.

                  <p>The whole Chapter is design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a <hi>Coronis</hi> or honourable Close of the Life of <hi>David,</hi> and gives us an account both of the worthy Expressions that dropt from him, and of the renowned

Worthies that were employed by him: but all the heroick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements recorded to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Memories, in the following part of the Chapter, are trivial and inglorious things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this one divine Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence recorded in my Text; in which we have two things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Preface, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding solemn.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the Preface, we have both the instrumental and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal efficient Cause of this divine Sentence, distinctly set down, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and the Efficient, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>The Instrument or Organ of its conveyance to us, was <hi>David</hi>; described by his Descent or Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <hi>the Son of Iesse</hi>; by his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Station, <hi>the man that was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up on high,</hi> even to the top and culminating point of Civil and

Spiritual Dignity and Honour, both as a <hi>King,</hi> and as a <hi>Prophet</hi>; by his <hi>Divine Unction, The anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the God of Iacob</hi>; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the flowing sweetness of his Spirit, and stile in the divine Psalms that were penned by him, whence he here gets the Title of <hi>The sweet Psalmist of Israel, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant one in the Psalms of Israel,</hi> as some read it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>principal efficient Cause</hi> of this excellent passage, is here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise noted, and all to commend it the more to our special obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and acceptance:<note place="margin">w. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</hi> This stamps my Text expresly with divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The Spirit of God spake by <hi>David</hi>; he was not the <hi>Author,</hi> but only the <hi>Scribe</hi> of it. Thus the ensuing Discourse is prefaced. Let us next see,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Matter or Speech it self, wherein we shall find the Maxims, and general <hi>Rules</hi> of Government prescribed, and the <hi>Felicity</hi> of such a Government e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38287:11"/>
described.<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>He that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</hi> Princes being in Gods place, must exalt the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men; and when they do so, they shall be as the Light of the Morning when the Sun riseth, even a morning without Clouds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What Halycon days shall that happy People see, whose Lot is cast into such times and places! All this is typically spoken of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and those pious Princes who succeeded him; but mystically and eminently points at Christ, who was to rise out of <hi>David</hi>'s Seed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. and to sit upon his Throne, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. So that in this he was raised on high, to an Eminency of Glory and Dignity indeed; He was so in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary natural Seed; a Royal Race, deriving it self from him, and sitting upon his Throne in a Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Succession, till the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, which was about four hundred and thirty years. And after that, the <hi>Iews</hi> had Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38287:12"/>
of his Line, at least right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heirs to that Crown, till the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> came. But that which was the top of <hi>David</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the most sparkling Jewel in his Crown, was this, that the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> was to descend from him, according to the Flesh, in whom all the glorious Characters, before given, should not only be exactly answered, but abudantly exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And thus you find the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Line of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is drawn down by <hi>Matthew,</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary, Matth.</hi> 1. and his Legal Line by <hi>Luke,</hi> from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> his supposed Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.23.</p>
                  <p>Now though the illustrious Marks and Characters of such a righteous, serene, and happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, did not fully agree to his day, nor would do so in the Reigns of his ordinary natural Successors, his day was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many Clouds both of Sin and Trouble; yet such a blessed day he foresaw and rejoyced in, when Christ, the extraordinary Seed of

                     <hi>David,</hi> should arise and set up his Kingdom in the World, and with the expectation hereof, he greatly chears and encourages himself: <hi>Although my house be not so with God, yet hath be made with me an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>This Covenant was, without controversie, a Gospel-Covenant. It was <hi>David</hi>'s Gospel: for all his salvation and all his desire were in it; which could never be, except Christ had been in it, who is the salvation of all the ends of the Earth, and the desire of all Nations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, it was a more obscure and imperfect Edition of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Faith,</hi> yet clearer than those that were made before it; it came not up to the fulness and clearness of the discoveries made by <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> but yet in this Covenant with <hi>David,</hi> God revealed more of Christ, than had been ever revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the Light of Christ, like that of the Morning, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed still more and more, till it came to a perfect day. It is worthy our observation, how
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38287:14"/>
God made a gradual discovery of Christ, from <hi>Adam,</hi> down along to New Testament-times. It was reveal'd to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he should be the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> but not of what Nation, till <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time; nor of what <hi>Tribe,</hi> till <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>; nor of what <hi>Sex</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> till <hi>David</hi>; nor that he should be born of a Virgin, till <hi>Isaiah</hi>; nor in what <hi>Town,</hi> till <hi>Micah.</hi> The first Revelation of this Covenant with <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.12, 13, 14.</note> was by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet; afterwards enlarged and confirmed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.

He spake of his <hi>Person, Psal.</hi> 45.6.11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6. of his Offices, both <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, Psal.</hi> 40.8, 9, 10. <hi>Priestly, Psal.</hi> 110.4. and <hi>Kingly, Psal.</hi> 2.6. of his Incarnation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.5. of his Death on the Cross, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.16, 17. of his Burial, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.8, 9, 10.

                        <p n="1">1. Internally, by the Spirit of Grace dwelling and acting in them, this is a choice priviledge to them in the day of affliction: for hereby they are instructed and taught the meaning of the Rod. Psal. 94.12. <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, and teachest him out of thy law.</hi> O 'tis a blessed thing to be taught so many Lessons by the Rod, as the Spirit teacheth them!

is all the fruit to take away sin.</hi> Now if a man be instructed in the ends and designs of the Rod, refreshed and comforted under every stripe of the Rod, and have his sins mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and purged by the sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit upon his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; then both the burthensom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and bitterness of his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are removed and healed by the internal presence of the Spirit of God with his afflicted ones. But,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Besides this, God is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially present with his People, in all their troubles, in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal way; ordering all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of their troubles to their advantage. He orders the degree and extent of our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, still leaving us some mercies and comforts to support and refresh us, when others are cut off. In measure doth he debate with his Covenant People,<note place="margin">Isai. 27.8.</note> staying the rough wind in the day of the East wind. He might justly smite all our outward <hi>Comforts</hi> at once, so that Affliction should not rise up

the second time: for what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort soever hath been abused by sin, is thereby forfeited into the hand of Judgment. But the Lord knows our inability to sustain such strokes, and therefore proportions them to our strength. We have some living Relations to minister comfort to us, when mourning over our dead: He makes not a full end of all at once. Yea, and his Providence supports our frail Bodies, enabling them to endure the shocks and storms of so many Afflictions, without ruine. Surely there is as much of the care of Providence manifested in this, as there is in preserving poor crazy leaking Barks, and weather-beaten Vessels at Sea, when the Waves not only cover them, but break into them, and they are ready to founder in the midst of them.</p>
                        <p>O what a singular mercy is the gracious presence of God with men! even the special presence of that God,<note place="margin">Eph. 4 6.</note>

If it had been all this rebellion and rage against God, all this apostacy and revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more, all this contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and hardness of heart under the Rod; then it had been a weighty and stumbling Objection indeed: but to say, If God be with us, why are all these chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrections and temporal cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses befallen us? why doth he smite
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38287:38"/>
our Bodies, Children, or Estates? is an Objection no way fit to be urged by any that are acquainted with the Scriptures, or the nature and tenour of the Covenant of Grace. Is afflicting and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, all one with you? must God needs hate, because he scourgeth you?

                        <p>No, no, Christian, 'tis not a chastening Rod, but the denying of such a favour, and suffering men to sin with impunity, and go on prosperously in the way of their own hearts, that speaks a rejected man, as the next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms you.

And they have other things which are Accidentals, that come and go, live and die, without affecting or altering their Happiness; such are Health, Estates, Children, and all sorts of Relations and earthly Comforts. These are to our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, as Leaves are to the Tree which fade and fall away without endangering the Tree; but the other as the vital Sap, without which it withers and dies at the very root. Now if it can be made out that the Covenant fully se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the former; then it will strongly follow, that it therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly relieves us under all our

                           <hi>I will remember their sins no more.</hi> Yea, Heaven, together with our perseverance in the way to it, are both put out of hazard by that invaluable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>They shall never perish,</hi>

                        <p>Thus are all the Essentials of a Believers Happiness secured in the Covenant; and these being safe, the loss of other enjoyments should not much affect or wound them, because if he enjoy them, they add nothing to his Happiness;

and if he lose them, he is still hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in God without them. And this unriddles that AEnigmatical Expression of the Apostle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.10.</note>

                        <p>If a man travelling on the Rode fall into the hands of Thieves who rob him of a few shillings, why this doth not much affect him: for though he have lost his spending Money, yet his stock is safe at home, and his Estate se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, which will yield him more. Or if a man have been at Court, and there obtain'd a Pardon for his Life, or a Grant of a Thousand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and returning home should chance to lose his Gloves or his Handkerchief, sure if the man be in his wits, he will not take on or mourn for the loss of these Trifles, whilst the Pardon or Grant is safe. Surely these things are not worth the mentioning.</p>

                           <pb n="64" facs="tcp:38287:41"/>'Tis true, the loss of outward earthly things, are to a Believer real <hi>Tryals,</hi> yet they are but seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Losses: and therefore they are expressed in the Apostles phrase with a <hi>Tanquam,</hi>

                        <p>Indeed, if the stroke of God were at our Souls, to cut them off from Christ and Heaven, to raze our Names out of the Covenant, or revoke the pardon of sin; then we had cause enough to justifie the extremity of sorrow; cause enough to weep out our eyes, and break our hearts for such a dismal blow as that would be.

<list>
                           <item>1. The unchangeable purpose of God, which is a sure and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast foundation. 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, the foundation of God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> The first act of Gods love to the creature is that by which he chuseth such a one to be his, and is therefore called the foundation of God, as being that on which he lays the super-structure
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38287:47"/>
of all other Mercies. And this stand sure, there can be no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillancy or slipperiness in such a foundation: for he knows who are his; he knows them as his Creatures, and as his new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Covenant with him; as his by Election, and his by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Transaction and Compact. The purpose of his Grace before time, gave being to the Covenant of Grace in time, and is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it.</item>
                           <item>2. The Free Grace of God in Christ, is that which gives immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability to this Covenant. It is not built upon Works, but Grace: <hi>Therefore it is of faith,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Rom. 4.16.</note> 
                              <hi>that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed.</hi> This Covenant is not founded as the first was, upon the variable and inconstant obedience of man, but upon Grace which is a steady and firm foundation.</item>
                           <item>3. The suretiship of Christ gives everlasting stability to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Heb. 7.22. <hi>He was made the surety of a better Testament,</hi> or

                     <p>It follows strongly from what hath been said, that the vertue of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38287:48"/>
the Covenant decays not by time, as other things do, but it is at this day, and will be to the end of the World, as potent and efficacious a Relief to all Gods People, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was to <hi>David,</hi> or any of the Believers of the first Ages.</p>
                     <p>And if so, certainly nothing can be more strongly supporting, or sweetly relieving in such a change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able World, than this he hath made with me, an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. What <hi>David</hi> speaks of the natural Heavens, will be found true, of things over-spread and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by them.<note place="margin">Psal. 102.26, 27.</note>

only all Power, Vertue, and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in it self to relieve a distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christian, but it hath it in all Ages, as well for one as for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The third and last follows, namely,</p>

                     <p>That it is a <hi>sure Covenant.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> stiles it in my Text. The certainty of the Covenant, is the glory of the Covenant, and the comfort of all that are in it. The certainty of it in it self is past all doubt, by what hath been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It is certain God did make such an everlasting Covenant with his People in Christ, and it must remain an eternal Truth, that such a Covenant there is betwixt God and them. It is as impossible that this everlasting Covenant should not be made with them, as it is impossible for God to lye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. If he might make himself not have covenanted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly with them, when once
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38287:49"/>
he had so covenanted, such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position would turn up the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Faith and Certainty, and overthrow the Apostles conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence on which the Faith and Comfort of Believers is built. Nor is it any infringement of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, to say, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self cannot do that which implies a plain contradiction, as <hi>factum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum reddere,</hi> to make that which was done, not to be done.</p>
                     <p>But of this there is no doubt; it is a sure Covenant in it self: That which makes to my purpose here, is to prove it capable of a personal security and certainty to us. <hi>David</hi> had, and all the Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, as well as he, may have a subjective or personal certainty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. He speaks categorically and positively in the Text, <hi>Yet hath he made [with me] an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> If it be said, he might have a personal certainty of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was revealed to him in an extraordinary way by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.12, 13, 14. and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38287:49"/>
                        <hi>extraordinaria non currunt in exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum,</hi> this was a peculiar favour, which we may not expect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I reply, And why may not we know it with as full a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to whom God is pleased to make it known in his ordinary way? Think you his Word and Spirit cannot ratifie it as fully and firmly to our souls, as <hi>Nathan</hi>'s discovery of it did to <hi>David</hi>'s soul? God give me but such a Seal of it in his ordinary method and way of confirmation, and I will desire no more of him in this World for my relief and comfort, whatever Afflictions it shall please him to lay upon me.</p>
                     <p>And thus you see all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a compleat Remedy in the Covenant, and of it every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may say, <hi>This is all my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all my desire, though he make not my house to grow.</hi> And now what hinders, but that all Gods afflicted should say from henceforth,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.7.</note>

of my heart in the Covenant of God, though he take away the desire of mine eyes upon earth with his stroke. In this Covenant my soul is at rest, and my very heart is centred. No Affliction can be great enough to make the Consolations of the Almighty seem small in mine eyes.

                     <p>I know many Christians droop and are dejected under the Rod, notwithstanding such soveraign Cordials are prepared for them in the Covenant; but this is not for want of Efficacy in the Covenant, but for want of Faith to clear their interest, and draw forth the vertue of it to their relief. Some are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their priviledges, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers disfident about their interest.

                        <p>By what hath been discoursed from this Text, it appears, <hi>That God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the spiritual part of the World by Faith, and not by Sense.

                           <pb n="84" facs="tcp:38287:51"/>God never intended temporal things for his Peoples Portion, therefore from them they must not expect their relief in times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He will have us read his love to us by things within us, not by things without us. He hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways of expressing his love to his People, than by the smiles of his Providence upon them. How would earthly things be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-valued and idolized, if beside their conveniency to our Bodies, they should be the marks and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of Gods love to our souls! A Christian is to value himself as the <hi>Merchant,</hi> or the <hi>Husbandman</hi> doth. The <hi>Merchant</hi> values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by his Bills and Goods abroad, not by the ready Cash that lies by him. And the <hi>Husbandman</hi> by his Deeds and Leases, and so many Acres of Corn he hath in the ground, and knows he hath a good Estate, though sometimes he be not able to command twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Christian, thy Estate also lies in good Promises and new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-securities, whether thou

hast more or less of earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in thy hands.</p>

One cannot live upon what the other doth. So it is here: A Christian can feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Promises, and make a sweet meal upon the Covenant, which the carnal mind cannot relish. <hi>The life that I now live, I live by the faith of the son of God,</hi>

All Creature-comforts have a double defect, they are neither suitable nor durable; but the word is so. Compare the Arguments that have been urged from the Covenant, with such as these.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what dry and ineffectual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are these! they penetrate not the heart, as pardon of sin, peace with God, and sanctification of troubles to our salvation do.</p>

                           <pb n="88" facs="tcp:38287:53"/>And no less is the Mercy of an able New Testament Ministry, to open, apply, and inculcate the consolations of the Scriptures to be esteemed.

                        <p>I can find no such settlement made of the Gospel and Ministry upon any place or People, but that God may remove both, upon their abuse of them; and if he do, sad will the case of such a People be, especially when a day of distress and trouble shall be upon them. 'Tis sad to be in a storm at Sea, without a <hi>Compass</hi> or <hi>Pilot</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and advise the distressed Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers.

that whatever changes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be upon the World, you may have the light and comfort of the Scriptures to direct and chear your souls.

in the Covenant of God, you have the less reason to insist upon that afflicting circumstance of an immature death. He that dies in Christ, hath lived long enough both for himself and us. That <hi>Marriner</hi> hath sailed long enough, that hath gained his Port: and that Souldier fought long enough, that hath won the Victory: and that Child lived long enough, that hath won Heaven, how early so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he died.</p>
                     <p>Beside, the sooner he died, the less sin he hath committed, and the less misery he saw and felt in this wretched World, which we are left to behold and feel. And it is but a vanity to imagine that the parting pull with him would have been easier, if the enjoyment of him had been longer: for the long enjoyment of desirable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, doth not use to weaken, but abundantly to strengthen and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the tyes of affection.</p>

The
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38287:59"/>
soul that freely and deliberately consents to take or chuse the Lord to be his God, may warrantably conclude the Lord hath taken or chosen him: for our choice of God is but the result of his choice of us. Joh. 15.16. <hi>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you; (i. e.)</hi> you could never have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen me, but in consequence to, and by vertue of my first choice of you.</p>
                     <p>Well then, let it be seriously considered, whether you have due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consented to take the Lord for your God, and Christ for your Redeemer. This includes two things in it.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Your relinquishing of all things inconsistent with him.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. Your relinquishing of all things that are inconsistent with an interest in him. Except we let these go, God cannot be our God,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38287:60"/>
nor Christ our Redeemer. The things to be relinquished for Christ are in short, both our <hi>sinful</hi> and our <hi>righteous self.</hi> Sinful-self must be disclaimed and renounced: for we cannot be the Servants of sin, and the Servants of Christ too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.18. and righteous self must be renounced also, or we can have no part or interest in his Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. These are two difficult points of self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to part with every beloved Lust, and to give up our own Righteousness. Thousands chufe rather to be damned for ever, than to do either of these.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Your acceptance and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of all things that promote his glory, and further the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. As all the painful ways of duty, hearing, praying, meditating, and all this with the intention of the inner man, and offering up of the soul to God in these duties, and the more painful ways of suffering for God, and enduring all losses, reproaches, torments, and death for him, if
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:38287:60"/>
his glory require it, and you be thereunto called. All this is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in your chusing God to be your God. And upon our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and free consent, and sealing to these Articles, we have right to call him our God. Mat. 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.</hi> Now have you considered the terms of the Covenant, weighed and balanced all the conveniencies and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of Godliness, and then determined for Christ and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, let the cost be what it will; then you have chosen him aright for your God. Many think they have chosen God for their God, that never understood or delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these terms. But <hi>Non consentit, qui non sentit:</hi> He that neither knows nor ponders them, is not capable of giving a due consent.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may discern our Covenant-Interest, in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Impressions that are made upon our souls. All Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant People have a double mark

Upon their Minds, in a more spiritual and efficacious knowledge of God: Jer. 31.33. <hi>They shall all know me, from the greatest of them, even to the least of them.</hi> This knowledge is said to be <hi>given,</hi> not acquired by the meer strength of natural Abilities and humane Aids; and <hi>given us in the face of Christ,</hi> not by the foot-steps of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only, as he speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. 'tis the choice teaching of the anointing, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge springing from inward expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and spiritual sense; as we know the sweetness of Honey by tasting, better than by all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and reports that can be made of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Upon their Hearts, in that gracious tenderness and meltings of it for sin, or the discoveries of Free Grace in the pardon of it.

So you read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is as easie to melt the obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Rocks into sweet Syrup, as it is to melt the natural heart into a penitential and tender melting for sin; but now there is a principle or habit of tenderness implanted in the soul, whereby it is disposed and inclined to relent and thaw ingenuously upon any just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Covenant-Interest may be evidenced in and by our Covenant-<hi>Conversations.</hi> All the knowledge which is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our Minds, and all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness given to our Hearts, do respect and tend to this: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes.</hi> Habits and Principles are for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice: Grace in the heart is for Obedience and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:38287:62"/>It is true, that as our Graces are imperfect, so is our Obedience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. Perfect working is not to be expected from imperfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God's own Covenanted People do often grieve him, and provoke him to bring them under the Rod of Affliction; but those their Infirmities break not the Bond of the Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32. Care and Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness ordinarily goes before them, Conflicts and Resistance accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them, and Shame, Grief, and renewed Care usually follows them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. By these things (which deserve a more copious discourse than my present design can allow) we may be helped to clear our interest in the Covenant of Grace: and that being done, it should be out of the power of all the Afflictions in the World to sink your Spirits.

                  <p>But yet good <hi>Iosiah</hi> had his mistakes and failings. The best of men are but men at best<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was too rash and hasty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, and too stiff and obstinate when resolved; and this was the occasion of his ruine. The case was thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pharoah Necho</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was at that time making War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Charchemish,</hi> a place that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, but was taken from him by the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> so the War of <hi>Necho</hi> was a just War; and <hi>Iudah</hi> lying between him and <hi>Charchemish,</hi> and being at peace with <hi>Iudah,</hi> he requests leave of <hi>Iosiah</hi> to march his Army peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably through his Country to the seat of the War: <hi>Iosiah</hi> takes an Alarm from this Message, and arms against him. Hereupon <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> send Embassadours to <hi>Iosiah,</hi> chap. 35. ver. 21. <hi>saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah?

I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make hast: forbear thee from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Expositors conceive <hi>Necho</hi> had this discovery of the mind of God, from the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>

No doubt the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> their Abettors, and Associates, secretly rejoyced at his fall; but all good

men mourned. But among all the Mourners, one only is specified by name, and that is <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the Prophet, in whom all the faithful Ministers of God were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. To them he was a true and faithful Friend; and in him they lost a Father, and a famous Instrument of Reformation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider it <hi>Intensively,</hi> as to the degree of the sorrow, it was a bitter Lamentation: so pungent, intense, and deep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Iews</hi> for Christ, at the time of their conversion to him, is compared to this Mourning for <hi>Iosiah.

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:38287:71"/>3. Lastly, Consider it <hi>Protensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in its continuance and durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was <hi>made an Ordinance in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>; and accordingly <hi>the singing-men and singing-women spake of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah in their lamentations to this day: i. e.</hi> Whenever any solemn Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or publick Calamity was solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd in <hi>Israel,</hi> those persons that were skilful in Lamentations, brought in the story of <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s death, as the burthen of that dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Song or Funeral-Elegy.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Let us consider the Cause and Ground of this Lamentation, which certainly was great and weighty enough to justifie that sorrow, as great and bitter as it was: for in him they lost a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, publick, useful, zealous, and tender-hearted Instrument, whose Life had been eminently useful to the Church of God, and whose Death opened the gap to all the following Calamities upon <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now considering <hi>Iosiah,</hi> here especially in his religious capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as so faithful, industrious, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38287:71"/>
useful an Instrument for the Church of God, rather than in his political capacity as a King, the Note from it will be this.</p>

                     <p>When <hi>Iacob</hi> was buried, a man famous for Religion, a great and sore lamentation was made for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And when <hi>Aaron</hi> died, all the House of <hi>Israel</hi> mourned for him 30 years, <hi>Num.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 29. When <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto-Martyr died, devout men carried him to his Grave with great lamentations, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.2. and indeed for any good man to be laid in his Grave, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lamentation, is lamentable. The living Saints have ever paid this respect and honour to dead Saints, as men sensible of their worth, and how great a loss the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38287:72"/>
World sustains by their removal.</p>
                     <p>I know the departed souls of Saints have no concernment in these things, yet respect is due to their very Bodies, as the Temples wherein God hath been served and honoured, as they are related to Christ who will one day put great glory and honour upon them.</p>
                     <p>In the Explication and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this point, I will shew you,

1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.13, 14. Religion differences the sorrows, as well as the joys, of its Professors, from the common joys and sorrows of the World. Dead Saints are better where they are, than where they were; to be with Christ is far better; Death to them is gain and infinite advantage, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21.23. This World is the worst place that ever God designed his People to live in: for if a state of perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Purity, be better than a state of Temptation and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if a state of Rest and Peace, be better than a state of Labour and Sorrow; if it be better to be triumphing above, than sighing and groaning beneath: then it's better for departed Christians to be where they are, than where they were. And could they now communicate their minds to us by words, as they lately did, they would say to us as Christ said, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.28. <hi>Daughter of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, weep not for us, but weep for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Positively,</hi> But the true grounds and causes of our Lamentations, are upon divers other weighty accounts: as,</p>

                        <hi>First,</hi> Because so much of the Spirit of God as dwelt in them when amongst us, is now recall'd and gather'd up from this lower World. Those precious Graces which they exercised among us, in Prayer, Conference, and other beneficial Duties, are now gone with them to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The Church had the benefit of them during their abode with men, but now no more, except only what the remembrance of their holy Words and instructive Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (whereby they still speak to us, though dead) may afford unto us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:38287:73"/>There are choice effusions of the Spirit at the time of our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, of which the Church reapeth the benefit whilst we live; but all these are recall'd at our dissolution, and thenceforth we can be no farther useful in this lower World: for as the Soul is the subject in which these preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Graces inhere, so they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and go along with the Soul into glory.</p>
                     <p>Now as it is a real loss to a <hi>Company</hi> when any <hi>Merchant</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws a great Stock, he had run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Trade, out of the Bank; so certainly it is a great loss to the Church of God, when the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gifts and graces of the Spirit, dwelling in the Saints, are drawn out by Death; so as the Church can have no farther benefit by them, their Prayers for us, and with us, are now ended; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> knoweth us not, and <hi>Israel</hi> is ignorant of us.</p>
                     <p>

                        </note> The death of the Saints deserves a bitter lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:38287:74"/>
because thereby a breach is made, a gap opened, to let in the Judgments of God upon the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that is left. It is said of <hi>Moses,</hi> Psal. 106.23. <hi>Therefore he said, that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, lest he should destroy them.</hi> A Metaphor from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged City, when a breach is made in the Walls, and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ready to enter; but some <hi>Champion</hi> stands in the breach to defend the City. Such a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion was <hi>Moses,</hi> who by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and fervent Prayers, put a stop to the inundation of God's Judgments against <hi>Israel.</hi> And such another was <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19.22. whose Prayers for that wicked place he lived in, bound up the hand of Judgment insomuch as the Lord told him, <hi>I can do nothing till thou art gone.</hi> But when the Lord by death removes such men, he thereby <hi>makes a way to his anger,</hi> as the expression is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.50. Hence the death of eminent Saints, especially when
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38287:74"/>
many are taken away at or near the same time, hath been ever look'd upon as a direful <hi>Omen,</hi> and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Presage of ensuing Judgments, and that not without good Scripture-authority, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous perish, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Methusalah,</hi> whose very Name signified <hi>a Flood cometh,</hi> died the year before the Flood. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi> a little before the sacking of <hi>Hyppo.

when the godly are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of them: for as wicked men are the spots and blemishes, so good men are the beauty and ornaments of their Country.

How desolate and dismal doth a Family look (whatever other Ornaments be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it) when the Religious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of it is gone!

Of how great use in a Country may one zealous publick-spirited man be? Hundreds may
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:38287:75"/>
have cause to bless God for such a man. It was the <hi>Apostles</hi> desire to the <hi>Thessalonians, To pray that the word of the Lord may have its free course, that it might run and be glorified,</hi> 2 Thess. 3.1. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of such a person as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally took care for the souls of those that were about him, to provide food for them, is no small loss, nor lightly to be passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

                        </note> The consideration of the time in which good men die, aggravates the loss, and justly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the sorrow of them that remain, and that upon a threefold account. (1.) That it falls out in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining state of Religion, when the Spirit and power of Godliness is so much weakned and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished. This is like the loss of good Bloud in a consumptive Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which must bring it very low. (2.) That it falls out also in a time when the numbers of the Godly are so much thinn'd and lessen'd, not when the Churches Children
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38287:76"/>
say in her Ears, The place is too straight, give place that we may dwell; but when they are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where lamenting, the paucity and scarcity of good men, as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth, for the righteous fail from among the children of men.</hi> At a time when they are bewailing themselves in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Prophet, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.1. <hi>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered the summer-fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desired the first ripe fruit.</hi> Alluding to a hungry man that goes into a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to refresh his spirits with the fruit thereof; but alas, there is not one pleasant bunch to be found, none but sower Grapes, to increase his Hunger, and set his Teeth on edge. (3.) And that which much more aggravates the loss, is this: when it falls in a time wherein the spring and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of good men is obstructed. In this case Death, like a storm of Wind, overturns the fairest,

                        </note> There is just cause to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the removal of publick and pious men, when we consider what influence our sins and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations have had upon those Judgments and Calamities; our unworthiness of them, unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for them, and non improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such mercies, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved us of them. I look upon every good man, as a good Book, lent by its Owner to another to read and transcribe the excellent Notions and golden Passages that are in it, for his own benefit, that they may remain with him, when the Owner shall call for the Book again: but in case this excellent Book be thrown into a corner, and no use made of it, it justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Owner to take it away in displeasure.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38287:77"/>
of good men are restrained, and upon what accounts and reasons they are due debt to the death of eminent and useful Instruments for God. What remains, is the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of this point. And,</p>

                        <hi>First,</hi> The Point before us justly reproves three sorts of men.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The worst of men, such as secretly rejoyce, and are inwardly glad at the removal of such men; they took no delight in them while they lived, and are glad they are rid of them when they are dead. Those that persecuted and hated them when alive, may be presumed to be pleased and gratified with their death. But alas, poor Creatures, they know not what they do! The innocent preserve the Island. <hi>Except the Lord of hosts</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>had left us a small remnant, we had been as Sodom, we had been like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gomorrah,</hi> Isai. 1.9. It's a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb among the very Jews, <hi>Sinè Supplicationibus non staret Mundus:</hi> The World stands by the Prayers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:38287:77"/>
of the godly. Let the World think what they will of them, I tell you these men are a Screen, a Partition-wall, betwixt them and destruction.</item>
                        <item>2. It reproves the insensibleness of good men, who are apt too slightly to pass over such tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous stroaks of God: for this it was that God reproved his own People, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57.1. <hi>No man layeth it to heart.</hi> Where the want of <hi>affection</hi> is charged upon the want of <hi>consideration,</hi> none considering their worth, their use, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of their fall. Such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of God do certainly call for a deeper sence and sorrow, than is found in most men.</item>
                        <item>3. It reproves the very best of men, who though they do bewail and lament the loss of such men, yet they do not lament it in the due manner. They lament it one to another, saying, Alas, alas, such a Worthy is fallen, such an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Instrument in the Church or State is dead; but they do not lament it in Prayer to the Lord,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38287:78"/>
they mourn not over the matter to him, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth.</hi> Help, Lord, the remnant that is left; help, Lord, to repair the breach made by their death; let the God of the Spirits of all flesh raise up a Man to fill the room and supply the want. Alas, how insignificant are the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of most men upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count!</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>

                        </note>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This point invites us all this day to bewail the stroak of God that is upon us. I could wish that he that looks upon this Text, and then upon the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of this Assembly, might be able to discern the agreeableness of the one to the other, in such a sad and solemn occasion.</p>
                     <p>O let all that love <hi>Sion,</hi> lament this day the fall of one of her true Friends and Lovers. I know Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Panegyricks</hi> are apt to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected of flattery; but as I want a Rhetorical Tongue for such a work, so if I had it, it should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38287:78"/>
be saleable for so base a use and purpose. I am sure by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generality that die to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, many are confirmed in the way to Hell. Nor can I but think of that serious Line in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, What a poor comfort is it, to be praised where a man is not, and to be tormented where he is. But yet the righteous shall be had in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting remembrance,</hi> Psal. 112.6. Expect nothing from me on this occasion, but what may be spoken with greatest assurance of truth, and that intended for the benefit and imitation of all that hear it. Some may think it a strain too high, to compare a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with such a glorious King as <hi>Iosiah</hi> was; but if Christ compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and preferr'd the very Grass of the Field, to <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory, I know no reason why we may not compare and parallel the precious Graces of a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with a royal Saint, especially since the comparison is only made in the <hi>religious,</hi> not in the <hi>civil</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:38287:79"/>I am sure the Graces and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Performances of <hi>David, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iosiah,</hi> with all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignified Saints, were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and propounded as Patterns for our imitation; and no doubt but private Christians may mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by their Pattern. Beside, it is abundantly more safe to relate the Vertues of the Saints when they are dead, than whilst they were alive: for now there is no danger of provoking pride and vain-glory in them that are prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but much hope of provoking an holy emulation and imitation in them that hear them.</p>
                     <p>Well then, <hi>Absit invidia verbis:</hi> Suffer me this day to erect a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to perpetuate the Memory of this deceased Worthy, to pay the tribute of my Tears due to that mournful <hi>Hearse,</hi> and to engage you to imitate those Excellencies of his, which I shall with equal truth and modesty display this day, that we also may be duly affected with the Rebuke of God upon us, and mourn over it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:38287:79"/>If when an eminent <hi>Commander</hi> in any Army falls, the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is affected and concerned with his death;

                        </q>
Let it not be thought much, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should express their sense and sorrow in sighs and tears, for so useful and worthy a man as God hath this day removed from among us, whose Character I shall give you in the following immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That worthy man whose fall we lament this day, was sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with Religion in his Youth, by God's blessing upon his pious Education; in this he had the advantage of <hi>Iosiah.</hi> His Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors were men of Piety, and himself a Child of many Prayers: and, as <hi>Monica</hi> said of her Son <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> it was not likely that a Child of so many Prayers should perish.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38287:80"/>
How importunately did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest the fervent Prayers of their pious Friends for him, in the time of his Education? nor was it in vain, for they were manifestly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in him. He soon disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that <hi>Probity</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> in his Youth, which justly raised great expectations from him in his riper years.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nor did he frustrate those hopes; for as soon as ever God had fixed him in a proper <hi>Sphere</hi> of Activity, (I mean, a Family of his own) those Graces that were in him shone forth, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and benefit of all that were about him. <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s pious resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was his; <hi>As for me, I and my house will serve the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He kept up the Worship of God in his Closet, as well as in his Family. And truly if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion languish in the Closet, it will quickly die in the Family. His House was a <hi>Temple</hi> consecrated to God; there the Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening-Sacrifices of Prayers and Praises were offered up. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38287:80"/>
his Children and Servants to those Duties, not reckoning that time lost to him, which was spent for God. The Lord had endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with an excellent Spirit of Prayer himself: I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accidentally heard him pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Family, with such soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Judgment, pertinency of Expression, and holy warmth of Affection, that hath at once edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, refreshed, and reproved me in hearing him.</p>
                     <p>He constantly read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in course before Prayer, and oft-times with a <hi>Commentary</hi> upon them, for his own and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies Edification.</p>
                     <p>The Lords day he sanctified not only in more publick attendance on the Ordinances, but in the Duties of Reading, Repeating, Singing, and Catechising all his Children and Servants about him. And all this before he allowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or them any bodily Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lest the edge of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections should be blunted in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the clogging of Nature with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38287:81"/>
Creature-repasts. And thus did he, as <hi>Iob,</hi> continually: to this course he was severe and constant, no incident occasions, how great or many soever, could divert him from it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Neither was his holy Zeal and Christian care limited and circumscribed within his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but was extended to the Souls of all in his Neighbourhood, who desired helps and means in the way of salvation.</p>
                     <p>His House was seldom without a godly Minister in it, and loath he was to eat his pleasant Morsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:38287:81"/>4. When God called him to publick Employments in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, he neither purchased nor abused that Trust; but with a true English, rather a Christian zeal and courage, he dedicated himself to the service of God and his Country. Chearfully quitting all domestick concerns, spent his Estate, time, and pains, to heal the breaches of <hi>England.</hi> I know not a man whose zeal for the common good, would have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him nearer to the Example of that noble <hi>Roman,</hi> who when a <hi>Chasm</hi> was made by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the <hi>Oracle</hi> had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it could never be closed, except something of value was thrown into it, cast in himself to close it.</p>
                     <p>I could truly have said, had there been conveniency and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for it, when he was laid in his Grave, <hi>Here lies a man that never betrayed nor deserted the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for any private interest of his own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:38287:82"/>5. He was a man that came as near <hi>Iosiah</hi> in tenderness of heart, as ever I had the happiness to be acquainted with. The Churches troubles were his troubles, they all met in him as lines in a centre; he even lived and died with the interest of Religion: and of him I will say, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> said of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Phil. 20.21. <hi>I have no man like minded who will naturally care for your state, for all seek their own, not the things which are Iesus Christ's. Naturally,</hi> in this place, is not opposed to <hi>Spiritually,</hi> but to <hi>Artificially.</hi> Many can artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially act the part of a Zealot, when their own interest lies in it; but he <hi>naturally,</hi> and therefore freely, cheerfully, and constantly.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But though these Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were in him, he had his <hi>Naevi,</hi> blemishes, and imperfections. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> was a man of like passions and weaknesses of Spirit. All these I doubt not but God hath covered, and he is now perfectly freed from them all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:38287:82"/>There is now no passion left within him to be stirred by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, no despondencies and sinkings of Spirit under dismal as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of Providence. His Graces are perfected, and his Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons finally eradicated.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. To conclude, he was a man of great <hi>Afflictions,</hi> as well as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Affections.</hi> And as the Lord greatly honoured him in the course of <hi>active obedience,</hi> so he greatly proved and tryed him in a course of <hi>passive obedience.</hi> He not only gave the <hi>Cross</hi> in his <hi>Coat,</hi> but bear it upon his <hi>Shoulders:</hi> for besides those troubles which were proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>sympathetical,</hi> he had his <hi>Idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical</hi> sufferings also, and that both from the hands of men, and from the hand of God. His Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made and marked him for an Object of Persecution; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers shot at him, and sorely grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him; he and his Family were hunted with a Net; the Lord lay it not to their charge: <hi>Et hinc illae lachrymae.</hi> The sad effects thereof, I chose rather at this time
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38287:83"/>
to pass over with a sigh, than in this place to commemorate.</p>
                     <p>And as the hand of man was upon him, so the hand of his God also. First, lopping off all the pleasant Branches that sprang from him, and that one after another; when come to the endearing age, opening and disclosing the Bud: And as the Complement and Issue of all, breaking his constitutional strength with a long languishing Disease, which at last extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this bright Lamp, and hath left his Family and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in darkness and sorrow. His poor Heart was the <hi>Anvil</hi> on which many <hi>Hammers</hi> of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been a long time beating; and no wonder it appeared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed and tumified, when it was inspected, having endured so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny successive stroaks of sorrow.</p>
                     <p>And now what the Lord spake of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.16. is fulfilled upon this worthy person, <hi>The Lord called thy name a green Olive-tree, fair and of goodly fruit, with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:38287:83"/>
fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        </note> I shall wind up the whole in several seasonable and necessary Counsels: Some more general, others more particular, and some most particularly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Counsel to all in general, to awaken themselves, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a due sense of such sore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of God as this is. When <hi>Saul</hi> fell, <hi>David lamented it, saying, The beauty of Israel was slain on thy high places.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God hath this day stript off an Ornament from this Country. Such Dispensations of Providence speak indignation coming on. It requires almost an Age to breed and furnish a man with due qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for the service of the Church and Common-wealth. <hi>England</hi> doth not so abound with pious, zealous, and faithful Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen at this time, but that it may sensibly feel the loss of such a man.</p>

                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:38287:84"/>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> More particularly, let the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ lament his fall, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> did the fall of <hi>Iosiah</hi> in the Text. He was a true Friend to Christ's faithful Ministers, and had them in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for their work sake. 'Tis true, he hath no more need of us, he is now wiser than his Teachers; but we greatly need him, and men of his Spirit, in such a dull degenerate Age as we live in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And most particularly, I shall apply and close all with a few words of Counsel to the dear and now <hi>desolate Relict</hi> of this Worthy Person, whose sad lot it is this day to over-live the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and comforts she once enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him.</p>
                     <p>Madam, God hath this day co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you with Sables, written bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things against you, broken you with breach upon breach. Your sorrows need not be excited, but regulated. 'Tis my trouble, that I cannot discharge my duty to the memory of your dear Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38287:84"/>
without exasperating your Griefs, which alas were too acute before; but Rods have their voices: <hi>Blessed is the man whom God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth and teacheth him out of his Law.</hi> Hear you the Rod, and who hath appointed it; and oh that your Soul may this day take in these necessary Counsels and Cautions, without which your Afflictions cannot be sanctified to the advantage of your Soul. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Learn from hence the vanity of the Creature, the emptiness and nothingness of the best things here below. How hath God made your best comforts on Earth to shrink up and vanish into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? How do our fancies var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and guild over these empty Bubbles? What great expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are we apt to raise from them? How apt to fall asleep in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms or laps of earthly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? and say with <hi>Iob, I shall die in my nest, and multiply my days as the sand.</hi> When loe, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the projects and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:38287:85"/>
of many years are over-turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Oh what a difference will you find betwixt hope founded in Christ, Comforts drawn out of the Promises, and the flattering Comforts and vain hopes founded in the Creature whose breath is in its Nostrils?</p>
                     <p>'Tis time for you and for us all to wean off from this vain World; mortifie our Fancies and Affections to it, and place them where they shall not be capable of disappointment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Guard carefully, I beseech you, against those Temptations which probably may accompany this Affliction. It may be Satan will suggest to your heart, what he once put into their lips. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>What profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and walked mournfully before him?</hi> Where is the fruit of Prayer? What good have I seen of Fasting? What hath Religion availed? Do not prayerless and ungodly Families thrive and prosper? Beware of this. <hi>Madam,</hi> I doubt not but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38287:85"/>
you will acknowledge there have been sins and provocations within your walls, yea within your heart, for which God may as justly and severely judge your house as he did <hi>Ely</hi>'s. Remember the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Religion are not in this World; and should we speak thus, we shall offend against the generation of his Children. All we must expect from Religion, is to save our souls by it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Call not the love of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to question to your self, or yours, because of these severe stroaks of God upon you and them: You know <hi>Iosiah</hi> was dear to God, yet he died in the prime of his days, by a violent hand, remote from his own home, and was brought home in the <hi>second Chariot</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a Spectacle of far greater sorrow, than your dear Husband was; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all these sad circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his death, the Promise of his God was punctually performed to him, that he should die in peace, and not behold the Evil that was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:38287:86"/>
to come. <hi>There is a vanity,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, which is done upon the earth, that there be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked: again, there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Eccles. 8.14. But then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is but in the Earth; here, or no-where, God must chastize his Children.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. See that you maintain that holy course of Religious Exercises in your Family, and in your Closet, wherein he walked so exemplarily before you. Let Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion live, though he be dead; and convince the World, I pray you, that it was Gods influence, and not your Husbands only, which was the Spring and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this holy Course.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Strive not with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, nor fret against the Lord, under this irksome and painful Dispensation. Remember there is a <hi>Woe</hi> hanging over this sin: Isai. 45.9, 10. <hi>Woe to him that striveth with his Maker.</hi> There is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:38287:86"/>
a twofold striving of men with God, one lawful and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when we strive with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knee of importunity in Prayer, thus <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestled with God and prevailed, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.4. the other is highly sinful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, when we presume to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or accuse any of his works as defective in wisdom or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He that reproveth God, let him answer it, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> at his peril be it. This sinful striving with God is twofold, either <hi>Vocal</hi> or <hi>Mental.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Vocal,</hi> when men in bold blasphemous language, arraign the Wisdom, Power, Goodness, or Faithfulness of the Lord at the bar of their own Reason, and there condemn them, setting their mouths against the Heavens, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.8, 9. this is the sin of the wicked, yea of the first-born sons of wickedness.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Mental,</hi> in inward frets, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs, repinings against God; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.3. <hi>The foolishness of man perverts his way, and his heart fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

against the Lord.</hi> The heart may cry out impatiently against God, when the tongue is silent: And if the frets and murmurs of the heart be (as indeed they are) interpretatively no better than a striving with our Maker, then this sin will be found more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among good men in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxisms</hi> of Affliction, than we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> When forgetting God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, and the desert of our Iniquities, we arrogantly censure his effecting, or permitting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, as if they had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducency
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:38287:89"/>
to his own glory, or our good. This is both sinful and dangerous: for,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This is a proud exalting of our own Reason and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, above the infinite Wisdom of God. God hath made our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son a Judge and <hi>Arbitor</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within its own <hi>Sphere</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>; but when it comes to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon God to its Bar, and article against Heaven, it is an insuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arrogancy, and we do it at our own peril. God will have all men know that he is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable being, <hi>Iob</hi> 33.13. yea, he will have us to know, that <hi>the foolishness of God is wiser than men,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.25. that is, that those very works of God which mans proud Reason adventures to censure, as not so wise a method as their own would be, hath more wisdom in it, than all the deep-laid designes of the greatest Polititians in the World. And it is strange that men should dare to attempt such a wickedness as this, after God hath so severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

it in the fallen Angels.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is no less than a spurning at the Soveraignty of God, from whose pleasure we derive our Beings and all our Mercies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. In these quarrellings of Providence, and frets at divine appointments, we invade his Throne, and controul his soveraign Pleasure. How monstrous were it to hear a Child quarrelling with his Father, that he is not so and so figured, or the Clay to chide the <hi>Potter</hi> for moulding it as it is?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. 'Tis destructive to our own inward peace and tranquility of mind, which is part of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of this sin; and a smart stripe, a sore rebuke it is from the hand of God upon us.</p>
                        <p>Contention is uncomfortable, though but with a Neighbour, worse with a near Relation; but a quarrel with God is destructive to all comfort in the World. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may disturb a good mans peace, but a mutinous Spirit against God, destroys and stabs it at the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:38287:90"/>
very heart. What is the sin and torment of the Devils, but their rage against the Lord, and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against the methods of his Grace? <hi>He seeketh rest, but findeth none,</hi> Mat. 12.33. The peace of our Spirits is a choice Mercy, and might be maintain'd amidst all our Afflictions, were but our interest in his Promises, and the true level of his Providences clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. 'Tis irrational, and highly unjust, to give the cause, and quarrel at the <hi>effects.</hi> God hath righteously and inseparably linked <hi>penal</hi> with <hi>moral</hi> evils; sin and sorrow by the Laws of Heaven are tackt and united together; he that doth evil, shall feel evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. We adventure upon sin, and then fret at Affliction: <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.3. <hi>The foolishness of a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts his way, and his heart fretteth against the Lord.</hi> Is this becoming a reasonable Creature? Doth not every man reap as he soweth? Can the seed of sin bring forth a crop of peace and comfort?
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38287:90"/>
                           <hi>Why doth the living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins,</hi> Lam. 3.39. Search your hearts, and search your houses, and you will quickly find that all your Afflictions in this World, were they ten thousand times more and heavier than they are, do not come near to the desert of one sin. All sorrows, losses, afflictions on this side Hell are quite below the value of sin, the meritorious and provoking cause of them all.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. 'Tis foolish and vain, to strive against God, and contest perversely with him. Can our discontents relieve us? or our murmurs ease us? Will they turn God out of his way? No, no; <hi>He is in one mind, and who can turn him aside?</hi> Job 23.13. The Wheels of Providence go straight forward, and turn not when they go, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.17. We may bring them over us to crush us, by standing thus in their way, but cannot turn them out of their way.

Psal. 75.6. <hi>I said to the fools, Deal not foolishly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for promotion cometh not from the east, or the west; but God is Iudge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</hi> Let not them that are at the top of the

All our fretting and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling cannot shake off the Yoak which he hath put upon us, but a weak and quiet submission to his will, and compliance with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, is the best expedient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our freedom. There is not one circumstance of trouble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals you, without his order; nor can you expect deliverance, but by order from him.</p>

                              <hi>Study the transcendant evil of sin, and what the demerit of the least sin that ever you committed is.</hi> This will becalm your tempestuous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and at once work them into <hi>Contentation</hi> with your present state, and <hi>Admiration</hi> that it is no worse, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22.39, 40.</p>
                           <p>Consider, thou querulous and discontented Soul, that the wages of sin is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> that tribulation, anguish, and wrath, are due by Law, to every soul of man that doth evil; that so often as we have sinned, so often have we deserved Hell: and shall we then charge God with severity, for scourging us with the Rods of gentle fatherly chastizements? Is this Hell? Dare you say the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest affliction that ever was upon you, is above the demerit of your sin?</p>
                           <p>'Tis true indeed, the Lord tells <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that she had <hi>received of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38287:95"/>
his hands double for all her sins,</hi> Isai. 40.2. But that is not the language of strict Justice, but of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions rolled together. There is not a gracious soul in all the world, but will readily subscribe <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Confession, that God hath afflicted it less than its iniquities deserve, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. Oh if once we measure our afflictions by our sins, we shall admire they are so few, so mild and gentle, as they are.</p>

                              <hi>Consider what a difference there is betwixt the Saints meeting with afflictions, and their parting with them.</hi> You meet them with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and astonishment, but you shall part with them with praise and thanksgiving, blessing God for the manifold blessings they have instrumentally conveyed to your souls. It is good for me, saith <hi>David,</hi> that I have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. By these things sin is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:38287:95"/>
discovered, and mortified, the ensnaring World imbittered, and the Rest to come sweetned.</p>
                           <p>Many other excellent Rules may be added; try these, and the blessing of the Spirit accompany them.</p>
                           <p>To conclude, be not swallowed up of sorrows for what you have lost, but balance all the troubles of this life, with the hopes of the next. Your dear Children are gone, your sweet Husband is gone; but consider who took them, and whither. It is said of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Gen. 5.24. <hi>He walked with God, and was not; for God took him.</hi> Mr. <hi>Upton</hi> is not, and yet he is: He is not with men, he is with God: He ceases not to <hi>be,</hi> though he cease to <hi>breathe:</hi> He is taken away, but God took him: He is better where he is, than where he was: Though he be not in your Bosom, he is in Christ's.</p>
                           <p>Imitate his Zeal, Plain-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, diligence in Duties, and you shall shortly meet him again, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:38287:96"/>
never part any more. <hi>For this we say by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain to the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.15, 16, 17, 18.</note> 
                              <hi>For the Lord himself shall descend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive, and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</hi> Did you but know the deep <hi>Emphasis</hi> of these words, <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> I doubt not but you would find Comfort enough in them for your self, and a great overplus for the comforting of others.</p>
