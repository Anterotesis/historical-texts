            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a <hi>Confessor</hi> in the towne of the <hi>Haghe,</hi> that so they might reueale their sinnes, and from him receiue absolution. But the <hi>Priest,</hi> that was thus by them elected for their <hi>Spirituall Father,</hi> denyed absolution vnto them all.</p>
            <p>Nothing may bee said to be light or of small estimation, where matter of <hi>Religion</hi> and of Conscience is handled, but rather to bee held full of moment and consideration: especially ought those points to bee so repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which treate of remission of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions committed against the Maiestie of God, and of the meanes to receiue spirituall consolation from the most holie Sacraments of <hi>Penance</hi> and <hi>Communion.</hi> And certaine it is, that if the <hi>Confessor</hi> shall proceed vniustly by a pertinacious refusall of Absolution to him vnto whom it doth belong, he tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally vsurpes vpon the Soule, deeply offends the diuine Maiestie, abuses the spirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie committed vnto him, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerably violence the <hi>Holy Church</hi> and his <hi>Neighbour.</hi>

            <p>Touching this successe, I being to make an answere, and to shew what is consonant to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humane Reason, and conformable


<pb facs="tcp:17246:5"/>
to the sacred <hi>Theologie,</hi> and to the <hi>Canons</hi> of the holy <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> that my proceeding may bee with order and cleerenesse; I hold that the action of the <hi>Confessor</hi> in refusing absolution to his <hi>Ghostly Penitents,</hi> cannot flow but from one of these <hi>Heads,</hi> or from many of them in vnion and concurrence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <item>2 <hi>Or, from the</hi> Confessors <hi>part: for that hee had commandement, and precise instruction so to do.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 <hi>Or, in regard the matter it selfe doth so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: because it is not lawfull for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentlemen of</hi> Italy, <hi>to dwel in the</hi> Low Countries, <hi>subiect to the</hi> LL. <hi>the</hi> States of Holland, <hi>without continuance in sinne.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4 <hi>Or lastly, because that they, exercising


<pb facs="tcp:17246:6"/>
themselues in a militarie profession, doe this vnder the banner of the</hi> States <hi>of</hi> Holland <hi>against the King of</hi> Spaine, <hi>or the House of</hi> Austria. <hi>I cannot deuise any other ground that the</hi> Confessor <hi>might haue. And vpon euery of these I will very briefely frame my Discourse: to the fabricke whereof I will onely bring materials necessarie and agreeable to</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Doctrine.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the first, It is cleere amongst <hi>Diuines</hi> primarily, and then amongst <hi>Canonists</hi> and <hi>Professors of Cases of Conscience,</hi> That the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the mind, concerning humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which judgeth of them sinisterly, and is called <hi>an erronious Conscience,</hi> is ligatorie: whence it followeth, That if those <hi>Penitents</hi> haue before their <hi>Confessor</hi> made it a matter of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and haue confessed their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and seruing as souldiers, as a sinne, and cannot calme and dispossesse their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of that errour, the <hi>Confessor</hi> might and ought by the rules of Conscience, to deny them absolution: because whosoeuer actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth perseuere in his sinne, and is persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded


<pb facs="tcp:17246:6"/>
by his Conscience (albeit erronious) that hee doth sinne, and will not abstaine from it, hee may not be absolued.</p>
            <p>But this cannot be in our <hi>Case,</hi> because it is knowne expressely, that the <hi>Confessor</hi> was he who raised the scruple in his <hi>Penitents,</hi> of a matter which they neuer held to be a sinne: and it came to such termes, that hee denied them the spirituall comfort of absolution, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would promise to depart from those countries. And this is easily euicted by argument: For if it had beene a scruple of the <hi>Penitents,</hi> it is not probable, that the same should haue happened vnto them all, and after the same manner, as that all should frame and fancie to themselues an incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of absolution. And albeit all of them had fallen vpon the very same scruple, yet did the <hi>Confessor</hi> know, whether it were a scruple of reason and foundation, or whether it were deuoide both of reason and ground. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it were reasonable shall herafter be demonstrated, and proofe made, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold water. If it be without the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of reason, then was he obliged by the tyes of Conscience, to informe them, and to


<pb facs="tcp:17246:7"/>
procure them to lay aside their errour. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it likely that all of them after the same manner, and as if they had had but one braine in common amongst them, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine incapable of reason, and should bee so obstinated in an erronious conscience, that for this respect it should be thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie them after one and the same Tenor, the benefit of <hi>Confession.</hi> Moreouer, it would haue beene (as a great <hi>Doctor</hi> said, but to another purpose) an <hi>Afinine</hi> ignorance, and a <hi>Hare-like</hi> fearefulnesse, if all those Gentlemen, after that they had a long time aduised with their friends and kindred in their countrie, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themselues in warre, and had deliberatly made election of a countrie so remote, with so much perill and expence (because it is the learnedst Schoole for that kind of discipline, that at this time is in all <hi>Europe,</hi> yea in the whole world) should all of them as it were by consent, haue waited together a whole yere to raise a scruple of Conscience of that tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the rationall persuasions of their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Father</hi> should not bee able to obtaine so much vpon any one of them, as to remoue him from that fancie &amp; to re-estate &amp; place


<pb facs="tcp:17246:7"/>
him within the boundaries of reason. And hence it appeares that this Head is totally excluded.</p>
            <p>Concerning the second: It is long since that the <hi>Fauourers</hi> of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and those that are dedicated to promote the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Monarchie,</hi> did with such subtiltie, and so vniuersally vpon all aduantages serue their turne with the <hi>Pretext</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that there is nothing by them left vnattempted, where they may with the specious Mantle, and couerture of <hi>Religion</hi> (a way among men most powerfull) bring vnto their part any profit, aduance their owne interests, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage themselues in their vast pretentions. One way they haue opened, and still beat it as much as may be, and that is this: A custome hath beene introduced by a necessitie of the Common good, and by the iust and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate interest of <hi>State</hi> and good <hi>Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and by the rules of their owne peculiar preseruations, as it is by all Lawes most war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, That many both great &amp; petty <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Princes</hi> maintaine <hi>Embassadors, Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> and other their <hi>Ministers,</hi> to bee neere those <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Potentates,</hi> who, although

               <hi>Christians,</hi> yet are not in vnion with the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike Romane Sea,</hi> and doe not yeeld, no not in Spirituall matters, the obedience which it desireth. As soone as they vnderstand that an <hi>Ambassador</hi> is chosen, they presently hunt about to know what <hi>Priest</hi> hee intends to take along with him to administer the holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> vnto him in those Countries where he is to be imployed; and hauing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated what he is, they instantly assault him with powerful offers and offices of loue; with large promises and hopes, and (according the quality of the person) with threats and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conscience, with apparant arguments of the seruice of God, and of aduancement of the <hi>Catholike Religion,</hi> which is euer the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison or Centinell, to warne &amp; induce them to receiue their instructions, and to hold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with them; and they are made to promise, and to sweare too, that they will follow their directions with all care &amp; pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualitie. And as in this manner they infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attempt all, so haue they happily preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with some; in so much that <hi>Embassadours</hi> thinking to carry <hi>Priests</hi> with them, who may haue care of their Soules, and of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:8"/>
haue giuen salaries vnto persons that obserue with all exquisitenesse the interests of the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and do vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally transmit vnto those <hi>Courts,</hi> all Relations and Reports; so as in steede of attending on the Soules committed vnto their charge, they become the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pretors</hi> of other mens subiects, to the no small distast of those <hi>Princes</hi> with whom the <hi>Embassadours</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to preserue, and, for the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to augment all good correspondence. Hence spring the continuall doleances of those <hi>Princes,</hi> that, from such as these, their subiects are debauched in their Allegeance, and in their Consciences contaminated; that from hence Seditions are raised, Rebellions machinated, Conuenticles and vnlawfull Assemblies celebrated. And these <hi>Princes</hi> are powerfully persuaded, that their care for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is least in their thoughts, which meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serues them for a colour: but that their reall and true end is, to make a muster and take a suruey of all persons malecontented with their Gouernement, and of all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondents with strangers by way of clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine intelligence; and so vnder this couert


<pb facs="tcp:17246:9"/>
to designe and practise against the <hi>State.</hi> And they thinke that they haue great reason to be jealous, and to haue vehement suspition thereof; because the greatest part of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, Machinations and Rebellions, haue had their spring from the like pretexts and practises. And to this purpose doe those <hi>Princes</hi> euer record the Leagues in <hi>France,</hi> the attempts vpon the liues of so many <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> the Powder-treason of <hi>England,</hi> the reuolt of the <hi>Valtellina,</hi> and other semblable combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. And in this discourse of Chaplains, it is fresh in memorie, that a certaine <hi>Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> thinking to take along with him a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine of good learning and of great aduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, before he departed from his Countrie, he had him so well mannaged and instructed at all points by the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the aboue recited <hi>Courts,</hi> that afterward in his charge he lost the name of Chaplaine, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested with the titles of the <hi>Intelligencer</hi> and <hi>Gazettist</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> And another did put his Patron into so many disguise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it lost him the name of <hi>Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> and gained him the appellation of <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi> which yet stickes vpon him with the


<pb facs="tcp:17246:9"/>
Nation where hee was imployed. And that neither Conscience nor Zeale was the true cause of this, they thinke they haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proofe, because some one of these did conuert to his owne vse a huge summe of Donatiues, consigned ouer vnto him, or by him craftily extorted, to make an offering in the Holy house of Loretto: and that the Confessions, Reconciliations, and exercises of <hi>Religion,</hi> were now changed into so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and so quotidian procurements of wantonnesse, and entertainements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that the scandall of these defamatorie doings is not yet layd or extinguished. Whence proceedeth this ill issue and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen to <hi>Religion</hi> it selfe, that whereas to the <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Residence</hi> of <hi>Embassadours,</hi> a good number of the <hi>Catholickes</hi> of that Countrey were accustomed to repaire, that they might there partake of <hi>Diuine Seruice,</hi> and receiue the <hi>Holy Sacraments</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>; this sacred custome was as it were vtterly abandoned, which tended so highly to the seruice of God, and honour of the Embassie.</p>
            <p>These disorders haue constrained <hi>Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:10"/>
who are deputed for such <hi>Residences,</hi> to apply their cogitations and solicitously to prouide, that the <hi>Priests</hi> assumed by them for such a charge, should not goe with them but vpon resolution to gouerne themselues with befitting modestie, without exceeding their limits; and to further the Seruice of God, and aduancement of <hi>Catholicke Religion,</hi> but with Prudence and Moderation.</p>
            <p>And in this I could giue many instances of conspicuitie and note, that diuers <hi>Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours</hi> without any disgust or giuing iust subiect of complaint, haue for certaine done greater Seruice to the <hi>Catholicke Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by the modest retirement and moderate temper of their <hi>Priests,</hi> than those <hi>Busibodies,</hi> or as the <hi>French</hi> haue it better, those <hi>Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant spirits,</hi> that out of heat and hast to doe much, haue rather defaced than built. And a demonstration of this may be drawne from the good effect which hath followed thereupon, and euery day increaseth, that without any occasion of querimony or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the same or greater concourse of <hi>Catholickes</hi> is present at the Diuine exercises of the <hi>Catholicke Roman R√©ligion</hi> than was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:10"/>
to the considerable aduancement of the Seruice of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Religion,</hi> which ought to be the principall obiect of humane actions.</p>
            <p>It is not improbable that the <hi>Confessor,</hi> of whom wee speake, may haue amongst his <hi>Instructions</hi> this also expressed, Not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue such <hi>Jtalian Penitents</hi> as reside in those Countries. For a matter of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as is the exclusion of men from the participation of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> would not bee vndertaken by a priuate <hi>Priest,</hi> without great motiues from abroad; especially, since it is an action not onely repugnant vnto Pietie, but to Wisedome also; that when with so much art, they labour the reduction of any from the <hi>Protestant</hi> vnto the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Roman Religion</hi> (of which the best proofe is to bring them to receiue the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>) they should notwithstanding exclude those from the participation of them, who from their infancie haue made profession of being <hi>Catholicks.</hi> And put case that the <hi>Priest</hi> haue receiued no such <hi>Jnstructions</hi> from <hi>Jtaly,</hi> nor by any letters or faculties, (which is the vsuall and easie way) yet may


<pb facs="tcp:17246:11"/>
hee bee induced to such a resolution, in the very <hi>Low Countries</hi> themselues, because it is an indubitable truth, That the <hi>Nuntio</hi> who resides in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> doth manage all the practises appertaining to <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and there hee appointeth his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> and <hi>Emissaries,</hi> who vnder other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and habits, promote that worke, which wee call the Conuersion vnto the <hi>Catholike</hi> Faith, and <hi>Protestants</hi> tearme the <hi>Seminarie</hi> of Sedition against the <hi>State.</hi> Neither doth the <hi>Nuntio</hi> want bold and potent instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are diuers disguised and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and other Religious persons also.</p>
            <p>It was in times past an vse, and the practise thereof still continueth, That <hi>Bishops,</hi> and principally the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> were procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of many expeditions, sending Religious persons into Regions inhabited by Infidels, with most ample Spirituall authority, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue from Cases reserued, to dispence with Vowes, to grant Indulgences and Graces, and to doe all that which was necessary or opportune for the Conuersion of Infidels to the holy <hi>Catholicke</hi> Faith, or for the corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration


<pb facs="tcp:17246:11"/>
and comfort of those beleeuers, which were still to bee found in those parts, from whence Christian Religion, and the free profession thereof had, by the Infidels, beene formerly discarded. The <hi>Sea of Rome</hi> in times past was for the most part wont to steede it selfe with the endeauours of the <hi>Minor obseruant Fryers</hi>; concerning whom, we may reade in sundrie <hi>P√°pall Constitutions,</hi> the Priuiledges and ample Concessions which they had, with power also to create titular Pastors of those Countries where they did exercise the workes of so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. But after, the Fathers the <hi>Jesuits</hi> grew great; and besides, the fourth Vow (which specially concerneth <hi>Missions</hi>) tooke into their secret <hi>Institutions</hi> a particularitie of their owne, to receiue power to lay aside their habits, and to take those whereunto they had the greatest fancie; so that they could metamorphise themselues into Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Marchants, Courtiers, and into any other Trade or Profession, and counterfeit themselues to bee of any Sect or Religion, <hi>Gentile, Turke, Iew, Hereticke,</hi> or any other which they should conceiue propitious vnto


<pb facs="tcp:17246:12"/>
the ends that they propose vnto themselues (so that from hence it might bee, that <hi>Father Aio</hi> sayd, <hi>Iesuita est omnis homo</hi>) the <hi>Missions</hi> for the most part (especially in the Countries where <hi>Protestants</hi> doe rule) consisted of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi> who leaue vnto other <hi>Religious Orders</hi> onely those <hi>Missions</hi> where there is the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest hope of gaine, and the greatest feare of danger. And these swarme ouer <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany,</hi> and indeed euery where, and now lately more than euer, since the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the new <hi>Congregation in Rome,</hi> which is conspicuous alreadie both for the greatnesse of their riches, and for the multitude of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> to be imployed by them: and it goeth vnder the title <hi>De propaganda Fide.</hi> Of these such as are sent into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Instructions</hi> which they carry along with them from <hi>Rome</hi> and from their <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,</hi> receiue also directions from the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> resident at <hi>Bruxells.</hi> Whence it may be certainly conceiued<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that this <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> had some such commands laid vpon him, and such like seedes sowne into him, from whence these fruits doe grow, which haue so strangely disturbed the Consciences of those


<pb facs="tcp:17246:12"/>
Gentlemen, that did so little expect in this kind to bee disquieted. Therefore as the introduction of these <hi>Missions</hi> had in their origine the respect of Deuotion and Zeale of <hi>Religion,</hi> for their motiue and princ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>pall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, together with a burning desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and saue Soules, so is it sure that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they degenerated into humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and interrests: and these expeditions haue onely serued to spie into <hi>Temporall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernements,</hi> into the strength of <hi>States,</hi> into the factions of <hi>Countries,</hi> into the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Policie,</hi> into the wayes and meanes how to debilitate Gouernement, how to sow ciuile Discord, how to diminish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Princes,</hi> or to bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, how to corrupt and entice from them their Souldiers of account and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: Nay, they are passed on so farre, as to blowe the coales of Sedition, to foment the Malecontents, to make set and formall leagues against <hi>Princes,</hi> to manage Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, &amp; other like scandalous actions, which haue so foulely denigrated the beautie of these holy <hi>Missions,</hi> that they haue made them to bee esteemed no better than the


<pb facs="tcp:17246:13"/>
sending forth of Bloody, Trecherous, and Insidiarie persons, and haue caused them to bee branded by the Aduersaries with those abhominable attributes which <hi>Saint Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> in the end of the first Chapter doth accumulate on those that are of a reprobate minde. Yea the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes</hi> themselues haue beene greatly ashamed of the villanies that are sprung from these moderne <hi>Missions.</hi> And although the fruit of such detestable seede is in these dayes but too rife and plentifull, yet now that the war is kindled against the <hi>Protestants,</hi> the fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is much greater than formerly it was. So that at this present when so formidable a warre is waged against the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> by the <hi>King of Spaine,</hi> no maruell if the <hi>Emissaries</hi> of the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Bruxels</hi> (who swarme in disguises through those Prouinces) doe straine a point beyond their vsuall manner. To this ought the <hi>Confessor</hi> to haue had some regard, and by considering, that hee was thus strictly appointed, Not to administer absolution to those that fought for the defence of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> he should thence haue inferred, That the <hi>Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:13"/>
was the pretext onely; but the end is the interest of factions, the which haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with <hi>Religion</hi>; neither haue the <hi>Antients</hi> euer taught that it should by such meanes bee ampliated. Further, hee ought to haue taken into consideration, that hee is not depending on the authoritie of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> or of any deputed from him that is not his <hi>Ordinarie</hi>: neither doth hee receiue authoritie from him to heare <hi>Confessions,</hi> and that these secret iuglings are odious before God, and that it is an adulterated Zeale which vnder the mantle of <hi>Religion</hi> coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth humane passions and ends. And it would bee too great an inconuenience, that when <hi>Embassadours</hi> and their Families (as good Authours doe maintaine) are not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subiected to <hi>Princes</hi> where they reside, but by the Law of <hi>Nations</hi> are exempt and free, and onely owe submission vnto their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lords, yet hee which attendeth them for the administration of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> should take law from one that is an Alien to that Countrey, yea and serueth such a <hi>Prince</hi> as maketh warre against it. Who can doubt, but that such a one will trie to doe


<pb facs="tcp:17246:14"/>
all the mischiefe hee is able, especially by disbanding the souldiers that serue the other side, as is apparant in this very Case? yet it cannot without horror be conceiued, how great an iniurie is done to the Maiestie of <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>Religion,</hi> to make it like vnto <hi>Medusas</hi> Head, a Bug-beare to scare and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidate mens Consciences, for ends meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mundane, and peraduenture for designes that tast of tyranny and iniustice, as to seise vpon and take away Countries from those persons vnto whom God hath giuen them. For conclusion then of this <hi>Head,</hi> it was not Iustice, and it is contrarie to <hi>Religion,</hi> that the <hi>Confessor</hi> did follow the directions of a professed enemie to those <hi>States</hi> by vertue of a blind obedience: and hee ought not to haue done so notorious a wrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to those Gentlemen, without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning first, Whether it were iust or vniust to denie such a <hi>Penitent,</hi> absolution. For I would see great and euident reason, before I would exclude any man from the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which is a bond of grieuous preiudice. And, as <hi>Saint Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> writes, <hi>Priests ought not to put on a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaicall


<pb facs="tcp:17246:14"/>
superciliousnesse, as if it lay in their power to binde and loose, but they are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conscience of the Penitent, and the merite af the Cause.</hi> So that you see, all is reduced to the two last <hi>Heads,</hi> which remaine to bee examined, because in them lyeth the pyth and point of the cause. Of which:</p>
            <p>The third is, Whether the <hi>Confessor</hi> had iust cause to denie these Gentlemen absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this respect, That they could not liue in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> without sinne, as beeing to conuerse with those who acknowledge not the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> for <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and refuse to yeeld vnto him obedience; and, For that there is not in those parts, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exercise of the <hi>Catholick Romane Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reason in times past would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued no shew or colour, but now, some shadow of doubt may bee put, since that <hi>Clement the eight</hi> tooke on him to bee the first that euer made any step and pretention in this matter. For in the yeare 1595, hee published a <hi>Constitution,</hi> That no <hi>Italian</hi> should or ought to goe for any cause what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, no not for trafficking and marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, to any place where there was not a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall


<pb facs="tcp:17246:15"/>
Priest and a publike Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Romane</hi> seruice was celebrated, except he first should obtaine leaue from the holy Office of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> or from the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> binding also those that should trauell with such licences, to send yearely to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors,</hi> letters of authenticall credence, that they had confessed and communicated. Peraduenture this might bee the cause why the <hi>Confessor,</hi> and he who mannaged him, did deale so roughly with their <hi>Penitents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But withall you must know, that this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Constitution</hi> was neuer entertained or put in execution by any <hi>Prince,</hi> but contrariwise totally excluded as if it had neuer bin ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And to confirme this, it is the receiued <hi>Position of Canonists</hi> and <hi>Ciuilians,</hi> and of the <hi>Popes</hi> themselues, and it is a Doctrine also consonant both to <hi>Diuinitie</hi> &amp; <hi>Nature,</hi> That all humane positiue Lawes (vnder which kind no Catholick Doctor doth denie that such like <hi>Constitutions</hi> are comprehended; neither can he, vnlesse he will make a man a God, nay aboue God) are iust so much in force as they are in vse, and by not beeing receiued, or by an application of them vnto a


<pb facs="tcp:17246:15"/>
contrarie vse, they loose all their vertue obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, and are as if they had neuer beene ordained. And if it should bee otherwise, there would bee nothing but confusion in Gouernement, and destruction of good Policie: and <hi>Popes</hi> should not onely bee <hi>Patrons</hi> of all <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Dominions,</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> of all matters of <hi>Iudicature,</hi> and of all <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> but the very facultie and meanes to thinke of any question, would bee idle and out of vse: for what matter is there, that the <hi>Popes</hi> in some past ages till now, haue not themselues decreed, or else commanded their determinations? But Iurisdiction is not acquired by commaundements, but by commanding iustly, and by being obeyed. So that no foundation must bee layd on this <hi>Constitution,</hi> which was abortiue in the birth, reiected in the first beginning, opposed by all, receiued by none; and by the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of some <hi>Princes</hi> against the very <hi>Pope</hi> that made it, it is apparant that it ought not to be receiued: so that it hath had no obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation at all, but hath remained as if it had not beene made; and that with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> and of the <hi>Popes</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:16"/>
themselues, yea and of the very person that made it.</p>
            <p>And so it ought to bee in reason, because the <hi>Pope</hi> extended his power to the restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confinement of that libertie which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> all Lawes diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and the practise in the generall course of all times from the beginning of the World vntill the yeare 1595, haue giuen and granted vnto the Faithfull. Whosoeuer hath any insight into the <hi>Sacred Stories,</hi> knowes that after the Creation of the world, there was a diuision of <hi>Religion</hi> in the very sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that some worshipped the true God with pure and lawfull Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as was requisite; others became Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and yet he will not finde that the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (I speak not of the separation of <hi>Nations,</hi> but of particular diuisions, for that was a Case reserued to <hi>God</hi> alone) euer receiued prohibition to inhabit those places where men of impure or false Religion did dwell, but the true worshippers of God did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies enioy the freedom of going, staying, &amp; dwelling there where their best commoditie did inuite them. The same is obserued to


<pb facs="tcp:17246:16"/>
haue continued all the while that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did dwell amongst the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and in the cities of <hi>Idolaters,</hi> as serued best for their ease and purpose. And this remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and vninterrupted, vntill the comming of our <hi>Lord</hi> into the World, in which tim it apapereth by the <hi>Scripture of the New Testament,</hi> That the true Beleeuers, which then were the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> were dispersed and scattered in the Countries of <hi>Asia, Affricke, Europe,</hi> and dwelt in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe. And in those dayes there was amongst the <hi>Iewes</hi> a <hi>Sect</hi> called in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> The Heresie of the <hi>Saduces;</hi> who denied that there were any spirituall Creatures, or Angells, or Soules, or Resurrection of the dead; and yet they dwelt with the rest, and they with them: neither did any then euer pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue this libertie, or to prohibit men from going or abiding where they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues best liked.</p>
            <p>And after the publication of the Holy <hi>Gospell,</hi> the same libertie remained in all ages, neither shall you find that euer any did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the contrarie, vntill <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>eight.</hi> And yet there were in the Church so many


<pb facs="tcp:17246:17"/>
Sects, Diuisions and Heresies, of that power as that they filled whole Cities, Countries, Kingdomes and Empires: Witnesse the <hi>Arians</hi> in particular, who seemed to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken possession of the whole Earth, in so much as <hi>Jerome</hi> with great bitternesse sayd of them, That the World was amased to finde it selfe turned <hi>Arian.</hi> And these with the <hi>Princes</hi> of this <hi>Sect</hi> held the Easterne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Affricke,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy;</hi> and yet it will not bee proued that euer it was endeauoured, that the libertie of <hi>Catholicks</hi> should bee taken from them, so that they might not trauell, abide, inhabit, or traffike where it should seeme best vnto them. And if there appeared danger to any particular man, to him in particular did they apply ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and persuasions by their friends and ghostly Fathers, but neuer durst they forme a generall Command for the people of a whole Nation; and of this there can be no example alleadged. But you will finde the <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> to the contrarie; that, if of two ioyned together, the one shall be a <hi>Beleeuer,</hi> and the other an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell,</hi> and this shall consent to liue with the


<pb facs="tcp:17246:17"/>
               <hi>Beleeuer,</hi> let the <hi>Beleeuer</hi> liue with him, and not abandon him. And thereupon the <hi>Canonists</hi> haue framed a <hi>Rule,</hi> with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception onely, That the seperation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded then meerely, when they cannot Cohabit without iniurie vnto the <hi>Creator.</hi> And this <hi>Rule</hi> will by reason of this restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so much the more serue for our purpose. The <hi>Cannons</hi> of seperating a mans selfe from hereticall or excommunicate persons, doe likewise make for our Case; because it is one thing to abstaine from the conuersation of a particular person that is censured by the <hi>Church,</hi> and another thing not to remaine in a Countrey that is diuerse in Faith from vs: for so, that which is done against an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke in fauour of <hi>Religion,</hi> might be turned to the disfauour and disaduantage of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of a <hi>Beleeuer</hi> and a <hi>Catholicke;</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom, none will say that he cannot so dwell without an iniury done to the <hi>Creator</hi>: For otherwise all the <hi>Catholickes of England, Jreland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes too, should bee bound to auoid their Countries.</p>
            <p>And therefore to goe, to stay, to inhabite,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:18"/>
to trafficke, and to serue in war are all ciuile actions, and not spirituall. And if any could or ought to frame commaundements on them, it is an office that belongs to <hi>Secular Princes,</hi> vnto which the <hi>Ecclesiastickes</hi> can make no pretension, vnlesse they will arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily vsurpe vpon others authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law or Scripture, nay rather against all Law and Scripture.</p>
            <p>But in the meane time, all the other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Christendome</hi> doe enioy this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, so that neither <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>Prelate</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the <hi>Spaniards, French, Germanes,</hi> nor <hi>Polackes,</hi> that are <hi>Catholicke,</hi> to goe and abide where they will; what reason then is there that onely <hi>Jtalians</hi> should finde worse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and that this bondage should bee imposed on them alone? Either this matter concernes Saluation, or no; if it doe not, why then should the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> thrust their sickle into other mens corne? If it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Saluation, in this, neither the <hi>Scriptures</hi> nor holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> euer knew distinction of <hi>Nations</hi> or people. Neither would they now giue authoritie vnto any <hi>Ecclesiasticke</hi> to make decrees in the like matter, although


<pb facs="tcp:17246:18"/>
in some sort it might bee thought expedient and conducing to saluation. For the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> themselues, who giue power to the <hi>Prelate</hi> indirectly in temporall things, haue not yet dared to passe further, except as the power in <hi>Temporals</hi> concerneth saluation, out of necessitie onely, and not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie, or for bettering the state of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For otherwise <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> might in all things command absolutely: as, it may bee, they might thinke it profitable for the saluation of many persons, that some should build <hi>Churches,</hi> others should giue all they haue vnto the poore; that some should not marry, that others should bee clad rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one fashion than another, that some should leaue marchandising, that a <hi>Prince</hi> should renounce his Kingdome and turne priuate man, that others should lay aside the art which they professe. And by this meanes would they become the absolute <hi>Masters</hi> of all wealth and of all <hi>States</hi>; and, which is more, of the very thoughts. But if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct cannot bee meant, vnlesse it bee for the necessitie of the <hi>Spirituall,</hi> it will lye on him who pretends to giue such commands,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:19"/>
to shew how this restraint of the <hi>Italian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> onely, is necessary to saluation, and not of others too; and why <hi>Italians</hi> alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine to their saluation if they dwell in such like Countries: and if it really bee an impediment to saluation, how may it bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by a peece of paper that containes the Licence which they are to carry with them? Besides, if <hi>Superiors</hi> doe send <hi>Priests</hi> into the <hi>Protestant</hi> Countries, that vnder other shewes, they may administer the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> vnto such, as albeit they liue vnder <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Princes,</hi> are notwithstanding, in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Catholicks</hi>; doe they not thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and approue, that saluation may there bee had without abandoning those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries? If so, then may <hi>Italians</hi> obtaine the like, and that with lesse impediment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they beeing strangers may lawfully make publike profession in the Houses of <hi>Embassadors,</hi> of the exercise of <hi>Catholicke Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>: so that the <hi>Priest</hi> cannot hereupon constraine them to depart from thence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee should iudge it to be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for them to liue in <hi>Italy.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it hath beene shewed, necessitie only


<pb facs="tcp:17246:19"/>
doth grant vnto them indirect authority in <hi>Temporals,</hi> euen by the opinion of the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>: otherwise, if it should bee iudged bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> That the <hi>Pope</hi> should in <hi>Temporals</hi> bee inuested with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> they might ordaine that those Countries should, by the renunciation of the possident <hi>Princes,</hi> be deliuered vp vnto him. And wee see that our <hi>Blessed Sauiour</hi> himselfe would haue things that are not necessary, but only profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table &amp; helpfull to saluation, left to Counsell, &amp; not circumscribed in precepts. How much lesse then can <hi>Ecclesiastickes</hi> vse their power in Temporall matters, when there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie thereof, but onely because it may peraduenture conduce vnto saluation? And in this case least of all, because we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not for what such power may bee profitable, vnlesse it bee for the aduancement of the interests of their temporall Greatnesse. And this difference touching <hi>Italians,</hi> which cannot indeed bee admitted in temporall matters, in which <hi>Saint Paul</hi> knew no diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of <hi>Iew, Greeke,</hi> or <hi>Barbarian,</hi> hath beene found out by some shrewd and experienced


<pb facs="tcp:17246:20"/>
braines, who by obseruation of former times, and comparing them with this, know that the <hi>Ecclesiastickes</hi> haue mightily dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their authority in <hi>Tramontane</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and therefore doe procure in <hi>Italy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensiuely, that which hath extensiuely beene lost in other places; and to this end they imploy all their art and force, and draw euery matter to the head of <hi>Spiritualitie</hi> or <hi>Religion.</hi> Vnto this, <hi>Soueraigne Princes</hi> ought to haue great regard, as they haue had by the exclusion and inobseruance of the foresaid <hi>Constitution.</hi> Notwithstanding which, the <hi>Italians</hi> who are subiects to the most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Republicke,</hi> to the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Tuscany,</hi> doe repaire where they see cause for matter of marchandise, and for any other concernement that belongs vnto them. They frequent <hi>England, Germany,</hi> and Cities that are subiect to <hi>Protestant Princes,</hi> and all places else whereunto their interests doe draw them. And therefore it is lawfull by an vniuersall consent of all <hi>Catholicke States,</hi> to persist in that libertie which God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue granted, and which is indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the will of <hi>Ecclesiastickes,</hi> as being a


<pb facs="tcp:17246:20"/>
matter that toucheth not spirituall Saluation, at the least not by a necessary connexion.</p>
            <p>But the importance of this action requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth further consideration, because the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of <hi>Princes</hi> are of greater moment than the faults of priuate persons. And this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is a beginning of notable vsurpation and perturbance in ciuile Gouernement. For it is to be held as a constant <hi>Tenet</hi> (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wee haue touched) that where any matter is handled concerning the saluation of Soules, in which the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Prelate</hi> hath authority to make orders &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, there can no distinction or difference of persons bee admitted. And therefore <hi>Pope Clement the eight</hi> in the <hi>Constitutions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd, commands in generall without exception either of Persons or Causes, That none without licence of the ordinary <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors</hi> should presume to go into such parts, where there is not a publike <hi>Church, Priest,</hi> &amp; exercise of the <hi>Romish Rites</hi> and Seruice. So that by vertue of this <hi>Constitution,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> should not send <hi>Embassadors</hi> ordinary or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary into the Countries that are held by <hi>Potentates</hi> diuided from the <hi>Sea of Rome.</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:21"/>
And if an occurrence or Case should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that out of the emergency of Reason, or out of necessitie of good Gouernement, it should bee held expedient to send a secret person to act some negotiations, which it were inconuenient that the <hi>Ecclesiastickes</hi> should know, yet notwithstanding, all must bee reuealed vnto him, or men must fall into censures, and bee made obnoxious vnto the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> These inconueniences are so cleere and so vsuall, that they doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare the apparancy of the vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. And it would be too great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> may (as dayly they doe, and examples hereof are actually practised) send into the Countries of <hi>Protestants</hi> (where there is publikely, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Romish Church</hi> nor <hi>Priest</hi>) <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and some of other <hi>Religious Orders</hi> in disguise, and in more priuate restriction too, whether for businesse, or for guile, or for explorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euery man speaketh after his owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and that it should bee vnlawfull for other <hi>Princes</hi> to send any person without their leaue or knowledge. And in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant</hi> too, where the very Soule of trafficke


<pb facs="tcp:17246:21"/>
breathes, there is scarce a place conuenient for trading, that hath the benefit of a publike <hi>Church</hi>: so that here likewise, if this <hi>Rule</hi> should hold, there is no abiding without licence. And if <hi>Princes</hi> must in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests depend thus on others, and submit the ground-worke of good Gouernement, and the necessitie of their defence and pr√©serua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to other mens ends and arbitrements, they are no longer absolute <hi>Princes</hi>; and farewell <hi>Soueraignetie,</hi> if it be once brought to such a descent, as to render an account vnto any but to God, and to receiue Laws of what it ought to doe, or not to doe, from any power but Diuine.</p>
            <p>But it exceedes all beleefe and Christian charitie, to obserue the course which hath bin taken with these Gentlemen. The time comes that a Gentleman, out of compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his sinnes, goes to reconcile himselfe to God by <hi>Confession,</hi> and then is hee intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such strange and intollerable rigor, that the spirituall comfort of absolution is denied him<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> And yet we are impatient to heare it maintained by such as are seperated from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> That <hi>Confession</hi> is


<pb facs="tcp:17246:22"/>
become the very path through which (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steede of comforting mens Soules) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrests of the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> are conueyed, to the detriment and disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of other <hi>Potentates</hi>; and that it is distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the originall and pure Institution, and made to pry into mens actions, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch the allegeance of subiects, to instill affections, to augment partialities and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and such like things as these.</p>
            <p>By all this that hath beene sayd, I remaine fixt in my iudgement, and it is sufficiently prooued, That if the <hi>Confessor</hi> haue denied his <hi>Penitents</hi> absolution, onely because they are in a Countrey which is separated from the obedience of the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi>; he hath done wrong vnto his <hi>Penitent,</hi> and abused <hi>Confession:</hi> and if hee haue done this by the command of any person whatsoeuer, that commaundement is vniust and vnlawfull, trenching, by vsurpation, vpon the authoritie of others, and is actiuely scandalous in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing spirituall authority to compasse ends that are purely mundane.</p>
            <p>So that the cause which may bee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, can bee no other than that which is in


<pb facs="tcp:17246:22"/>
the <hi>Fourth Head</hi> propounded; that is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they professe to march in the <hi>Army</hi> of the <hi>LL. the States of Holland,</hi> against the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke King.</hi> And this cannot in our <hi>Case</hi> arise but from two <hi>Heads</hi>: Either for that it is not lawfull for <hi>Catholickes</hi> to take armes absolutely in fauour of such as the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> accounts <hi>Heretickes,</hi> or because the war which they mannage is vniust. And these two <hi>Heads</hi> will easily reciue their discussion.</p>
            <p>Touching the first, it will be necessarie to alleage the common Doctrine of <hi>Ciuilians,</hi> which in matter of defence, ayde, or suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Heretickes,</hi> is voide of all contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by distinguishing that a man may fauour or defend <hi>Heretickes</hi> two manner of wayes, either formally, or not formally. A formall fauouring or defending of <hi>Heretikes</hi> is (to vse the very words of a <hi>Ciuilian</hi> and a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> which in this subiect may stand for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san witnesses) when a man doth assist and fauour <hi>Heretickes,</hi> either because they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse such and such hereticall Doctrines, or when ayd is lent out of relation and order vnto Doctrines that are hereticall, to the end that <hi>Heretickes</hi> may teach or defend


<pb facs="tcp:17246:23"/>
them. Not formall, is when the cause which mooueth a man to giue fauour, ayde, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is not heresie, but friendship, kindred, gratitude, goodnesse of nature, want or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of helpe, or the like. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they decree, That the <hi>Cannon Lawes</hi> and <hi>Papall Constitutions,</hi> yea euen those which concerne the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which are the most rigorous that Church-men could euer inuent, ought onely to be vnderstood of the first part, when the respect and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> motiue is <hi>Heresie</hi> or false Doctrine, and not of the second. Nor can lawes Penall or <hi>Papall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue such latitude and extension, for that would bee a flat prohibition of all offices of humanitie and of good workes; and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept vniust and tyrannicall, that is not of validitie to tye any man. To apply this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our purpose, it being so, that the onely and true cause why these gentlemen serued vnder the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> was a meere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to learne the art of Warre vnder that <hi>Captaine</hi> vnto whome without controuersie all the Commanders of our time must giue place, without hauing relation or regard vnto the Doctrine and Religion professed in


<pb facs="tcp:17246:23"/>
those Countries; Nay, it appearing in fact, in that they presented themselues to <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> at the time appointed by the <hi>Bishops of Rome</hi>; That they perseuered in the <hi>Catholicke Romane Religion</hi>; neither doe they fauour or fight out of respect of the <hi>Religion</hi> that disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth from the <hi>Romane</hi> Faith. And it cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also appearing, as I proue by the doctrine of the <hi>Canonists,</hi> who attribute vnto the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastickes</hi> all that they can, certainely more than they should, That these gent<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>emen haue not in this case committed any sinne, much lesse a crime inexpiable. How then could the <hi>Confessor</hi> denie them absolution, without manifest wrong, and vnlesse hee abused <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> to serue politike and indirect ends?</p>
            <p>And here it will not bee besides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to recount two <hi>Master</hi>-designes hid vnder this practise, the one from <hi>Spaine,</hi> the other from the <hi>Ecclesiastickes,</hi> who indeede walke hand in hand with them. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> as it appeares by letters from many <hi>Italian Caualiers</hi> that serue in the warres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Standart</hi> against the <hi>States,</hi> haue a purpose and custome to require an oath from all those that will serue vnder them,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:24"/>
that they shal neuer serue without their leaue against the <hi>House of Austria</hi>; and whosoeuer receiues from them any Militarie charge or honor, must take this oath irrefragably and without exception. If then they shall bee able to gaine this other point also, by the way of <hi>Confession</hi> &amp; mantle of <hi>Religion,</hi> That none shall passe to fight in the Campes of <hi>Protestants</hi>; the consequence will follow, that there shall bee none which seeketh to attaine to Militarie science, who withall shall not be by oath oblieged to the <hi>House of Austria</hi>; yea, although it bee against their naturall <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</hi> For the World is not so in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie and cradle, but that by a surueigh of the present face of <hi>Europe,</hi> it can easily presage, That there cannot be a war, which either in the beginning is not betweene <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> or in the progresse will not become so. And in this period stands the true state of matters at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: in so much as other <hi>Catholick Princes,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can haue no subiect that hath seene the wars, or if they haue any, they must be such whose fideliltie they haue reason to suspect. And this is one of the weightiest and most


<pb facs="tcp:17246:24"/>
important considerations, that moues many <hi>Italian Caualiers</hi> to militate in the warres of <hi>Holland,</hi> there beeing none any other-where amongst <hi>Romane Catholickes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other dessigne which is peculiar to the <hi>Ecclesiastickes,</hi> is yet of more importance, on which without question they fixe their eyes, albeit they dare not as yet to discouer it. But with certaine tasts and beginnings, they let some men a little to vnderstand it, who by obseruation of their drifts, doe know with what artifice they haue so farre incroached vpon the power of others, vnder fained pretexts of <hi>Religion,</hi> and how they cheate vpon the simplicity of <hi>Princes,</hi> and preuaile by the power of <hi>Religion</hi> vpon the people. If it bee a sinne in priuate men, sufficient to exclude them from the participation of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> to take armes in fauour of those which obey not the <hi>Pope</hi>; how much greater an offence is it in <hi>Princes,</hi> who make defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue Leagues with them, and contribute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vnto them, or send them militarie assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. This is the secret and the <hi>Center</hi> to which all these lynes are directed. But as yet it is an attempt too difficult, neither is


<pb facs="tcp:17246:25"/>
the matter yet fitted or well disposed: It is an Embryo that ripens by little and little, and waites the good houre for the disclose &amp; deliuery. It is true, that in their discourses they will giue you some touches of it, and being <hi>Patrons</hi> of the <hi>Presse,</hi> they cause some of their <hi>Confidents</hi> to print some sentences tending that way; but yet they haue not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to decree that such Confederations &amp; succours, which are made through a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of a mans owne preseruation, are vtterly vnlawfull. They know full well that the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> doe not hold it a sinne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute mony vnder-hand to those of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in France,</hi> that whilest warre is kindled in that kingdome, they may other-where oppresse minor <hi>Princes,</hi> with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ease and conueniencie. Neither doe the <hi>Nuntios</hi> themselues disdaine to be made the <hi>Ministers</hi> and meanes of such charitable ends. They are not ignorant that the crowne of <hi>France</hi> hath for a long time entred into league with the <hi>Protestant Switzers,</hi> with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall articles of defence; with the <hi>Grison Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> vnto whom that Crowne is to giue ayde ordinary and extraordinary,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:25"/>
               <hi>Contra quoscunque</hi>: yea against <hi>Catholicks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that shall inuade them, or giue them disturbance; that it hath contracted antient allyance and confederation with the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that it maintaines a Garrison payd, and giues besides an annuall summe of money of twenty fiue thousand Crownes to the Common wealth of <hi>Geneua,</hi> that it might bee enabled to defend it selfe, and likewise hath defended the same against <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> who are <hi>Catholicke Princes,</hi> as often as they haue attempted to make war against it. And from the beginning of the warres in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> to this present time, the most <hi>Christian Kings</hi> haue euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> and maintained Regiments of foote at their owne charge and pay, without intermission, which they doe still performe, and besides, administer vnto them extraordinary succours of mony. And the <hi>French Militia</hi> which haue gone to these warres, for the most part did consist of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes,</hi> and their greatest <hi>Officers</hi> were <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes</hi> likewise: Of which, <hi>Monsieur de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claur,</hi> and so many other Captaines of warre make sufficient proofe, who came from the


<pb facs="tcp:17246:26"/>
               <hi>Low Countries,</hi> to the pay of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Republicke</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> And in all that time there came souldiers from all the Countries of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and from <hi>Italy</hi> it selfe, to those warres indifferently to what side they pleased, and yet the <hi>Ecclesiasticke</hi> neuer had the boldnesse to oppose. Whence we may drawe the common meaning of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and of all <hi>Christendome,</hi> which conuinceth this noueltie of iniustice, of vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and of desire to fauour one faction against another, vnder the shew of <hi>Religion</hi>; a matter scandalous, of pernicious example, and iudged to be tyrannicall. And the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of State</hi> beeing as it is, so sacred, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and supreame in humane actions, yea, in nature diuine, and beeing recommended to the <hi>Soueraigne</hi> onely, who sitteth in the seate of <hi>Maiestie,</hi> me thinkes the <hi>Ecclesiasticke</hi> should totally abandon that vaine and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus pretension, That the saftie and defence of Nations, ought to be regulated by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the <hi>Cannon Law</hi>; which is as much below this supreame reason, as the humane is inferiour to the diuine, and the <hi>Positiue</hi> to the naturall: and let him consider that <hi>God</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:26"/>
hath together with the <hi>Maiestie,</hi> giuen vnto the <hi>Soueraigne</hi> alone, the authority to make peace, warre, leagues, and allyances, as hee shall conceiue it necessary and conuenient: neither can any but hee know the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of opportunities and needes, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can gouerne and actuate the body but that Soule which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it.</p>
            <p>And that the iniquitie of this attempt may the more manifestly appeare, letting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne matters alone, we are to know, that <hi>Sextus Quintus</hi> being cleerely satisfied of the ends of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> That they aspired to oppresse all <hi>Potentates,</hi> vnder colour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themselues <hi>Protectors of the Catholicke Religion</hi> against <hi>Heretickes;</hi> did with great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie stirre vp the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>States of Holland</hi>: and the same ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions had <hi>Clement the eight,</hi> and <hi>Paul the fift,</hi> although it were late ere they came vnto it. And that the falsity of this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stampt Doctrine may the more perspicuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee discouered, which by these indirect wayes, striueth to introduce a prescription, That it is not lawful for <hi>Catholike</hi> souldiers to


<pb facs="tcp:17246:27"/>
fight for <hi>Protestants,</hi> that so they may by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique insinuation arriue vnto their designe, to make it vnlawfull for <hi>Catholicke Princes</hi> to make leagues, or send succours vnto them, excluding vnder the cloake of <hi>Religion,</hi> all fundamentals of good Gouernement, of ones owne defence, and of the necessitie of mens peculiar preseruation; a deduction hereof may be drawne through all times, of which any memory in sacred or profane <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories</hi> doth remaine: But I will alleage some few instances of the choicest and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable places.</p>
            <p>The first example (and it will be the more singular because it is set downe in Diuine Writ) is that of the great <hi>Patriarch,</hi> who by <hi>Saint Paul</hi> is stiled <hi>the Father of the Faithfull,</hi> whose actions none dare bee so hardy as to blame, or to esteeme them such as are not propounded for examples to bee imitated. Of <hi>Abraham</hi> then, the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That when his brother <hi>Lot</hi> had beene made prisoner by certain <hi>Assirian</hi> Kings, who had waged warre against him, <hi>Abraham</hi> not hauing force sufficient of himselfe, made a league with <hi>Ascol</hi> and <hi>Annor, Jdolatrous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:27"/>
setled the articles of Confederation with them, and hauing ioyned his forces with theirs, he began the war, recouered his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and got the victory. Behold a league made by an holy <hi>Patriarke,</hi> with <hi>Princes,</hi> not onely of a diuerse <hi>Religion,</hi> but also <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Idolaters.</hi> Next followes another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of a King after <hi>Gods</hi> owne heart, and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> that according to the flesh was one of <hi>Christs ancestors, Dauid,</hi> in the persecutions which King <hi>Saul</hi> raised vp against him, fled with all his Company, consisting of six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred souldiers, ouer whom hee was chiefe, and put himselfe into the pay of King <hi>Achis,</hi> made a league with him, receiued from him places to dwell in, and it is certaine that hee vndertooke to serue him in the warre against the Faithfull themselues. For there being warre proclaimed betweene King <hi>Achis</hi> an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> that was King of Gods owne people, <hi>Dauid</hi> would faine haue beene at those warres, but the King would not permit him, because hee and his had his fidelitie in suspition, and feared least when they should ioyne battell, he might turne his banner and reuolt. And hereupon <hi>Dauid</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:28"/>
tooke it heauily that hee was not admitted to this warre, as one that held himselfe wronged in honour to be had in diffidence. So that it is sure that hee was prepared to haue fought in fauour of <hi>Infidels</hi> against the worshippers of the true God and professors of true <hi>Religion.</hi> And who so shall consider the person of <hi>Dauid,</hi> so mightie a <hi>King,</hi> so great a <hi>Prophet,</hi> so holy a <hi>Saint,</hi> hee will bee easily conuinced in this point, that it hath bin and is lawfull for other <hi>Princes</hi> to doe that, of which in the <hi>Sacred Scripture</hi> there is found so illustrous an example, That a Captaine with all his Companies of Beleeuers did serue an <hi>Idolatrous King</hi> in the warre against those of his owne Faith, that is, those of the false against those of the true <hi>Religion.</hi> It is likewise cleere, that the same <hi>Dauid,</hi> after he attained to the Crowne, entred into league and established a Confederation with <hi>Naas</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and with <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre:</hi> neither can it bee alleaged, that this was done in time of extreame necessity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those leagues with the foresayd <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous Princes,</hi> were stipulated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Dauid</hi> did peaceably enioy the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome


<pb facs="tcp:17246:28"/>
of <hi>Israell.</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne and successor in the Kingdom, ioyned in league with the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with whom also he made allyance and married his daughter. And <hi>Assa</hi> King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (of whom the <hi>Scripture</hi> beareth witnesse, That he had his heart vpright towards <hi>God</hi> like <hi>Dauid</hi>) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to his succour <hi>Benadas</hi> the King of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco,</hi> against <hi>Baasha</hi> King of <hi>Israell</hi>; which was to confederate himselfe with an vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing King, against one that was of the same <hi>Religion</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>In the times which were neerer to the birth of our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> wee haue the example of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who made a defensiue league with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the very Conuentions betweene them are cleerely to bee seene in <hi>Holy writ,</hi> that whensoeuer warre should be made against either of them, they should interchangeably send succours one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of victuals, munition, ships, money, and souldiers, according to their power, and as the condition of the times would permit them. And the same <hi>Maccabees</hi> made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie also with the <hi>Spartan Republicke,</hi> who then swayed all <hi>Morea,</hi> often renewing,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:29"/>
and from time to time reconfirming the same. By which examples of holy <hi>Scripture</hi> it resteth firme, That beleeuing <hi>Princes</hi> may confederate themselues, giue and receiue ayde, if their proper preseruation shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, from <hi>Princes</hi> that are <hi>Infidels.</hi> And the example will serue this present <hi>Case</hi> of ours, as drawne from the greater vnto the lesse. For albeit the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> bee not vnited vnder the obedience of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> yet are they <hi>Christians,</hi> and not <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters or Infidels.</hi> And the <hi>Maxime</hi> which the flaterrers of the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> doe endeauor to sow the propagate, That <hi>Heretickes</hi> be worse than <hi>Idolaters</hi>; is finely accommodated to the temporall and worldly interests of the <hi>Ecclesiastickes,</hi> but no way conformable to the sacred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor to the Doctrine of the antient holy <hi>Fathers.</hi> And my Soule trembleth within mee, to thinke that hee should bee held more tollerable and lesse abhominable, That calleth <hi>Christ</hi> a seducer and a false Prophet, than he that inuocates him as <hi>God,</hi> and is baptised in his holy name, and receiues his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and confesseth that it is the onely <hi>Name</hi> vnder Heauen, by


<pb facs="tcp:17246:29"/>
which mankinde may be saued. And if in some antient <hi>Writers</hi> any passage shall bee found, that may seeme to fauour those opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, it was because such <hi>Heretickes</hi> denied the Diuinitie of <hi>Christ,</hi> and thereby laboured to ouerthrow the very foundation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie,</hi> by reason whereof, they were rather a <hi>Sect of Infidels</hi> than <hi>Heretickes</hi>: But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderstood of these who confesse him to bee <hi>God,</hi> and by this confession acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ground of our saluation; yet to take away this cauill too, see here examples (in the particular) of <hi>Heretickes</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Vnder the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> in the time that the <hi>Princes</hi> professed the <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Romane</hi> Faith, <hi>Histories</hi> both <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> and others, do swell with examples of the greatest and deuoutest <hi>Emperours,</hi> that haue made leagues and held amitie with <hi>Infidell Princes</hi> and <hi>Hereticall</hi> also.</p>
            <p>It is most certaine that <hi>Constantine,</hi> who so well deserued of the <hi>Catholicke Church,</hi> did for the defence of the <hi>Empire,</hi> make Conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who were <hi>Idolaters</hi> (with <hi>Heretickes</hi> hee could not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb facs="tcp:17246:30"/>
as then they had no territory) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed places on them to dwell in, amongst the <hi>Prouinces</hi> of the <hi>Romane Empire.</hi> And in those times it is well knowne how aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly the <hi>Church</hi> flourished with holy men, zealous of the purenesse of <hi>Religion</hi>: and yet you shall not finde that any of them did euer reprehend, or teach that it was not lawfull to make such confederacies: the which doth inuincibly argue the approbation of all the holy <hi>Catholicke Church.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> was created <hi>Emperor,</hi> who was not only a <hi>Catholicke,</hi> but also an exceeding fauourer of the <hi>Church</hi> and of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> of the same. At the same time was his brother <hi>Valens</hi> Emperor in the <hi>Eastern parts,</hi> who was an <hi>Arian</hi> hereticke, and persecuted <hi>Catholicks,</hi> yet was there euer vnion, confidence, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie betweene these two brethren, (the one an <hi>Hereticke</hi> and the other a <hi>Catholike</hi>) for the common defence, and offence of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Emperours Theodosius, Arcadius, Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> made many Conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with <hi>Gothes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Alans, Gepides, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> part of which were <hi>Infidels,</hi> and part


<pb facs="tcp:17246:30"/>
               <hi>Heretickes,</hi> and yet there was none so hardy to reprehend those leagues as a thing vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, although there then liued those great <hi>Fathers</hi> and zealous <hi>Doctors,</hi> the <hi>Luminaries</hi> of the <hi>Holy Church</hi>: who, out of their zeale to truth, feared not to reprooue euen <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> to their faces, and to tell <hi>Empresses</hi> of their faults and defects. There liued in those dayes <hi>Ambrose, Ierome, Austine, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Leo,</hi> and other most renowned <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome, Patriarckes, Archbishops, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Chiefetaines</hi> of the holy <hi>Church,</hi> whose workes and writings remaine with vs, and it can neuer bee found that they reprehended these Confederations: And therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie wee must confesse, that their silence in this Case, when the other errours of the <hi>Emperors</hi> were exagitated by them with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite zeale, doth demonstrate herein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the whole <hi>Catholicke Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of the aboue named <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> the Kingdome of the <hi>Gothes</hi> began to take roote in <hi>Italy,</hi> and continued a long time; These were Christians, but <hi>Arians,</hi> who were the most pernicious Sect of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes</hi> that euer infested the <hi>Church,</hi> for they


<pb facs="tcp:17246:31"/>
fought against the very person of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose <hi>Diuinitie</hi> they denied, and shooke the Article on which as on a ground-worke, <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is built, and that is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the <hi>Blessed Trinitie:</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which, the <hi>Emperours of Constantinople</hi> who were <hi>Catholickes,</hi> were for the most part in peace and league with them; and the <hi>Popes</hi> themselues were their subiects, and yeelded them obedience. Yea, one of the <hi>Popes</hi> was sent in <hi>Embassage</hi> by them, about affaires of <hi>State,</hi> and yet he made no refusall of such imployment; and it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that any <hi>Writers,</hi> or Holy men of those times, did blame those <hi>Catholicke Princes</hi> for that they held friendship with kings that were hereticall and infected with such monstrous falshoods. This labour would be endlesse, to particularise in all the examples which might be alleaged in this argument.</p>
            <p>After that the power of a <hi>Temporall Prince</hi> was in the persons of the <hi>Popes of Rome</hi> ioyned in <hi>Jtaly</hi> to the <hi>Pontificall Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> in which time they haue framed so many Lawes, as in the <hi>Decretals</hi> in the sixt, and in the <hi>Clementines</hi> and <hi>Extrauagants</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:31"/>
that there is not a matter of <hi>State</hi> in which by extension of their authoritie, they haue not opinated and decreed: yet doe wee not want examples of the like Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, as may easiely bee seene in the <hi>Histories</hi> of those times. <hi>George Podibras</hi> was an <hi>Hussite Hereticke,</hi> and so held by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and for that cause he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by <hi>Pius the second,</hi> with <hi>Censures.</hi> This example is obseruable, because it will so flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew that there were treaties and leagues then handled, notwithstanding the matter of <hi>Religion.</hi> Now in the yeare 1463, the <hi>Emperour Fredericke</hi> the third being inuested with a dangerous siege in <hi>Vienna,</hi> called him to his succour, and made conuentions with him of mutuall assistance; and these were approoued by the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe, who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon left to prosecute him with <hi>Censures.</hi> And <hi>Iulius the second,</hi> in the yeare 1510, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe in danger at <hi>Bologna,</hi> by the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the <hi>French armie,</hi> receiued into the citie to his ayde <hi>Chiappino Vitellio,</hi> with sixe hundred light horse, &amp; a squadron of <hi>Turks,</hi> whom hee much entrusted with his person. And in the yeare 1558, <hi>Paul the fourth</hi> did


<pb facs="tcp:17246:32"/>
hire and pay many <hi>Protestant Grisons,</hi> who euen in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe performed diuerse acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contrary to the <hi>Catholicke Religion</hi>; and all was told the <hi>Pope,</hi> who auouched openly, that they were <hi>Angels of God</hi> sent for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and that to preserue a mans selfe it was lawfull to vse the seruice of all sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And hee gaue an authenticke docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof, when (the third of <hi>September</hi> in the yeare 1557) hee spake these expresse words to some that quipped him for this, <hi>It would haue beene lawfull and laudable too, to call in Turkes, Moores, and Jewes, for our defence.</hi> And it is a matter without doubt, that hee did indeede actually treate with the <hi>Turke.</hi> To this day, the <hi>House of Austria</hi> hath amitie and league with the <hi>Protestant Princes</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and others, and giues, and takes ayde from them. And for the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> the matter is so notorious, as that I shall not neede to enlarge my selfe vpon this subiect, and besides, it hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly touched. If then it bee lawfull by Stories out of the <hi>Sacred Scripture</hi> for <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Princes</hi> to defend and succour the very <hi>Infidels</hi> themselues, much more those that


<pb facs="tcp:17246:32"/>
are <hi>Christians,</hi> although not obedient to the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and when they doe really ayde them with money, men, and munition; yet doth not this derogate a iotte from their deuotion, or profession of the <hi>Catholicke Romane Religion.</hi> Why may it not likewise bee lawfull for priuate men, to defend and ayde that sort of people with their persons, and yet bee not onely no sinne, but also a worke pious and praise-worthy. But if those souldiers bee the naturall subiects of a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Prince,</hi> confederated with them, and that for common defence and interrest of good Gouernement, hee yeelds assistance vnto those <hi>Protestant Princes,</hi> and is thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tyed by couenants of allyance, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is so much the cleerer in regard of the Connexion of a <hi>Subiect</hi> to his <hi>Prince</hi>:for <hi>Subiects</hi> are bound by the diuine Law to helpe on the interests of their <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> neither doe they commit any sinne by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating and conforming themselues vnto them. And hereupon the <hi>Confessor</hi> hath done great wrong to denie those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men their absolution, but much greater iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hath hee in this Case done the <hi>Prince</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:17246:33"/>
himselfe. And he well deserues to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, because indirectly it must tend to the condemnation of leagues already made, and of the succours which shall hereafter bee yeelded vnto them. The which action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that of it selfe it is iniurious and vniust, in making that to bee a sinne which is none, becomes yet the worse, because it is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and wrought into Confession. And surely the rule of good policie requires, that a temeritie and petulancie of that excesse should bee ressented, That a religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons minde should serue him to condemne the <hi>Determinations</hi> of his <hi>Prince,</hi> which haue beene made according to all the rules of Wisedome, and for reasons of good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement; of which a priuate man cannot be capable, much lesse become a Iudge or Censurer.</p>
            <p>But if absolution could not bee denied by reason of habitation, or because they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in fauour of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> it might perhaps bee denyed, by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice of that warre, especially seeing these Gentlemen were not the subiects of the <hi>Prince</hi> that made the warre, and so were no


<pb facs="tcp:17246:33"/>
way hereunto commanded, but vndertooke it voluntarily, and therefore are in the state of sinne.</p>
            <p>This is the last point, which I will dispatch very briefely, because all the <hi>Doctors</hi> doe agree, That the warre whereby the <hi>State</hi> that is possest is preserued (and therefore a warre defensiue) can hardly entertaine a doubt that it is not iust. And among the causes, which the skilfull in both the <hi>Lawes</hi> and the <hi>Summists</hi> also, alleage to make the warre iust, the necessitie of Defence doth euer ranke it selfe in the first place. So that without tedious allegations, it will suffice to conclude this businesse with the words of <hi>Couarruvias,</hi> That amongst other reasons which are held most iust whereupon to ground a warre, that is aboue them all the best approoued, and vnto which, all causes else which are alleaged, may bee referred or reduced, which is vndertaken for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the <hi>Common wealth,</hi> and defence of ones owne <hi>Dominion</hi> or <hi>Countries</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appertaining: for so it tendeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the defence of a mans owne life and goods. This cause then of defence doth


<pb facs="tcp:17246:34"/>
exceedingly iustifie the warre, because it is fauoured and authorised by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> so that a priuate man may assist in a defensiue warre. And that the war which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> make is of this nature, that is to say, a <hi>Defensiue,</hi> it appeares out of the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the fact, because they are those that are inuaded by the armies of the <hi>King of Spaine,</hi> and euer stand on their guard, and vpon the <hi>Defensiue.</hi> And it is so farre from question, that a <hi>Defensiue</hi> warre is euer iust, except there bee such circumstances to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it vniust, as can hardly sinke into a mans imagination, that it is an vndeniable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine amongst the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> That although the partie assailed haue deserued by his own fault or offence, to haue warre made vpon him, yet for all that, it shall bee lawfull for him to defend himselfe. And if in his own defence hee must take armes and fall to blowes, yet shall it bee iust in him so to doe, not onely by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheh man to repell force with force, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because the omission of a mans necessary defence, causeth him to commit his owne life, state, and honour to the discretion of


<pb facs="tcp:17246:34"/>
others, and many times of souldiers, of whose excesses and vsuall deportments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mens liues, honours, and goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no lesse licencious in sacred than in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane matters, examples are too too frequent and notorious. Moreouer, though the war should be mooued for lawfull pretensions, &amp; <hi>Restitutions,</hi> yet would the defence be iust: For the <hi>Ciuilian</hi> sayth, That the <hi>Assailant</hi> would not bee content with such <hi>Restitution</hi> as were iust, neither could hee containe the furie of his souldiers, that they should not passe the measure of iustice. And the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Liuy</hi> is receiued as an Oracle, <hi>That to him the warre is euer iust vnto whome it is necessarie;</hi> and it is pious and religious for them to take <hi>Armes</hi> who haue no hope but in <hi>Armes,</hi> the which euer falleth out in <hi>Defensiue</hi> warres.</p>
            <p>And if any should from hence make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, that then the war might be iust on both sides, which is denied by the writers of <hi>Cases of Conscience;</hi> I say, first, that this ought not to seeme so great an inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, because they themselues, and the best grounded <hi>Diuines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> doe teach,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:35"/>
That in some Cases the warre may be iust on both parts: On the one, out of Truth; on the other, <hi>Juris praesumptione.</hi> For warre betweene those that know no Superiour, is like a suit in Law: and as it is impossible that both the litigant parties should haue reason on their side, and yet both of them may haue a iust cause to sue, because it appeareth not on which side reason standeth, vntill the <hi>Iudge</hi> by his sentence shall decide it: And yet in this Case no man will euer make doubt, that the <hi>Defendant</hi> ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the <hi>Court</hi> whereunto hee is drawne, but all the doubt will rest on the <hi>Plaintifes</hi> side: So in a war betweene <hi>Soueraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as in a suit, although both parties cannot haue equall iustice in the <hi>Cause,</hi> yet may they both haue iust occasion to commence it, for it may bee doubtfull on which side the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son resteth, but it will bee cleere that the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed</hi> makes a iust warre, and the question cannot fall but on the <hi>Aggressor.</hi> And to speake truth, it is a fancy which mens braines doe frame vnto themselues, but reason doth no way comply with it, That any man should take on him to iudge of the warres which


<pb facs="tcp:17246:35"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make, as heretofore some haue done of the <hi>Schismes</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> That there hauing beene a matter of fiftie seuerall <hi>Schismes,</hi> yet they which had iustice and right on their side did euer remaine the Conquerors: whereupon of fiue examples whereof wee read, <hi>John the tenth, Leo the ninth, Pius the second, Gregory the sixt,</hi> and <hi>Iulius the second,</hi> from the first of these to the last, the three intermediate <hi>Popes</hi> were ouerthrowne, and two of those were taken prisoners, one of them (<hi>Leo the ninth</hi>) being a <hi>Cannonised Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> in our memory haue in a manner made warre against all the <hi>Princes</hi> of the world, directly or indirectly. In the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>New world,</hi> they haue seised on an infinitie of Countries, made a world of free-borne people slaues, and become the Lords and Masters of the liues and goods of those that were the antient proprietaries of them. They haue attempted <hi>England,</hi> &amp; falne vpon <hi>Ireland</hi> in a very open and notorious manner: They haue vndermined <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Leagues</hi> which were christned Holy, and with rebellions of the subiects that


<pb facs="tcp:17246:36"/>
belonged to that Crowne. They haue made warre with the <hi>Princes of Germanie</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp names in trust to iustifie the same. The most famous <hi>Republicke of Venice,</hi> the <hi>Duke of Sauoy,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> with the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe, may witnesse what his goodnesse hath done to <hi>Italy,</hi> where they sacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and made the <hi>Pope</hi> prisoner. And they speake it openly and aloude, <hi>That a great Empire cannot subsist without warre.</hi> Is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that iustice should euer stand on their side, except it be after the profession of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, That God fauoured him that had most power? and is it sufficient to cleere the iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the warre, although they should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the very Heauen it selfe, because for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth they begin it?</p>
            <p>But the difference is too large, to speake of a matter in <hi>Thesi,</hi> and to discourse of the same in <hi>Hypothesi.</hi> Let vs draw neerer to the particular Case, and let vs giue it for granted, though not for true, That the <hi>King of Spaine</hi> hath reason, be it what it will bee, to make warre against the <hi>States,</hi> although they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the contrarie; and that he first out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them by the debauchment of their


<pb facs="tcp:17246:36"/>
Councellors and subiects, by seminating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them seditions in <hi>State,</hi> and diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Religion,</hi> of which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Religious</hi> persons haue beene made the Ministers and inciters, by breach of publike Faith in Truces which hee was sworne to keepe, &amp; by planting a pleasant credulitie in them, till as it were by a signall giuen, hee might vniustly and suddenly take armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. But as I sayd, Let the truth hereof appeare as it may; I would in the meane time but aske the good Conscience of this <hi>Confessor,</hi> or of others that direct and bend him, Whiles the <hi>Spaniard</hi> resolues to assault that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> makes his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and his armies are in motion, what should the <hi>States</hi> doe? are they idle and at leasure to waite on the discretion of their Enemies, and pray them not to passe the bounds of iust Restitution? If this bee the Case, and that his pretence be to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Master of those <hi>Prouinces</hi> by <hi>Armes,</hi> who can then rest secure of their liues, and of their wiues honors, when they shall suffer him to seise on the <hi>Country</hi> without taking vp weapons to resist him? These are prettie tales


<pb facs="tcp:17246:37"/>
to tell by the fires side for recreation, not persuasions to be represented to the <hi>Maiestie</hi> of <hi>Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it should fall into deliberation and Counsell, Whether it were fit to make warre, or no? an examination of the iustice or iniustice of the quarrell might then be admitted: But my <hi>Reuerend Confessor</hi> takes on him, like a <hi>Prince</hi> engaged in warre many yeares since. What doth he thinke? That hee is brought hither to bee the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Vmpire,</hi> whether the warre on the <hi>States</hi> side bee right or wrong; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee is, <hi>Ex Tripode,</hi> to pronounce his sentence? To say troth, men of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding do strangely wonder, and <hi>Princes</hi> haue a iust subiect to bee highly displeased, and deepely to ressent the timeritie and petulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of some <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Confessors,</hi> who pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the confines of their Office in <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> prouoke <hi>Soueraignetie,</hi> and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Censurers</hi> of the actions of <hi>Princes.</hi> A <hi>Prince</hi> can no sooner procure a Contribution, or lay on an Imposition, but they will straight sit vpon it as <hi>Iudges,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cause be iust or vniust. The same


<pb facs="tcp:17246:37"/>
Masteries they would play in Confederacies of peace &amp; war: and yet all this were in some sort tollerable, if they did it in relation meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to themselues, but the importance of it lyes in this, That they taint the fidelitie of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in <hi>Confession,</hi> they put the <hi>Prince</hi> into scuruie apprehensions, they perturbe the Consciences of publicke Ministers, and they do insensibly worke such mischief, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enemies of the <hi>State</hi> cannot desire more.</p>
            <p>Miserable is the condition of the <hi>Reason of State,</hi> That beeing a Reason diuine, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, free, and independant, it should yet be fettered with the Censures of those, who are no way capable to discerne of it: and that the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Warre</hi> being likewise held, as indeed it is, a Soueraigne reason, must be inthralled, I will not say to the iudgement, but to the capriciousnesse of one that cannot by any meanes attaine to know the true grounds that are to gouerne it. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>Statesmen</hi> haue much doubted, whether it were possible to giue iudgement touching the iustnesse of a warre: For whosoeuer will determine the iustnesse of it, must of necessitie ordaine it by circumscribing the


<pb facs="tcp:17246:38"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ame with certaine Lawes, by which the iustice of warre is to be regulated: but so it would leaue to be a supreame and soueraign Reason.</p>
            <p>But to let alone those disputes, one thing is so certaine that no man can denie it, That a common or publicke good, is superior to any good that is priuate, and this ought to be ruled by that; and that to attempt the vse of the contrarie, is the ruine of the <hi>State,</hi> and the peruersion of all Lawes both Diuine and Humane.</p>
            <p>The care of the <hi>Common good, God</hi> hath together with <hi>Soueragnetie,</hi> committed vnto the <hi>Prince</hi>: for it is his office alone to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the meanes of conseruing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this <hi>Good,</hi> whether it bee by imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or by warre, or by leagues, or by any other course whatsoeuer. And hee that in this point shall intermedle or make himselfe a <hi>Iudge</hi> and <hi>Censurer,</hi> whether he be <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> or other, hee offends against <hi>Soueraigntie,</hi> and worketh against that respect and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is by <hi>Nature</hi> instilled, and in the <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> by <hi>God</hi> himselfe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and which euery one ought to carry


<pb facs="tcp:17246:38"/>
toward the <hi>Prince,</hi> who is <hi>Gods Vicegerent</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant</hi> in the Gouernement of the <hi>State.</hi> And therefore Godly men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable <hi>Priests</hi> haue the deliberations of <hi>Princes</hi> in veneration, &amp; doe not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <hi>Judges</hi> of them. As for the miserable subterfuge of such as excuse themselues, That they doe not become <hi>Judges</hi> in these Cases of <hi>Princes,</hi> but that the warre may bee vniust out of the notoriousnesse of the fact, it is not applyable to our present purpose; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause first it may bee replied, <hi>Quo iure,</hi> is it notorious? by the <hi>Cannon</hi> or <hi>Ciuile</hi> Law? But these are inferiour and not superior to the Reason of warre. Againe, is it notorious by reason of the <hi>Publicke Good,</hi> or of the <hi>Priuate?</hi> If by this, why this must be subiect and giue way vnto the <hi>Publicke</hi>? If by the <hi>Publicke,</hi> the care of that appertaines to the <hi>Prince.</hi> And lastly, these euasions take no place in warre that is vndertaken for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary defence.</p>
            <p>If after all this it should bee sayd, That <hi>Lawyers,</hi> besides the iustice of the Cause in warre, doe looke after, and that in the first place, the iustice and right of the


<pb facs="tcp:17246:39"/>
               <hi>Dominion, Bellum iustum, Iustitia Imperij,</hi> it would bee an intollerable impudence in a <hi>Priest,</hi> without any regard had of that which passed in the <hi>Truce,</hi> wherein the <hi>States</hi> were by the <hi>King of Spaine</hi> himselfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for Soueraigne, Independant, and Lawfull, that hee should passe so farre, as to arrogate to himselfe the examination of <hi>Dominions,</hi> and the titles of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ordaine himselfe <hi>Iudge</hi> of Temporall <hi>States and Seigniories.</hi> Whereas the Holy <hi>Writ</hi> commands, That we should looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these matters no further, than to hold those <hi>Princes</hi> that raigne, to bee appointed by <hi>God</hi> himselfe. And scarsely is it permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teed to <hi>Soueraigne Princes</hi> to enter into the titles of <hi>Dominion</hi> which the <hi>States,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue; and for priuate persons, they ought not to make any iudgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, but by the possession, leauing the rest to Almightie God, who transferreth Rule and Dominion by those meanes which seeme aptest and best vnto his Diuine Prouidence. And if it should be held fit to follow the opinions of others, especiall of the parties interessed, in decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,


<pb facs="tcp:17246:39"/>
Who Rules with iust and vniust titles; the world would be reduced to very few <hi>Princes,</hi> and by this time there would haue beene one <hi>Spirituall Pope,</hi> and one <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall King,</hi> or else one sole <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> and <hi>Temporall Monarke.</hi>
