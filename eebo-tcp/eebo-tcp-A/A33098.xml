            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NOt being able in ſo little Time, as is uſually allowed to Sermons, to go ſufficiently through all the Points of this; I was forc'd, when I preach'd it, to touch ſeverals of them but very lightly. I was therefore deſired by ſome, who have no ordinary Influence with me, to Write out the whole to a full and proportionable length, and then to publiſh it. Yet I have not altered any thing I had in my Papers, before I went to the Pulpit: Having only added what I thought moſt requiſite to clear the Subject I was handling. I confeſs it has ſwell'd to a Bulk I did not foreſee, even when I gave the firſt Sheets to the Preſs. But I ſhall be content that the greateſt Cenſures fall upon this. And I doubt not but many will be ſatisfied to ſee this Text ſo fully diſcuſt. Neither am I the firſt that has converted a Sermon into a Book: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the famous Doctor <hi>Barrow;</hi> beſides ſeveral others. What-ever faults the Stile and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb facs="tcp:54328:3"/>
are guilty of, muſt in ſome part be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to my want of Health all the time I was writing it; and ſo to its going by Peice-meal to the Printers, as my conveniency would allow me to have it ready for them. Its other eſcapes muſt alſo in ſome manner be imputed to my not being at Home, where one is wont to have more compoſed Thoughts, and ſome Books alſo. I know it may be askt, why then ſhould I have thus adventur'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? But I ask alſo, whether or not every man knows how long it ſhall pleaſe God to preſerve him in Health? And whether or not ſome Exigencies do not admit of common delays? However I fear not to ſtand by its fate. Only I muſt earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that none would paſs their Judgment upon any Part or Sentence of this Diſcourſe, till once they have ſeriouſly read it all over; that then they may conſider what relation and dependance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one Part and another, and betwixt all the Parts, ſeverally taken, and the Whole together. What elſe I would ſay by way of Preface, will be found in the Body of the Diſcourſe it ſelf.</p>

               <bibl>ROM. 13. 5.</bibl>
               <q>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the peculiar Excellency and Perfection of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, beyond any other Inſtitution that was ever ſet up in the World, that, what-ever corner of it we ſhall turn about, it does ſtill ſhow it ſelf to be of a piece, to be throughly adapted for rendering Mankind compleatly happy, both as to this life, and as to that which is to come. For Peace and Felicity are but two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent words for the ſame thing; as might largely be demonſtrated throughout all the ſeveral inſtances that relate to the divers Aſpects of it under thoſe two denominations: And our moſt holy Religion does not only ſecure to us the peace of our Conſciences toward God, and the inward peace of thoſe Powers and Faculties that are lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within our Beeings amongſt themſelves; but alſo that outward peace and tranquillity, whereby, as we are Members of Societies and Common-wealths, we are Cemented together, are Incorporated into one accompliſhed Body and Conſtitution. So that whoever frames himſelf according to the Genius of true Chriſtianity, cannot but be at peace with his God, with Himſelf, and with all Men too; and ſo of neceſſity he muſt be entirely happy and bleſſed alſo.</p>
            <p>This indeed is the great and noble deſign of our Reaſon. And what-ever that has ſuffered ſince the Fall, yet it has always preſerved ſo much ſtrength as was ſufficient to purſue, in one degree or other, ſuch an Univerſal Peace. And therefore, in order to that end, ſome kind of Religion has ever been retain'd in all Ages, and by all ſorts of Men; as the only Mean immediatly Dictated by the Light of Nature to compaſs it. For the apprehenſion of ſome Supream Beeing never fail'd to poſſeſs their Minds, nor ſome ſecret pangs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54328:4"/>
and horrour upon any vitious Neglect or Performance to cruciat and torment them; nor yet the jealouſie of Privat Security in a Common-wealth, out of which none could live, to moleſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them. And ſo they always found Religion to be the only way to appeaſe their God, to calm and compoſe their Conſciences, and to ſettle their Intereſt in the World. And upon that account the deſign of Reaſon and Religion has been ſtill ſo much of a ſide, that, as God had blended theſe two together in the firſt Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Nature, ſo what-ever progreſs the one made, the other followed cloſs upon it. And hence alſo it has come to paſs that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ever Adopted to be Religion, even by the wildeſt Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, which attempted to ſet looſe the old <hi>Chaos</hi> upon the World, as if to recover its ancient Spoils; or to involve all Mankind into Diſcord and Bitterneſs, Wrath and Violence, both toward them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and toward all other Beeings whatſoever. An <hi>Hobbeſian</hi> ſtate of Nature it may perhaps be dream'd to be. But as it acts the Giant againſt Heaven, and the mad Dog againſt it ſelf; ſo it does the Wolf and the Tiger againſt its Fellows. And conſequently the beſt Character it ever attain'd to, went no higher, than to be conſtrued, as well as call'd, Impiety, Fury, and Cruelty. Such ingenuous and proper accounts of things has the very remoteſt, the very obſcureſt inſtinct of Religion, that is eſſentially interwoven with the Reaſonable Minds of Men, obliged them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their acquired fierceneſs, to entertain. Wherefore as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nature ſhrinks even at the apprehenſion of all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, inſobriety, and unrighteouſneſs; ſo no ſpurious or pretended Religion can be more convincingly upbraided as ſuch, than when it is redargu'd of owning any ſuch Principle or Tenet as in its conſequence introduces any of theſe; or when it is hiſs'd off the Stage for maintaining what at long run comes forcibly to contradict the moſt Vulgar Notion, that ever was imagin'd of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by any of the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>Yet nevertheleſs it cannot be denyed but that ſuch hath been the degeneracy and corruption, and ſuch the odd miſtakes and fond
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54328:4"/>
deluſions of the moſt part of Mankind, that in ſtead of performing thoſe ſuitable Duties which are incumbent from Religion, when they ſaid, and it may be thought too, that they were going about them; They have made the very Name of Religion to truckle to the uglieſt Profaneneſs and Vice, to the moſt infamous Barbarity and Wickedneſs; and have perverted it unto a Mask, to ſerve the turn of thoſe Deſigns that thwarted moſt the ſignification of it, and caſt the fulſomeſt Scandal even upon Humane Nature it could be reproached with. But no more can be gathered from this, but that there is no ſmall inconſiſtency betwixt the Reaſon and Frailty of Mankind; and that things may be imployed in a Relative Senſe, when they cannot in an Abſolute one. For however much men may ſwerve from the Native Dictats and Suggeſtions of their own Souls, when they are to reduce them to practice, yet nothing can be more certain than that none ever promiſcuouſly uſ'd, either the Titles, or the Conceptions, they had of Religion, with thoſe they had of Sacriledge, Debauchery, or Murder, as both Religion and they are viewed in their Genuine Colours.</p>
            <p>But as on the one hand, there has ever appear`d ſuch a Dawn, and Sparkling Glimmerings of Religion among Men; So on the other, they have never been able ſo to come up to the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin'd and ſublimated Notion of it, but that they have bungled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in their moſt elabourated Contrivances, and have ſadly blurr'd over that Copy, they endeavoured to draw from ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine an Original. Their neareſt Reſemblances were ſtill Faint, and the livelieſt, vivideſt Repreſentations they could form, bore but rudly the Picture of the Beauty of Holineſs. As their thoughts were narrow and cloudy; ſo their Religion was always puddled and imperſit; it ſavoured more of the polluted Subject, than of the brighteſt Object of one; and at beſt, it was but the Dwarfe and Abridgement of their own Aims. Their Fears prompted them to ſnatch hold of the firſt Crocodile they could get by the Tail, to be the Divinity, which they ſhould adore, Their Shame chiefly reſtrain'd them from thoſe outward Enormities, which raiſ'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54328:5"/>
and the Bluſh in a Modeſt Face; And it was moſtly their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that mounded them within certain confines they ſaw were not to be tranſgreſſed without engaging a Pother about their ears. And thus all the while their Devotion was really, but the reſult of an Adventure; their Vertue the limits of a moderat Extravagance; and their Humanity and Alledgance the Police of Craft and Suttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And even as to all this they had no ſolid ty upon them, no ſufficient Baſis upon which to ſetle their Model: Nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make them over-leap all the bounds of their Religion, but only ſuch convenient occaſions, as the Secret Benfil of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit, was conſtantly ſpringing out after.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Religion, which, having proceeded from the Almighty himſelf, could not but have many ſuch Poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Strokes in it, as did abundantly atteſt by whoſe Finger it was faſhioned. But as they were a rugged and peeviſh People, ſo there was a certain exigence, that their Diſpenſation ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, and proportion'd to the grain of their Temper. And therefore, as their Worſhip of the Deity was heavily loaded with a croud of carnal Obſervances, and as the Defilement that had crept over their hearts, was much to be purged away by bodily ablutions; ſo their Kindneſs to all the World: beſides thoſe of their own Nation, was ſhrivelled up into a very little Sphere; and the Obedience they were to pay to their Governours (as that Word is to be taken in the General, for all thoſe under whoſe Yoke they ſhould happen to fall) was but built on <hi>Wrath,</hi> on that daſtardly awe which the dread of Temporal Puniſhment compels unto; they having no ſpecial Obligation upon their Conſciences from any Law, that particulary related to that Duty.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it was by the Divine Providence reſerved to our Bleſſed Saviour, to bring from Heaven with him, the exacteſt Form that could beſt qualifie Mankind for that Fellowſhip with God, with the Holy Angels, and among themſelves, which is to make up the Glory of that Place. And the <hi>fulneſs of time,</hi> at which he took upon him the form of a Servant, was little leſs ſo upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54328:5"/>
of our need of a <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> than of a Redeemer to be crucified for our ſins. Then were we inſtructed to <hi>worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, to follow peace with all men,</hi> and to <hi>be ſubject, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had not inſiſted ſo long upon that eminent advantage our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion carries over any other, either Profeſſion, or Religion, that ever went before it; nor had ſo fully run the parallel betwixt thoſe two Branches of it, that relate to our God, and our Selves, and That which concerns our Neighbours, and our being Subject to a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power; but that thence I have laid much of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I intend by this Diſcourſe. And certainly ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as is the Drift of this, and all other Texts in the New Teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament to this purpoſe, cannot but be highly endear'd to us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by its being ſo very peculiar to that Holy Faith upon which we reſt all the Hope of our Immortal Souls, as to have kept an equal pace with all thoſe Fundamental Excellencies of it, which raiſ'd it ſo far above, either the attempts of the greateſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that ſhone moſt conſpicuouſly in the Heathen World; or even thoſe Sublimer Communications, that God himſelf conveyed to his choſen People, by the Adminiſtration of his grand Prophet <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I come to ſpeak more cloſely to the Theme of my Text. And therefore I ſhall, through the aſſiſtance of God, ſhew</p>

               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That thoſe Motives by which it recommends ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto us, do fix the moſt immoveable Hinges, upon which any Government can ſurelieſt turn.</item>

            <p>To begin then with the firſt; Were there no more in all the New Teſtament but this Text, and the four foregoing, with the two ſubſequent Verſes, to devolve the obligation of this Subjection upon all Chriſtians; none of them would ever find a ſhift whereby to divert it, unleſs they ſhould furniſh themſelves at the ſame time with ſuch a ſtore of Evaſions and Subterfuges as might quite baffle and evacuate the entire ſcope of the whole Book. For what can be more pat and expreſs for any thing, than is here the Apoſtles command for this Duty? Not only does he directly condeſcend upon the Matter it ſelf, <hi>be ſubject to the higher Powers;</hi> Not only does he ſpread the Bond of it over the whole Race of Mankind in whatever condition or circumſtances, <hi>let every ſoul be ſubject;</hi> Not only does he back his Command with the moſt irrefragable Arguments, <hi>for there is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordained of God: whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God;</hi> Not only does he declare the end for which theſe Powers were appointed by God, and conſequently preſs home the Reaſon why we ſhould be ſubject to them, <hi>for they are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God to us for good; and bear not the Sword in vain, but as revengers to execute wrath upon them that do evil;</hi> Not only does he thence infer the Title that theſe Powers have to our Subjection e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the point of the ſtricteſt Juſtice, <hi>Render therefore to them their dues, for they are Gods Miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing;</hi> Not only does he animate all with the moſt cogent Peſwaſives, <hi>they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation, wherefore he ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake;</hi> But does alſo in the moſt peremptory terms ſhow from all this the abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity of being ſubject, <hi>wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject.</hi> So that we ſhall hardly find any other Precept in all the Chriſtian Law, either more particularly determined, or more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly impos'd, than this of being ſubject to the Higher Powers.</p>
            <p>But that God, who atteſts all his Works towards Mankind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54328:6"/>
with a Cloud of Witneſſes, has by his Providence ordered that to the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be joyned in laying on this Duty of Subjection. And he has no leſs punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſet it forth in his firſt Epiſtle and ſecond Chapter, and 13, 14, 15, and 16 Verſes, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake; whether it be to the King as ſupreme or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well; For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men; as free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.</hi> Theſe words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are ſo very plain that ſcarcely any Comment upon them could make them more ſo.</p>
            <p>There could have been but one ſtep more; namely the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Confirmation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; which in all matters depending ſo much upon his Authority, as this does, gives the laſt touch and finiſhing to them. And this too we have ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that He, not only made a peculiar Reſponſe on the Head; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which was a ſignal Acceſſion, ſet all his Followers an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as much fraughted with his Doctrine, as this was with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. The Riſe then he got to the firſt, was when the <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> upon a very inſidious deſign asked him, St. <hi>Mark</hi> chap. 12. ver. 14. <hi>Is it lawful to give tribute to</hi> Ceſar, <hi>or not? ſhall we give, or ſhall we not give?</hi> And for anſwer; He firſt calls for a peice of their Money, that by their acknowledging, from the Image and Superſcription it carried, that the Original was their <hi>Ceſar,</hi> their Soveraign, he might out of their own Mouths eſtabliſh their being Subjects unto him: and then he tells them they ſhould <hi>render to</hi> Ceſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Ceſars, <hi>and to God the things that are Gods;</hi> as if he had ſaid, whatever belongs of right to your Prince by the Laws of his Dominion over you, be ſure to detain nothing of it from him; and therefore if upon this reſpect you owe him any Tribute, forbear not to pay it to the laſt Farthing. So that our Saviour propos'd to them the general Principle of Subjection accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Goſpel; and left no more to them to do, but only to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54328:7"/>
ſubſume and infer in a Caſe that admitted of no doubt or ſcruple. But it is further obſervable, that he ſubjoyns theſe words, <hi>and to God the things that are Gods;</hi> as to let them underſtand that no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their <hi>Ceſar</hi> ought to entrench upon that which God exacts of them; So to ſtate the Compariſon betwixt the Obligation from his Doctrine to perform their bounden Duty to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and that from Religion in the general to be ſubject unto the <hi>Rights</hi> God has over his Creatures. For the whole complext of the Sentence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that they were no leſs conſcienciouſly to acquit themſelves in all reſpective points to the Former, than they were to the Latter: ſince ſuch an immediat Poſition of any like two Clauſes together, naturally ſuggeſts, a mutual reference of Analogy from each other, where the Matter can bear it.</p>
            <p>And what he taught, he examplified in an inſtance ſo very deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that if any thing of that nature can be allowed to Preach, it cannot be denyed a moſt eminent ſhare of that. And this was when he himſelf <hi>payed the Tribute-money, leſt he ſhould have offended the Governours</hi> that were then in the Land, <hi>Matth.</hi> chap. 17. verſ. 27. He reaſoned the Caſe with St. <hi>Peter</hi> about the priviledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of the free-born Subjects; Strangers being then only obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to that Taxation. And tho none could have a better title upon which to plead his liberty from it, than he had; yet He rather choos'd even by a Miracle to ſatisfie the utmoſt exaction that was impos'd upon him, than to give any ground for jealouſie unto the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which he was living, as if he had in any manner of way ſeem'd to have call'd the Power of it in queſtion. But whoever ſhall conſider the whole Series of his Converſation among men, will find the moſt perfect Patern of Submiſſion to the higher Powers, that the very niceſt fancy could imagine to it ſelf: So that theſe muſt not at all be acquaint with the mere Hiſtory of his Life and Death, who are yet to learn any thing in that point. And, as he came to fulfil the Law, by undergoing all the external Purifications of it, tho he had no Sin; So, tho he had all Power in Heaven and in Earth given to him, yet he never ſtepped but one Hairs-breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54328:7"/>
the borders of that private Station, as a Subject, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted himſelf unto: not medling ſo far with any thing that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like Civil Authority, as even to umpire a ſmall Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Brothers, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. ver. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, both how very poſitive the New Teſtament is in binding this Subjection upon us, as well by Precept, as by Example; and alſo that to all the Obligations to it, either from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Policy of an eſtabliſhed Common-wealth, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion ſuperadds that of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and of <hi>obeying for the Lords ſake.</hi> I might bring down the Argument to the Lives of the Apoſtles, and to the Doctrine and Practice of the firſt and pureſt Lights of the Chriſtian Church throughout thoſe Centuries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Holy Faith flouriſh'd in its greateſt glory and perfection. But that were to launch out into an Ocean too vaſt for a Volum, and much more for a Sermon. And beſides, if what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged already be not ſufficient to convince any Mind, that is not hardned into Marble by its Obſtinacy, and then not I, but the Grace of God, muſt deal with it; I know not what elſe I could ſay, would do that. I have purpoſely forborn to take notice of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrical Debates to my Subject, that are eagerly bandied by ſome, as naturally ariſing from thoſe Texts I have cited: Since my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſs calls for no more, but only to clear the Point I have in hand from expreſs and uncontrovertible Scripture. Neither have I taken to Task any of theſe exceptions that men of ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions offer to thoſe Quotations; becauſe it cannot yet appear whether or not they meet with that Senſe and Meaning of theſe, which I am perſwaded is the only true one; and becauſe too it were an endleſs labour to anſwer all the vain Quirks and Whimſies that Prejudice thruſts into an eaſie Brain. Wherefore I go on to the ſecond thing propos'd;</p>
            <p>That the Obligation from Conſcience to be ſubject to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, layes the ſureſt foundation that can be for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the whole weight of Government from crumbling down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pieces. It is the very Rock upon which the Houſe is built; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54328:8"/>
all other engagments are but the rolling Sand, which every Wind of Tumult, and every Floud of Rebellion, drives from under the tottering Fabrick that leans upon it. The Law of Nature indeed were fully ſufficient to conſolidat the whole Structure; were it now capable to exert that entire vigour which is originally entwiſted with its very beeing. For that Law is ſober and unbyaſs'd Reaſon, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting all requiſite Means toward our Preſervation and Felicity: And all Governments owe their firſt riſe, to ſuch an end; &amp; are only yielded unto, as the moſt univerſal way to obtain it. And ſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the unadulterated Principles of pure Reaſon were exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, there would be no poſſibility there for any ſuch Invaſions upon the Government, as would in the event come to ſubvert it. Becauſe every individual Member of it acting rationally, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conform to the Genuine Deſigns of his own Intereſt, all would unanimouſly conſpire in promoting what all were equally concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in. But however much theſe plauſible Schemes may tickle and pleaſe the Fancy, when they are only conſidered by a Speculative Mind; yet they are no ſooner applyed to the Matter of Fact of all the preſent Governments in the World, than they vaniſh into meer Plat-forms for an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> Common-wealth. Then they are found too Thin and Aerial to underprop ſo huge a Load as is the whole bulk of a Government. And we may think as ſoon to rear a Caſtle upon our Summers Breath, as to put the ſtreſs of Government upon the Reaſon and Ingenuity of Mankind in that deprav'd eſtate it now wallows in. I told you before how much the Reaſon of Man is dimm'd and weakned ſince Sin got the Aſcendant over it; and how little competent Forces it is endowed with for atchieving ſo great an Affair, as is the ſettling the unalterable Poles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I preſume I need not tell you too, how much the whole Herd of boiſterous and unruly Paſſions grazes upon his Soul, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt devours all the remaining Sprouts of Reaſon in it, that ſtill are growing up, tho leaſurly, in ſpight of every Tusk that would grubb it out, and every Hoove that would trample it under. What haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and aſpiring Ambition puffs up the lofty Imaginations of ſome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54328:8"/>
People ſo, as nothing can put a ſtop to their climbing Deſigns, till either a Crown, or a Halter do it? What ſour Malice, What cankering Envy, Levell'd, either at a Diſappointment from the Throne, or the ſwoll'n Courtſhip of a happy Competitor, ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters the Gall of others, that nothing can allay its Venom, but the Swilling up the ſweet, becauſe ſatiating Blood of thoſe from whom ſuch an offence took its Birth? What unbounded Avarice and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs ſo Widens the deſires of others, as nothing can tollerably fill them, unleſs it be the whole Revenue of a Kingdom, and the expectation of what can be ſqueezed from the Subjects to Boot? And what Medling and Pragmatical Humor ſo buſies the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others, that their Volatile and Mercurial Diſpoſition can never be fixed till it be tempered with the Gold of the Diadem, or the Lead upon the Block? Would to God this day had never prov'd the fatal Demonſtration how ſadly ſuch unweildy Paſſions can triumph and vapour it over all the Rational Powers of Mankind! But I am not to foreſtall the allotted part of my Diſcourſe to this. Only how feeble were the Sinews of that Government, which deriv'd all their ſtrength from ſuch a defeated, ſuch a baffled, ſuch an emaſculated Reaſon?</p>
            <p>And as theſe fierceſt Paſſions do thus tranſport the <hi>Olivers,</hi> the huge Leviathans that ſwallow up the Soveraign Power: So do they furiouſly ſet a-work theſe Underling Scramblers, whoſe only Game it is to Angle in troubled Waters; Whoſe condition is already ſo low, that any Revolution may happen to improve it, but which none can render worſe; Or whoſe Piques and Animoſities againſt their Neighbours are ſo inveterate, and yet ſo cowardly, that, as it is only in a Confuſion they dare give the Stab, ſo they never fail to thruſt it home when they can have That; Or yet whoſe Itch and Affectation of being men of Intrigue and buſineſs makes unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to gape after Changes and Novelties, that may afford Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment enough to their reſtleſs, their impatient Fingers. Now when the <hi>Mobile,</hi> when the unthinking Multitude, is either put on the Wheels, and ſet a-going by thoſe more deſigning States-men,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54328:9"/>
who take advantage of its Temper, to bring about their own Turn; or elſe when it breaks out of its own accord into Sedition or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and involves all a-round into almoſt unquenchable Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Then muſt the Government, not be diſturbed, not ſhaken, nor endangered, but wholly un-hing'd and overturn'd; Unleſs that God who calms the roaring Billows of the raging Sea ſhall lend his Omnipotence to reſcue the ſinking State. And thus Reaſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at ſuch a loſs in all kinds of men, that a Supream Power that would lean upon it, would find it that bruiſed <hi>Egyptian</hi> Reed, which at once diſappoints, and wounds too.</p>
            <p>Shall we then think that the terror of Civil Sanctions can do the Feat? 'Tis true indeed that few conſiderations ſeldom conſtrain our obedience more, than thoſe apprehenſions and fears which the grim Aſpect of Death, of Poverty, or of Infamy, ſhoots into us: As alſo, we are not much wont to be allured unto our Duty by any Bait ſo forcibly, as by the Proſpects of Honour and Riches. And ſo, the Supream Governours having all theſe, as well on the one ſide, as on the other, much at their Diſpoſal; they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably enough concluded to have ſuch a hank upon our hands, as will ſufficiently keep us within a full ſubjection to them. And the preference we daily give to the enjoyments of this World before our biggeſt hopes of all that Eternity can beſtow upon us, does not a little confirm it. But yet, as you have freſhly heard, the Paſſions of Men are violent and head-ſtrong; and like ſome Rapid Torrent, can overflow all Banks, and impetuouſly bear down all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, even of Danger, or of Intereſt, they ſhall find in their way; but eſpecially when Both is but at the Venture, and This at a certain Remove has a more promiſing countenance than their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Poſſeſſion makes a ſhew of. There are beſides ſo many ſtrange Viciſſitudes and Alterations incident to Humane Affairs, as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afford occaſion to thoſe who are lying in wait for it, to ſet their fore-thought Conſpiracies a-work, and to burſt out into all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence that is needful for, firſt diſturbing, and then overturning, thoſe who are above them. Now the ſecret Thoughts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54328:9"/>
Clubbings and Caballings of Men, are not immediatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd to the Laſh of the Law; and all the Inſurrections in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpring from Plots and private Intrigues. Wherefore, as there will ever be thoſe whoſe Paſſions will inſtigate to miſchief, and whom favourable Conjunctures will invite to it; So that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can never be ſufficiently provided for, which has not Shakles upon the very Minds of Mankind, as well as upon their Hands, and Locks no leſs to the Doors of their Retirements, than to thoſe of their Priſons. And therefore unleſs a Civil Conſtitution could reach further than the Publick and notour actions of Men, it muſt be acknowledged to come vaſtly ſhort of what we are ſeeking. Add to all this, that every villany, every ſtroak at the Government, would be no leſs lawful, than it was proſperous. And ſo nothing could Cajole and Flatter to the hope of Succeſs, but what would proportionably encourage the blackeſt deſigns and undertakings.</p>
            <p>Wherefore without Conſcience all muſt depend upon a meer <hi>May-be,</hi> and good luck. But that once concurring with the Law of Nature, and that of the Government, the Hell it ſelf within us muſt break forth, and its Furies carry along its Confuſions with them, before ever the Soveraign Power can be ſhaken, and far leſs trip'd up. For Conſcience makes us <hi>content in every Condition,</hi> and not to be ſtill at Graſping more than is convenient for that Station Providence has aſſigned us. It ingadges us to <hi>put off all manner of Wrath, Anger, and Malice, to forbear one another, and to forgive our very Enemies, to do good for evil;</hi> And ſo Transforms us from the Vulture to the Dove, ſets our over-boiling and fermented Blood into an orderly Motion, and Suppreſſes all thoſe Storms within us, that are ſo apt to bluſter out in Tempeſt &amp; Thunder towards others. It teaches us <hi>not to care for the morrow,</hi> and <hi>to take no thought what we ſhall eat, drink or put on;</hi> and thereby contracts thoſe deſires which puſh us on to the moſt irregular Methods for ſatisfying them. And it confines us to our <hi>own buſineſs at home,</hi> that <hi>we be not Buſſie-bodies, or medale in other mens affairs;</hi> And therefore checks all thoſe firſt inclinations to vanity, that turn us out a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54328:10"/>
and let us ſeldom return, till we have gone about ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous Exploit or other. And thus it prevents the earlieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of thoſe Paſſions, that are wont to ſhock Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; and upon that account, it gives more ſecurity to Theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than any after Remedies can well be ſuppoſ'd to do.</p>
            <p>But it is alſo Conſcience that penetrats into the very inmoſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and receſſes of our hearts; that not only Preſcribeth to, but alſo over-awes all our thoughts, and moſt obſcure Actions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſtraitens us ſo, that we muſt, either manage our ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules ſet to us by our Religion, and ſo according to the Eternal Meaſures of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; or elſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie God Almighty, and all the Devils in the Bottomleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pit too. And however many Men may dare to out brave the utmoſt Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance that can threaten their Bodies from the torturing Inſtruments of an Executioner; Yet few are to be found of ſuch a Sanguine Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but that the fearful expectation of Judgement from Heaven upon their Souls, will Damp and Appal them, will make their honeſt Blood to ſhiver, &amp; ſhatter all their Bones upon one another; provided their carreer be not ſo very Furious, as not to allow them one moment for a Serious and Sedate Reflection. Now the great buſineſs of all Supream Power, is to procure Obedience and Submiſſion; and the great Springs upon which that moves, are Hope and Fear: And conſequently that will always prove moſt effectual to all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Government, which propoſeth the moſt tranſcendent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and Puniſhments; and which extends thoſe moſt to all the Capacities we poſſeſs, as to all the Faculties by which we can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merit, or become Guilty. And ſo when Conſcience obliges to no more, but a ſhort, and yet <hi>peaceable and quiet life, in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty,</hi> under thoſe whom Providence has plac'd over us; and when it enſures a Crown of Glory afterwards, for an orderly Subjection here, and a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone in the World to come, for having embroil'd and confounded the Affairs of this; when, I ſay, Conſcience does ſo, what can be more proper to anſwer the end of Government, than it is? In a word, by Conſcience our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54328:10"/>
Alledgance is equally ſecured to our Soveraign, and to our God; and we cannot Rebel againſt the Powers on Earth, but we muſt Flie in the Face of Thoſe in Heaven alſo. Our Souls are the Pawn of our Subjection; and we cannot incroach upon This, but we muſt forefeit That, with all the Felicity we can ever lay claim to, when this World, and all the Glory of it, has drawn its Skreen upon us. And beyond this, the Wit of Man cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any more preſsing, and inviolable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ty. But as Conſcience does thus reſtrain us from all Aſſaults upon the Soveraign: So when one has fortun'd to prevail over him, to Juſtle him out of his Rightful Poſſeſſion, and to uſurp all the Power himſelf; even then Conſcience will attack him. It will force the Scepter from that hand, that has unjuſtly ſnatcht hold of it, that it may be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the true Owner. At leaſt it will convert that Scepter unto a Mace of Iron, to break his Sleep who violently retains it, to powder his pleaſanteſt Dreams, and to cruſh his quiet in pieces. And this was the Fate of that horrid Uſurper <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> after he had Seized the Inheritance of the Royal Martyr of this day. For it was obſerved by all about him, eſpecially that year before his death, what Quackings and Convulſions he ſuffered in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and under what dreadful terrours he laboured; doubling and re-doubling his Guards, as if he had felt himſelf under <hi>Cains</hi> fears, that every one that ſhould find him, would kill him. And ſuch Palpable Indications there were, that the Worm that never dies, had already begun to gnaw upon his soul, to <hi>torment him before hand;</hi> That our moſt extended Charity toward him, will allow him no milder thoughts, than that his Reſigning the Power he had Sacrilegiouſly made himſelf Maſter of on Earth, was at once to leave it for him to whom it did juſtly belong, and to undergo the Slavery of another Region, more ſuiteable to his Crimes, and to his Genius too: This, I ſay, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of him; unleſs that Mercy, which is infinite, did vouchſafe ſuch a Wretch Repentance, like that of the Theif upon the Croſs, to prove a ſecond evidence what Mercy can do, and how
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54328:11"/>
Hell when it gapes wideſt can be fruſtrated. And hence Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtricks as much againſt all the flattering hope of Succeſs, and even Succeſs it ſelf; as againſt any of thoſe unlawful Paſſions, which either prompt, or carry foreward the Attempts of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects upon their Soveraign. And ſo it ſecures the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on all hands; becauſe it univerſally reaches everything that may execute a Deſign againſt it, or even may keep it under, when it has unfortunatly come to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it was the Policy, tho not the Religion, of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> that made him lay the firſt Stones of his Empire upon the belief of the Gods. And <hi>Matchiavell</hi> himſelf could invent no more ſuitable Maxime for the ſecurity of his Prince, than <hi>Si vis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere Plebem, finge Deum.</hi> And upon this accompt it was that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the firſt, was once of the deſign to have added the Papal Miter to the Imperial Diadem. Therefore alſo did <hi>Mahomet</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it Sacriledge to attempt the Throne, and entail his Paradiſe upon thoſe who ſhould enſlave themſelves to it. And hence it is, that the ſtouteſt calumny that was ever fixt upon Conſcience by thoſe that had gone fartheſt into Athieſm itſelf, never mounted higher, than that it was but a certain Tool and Wheedle for advancing the Intereſt of the State; all kinds of Men, however familiar they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Conſcience, being ſtill conſcious of it's Subſerviency to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>But here it muſt be obſerved, that what I have ſaid of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the general, muſt be underſtood of ſuch a one, as is only founded upon a true Religion. I deny not that a blind and falſe Zeal may produce the ſame Effects for a while, which the moſt well grounded Conviction can do. Yet, if the Bottom be weak, the Superſtructure cannot be ſtrong. And a falſe Religion is ſo far from being a ſufficient ſecurity for any Government, that it is the only wonder why it does not always redound to the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to it, that it can ſuffer. For nothing bolſters up any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that is not true, but, either Ignorance, or Paſſion. But the firſt ſtep from being deceived in any thing, is to learn that we were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54328:11"/>
ſo: and we can no ſooner do this, than we muſt reject and caſt off that. Paſſion alſo is but the ſudden Flaſh of an unſteady Mind, and is as lyable to vary, as the Wind is to vere about from all Quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo that Religion which goes no deeper than theſe two, may indeed chance to continue a long time; but if it do ſo, it is only by Chance that it does it. And therefore all Governours whoſe Subjects were in a wrong Perſwaſion, had need in time to caſt about for ſome other more permanent Baſis upon which to build their Security, than the Conſciences of their People in that eſtate could afford. And, unleſs upon the very firſt detection of the Error, the Truth ſhall alſo be diſcovered; and 'tis many an odds to one if it happens ſo; the having been cheated by a pretended Religion were enough to make all thoſe Bonds it impos'd, as well as to the Magiſtrat, as to any other Being, be flung away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not without a certain diſdain and rage for having ever been ſo miſerably gull'd and befool'd. But whatever a falſe Conſcience can do, yet it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be controverted but that a True one can do as much, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more too.</p>
            <p>I might now from all this draw ſeveral Inferences, which tho a little out of my Road, might not be thought wholly impertinent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall only mention this one; That therefore it is the Intereſt of all Government to ſettle and eſtabliſh the true Religion by the moſt ſacred and inviolable Laws that poſſibly can prove effectual to ſuch a purpoſe. And tho there were nothing of Intereſt in all this; yet by the very Rules of Juſtice and Gratitude no leſs could be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any Government to that which tends ſo much to uphold and preſerve it; unleſs it ſhould not do, as it is done by. And this I leave to the Senſe of all the World.</p>
            <p>But now an Objection to what I have been ſaying, and which lyes heavily upon the Minds of many, offers it ſelf in our way. And it is, That indeed this Draught about Conſcience is very agreeable and taking; But yet nevertheleſs, when all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions in the World are impartially viewed, it appears that there happens as few, and as little ſtrange Revolutions in thoſe,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54328:12"/>
who either have no Conſcience at all, or at beſt but a very Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious one, whereupon to ſettle their Foundations; as among us, who make the moſt Flouriſhing and Splendid Pretentions to the beſt Form of Religion, that ever went under that Title.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs that our Chriſtianity has been ſo ill abuſed by us, that inſtead of our being conformed by it, to the Image of its Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Author, the event has rather Metamorphoſ'd us to that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Shape, which ends in a cloven Foot. And thus, tho none have ever gloried more in any thing, than we have in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; yet were our Lives and Practiſes throughly Examined by any Stranger, they could not but be a ſhrewd Temptation to him to conclude, that all the glittering ſhew our Religion makes amongſt us, ſerves only the moſt ſiniſtrouſly to guild over as ill, if not worſe Vices, as the very Heathens are blackened with. And no doubt it will the more Amazingly confound us one day, when we ſhall be ſo far from having thoſe excuſes, the <hi>Pagans</hi> will then have, to ſhroud ourſelves from the Dregs of the Cup of Wrath and Indignation; nay when the Hills and Mountains will not cover nor ſhelter us from them.</p>
            <p>But however, nothing follows upon all this, but that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, notwithſtanding all its intrinſecal perfection, has not yet prevail'd over that ſtubborneſs of our Nature, which, not Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Miracle, can only overcome. And of all the fallacious conſequences imaginable, none can be more unworthy, than thoſe by which the genius of Principles is inferr'd from that of Practice. Upon whom ever then the reproach lies, ſure it is, the leaſt Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of it can never reach our Chriſtianity. And this, as I have ſhown, is ſo fully accommodated to ſettle the Intereſt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the moſt unmoveable Foundations, that it fears not to be outvyed by any other Scheme the greateſt of its Enemies can ſet in competition with it. And ſince the thing is ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed for ſuch an end, who knows how ſoon it ſhall pleaſe God, in his infinite mercy, to make it take effect upon our moſt Reluctant, moſt Obſtinate Hearts and Temper. But I am not a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54328:12"/>
little afraid, that the greateſt of all our miſchiefs, have took their Riſe from the miſtaken deſign of our Religion in ſome, and the perverſe Interpretation of it in others. What if the Supream Powers ſhould have ventured too far out upon the Confidence of that Doctrine about Subjection, which perhaps was ſcru'd up by ſome till it left Chriſtianity to become a Complement? What if too many Subjects have ſo pared and minced their Subjection, as hardly to have retain'd the very Name of it; And even ſet up Religion itſelf, as the great Warrant to baffle the Speculation of it, and the no leſs ground of Quarrel to do ſo with the Practice of it too. Muſt true and undefiled Chriſtianity be accountable for all this? Or ſhall Men be ſo diſingenuous as to cropt the ears of ſome of their own kind, becauſe an Ape has done ſome trick or other? ſhall they be-ſpatter Chriſtianity, becauſe the Miſ-repreſentations of it have occaſioned ſuch wrong Steps? But that Objection will beſt be unravelled by what I am further to ſay. And therefore I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the third Particular of my Deſign.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen how peremptorily our Chriſtian Religion obliges us to be Subject to the Higher Powers; and alſo how very much the Obligation from it is neceſſary to any ſolid being and ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Government. It cannot then but nearly concern us rightly to know what the Nature of this Subjection is, and how it is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be limited, for anſwering the end for which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>But before I can enter upon this, I muſt firſt tell you, That our Bleſſed Lord, foreſeeing what vaſt Confuſions any Alterations in any of the Governments in the World would produce, did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate his Religion, ſo to all of them, that none could have but reaſon to thank him for that Great Acceſſion to all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſtitutions, which the Obligation from Conſcience added; and as few could have pretence to blame him for any innovation he had introduc'd upon the Ancient Terms of Subjection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by each individual Form ſubſiſted before. We all know that the matter of the Angelical Hymn at his Nativity was <hi>Peace on earth,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:54328:13"/>
               <hi>and good will toward man.</hi> And this was ſo true, even in that ſenſe which moſt obviouſly ſuites the preſent purpoſe, that, as I told you in this beginning of the Diſcourſe, there never was any Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſo throughly accommodated to the Peace of the World, as that Religion which he imparted to Mankind. But if he had taken upon him to change the External Forms and Polities of civil Governments, he had done a thing ſo far from eſtabliſhing Peace on the Earth, that he had <hi>intentionally</hi> done what was to be but an <hi>accidental event</hi> of his coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had <hi>ſent fire on the earth; had not given peace on earth, but rather diviſion, had not ſent peace, but a ſword.</hi> For if the Chriſtian Religion had invaded the Rights of the Supreme Powers, had curtail'd any of thoſe Royalties that were inherent in their Crowns, by the Laws of Nature, as they were Soveraigns, or by Thoſe of the Nations over which they rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Then it could not but have given ſuch Scandal and Offence to all the Princes of the World, as had no leſs inevitably, than Literally, made them upon that very ſence, accompliſh that of the ſecond Pſalm, <hi>The Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together, againſt the Lord, and against his Anointed; ſaying, let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> Becauſe, as all men are wont to the utmoſt of their Power to be tenacious of their Rights; ſo none have more reaſon to be ſo, than thoſe who have them in the Title of Soveraignity. On the other hand, if Chriſtianity had entrenched upon the Rights and Priviledges of the Subject, or had impoſ'd Slavery, where there was no more but Subjection, Then had it given ſo much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to, and raiſ'd ſuch an excuſable averſion in all thoſe, whoſe Lot had been ſo good, as not to be ſunk into the loweſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind can be depreſs'd into, and yet ſo moderat, as to be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably bound to aninferior Station, that Chains, and It had been equally inviting to them. Since there are ſuch Charmes and Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the very remiſseſt degree of Liberty and Property, that no conſideration can be able to dull or blunt them, but of that Neceſſity, which is only tollerable, becauſe it cannot be reſiſted.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54328:13"/>
Our Saviour therefore (as the excellent Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſayes in his Caſe of Reſiſtance, <hi>Pag.</hi> 46.) <hi>Left the Government of the World, as he found it: he has indeed given ſuch admirable Laws, as will teach Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to govern, and Subjects to obey better; which is the moſt effectual way to ſecure the Publick Peace and Happineſs, to prevent the Oppreſſion of Subjects, and Rebellion against Princes: but he has not interpoſed in new Modelling the Governments of the World.</hi> And ſo he did no more but enforce that obedience to Princes which was antecedently due by the Law of Nature, or the Civil Conſtitution of the Common-wealth, by the prevalency of Conſcience; without laying any further tye upon Subjects, as to the Matter of their Duty; the Motive to it being the only thing he was concerned in; as not ſuſtaining the Perſon of a <hi>Temporal,</hi> but only of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Prince.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any thing to the contrary in all the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either from any Sentence our Saviour is recorded to have ſpoke, or any Action he did that is transmitted unto us, or yet from any Doctrine his Apoſtles ever Taught or Practiſed; as will appear to every one who ſhall moſt narrowly go over that Book. And if a Negative Argument can have any force at all, it muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be allow'd to have it here; when it can never be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that an Affair ſo very important to the World, as would have been the ſetting a new Pattern for Government upon the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Conſcience, would have been paſt over in ſilence by thoſe inſpired Writers, who were only ſo, to leave ſufficient Rules for every thing that concerned the ſubſtance of our Religion.</p>
            <p>Nay, there are great hints toward the Poſitive; as is manifeſt by that fore-cited Paſſage touching our Saviours anſwer to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians:</hi> And I ſhall not need to ſay more to it upon the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, than what Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> inferrs in his lately cited Book, <hi>Pag. 55, 56. First,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>That our Saviour did not intend to make any alteration in the Rights of Soveraignty, but what Rights he found Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes poſſeſt of, he leaves them in the quiet poſseſſion of; for had he intended to make any change in this matter, he would not have given ſuch a general Rule,</hi> To render to <hi>Ceſar</hi> the things which are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54328:14"/>
               <hi>Ceſar's, without ſpecifying what theſe things are.</hi> Secondly, <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he leaves them to the known Laws of the Empire to determine what is</hi> Ceſars <hi>Right. Whatever is eſſential to the notion of Soveraign Power, whatever the Laws and Cuſtoms of Nations determine to be</hi> Ceſars <hi>Right, that they muſt render to him; for he would make no alteration in this matter.</hi> And Thirdly, <hi>That when our Saviour joyns our duty to our Prince, with our duty to our God, he excepts nothing from</hi> Ceſar's <hi>Right, which by the Laws of Nations is due to Soveraign Princes, but what is a violation of, and an encroachment on Gods Right and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</hi> Now what he ſayes here of the Rights of Princes, is by conſequence the ſame, as to the Rights of Subjects. For, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Pag.</hi> 45, reaſonably concludes, our Saviour <hi>could not alter the duties of Subjects, but he muſt alter the Rights of Princes too:</hi> And therefore in the Reverſe, he could not have diminiſh'd or aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd the Rights of Princes; but he muſt have done ſo with the Duties or Rights of Subjects alſo; the Rights of Princes and of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being Correlatives to one another. This alſo will be found evident enough by any who ſhall impartially conſider the anſwers our Lord gave <hi>Pilate</hi> when he was arraign'd before him.</p>
            <p>This then, as it is a general Principle about our Saviours Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning Subjection, is quite out of doors as to any debate, either among the Divines of our own, or among thoſe of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Church. And from this Principle the Nature and Extent of Subjection is to be deduced. So that now the only difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in drawing ſuch plain and natural conſequences from it, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily flow without any force or compulſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, all Subjects are upon their Conſcience to yield their Soveraign all thoſe Rights and Dues which by the peculiar Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in which they live, He can Legally exact of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Otherwiſe our Saviour had Abridg'd the Rights of the Supream Powers. On the contrary, the whole Body of the Subjects is not obliged by Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to give the Soveraign more than what by the eſtabliſhed Form of the Government he has a juſt Title to; all that is more than this being wholly left to their choiſe and diſcretion; I mean that ſince
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54328:14"/>
they are not obliged to more upon the point of ſtrict Juſtice and Right, ſo neither are they upon the point of Conſcience by any tye from the Chriſtian Religion. Otherwiſe our Saviour had encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Rights of the Subject. I ſaid <hi>The whole Body of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> becauſe no private man has any Right by vertue of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government, but only as he is a Member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, under that Reduplication; and ſo 'tis properly and originally the whole Body only in which any ſingle Subjects Right is lodged.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Soveraign is, either inveſted with ſuch an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power, as leaves the whole Body of the Subjects no Right at all, nothing that is further their own than as he pleaſes; Or he is not, and the Subjects have an entire and uncontrovertible Right to ſuch and ſuch things as by the Conſtitution of the Government are reſerved to them ſo, that the Fundamental Conſtitution muſt be violated by every attempt the Soveraign makes upon them. If the former; then Subjects are not to deny their Soveraign any thing, but what interferes with the duty they owe their God; And by Conſcience they are bound to this. If the latter, then there muſt be fixt and ſettled Laws whereby the Rights betwixt the Soveraign and the Subject are contradiſtinguiſhed from each other; and theſe Laws muſt be mutual evidence of the Rights of both; ſo that ſo long as they ſtand in force and unrepealed, neither the One, nor the Other, can tranſgreſs them, without invading the oppoſite Right. For where there is no Law, there by the common Law of Nations all falls to the Soveraign; as where there is Law, the Rights are divided betwixt him and the Subject. Now the Subjects are to learn their Rights from the Laws of the Land wherein they live; nothing elſe being competent to afford them inſtruction in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And what theſe Laws bind them to, they are upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to perform. But if more be required, they are not obliged by Conſcience to yield it; according to what I ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There muſt always be ſome kind of <hi>undefineable</hi> Power lodged in the Soveraign, which no Laws can expreſs, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54328:15"/>
which only certain extraordinary Emergenciés in the State can bring out. For it is quite impoſſible for the greateſt and moſt combin'd Wiſdom, that is but Humane, to provide ſufficiently for all that may happen. And therefore the exertion of that Power muſt in the conſtruction of the Law be interpreted to be legal, when thoſe Occurrences that call for it, do in a juſt Analogy to the whole Body of the Law, ſufficiently appear to be ſuch, as preſumably would have been determined by the Law to have required ſuch an interpoſition of the Soveraign, had they been thought upon when Laws were a making. And even as to this the Subject is tyed by Conſcience to ſubmit. Since otherwiſe the obligation from it would directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that Truſt, or eſſential ingredient of the Soveraignty, which the not prognoſticated exigencies of the Common-wealth do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der neceſſary to be repos'd, or involved, in the Supreme Power. But on the other hand, there is ſomething included in the Liberty of the Subject that fully correſponds to that Prerogative Power in the Soveraign. For wherever there are Laws, there is a mutual Right betwixt the Soveraign and the Subject; elſe why a Subject, and not a Slave? according to the immediatly preceeding Point. When therefore that eminent exerciſe of the Subjects Liberty happens to become indiſpenſable, unleſs he ſhould ſuffer himſelf to degenerate below that Title; Conſcience does not intereſs it ſelf to reſtrain him from his native Priviledge. Otherwiſe the Obligation from it would plainly contradict that Right he has to the end of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the Laws ſettled by it; and ſo our Saviour had inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated upon the Subjects Right. And indeed whenever the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is ſtretched ſo far as to be made a Pretence for overturning the Subjects Right, or introducing ſuch an illimited Power in the Soveraign as wholly evacuats the Property and Priviledge of the Subject, ſo as upon the matter to change his ſtate of Subjection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Slavery; Then, if the Conſtitution under which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject lives does allow it, the Subject may by all the juſt Means he can be maſter of, vindicate his own Right, and ridd himſelf from all thoſe incroaching uſurpations upon it, which give him ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54328:15"/>
ground of being allarmed. It cannot indeed be eaſily conceived how the Subject can have Right in the Laws, and not have Right to all thoſe neceſſary Means by which he can ſecure his Right in the Laws. For otherwiſe his Right in the Laws were eſſentially fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraneous; ſince every End is ſo, that cannot be attain'd by any requiſite Means. And ſo it were the ſame thing upon the event to him, whether he had any Right in the Laws, or not; as ſeems palpable. But whatever be in this, Conſcience is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſince it lays no check upon the Subject from making uſe of that Civil Right he can claim by the Laws of that Government of which he is a Member. In ſhort then, whatever Subjects can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do by vertue of the ſpecial Conſtitution in which their lot is caſt, that Conſcience permits unto them, without any reſtriction or limitation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Fourthly, Thoſe Subjects who have Right in the Laws, have alſo Right to be Judge when their Laws are attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or when the Soveraign is embarked in a Deſign to enſlave them. Otherwiſe all their Right in the Laws, and all their Right to Means whereby they may poſſeſs themſelves of what the Laws provide for them, were neceſſarily incapable of bettering their eſtate, more than when they were under the moſt abſolute and illimited Government. Becauſe <hi>Right</hi> without a Judge, to determine where, and when it belongs, and when it is violated or invaded, is all one as no Right at all. Since before any Right can take place, there muſt be the Deciſion of a Judge that it ought to do ſo. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently where there can be no Deciſion in the Caſe, there the Right muſt abſolutely be ineffectual; that is, it muſt be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate conſequent of mere Slavery, or an empty ſound without any import or ſignification. Now there can be no other Judge had in this matter, than the Body of the Subjects; as is clear. For there is no other that could be ſo, but the Soveraign; and it could not be expected that he would condemn himſelf; and beſides, if to paſs the Judgment were referred to him, he would no leſs be Judge in his own Cauſe. The advantage then that here the Subject has
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54328:16"/>
over the Soveraign, is founded in the original end of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is the Right and Property of the Subject; who can have no benefite by either, unleſs in ſuch an extraordinary caſe he could be his own Judge; as is juſt now ſhewed. Neither can the Soveraign be juſtly aggrieved hereby: ſince, as to point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, his Subjects muſt firſt attempt God, before they can him, without juſt ground; and without Conſcience nothing but mere Force and Power can preſerve him at all, and ſo long as he has this, he can be in no danger at any rate. But in all this we muſt not forget that it is only the whole Body of the Subjects that is to be underſtood. Now Conſcience does not meddle further as to this, than only to in fluence the Subjects, that neither Paſſion nor Intereſt act them, when they are conſtrain'd to Judge, when the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign has broke through all the Hedges whereby their Liberty was preſerved; and that they ſhould deal impartially, as thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who muſt one day anſwer before the Tribunal of the Judge of the Quick and the Dead, for what they have pronounced in an affair of the higheſt concernment and importance. For they had need to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a due Caution; and they ought ſtill to chooſe the ſafeſt ſide, and that too with ſuch a latitude as does not manifeſtly infer ſome moſt conſiderable prejudice to the primitive deſign, why the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was ſo or ſo conſtituted at firſt: So that when the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative is exerced, the Subject muſt not without great ground pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that it goes without its Sphere; and when the Subjects Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty takes place, he muſt not without certain, and imminent, and extraordinary danger threatning him, adventure to aſſert it. Since by Conſcience the Subject is obliged to be ſubmiſſive to the Higher Powers; and in ſo nice a buſineſs it is but to fall over the Precipice, to ride cloſs upon God Almighties Marches.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I ſhall add as a certain Concluſion from what has been Diſcourſed, That where the Subject has any Right, or is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required, either as a Condition, or a Conſtitutive Part, to the making the Laws; ſo that both the Prince and the People have a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54328:16"/>
Vote upon each other: There the Supreme Power, in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of that Term, is only lodged in the Prince and People together, as compoſing that entire Body from which the Soveraign Authority does flow; the Princes Sanction being <hi>materially</hi> no more but the expreſſion of his Conſent. For if the Subject has right to the Laws, either it lyes in his option to conſent to the cancelling and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating them, ſo that they cannot be really annulled without he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall Vote for the annulling of them; or elſe his Right in them would be but a Sham one, and he needed expect no further Protection from them, than what, and ſo long as the Princes Humor ſhould liſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo in effect he were but a Slave, whatever pretence he had to be a Subject. Suppoſing therefore that, neither old Laws can be repealed, nor new ones made, without the conſent of the Subject; It is evident that, whatever eminent Power the Prince is inveſted with, yet that which is entirely Abſolute and Supreme, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Senſe, does not wholly reſide in his Perſon. Otherwiſe, why were the Subjects Conſent ſo indiſpenſaby neceſſary in the moſt important matter that concerns the Government? and why would not the Princes mere Arbitrary Will be as valid, as the moſt ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved Laws can be? The great difference then between a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and an illimited Soveraignty is, that in the former the Prince has no more but a certain ſhare of the Supreme Power, whereas in the latter he has it all ſolely to himſelf; and in the former the Prince and the People together have but juſt ſo much among them as in the latter the Prince has alone. But tho ſuch a limited Prince can claim but partially the Supreme Power, as to the abrogating or making of the Laws; yet as to the putting thoſe that are made in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the whole Supreme Power may be in his hands; and is actually ſo in thoſe of the moſt Princes that are undenyably under Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the other reſpect. It being eſſential, at leaſt very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the Being of a Monarch, to have the Government to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſo far upon him, as his being inveſted with this Power implyes it ſhould. Yet notwithſtanding, the Exerciſe of this Power ought to be regulated and meaſured according to the Laws; ſo as that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54328:17"/>
whenever it tends to ſubvert the Conſtitution, and trample the Laws under-foot, and conſequently to aſſume to it as Abſolute a Power in <hi>Making</hi> Laws, as it ſelf is in <hi>Executing</hi> them; then an obſequiouſneſs to it is not ſo incumbent upon the Subject, but that he may aſſert his own Right and Property the beſt way he can. Otherwiſe a limited Monarch were a mere contradiction; and what he wanted in the one hand, he would have fully recompenſed in the other; And therefore, according to all ſaid before, he could not have Subjects, but only Slaves. Now what Conſcience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges unto, with relation both to the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power, and to the <hi>Executive,</hi> needs not any further be told.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to reſolve the Point of Conſcience in this Affair about Subjection. And, as far as I could, I have only carried along with me the Threed of thoſe Conſequences which freely ariſe from that general Principle told you before, and which is acknowledged by all; together with what is obviouſly ſuggeſted by the common Dictates of our Natural Reaſon. I have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to condeſcend upon the particular Conſtitution of our own Nation; that being none of my Province, and not thinking it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent at this time to mingle the Miniſter and the Lawyer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Nevertheleſs it may be eaſie for every body concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to compare what has been ſaid with our ſpecial Form; and ſo to ſatisfie their Conſciences as to all the Rencounters they may meet with upon this head.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſhow, Firſt, That this Doctrine is ſo far from being derogatory to any Prince, that it ſerves mightily to Enhance and Aggrandize all, and eſpecially thoſe who are ſo, over Subjects, and not Slaves; Secondly, That it is conſonant to the deſign of my Text, and thoſe other Scriptures that I adduced for proving in the general, that our Religion impoſes upon us the duty of Subjection to the Higher Powers; And then, That thoſe Exceptions that may be made to it, are founded upon ſad miſtakes, both as to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, in commanding that Duty, and as to the nature of the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54328:17"/>Firſt then, If any Prince be an illimited Soveraign, what can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound more to his Glory, than to have a whole Empire of Slaves cringing to his nod, more becauſe of the impulſe of Conſcience, than of Fear and Awe? But a King that rules over Subjects and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, cannot but gain proportionably more by their being oblig'd from Conſcience to pay their Duty to him; than can the Great <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Mogull,</hi> by having ſuch a tye upon their Slaves, tho they have all to expect that perhaps their Caprice can demand. For then an Emperor and his Slaves makes the neareſt reſemblance to a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and his Flock. They look like two different kinds of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and are driven aſſunder to the utmoſt Extreams: So that the pleaſure of the Government muſt be derived from ſome thing elſe than Reaſon; it muſt be the neceſſary reſult of a blind Ambition, of an extravagant Humour and Vanity. Neither can there ever be thoſe franker communications betwixt ſuch a Prince, and ſuch a People, which might treat him with the ſatisfaction of a Man, and rationally ſweeten all the Cares that attend a Scepter. Beſides, there lies no fewer nor lighter burdens upon the Conſcience of ſuch Slaves to choak and ſtiffle it, than there does upon themſelves, to bear down and ſuppreſs thoſe Inclinations to Liberty, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from all men, that had ever the leaſt glimpſe of what it was. And therefore, tho they are bound by Conſcience to obey; yet, conſidering that <hi>Oppreſſion makes wiſe-men mad,</hi> and that our frail Nature ſeldom bears much and long out againſt violent Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even when it is aſſiſted by all the forces of Conſcience; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, that Government muſt be but weakly ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which has but ſo little of Conſcience in it to Cement its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as will not be queſtioned by thoſe who have given an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ear to what was ſaid on the ſecond Head of this Diſcourſe, or who ſhall peruſe the Hiſtory of the Turkiſh Empire. But when we turn over the Medal, then do we ſee the beſt Land-skip of Heaven that any thing on Earth can afford. A King ſeated on a Throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Subjects, that want only Sin enough to be Kings themſelves; that at once Love and Adore Him whoſe Commands are their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54328:18"/>
that envy Him nothing but a ſhare of his Troubles by the Crown; and that have their Lives and Fortunes, not only a readier, but a ſurer Sacrifice to be offered up to His Service, than are thoſe of the profoundeſt Slaves, whoſe eyes dare not look above the Foot-ſtool of their Soveraign. It were eaſie for a florid and pathetick Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſet forth this Subject with ſuch lively, but deſerved, Charms, as might enamour the moſt obſtinate hearts againſt Monarchy with it, and raviſh their Admiration, and their Affection too, in ſpight of all their Reluctancies and Prejudices. But if the very nature of the thing be ſo enticeing; What muſt it be when Conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves all? When Inclination has it to ſecond its influence? And when it has no juſt provocation to graple with it? Let the moſt Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Wits, let the beſt contriv'd Romances, now compear, and in their higheſt Vies, ſhow us any thing, that can make a King ſo truly Great and Splendid. Wherefore it is a King of Men, and not of Cattel; a King that has free Subjects left to the ſwing of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and not Slaves, in which hardly the Embers of Conſcience can ſparkle through thoſe Aſhes of Illimited Power by which it is ſmothered; It is only ſuch a King that has the juſteſt claim to ſo proud, ſo pompous a Title. And hence it has frequently come to paſs that thoſe, whoſe firſt Right to it was only that of Conqueſt, have been ſo ſenſible of this, that they have voluntarily granted to their People ſuch Rights and Priviledges, as might elevate them to the Degree of Subjects, above that moſt contemptible Depreſſion of Slaves. And this they ſound the propereſt method to promote their Glory, and ſettle their Intereſt; reckoning it below their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Minds to trample upon the Necks of thoſe who could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly crouch to the Foot that did ſo; and too tickliſh for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to vapour it over thoſe who could not. For whatever they ſaw was to be repoſed in Force, and Conſcience, when abſtractly viewed; yet they concluded it was much more ſafe to take off all thoſe weights from their power by which it was moſt grievouſly felt, and not to load Conſcience too heavily with Rigid and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Impoſitions; when theſe are ſo very irritating to fleſh and blood, as the practice of the World goes.</p>

            <p>It is therefore the advantage of all Supreme Powers, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that their Humour is not to be their Law; and that they are never with a ſufficient Ray about their Heads, nor have their Thrones faſtned with Chains enough Adamantine for their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but when their Subjects Rights are as Sacred to them, as is their own. Neither have ever any Vermine holl'd the Throne more, than theſe flattering Paraſites, that, contrary to the inward Sentiments of their own Minds, contrary to the Dictats of their Conſciences before God, and as much contrary to the true Intereſt of the Monarch, as of the Subject, have laid themſelves moſt out to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the biggeſt, the moſt ſwoln thoughts of the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority into his Imagination who poſſeſt it. And the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Ages furniſhes us with ſad atteſtations to this. But to make Religion a pretence for all, and under the colour of it to ſteal in the deadlieſt Poyſon into the heart of a King, is to vouch Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs by Almighty God, and to injure Heaven as much as Earth: Beſides that, Religion is one of thoſe Strings, which too much bending will crack; and beſides too, that nothing gives a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54328:19"/>
more amazing diſappointment, than when a ſtreſs was put upon ſome fond Exceſs of Religion, and all other things failing, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun moſt totally to do ſo. By this time then, I hope none will think that thoſe Meaſures to which I have fixt our Subjection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of Conſcience, are not fully more Loyal, becauſe more ſolid; than the higheſt Stretches ever were, or ever ſhall be made, by the moſt ſneaking Sycophants for inſinuating themſelves upon their Princes Favour.</p>
            <p>Now that Theſe are not the deſign of my Text, or any other in the New Teſtament, needs not much pains to be made clear. For it is palpable by what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes in thoſe preceeding and following <hi>verſes,</hi> and by that Paſſage I cited from <hi>St Peter,</hi> that the Queſtion among thoſe to whom they Wrot was not, <hi>Whether or not Subjects were bound by their Conſciences to be ſubject to the Higher Powers beyond thoſe Limits which the Conſtitution under which they lived ſet them;</hi> but only, <hi>Whether Christianity looſ'd all the bonds of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from thoſe that profeſs'd it, and proclaimed to them an abſolute and univerſal Liberty from all ſubmiſſion to thoſe Powers that Govern'd at the time?</hi> Otherwiſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> had argued very impertinently, when he endeavoured to perſwade the <hi>Romans</hi> to Subjection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil; Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame; For he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good; But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain; for he is the Miniſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath to him that doth evil.</hi> It were to ſuſpect a ſtrange want in my Hearers, to offer at any more, beſides the repeating theſe Words over. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo had ſtruck very wide, had he intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort unto ſuch a ſubmiſſion, when he gave no other reaſon for That he was preſſing, than that the <hi>Governours are for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well;</hi> and therefore <hi>no liberty was to be uſed for a cloke of maliciouſneſs.</hi> The truth is, the moſt probable Conjecture that can be made of the occaſion, why theſe two <hi>Apostles</hi> wrot upon this Point, is, that the believing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54328:19"/>
               <hi>Jews,</hi> who were mingled among the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, had made it their buſineſs to draw over Theſe to that Doctrine concerning Subjection to the Supreme Powers, which themſelves, when <hi>Jews,</hi> had been train'd up in, and which, now when they were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they had not abandon'd, nor laid down. We are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how tenacious that People was of every Circumſtance, every Punctilio of their old Religion, that was not Diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the bare Profeſſion of the Chriſtian. It was therefore a moſt peremptory Maxime among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that their Government was an immediate Theocracy; and that, ſince Gods Exchequer need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Tribute Money to be payed to it, they were not to condeſcend to ſuch an exaction by any other Power, but becauſe ſuch a Force lay on them, as they were not able to reſiſt. And ſo we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude, that they had ſet about the perverting their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Proſelyts to the ſame Belief, and the prevailing with them not to yeild any further to the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, under which they were then, but in ſo far as they could not with any tollerable ſafety help it: And that theſe <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> foreſeeing how injurious ſuch a Tenet was to the true deſign of Chriſtianity, and what ſad conſequences it might be the ſource of to thoſe who ſhould embrace it; did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently uſe their Authority, to ſtiffle it in the Bud, and to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thoſe out of it, whom it might have tainted. Neither ſhall we find many Texts that do more palpably ſuggeſt the circumſtances in which they were written. Nay further, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems directly to touch this by the firſt, and ſo moſt appoſite Argument he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, <hi>for there is no Power but of God, and the powers that be are ordained of God, whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God:</hi> As if he had ſaid, All that ſtumbles you is, becauſe you think no Power can be lawfully ſubmitted to, but the Power of God; Why then do you refuſe Subjection to Higher Powers, for there is none of them, but whom God has Authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Office, and inveſted with Power by his Sanction.</p>
            <p>However, it is manifeſt to the half of an eye, that no ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection can be meant by thoſe <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as is inconſiſtent with thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54328:20"/>
Rights the Subject has in vertue of that Conſtitution in which he lives, as they are conſidered antecedently to any Obligation from Conſcience. At leaſt thoſe who will be of the contrary Opinion muſt firſt prove that Our Saviour did really alter the Rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns and Subjects, and make all Thoſe unboundedly Abſolute Powers, and Theſe entirely and irreſervedly Slaves. For the Word <hi>Subjection,</hi> or that <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> or that <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> is too General and Equivocal to infer any ſuch thing of it ſelf; eſpecially when it is to be Interpreted only with regard to the Correlative Matter to which it is applyed. And if ſuch a Subjection had been then in either of theſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> view, they had certainly been more Expreſs and Particular in Determining the Extent of it; Since it would have been a thing wherein the whole Body of Mankind could not but have been moſt nearly concerned; and which all would have expounded in the moſt favourable Senſe that could have been contrived, and that even when the moſt punctual caution had been uſed, to render the odious one beyond the hazard of being contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>Yet I know there has no ſmall pretences been made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And firſt it is ſaid, That the very notion of a King does eſpecially imply ſuch an Abſolute Power, as is quite irreconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with any other Obedience in the Subjects, than what is ſuch, that the greateſt wrongs they can ſuffer, can never juſtifie their not behaving Paſſively at leaſt: And that therefore Our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, could not but mean ſuch a Subjection, when they recommended any at all. To this I anſwer, That it is plainly falſe that the Notion of a King involves any ſuch thing, as the Word <hi>King,</hi> is generally taken; unleſs it ſhall be granted, that there is no poſſible diſtinction <hi>upon the Matter</hi> betwixt a subject and a Slave. And it is an infinite Error for one to let his thoughts pore conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Notion of a King, without allowing ſome cool ones to reflect what kind of Creatures a King is to Rule over. If therefore it ſhall not be denyed, that Subjects have a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> and <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Right in the Laws, and not only ſuch an Imaginary and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54328:20"/>
and Ineffectual one, as ſome pleaſe themſelves with; Then either a King may have a limited Power, or, if it muſt be ſo, none is a King, but who is it at the rate the Grand Signor is ſo. And yet if that be only to be a King, thoſe who are moſtly Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe over Subjects, need not grudge Him the Monopoly of the Title; and whatever other they ſhall aſsume, as their peculiar, will ſound as much more big, as its being Special to them, will render it more deſerving that it ſhould. Wherefore there was no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon Our Saviour to calculate the Meaſures of Subjection unto this Notion of a King.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, it is Alledged, That without an abſolutely irreſiſtible Power in the Soveraign, the peace of no Nation can be preſerved; Becauſe no Government can be ſo very exactly well bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, but that there will always be many diſcontented Perſons under it, either becauſe things do not anſwer their own expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or becauſe of thoſe other Paſſions which are wont, not more to ferment Mens Minds, than to raiſe Commotions in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And therefore, if Subjects had the Liberty to ſtart a Quarrel with their Soveraign, and then to Judge of the ſufficiency of that themſelves, and after all to frame a new Model after their own Humor; there could be no ſettled quiet in any State at all, but one Confuſion would ſtill ſucceed upon the neck of another, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could put an end to them, but that which would do ſo to this World. Now Our Saviour muſt needs have, either done very little or no good to Mankind, by all that he taught concerning Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or elſe laid bonds upon all Subjects to carry patiently under all the injuries they could ſuffer from their Princes, this being the only way poſſible to prevent ſuch diſorders, and perpetual Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. But ſtill I anſwer, That this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either proves that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and a Slave is the very ſame thing, or elſe it proves nothing at all; as is manifeſt by what was ſaid in theſe Inferences, by which I deduc'd that, againſt which this Objection is Levelled, upon the meer ſuppoſition of a certain Right and Property lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Subject. Therefore I doubt not, but all will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54328:21"/>
that, if it proves a Subject to be the ſame with a Slave, it proves too much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this ends in a ſhort way of Arguing. But not barely to cut the knot; It is not every Picque or Grievance that will infer ſuch a wrong from the Soveraign, as can juſtifie ſo high a Redreſs. And I told you before, that the Subjects are obliged by Conſcience not to beſtir themſelves till a moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and impendent Danger ſhould threaten the Subverſion of the Government it ſelf. And ſince the Laws of a Nation, and the Eſſentials of its Conſtitution, are patent to every body; It is not moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſumeable, that the moſt conſiderable Part of the Subjects, will in ſpight, not of their Honour, but their very Conſciences, concur in an attempt, where the miſtake cannot but be as evident, as they muſt know it will be fatal, tho none but God ſhould pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it. Where ever then Conſcience gets freedom to work, it will undoubtedly ſecure the peace of any People, whoſe Soveraign has not been ſo exceſſively unjuſt unto them, that if a ſtorm falls upon him, he has only himſelf to blame for it. And that Our Saviour, ſhould have raiſ'd ſuch a Fence about thoſe, who could ſo little merit it at his hands (when they muſt firſt violate their Conſciences, before they can give any provocation of that nature to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by endeavouring to tyrannize it over them); were too odd to imagine of him, who was the <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Beſides, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot keep the Peace of a Nation, when there can be no juſt temptation to break it; certainly it would far leſs do ſo, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations that flow from Self-preſervation would drive on our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd Natures to gagg it for a while, till we ſhould put our ſelves in the condition of being more at Gods mercy, than at Mans. For the greater the Temptations be, the leſs proportionably of vigour &amp; force has Conſcience in the moſt part of men. And when there would be ſo great a ſtruggle to be made by Fleſh and Blood, againſt Violence and Oppreſſion; Conſcience would much ſooner ſuccumb and quite the Field; Than when we were only to deal with thoſe impatiencies and frettings, with this ambitious temper, or that ſoure thought, which we could not but be aſhamed of, when ever we returned again to our ſelves. And upon this account Our Saviour has better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54328:21"/>
the Security of Kings, and the tranquillity of Subjects: than if he had carried the Obligation of Conſcience to ſuch an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable length, as ſome would be at thinking it ſhould go to. For if we were implicitly upon all emergencies to ſubmit, 'twere many to one, but that at long run, we would come to be ſo deſpair'd of our eſtate, as rather to chooſe once for all to give our Conſcience a pull, and to attempt a Freedom, which needed not occaſion its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo troubleſome to us any more. And we know already what a ſandy Foundation the beſt formed Government would have, if Conſcience did not Support it. It is true, God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence does ſometimes permit a Nation to be its own Scourge, by perſecuting a Prince which is its Glory and Happineſs; and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly, nay wantonly embroiling it ſelf, when it wallows in Plenty and Proſperity. And this day furniſhes us with as deplorable an Inſtance of that, as ever any other day did any other Nation. But as that is owing to a Peoples own Sins; ſo as they would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Miſchief, let them beware not to reiterate the Cauſes of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And at leaſt this advantage may be gathered from it, that the moſt foreward and heated People have an example before their eyes, how much Conſcience can be trampled under, and how much the moſt ſober Principles can be miſapplyed and abuſed. But I ſhall have occaſion afterwards to ſpeak ſome-what more to this.</p>
            <p>But further it is Objected, That a King may be any thing elſe, if he be inferior to his People: And if he be their Superior, then it is manifeſt that he cannot be accountable to them; it being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the very beeing of a Superior, to be ſubject to thoſe, who are ſubject to him. And therefore a King is looſed from all Laws; neither can any bind him; Theſe being <hi>his</hi> Laws, and appointed only for tying the Subjects. And hence our Saviour muſt, either have not underſtood the Power and Dignity of a King; or elſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to oblige all Subjects to what That imports. But ſtill the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ect and the Slave are confounded, and mixt together. However, I ask thoſe who depend upon this, whether or not the Subject has ſuch a Right in the Laws, that the Prince cannot make, or repeal any without him? If he has, as he muſt have, if he be a Subject; then the Laws are not ſo entirely the Kings, but they are the Subjects
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54328:22"/>
too. It is indeed the Kings Glory and Advantage to Rule his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by Laws; But it is alſo the Subjects Priviledge and Security to be ruled by them. And if the eminency of Splendor, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds from the Laws, falls to the Kings ſhare; and if alſo That be ſufficient to ſound the common denomination of Property: Then no Subject can reaſonably envy his Soveraigns aſcribing the Property of the Laws to himſelf. Yet I doubt if there will many be found who ſhall willingly acknowledge, that the Laws are ſo much the Kings, that he may make, and un-make them, at his pleaſure. This then being without queſtion, it naturally follows, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences I drew before, that the Subject may juſtly vindicat his Right in the Laws, if it be attempted. Tho then the King be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the whole Body of the Subjects, when he Rules accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law; Since both he has a tranſcendent kind of Power in the making of the Laws, and an intire one for putting them in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet when he deſerts the Laws, and takes up his own Arbitrary Will in lieu of them; then the Subjects may look to themſelves, whatever be in the Character of his being King, to ſtate them as his Inferiours. So that a Limited Monarch, is but a Limited Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. And they, who drive any iſſue of the Matter upon a King's being Superiour over his People, ſeem only to be fondly poſſeſt with the abſtract Notion of Superiority, without conſidering that his Power, whom they ſtile Superior, is really confin'd within certain bounds. It muſt nevertheleſs be confeſt, that a King is ſo far above the Laws, that his Perſon ought always to be Sacred to his Subjects. The <hi>cutting off the very Skirt of a Kings Rob,</hi> wrought a very ſenſible remorſe upon the <hi>Man after Gods own heart;</hi> for <hi>his heart ſmote him for it,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5. And it is the duty of every Subject to ſay with him, <hi>verſ. 6. The Lord forbid that I ſhould do this thing unto my maſter the Lords anointed, to stretch forth my hand againſt him, ſeing he is the annointed of the Lord.</hi> And there is ſtill ſuch a ſilial regard to be had to the Perſon of a King, that nothing leſs than the Barbarity, of which a Son that would cut his Fathers Throat could not but be horridly guilty, could ſuffer any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54328:22"/>
Subject, to put hand in the Father of his Countrey; however much he had forefeited that Title, by the violent Invaſions he had made upon his own Children. And in this ſenſe only, can the <hi>Solutus Legibus,</hi> that is ſo much talkt of, be underſtood; unleſs it ſhall only be appropriated to thoſe Monarchs, who have form'd their Copy after the Model of the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>To all this it is added, That if the whole Body of the Subjects can oppoſe themſelves to their Prince, can riſe up againſt him, and aſſert their Right in the Laws whether he would or not; Then every ſingle Subject is hereby allowed to reſiſt his Soveraign, when-ever he is unjuſtly attacked by him. For all the Individuals of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth have a-part as much Right in the Laws, as the Whole has; and on the other hand the whole Body can never combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Soveraign, unleſs the particular Members ſhall in their private capacity work the Deſign againſt him. And of how pernicious conſequence this were to any State, is eaſie to be told? Neither could any Subject be juſtly brought to Puniſhment for entering into Conſpiracies againſt the Government, if he could make it appear that he was only endeavouring to free the Subjects from Tyranny &amp; Oppreſſion. So that our Saviour muſt either have thought that every private Subject might thus preſerve himſelf, or elſe have intended that his Doctrine ſhould Militate againſt ſuch a method when uſed by the Whole. But it is ſtill forgot that therefore every Subject muſt reckon himſelf to be even naturally a Slave. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I anſwer directly, That indeed no private Subject ought to reſiſt the Government under which he lives, even when he ſuffers the moſt injuriouſly by it; provided there be no more but a meer tranſient and private Act of Injuſtice in it, without tending to the common prejudice of the Government, or to the Subverſion of the Right of the whole Subjects in the Laws. For, tho he has Right in the Laws, yet his whole Right in them is founded in his being a Member of the Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I told you before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has no other Right to the Means whereby he ought to, or can juſtly aſſert his Right in the Laws, but only in ſo far as the whole
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54328:23"/>
Common-wealth is concerned: Since in the firſt conſtitution and end of all Common-wealths the Publick Good is chiefly aimed, and the Private comes in only by way of Reſult; And therefore no Means can be Legittimate to any individual Perſon, that can claſh with the general intereſt of the whole Body; And conſequently the Means that any ſingle Subject can pretend to for making his Right in the Laws to be effectual to him, muſt have a ſpecial regard, in the very nature of the thing, to the publick advantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Now when, as things ſtand in the World, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible for Subjects to Cope with their Soveraign, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt danger to the Common Good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: every ſingle Subject that meets with an injury, however atrocious, is obliged by his being a Member of ſuch a Body, not to attempt any thing, becauſe of his own private concern, that may ſet his whole Fellow-ſubjects and the Soveraign by the Ears toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the hazard of the Publick Damage, does ſufficiently preponderate all the wrong that he can actually ſuffer; to wit, as he is comprehended in the Original Deſign of the Society. Indeed if he ſhall lay aſide his Title to his own Preſervation, upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of being a Member of the Common wealth, it is palpable, that if any other ground juſtifie him to ſhift the beſt way he can for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he muſt do it, not as a Subject, but meerly as a Man. And then the caſe becomes quite impertinent to our Affair. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, there muſt other thoughts be taken up, when the Subjects <hi>Right in general</hi> is Invaded, and the Injuſtice reaches the Publick Intereſt of them all. Then every particular Subject not only may, but, by the terms of his being a Member with the reſt of the Subjects, ought to do whatever he can contribute to the relieving the whole Subjects Right in the Laws, from that Tyranny and Oppreſſion it is falling, or fallen under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Otherwiſe it were non-ſenſe and contradiction to ſay that Subjects have Right in the Laws; Becauſe, according to the ground this Objection went upon, the whole Body of the Subjects can never, Morally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, jump out at once into a common Vindication of their Right,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54328:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without matters had been previouſly concerted by ſingle perſons. 'Tis true, if a private Subject be of a publick Spirit, he muſt do it at his perill. And there were no glory nor merite in the thing, if he did it not ſo. And tho his beſt intentions ſhould happen to be defeated, and he to fall in the hands of the Prince; Yet then, if the Prince be a good one, and can be prevail'd with to mend what has been done through miſtake, or by evil Counſel; he will be ſo far from looking upon ſuch a man as his enemy, that he will reckon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his ſincereſt friends, for having given him occaſion to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the true intereſt of a Monarch, is not to ſuffer ſuch a diminution of his Character, as the violenting his Subjects Rights carries alongſt with it. And ſuppoſing the Prince to be engaged in a deſperate reſolve to break through all difficulties, rather than not poſſeſs himſelf of an, as miſtaken, as illimited Power; and ſo that he who was endeavouring to ſtand in the way of it, muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as a Traitor and a Rebel; Yet in the ſight of God, and of all honeſt Subjects, his reputation will be as much without ſtain, as his Conſcience will be without guilt; and his Death, when the moſt cruel, will be ſo much the more glorious Martyrdom for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And the Providence of the great Diſpoſer of all mens lives, muſt be reverenc'd in all. I confeſs that the evidence of Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had need be very great and common, before one apprehended in any deſign againſt the Soveraign, can be preſum'd to have been about the Publick, and not his own Private, Concern. Otherwiſe this would never fail to be perverted unto a pretence for the moſt villanous and wicked Plots againſt the Government, that the moſt furious Traitors can Embarque into. Wherefore I muſt here again inculcate, that all along in what I have been ſaying upon this Head, I have walked upon this ſuppoſition, That the Princes invaſion of the Subjects, ſtrikes <hi>manifeſtly</hi> at their Right in the Laws, and does viſibly appear to the World to be a robbing them of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as Subjects, and an enſlaving them to all the miſeries of an Arbitrary Power. For when the wrongs done by the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts not to this, and when the evidence of theſe wrongs is not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54328:24"/>
without queſtion; then all muſt go in his favours, and the Subjects Conſcience muſt quitt the coſt.</p>
            <p>But now in fine, all theſe, and other Objections of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can never come home to the main Point in hand. For in ſo far, as they proceed upon Reaſons of an antecedent conſequence to the Inſtitution of the Chriſtian Religion, they cannot be brought againſt this Principle, <hi>That our Saviour never meant by his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine about ſubjection to alter the Rights of Soveraigns, or of Subjects, as they are stated by the ſeveral Conſtitutions of different Nations.</hi> And in ſo far as they leave out the conſideration of the Subjects Right in the Laws; they are impertinent againſt this Suppoſition; That he has really ſuch a Right. The only thing therefore that ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections ought to be adduced for, is, That whoever is a Monarch, cannot but be Inveſted with ſuch an Abſolute and Illimited Power as the Great Turk enjoys: And that there can be no <hi>Real</hi> Subject, but that all under any Soveraign Power whatſoever, are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Slaves. Truly, if there could be a midle Eſtate found out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſuch a Subjection, (as envolves the Right, I have inferr'd all I have ſpoke from,) and Slavery; it may be that hitherto I have been talking in the Air. But if men have ſtrength of thought enough to ſearch into things as they tend to Practice, and the event; and ſhall not amuſe themſelves with empty ſounds of Words, or Metaphyſical Speculations, and abſtract confuſ'd Ideas: They will ſend, after an impartial enquiry, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Contradictions, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Slave, do equally admit of a Mean betwixt them.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that there is a Salve offered, whereby a limited Monarchy, and Subjection without ſuch a Right, as I have aſcribed to it, may be reconciled together. It is therefore ſaid, That a Slave is the Correlative only of ſuch an Abſolute Monarch, as is under the Government of no Law; but a Subject is of ſuch a limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, as has his Soveraign Power regulated by known and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws, which indeed he cannot make nor repeal without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People. And tho the People are tyed to mere paſſive Obedience, even when he breaks theſe Laws, and Governs by an
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54328:24"/>
Arbitrary and Lawleſs Will; yet they are not to be accounted Slaves, there being notwithſtanding a vaſt difference between an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and a Limited Monarchy. For firſt, a Limited Prince, tho he may make his Will a Law to himſelf, and the only Rule of his Government; yet he cannot make it the Law of the Land: he may break Laws, but he can neither Make nor Repeal them; and therefore he can never alter the Frame and Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, tho he may at preſent interrupt the Regular Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it: and this is a great Security to Poſterity, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Reſtraint upon himſelf. Secondly, It is a mighty uneaſie Thing to any Prince, to Govern contrary to known Laws. He offers as great and conſtant Violence to himſelf, as he does to his Subjects. The breach of his Oath to God, and his Promiſes and Engagements to his Subjects, makes the Exerciſe of ſuch an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power very Troubleſome; and tho his Subjects are bound not to Reſiſt, yet his own guilty Fears will not ſuffer him to be Secure. Thirdly, Tho Subjects muſt not Reſiſt ſuch a Prince who Violats the Laws of his Kingdom; yet they are not bound to Obey him, nor to Serve him in his Uſurpations; as being only bound to yield an active Obedience only according to Law. And it is a mighty uneaſie thing to the greateſt Tyrant, to Govern always by Force: and no Prince in a Limited Monarchy can make himſelf Abſolute, unleſs his own Subjects Aſſiſt him to do ſo. Hence it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for any Subject to ſerve his Prince contrary to Law, all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of a Prince being accountable; and therefore all of them are wary how they ſerve their Prince againſt Law. Fourthly, It is the greateſt Temptation to a Prince that is but Limited, to do all he can to make himſelf Abſolute, when he knows that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects pretend he is accountable to them for any wrong Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government. And therefore it is the ſureſt way for Subjects to preſerve their Liberty, to be tyed not to attempt any thing againſt their Prince, even when he ſets himſelf moſt to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it. Laſtly, It is the Intereſt of the Common-wealth, rather that Subjects ſhould patiently endure the greateſt Out-rages of a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54328:25"/>
Tyrant, than be engaged in a Civil War. And tho a People ſhould prove Fortunate againſt their Prince; yet even then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of the Common-wealth, would be ſo far from being redreſs'd, that on the contrary, all would be expos'd a Prey to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and Deſigning men: and then Diviſions, and Sub diviſions would harraſs all, till either the Strength of the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were ſo exhauſted, that the extreameſt Miſery ſhould only give Quiet and Peace to it; or elſe till ſome Forraign Power ſhould take Advantage of ſuch Inteſtine Buſtles and Confuſions to bring it under a heavier Yoke, than that it had ſhook off. Thus Doctor <hi>Sherlock, Caſe of Reſiſtance:</hi> from Page 207, to 217.</p>
            <p>But all this is ſo far from militating againſt what I have ſaid, that it really ſuppoſes it. For the firſt is expreſs, that the Subjects have an entire Right in the Laws. And all that I infer is, that a Right in the End, without a Right in the Means, is a ridiculous Right. And there can be no Security againſt any interruption the Prince ſhal make of the Regular Adminiſtration of the Government, unleſs that Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be founded in ſuch a Right in the People as is manifeſt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond muſt ſuppoſe, that all the uneaſineſs a Prince may meet with in ruling contrary to the Laws, flowes merely from his being conſcious that the People has Right to vindicate their Right in the Laws. For what elſe ſhould trouble him, more than the Grand Seignior? Beſides the Queſtion is, what the Subjects may juſtly do for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when a Prince breaks through all the reluctancies of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and his Honour, and falls head-long upon the Rights of his People. The third alſo does yet more directly ſhow the Subjects Right. Otherwiſe why ſhould there be ſuch Bonds upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State? But when a Prince gets himſelf furniſhed with ſuch Paraſites, who will not ſtick upon any Conſiderations to embark their whole Fortunes into that Bottom wherein their Princes is Aboard; Muſt therefore all the Right of the Subjects ly as ſo much dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active Lumber beſide them? Moreover, ſuch corrupt Miniſters will endeavour to make Hay while the Sun ſhines, and therefore will put all to the hazard, rather than not ſee that Government entirely
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54328:25"/>
Subverted, which they have ſo great reaſon to be afraid of; that the People may have, whatever Good-will they pleaſe, but not withall Teeth, to bite them. The fourth likewiſe goes upon the ſame Foundation on the one hand, ſince why ſhould the Subjects be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſuch a politick Method, as not to owne their Right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves from Tyranny, if they had not ſuch a Right? And on the other hand it ſuppoſes ſuch an Ambition in all Princes to be Abſolute, as may rather provoke all Subjects to Aſſert their Right to the utmoſt of their Power, than not to expreſs their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about it. And it is worth Conſideration, whether it is not a more forcible Temptation to any Prince that can aſpire after an illimited Power, to adventure upon Subjects that he knows before hand will go like Sheep to the Slaughter, than to aſſault thoſe who he is ſure will uſe all juſt means to ſecure themſelves? And the laſt only poizes the Inconveniencies of Tyranny and of a Civil War together. But Subjects may think upon that accordingly as they ſee their Circumſtances. And it is only Prudence then that is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Buſineſs. For as to point of Right, they may chooſe as they pleaſe which ſide appears moſt convenient for them, and the publick Intereſt of the Common-wealth. But I am not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for what <hi>factious</hi> and <hi>deſigning</hi> men may do, and occaſion. It is only thoſe that are guided by a true and ſincere Conſcience, that I am concerned in. And as a vertuous and conſcientious Prince needs never fear thoſe; ſo a Common-wealth can never ſuffer by them. Now when Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> has not ſaid more on this Head, it is not like that more could have been ſaid on it. And ſo I go to what comes nearer to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And that is, That Our Saviours Example does expound his Doctrine, in a Senſe very contrary to what I have given it. That he might have, not aſpir'd unto, but obtain'd the univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the World, none can doubt, who confeſsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> was God Almighty, as well as Man, like unto us in all things, ſin only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore he checked St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when officiouſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in his Quarrel, with this, <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54328:26"/>
               <hi>my Father, and he ſhall give me more than twelve Legions of Angels</hi> Math. 26. <hi>verſ.</hi> 53. But let him be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to be quite ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of his Omnipotency, and ſhrunk into as much meer Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the whole tenor of his Life made a ſhew of. Yet ſtill we ſhall find he lacked only Ambition, and not Opportunity, for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing himſelf of the whole Power of his Nation. The groanings of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, then vyed with their languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pantings after their <hi>Meſſias, to restore the Kingdom again to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> even in their own fulſome ſenſe. Nothing therefore was more acceptable to them, than was He, who, by the many Signal Prodigies he had wrought, and the no fewer palpable accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Propheſies in his Perſon, had gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d ſo far already, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon their Underſtandings, or their Inclinations, that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them began to aver, <hi>he was the Prophet that ſhould come into the world, John 6. verſ.</hi> 14. And all of them had done ſo, had he but beſtowed that ſingle inſtance, of pretending to the Crown, to have vouched himſelf according to their earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Man they imagin'd ſhould be that ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> greater than was their Firſt. For then their affairs was in ſuch a poſture, that, as well their Neceſſity, as their Temper, prompted them to diſcard the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, and re-eſtabliſh their own ancient one, wherein they might have had <hi>a King who was their Brother; Deut. 17. verſ.</hi> 15. And all things concurr'd ſo mightily for an Univerſal Inſurrection from the Higheſt to the Loweſt, from the Prieſts to the Phariſees, and from theſe to the very meaneſt of the People, that there was no more needfull for it's violent eruption, but ſuch a plauſible Head, as ſparkled all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round with the moſt refulgent Marks of their long'd for Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Hence it is manifeſt, that Our Saviour would have had but to lay hold on thoſe Importunat Invitations, wherewith he was dayly throng'd, for mounting the Throne of his Royal Anceſtor, <hi>David.</hi> And yet we know that he ſtole away from the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that would have made him King; <hi>John 6. verſ</hi> 15. And as ſolicitouſly declin'd the Higheſt Elevation among Men, as others
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54328:26"/>
Court and Fight for it; Nay, as he himſelf was preparing immortal Crowns of Righteouſneſs, for all thoſe that ſhould walk in thoſe Paths he had ſo clearly chalked out unto them. Beſides, his intereſt among the People was ſuch, that, not only the Prieſts at ſeveral times durſt not ſet upon him, for fear of them; but even when he was in their Clutches, when <hi>Pilat</hi> had him at his Mercy, he was in a capacity of getting himſelf reſcued, and that by ordinary means: <hi>If my kingdom were of this World,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>then would my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the</hi> Jews, <hi>Joh. 18. verſ.</hi> 36. So that if he had thought it lawful for Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either to ſhake off their Governours, or to reſiſt them, when they fall to oppreſs them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had never caſt ſuch a Copy to his Followers, who could not but be preſum'd not to follow the Actions of their Maſter, as much as his Words. Yea further, He not only would not ſuffer <hi>St. Peter</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him in an hoſtile manner, but alſo up-braided the raſhneſs of his undertaking, with this ſmart rebuke, <hi>Put up thy ſword into his place; for all they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword;</hi> Mat. 26. <hi>verſ.</hi> 52. And thus he did at once condemn the Doctrine of its being lawful for Subjects to reſiſt the Supreme Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even when they ſuffer the moſt unjuſtly by it; and alſo furniſht us with the moſt eminent Inſtance of non-reſiſtance, that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt Attack could give us occaſion for.</p>
            <p>But, however much this has been urged, I would fain know whether or not our Saviour deſign'd by ſuch an Example to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the Right of the Subject. Yet to anſwer by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal; I ſay to his refuſing to be King, That then <hi>Jacobs</hi> Prophecy was fulfilled, and <hi>the Scepter was departed from Judah,</hi> becauſe <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo was come.</hi> And ſo that Conſtitution which was appointed by God to be peculiar to that People, was then expir'd: And the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were become their lawful Governours, not only by their right of Conqueſt, but even by their own Sollicitation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their Power, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports. Unleſs therefore it could be made out, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were then uſurping over them, by violating the fundamental Conſtitution of their new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54328:27"/>
our Saviour acted but conformably to the Principles I have laid down about Subjection; neither would he have yielded to the deſire of the People to be their King, without overturning thoſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Rules of Government, which were then eſtabliſhed both by the Law of Nature, and of Nations. Yet moreover, it was totally inconſiſtent with our Saviours deſign, to have ever aſſum'd any other Principality to himſelf, but what tender'd him to be the Prince of our Peace with God his Father, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Eternal Life and Salvation unto us. And when he only departed alone into the Mountain, to eſcape the deſign of making him King, without reproving it of injuſtice, as wronging the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign; there are thoughts ſuggeſted thereby to us of a far different nature from thoſe, in behalf of which ſuch a Paſſage is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. For he who taught openly in the Temple thoſe things that were moſt diſtaſteful to the <hi>Jews,</hi> cannot reaſonably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to have dar'd in the Mountain to have expos'd ſuch a wicked Error, as the People then ſhew they entertain'd. It ſeems then that it was ſufficient to his Purpoſe to let them underſtand, that whomever they deſignd to make their King, 'tis like (becauſe of the Oppreſſions they were lying under), he was not the Perſon that could embrace it, his Errand to this World being only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them for a Kingdom in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Then, as to our Saviours Behaviour in the Preſence of, and Anſwer to, <hi>Pilate,</hi> He both ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was not to go over the limites of that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Station he had confin'd himſelf unto; and that he had not ſet up for any Temporal Monarchy; his Kingdom being a Spiritual one, that involved quite other Rights, than thoſe that were repugnant to the Subjection, he as a Member of the Common-wealth, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to pay. Wherefore, tho nothing could have been more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and unjuſt, than was the Treatment he met with, firſt from his Accuſers the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then from the Governour <hi>Pilate;</hi> yet, in the capacity of a ſingle Subject, he reckoned it unlawful to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch an act of Oppreſſion, as extended not, immediatly in its own nature, to endanger the Common-wealth; but only fell hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54328:27"/>
upon his individual concernment. But there is ſomething ſhrewdly imported in theſe words, <hi>then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the</hi> Jews. For it were blaſphemous to think that our Saviour, under any kind of Suppoſition about him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would have given his Verdict to what in it ſelf was unjuſt and unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>And as to the Reprimand St. <hi>Peter</hi> got, it is palpable that our Saviour only intended by it, to ſhow, that altho the Sword was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt the Aſſaults of privat Invaders; ſince he had given Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion even to barter ones Garment for one upon that account: Yet no private Quarrel was ſufficient ground for drawing it againſt the publick and lawful Authority; and that neither He himſelf, nor his Doctrine, however ſacred both were, was to be defended againſt Perſecution by ſuch carnal Means. It is alſo obſervable, that the Verſe 54, <hi>But how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be?</hi> denotes that there was ſomething particular in that whole Affair relating to his Perſon; and that in a certain Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the End why he took our Nature upon him, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſubmit to the Governing Power that then was in the Nation, notwithſtanding it was infinitely abus'd in its management toward him. It cannot indeed be denyed but that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Chap. 2. Verſe</hi> 21. tells us that one end of his ſuffering was for our Imitation; <hi>having,</hi> ſays he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ſuffered for us, to leave us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that we ſhould follow his ſteps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But then our Sufferings muſt reſemble the Motives and Limitations of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it were very odd to Dream, unleſs it were by Dreaming indeed, that the Copy ought to contain more than was in the Original. But where our Saviours Doctrine and Example obliges us to ſuffer, will more fully appear in the enſuing fourth Part of this Diſcourſe. And now I am naturally brought to it;</p>
            <p>Namely, I am to take notice of thoſe Errours that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> themſelves to our Chriſtian Doctrine about Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54328:28"/>
and which do little better than entirely evacuate the whole deſign of it.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, There want not thoſe who pretend to ſuch Original liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the Lawof Nature, as upon every diſguſt they conceive at the Governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, affords them ſome title or other for riſing up againſt it.</p>
            <p>But, to go to the bottom of this, tho I ſhould repeat ſomething I have ſaid before; It is certain that by the Law of Nature there is not one ſpecial Form of Government conſtituted, more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For that Law does not inferr any dependence of one man upon another, or of a whole Body of Men upon one ſingle, or more Perſons; but in ſo far as the Relation betwixt Children and their Parents is conſidered: Since all men are of the ſame Kind, and are conſequently equal in all reſpects to each other. Whence it is that all Governments ariſe, either from a voluntary conceſſion of one Parts natural Right over into the hands of the Other; or from the One Parts having by force wreſted that Right which the Other had by Nature. For now there is no immediate Appointments from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And as the World is ſtated at this day, the Paternal Right for that of a Monarch, is but an empty and Chymerical Notion.</p>
            <p>For all men, ever ſince the Fall of their firſt Fore-father, are over-ruled with ſuch devouring Paſſions, as render them dangerous Neighbours to one another: and <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> is the immediate off-ſpring of their Reaſonable Natures. That therefore they may be able to reſiſt all violence endeavoured againſt them; and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves in the poſſeſſion of thoſe things which may at once preſerve their lives, and make them as comfortable as the preſent condition of Affairs will allow: They have been warranted by that God, from whom they derive their Beeings, and the rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their own intereſt has alſo prompted them, to enter into mutual Compacts and Agreements; The one part reſigning up ſuch a proportion of their Primitive Right to the Other, as may ſufficiently empower this Other to adjuſt all matters of difference that ſhall break out among them; and this Other Part, upon whom ſuch a Power is devolved, promiſing faithfully to diſcharge the Truſt committed by the Other, and never to invade that rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54328:28"/>
Right which they have retain'd to themſelves. Now when any Government takes Birth upon theſe Terms, there are Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to by both Parties, as the Articles of Engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And theſe Laws are on the One hand ſo many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgments of the Natural Liberty of that Part which is ſubjected by the Conſtitution; and on the other, are ſo many Securities of the Rights which they have not delivered up. And whatever is not contain'd in thoſe Laws is eſſentially preſum'd to continue ſtill with the Subjects; but in ſo far as it is indiſpenſably requiſite to the very beeing of that Soveraignty which is transferred by them. Becauſe no man can be juſtly conſtrued to have denuded himſelf of any Right, unleſs a poſitive evidence to the contrary be produced: And alſo, there is always a neceſſary conſtruction of the direct and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced Conſequences, where-ever there is that Principle from whence they do ſpring. All then depends upon the entirely voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of every one of thoſe Perſons who are concerned in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo framed.</p>
            <p>The other Modell goes upon the Right of Conqueſt. And even this falls at long-run into a voluntary condeſcention; tho at firſt not ſo abſolutely ſo, as when there is no other conſtraint in the caſe, than what the neceſſity of Humane Affairs does occaſion. For when one by a prevailing Power overcomes another, the competition that he, who is worſted has to make his choiſe in, is whether or no he will loſs his Life for good and all, or have it vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaf'd him upon thoſe conditions his Conqueror is pleaſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. It is indeed a hard pull to have nothing elſe but Slavery to exchange for ones Life. But yet when one values his Life ſo much more than his Freedom, that he will purchaſe the one at the total expence of the other; he cannot have him to blame who accepts of that which is leaſt dear to himſelf, but only becauſe he put him in a condition, wherein he could not refuſe both. 'Tis true, ſuch a rigorous meaſure will provoke one to retrieve his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty too, when ever he ſhall have it in his Power to do it. And if Providence ſhall favour him with an opportunity for that end,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54328:29"/>
before that which is an oppreſſion in his Conqueror, has by time grown to be a Right; I cannot blame him, if he make the beſt uſe of it he can. For the Law of War denyes nothing to the Man that has Power enough, but only the not managing it according to the Rules of Honour, and Honeſty. But when once ſuch a long fruition of that Soveraignity, that even is ſo illimited, as to have nothing but Slavery below it, comes up to a Preſcription; Then by that very tract of time, in which it has endured, from a queſtionable Title, it advances to the contrary. And alſo thoſe who have trudg'd under the Arbitrary Nod of it, have either, like thoſe Gally-Slaves, who have declin'd a manumiſsion when it was offered them, found ſatisfaction in their Chains, and therefore have, with a reſolute acquieſcence in their Lot abandon'd all further pretence to liberty; or elſe are juſtly to be reputed, not to deſerve that greater Enlargement, which their Courage and Conduct was not for many Ages able enough to procure them. And thus by the Law of Nature it ſelf, which binds every man to what himſelf has conſented to, or which beſtows not that upon him whereof he is unworthy; the Title of Conqueſt upon the Event, is no leſs good and valid, than that of Compact.</p>
            <p>There may alſo be a mixt Government as to its Original, tho as it actually ſtands, it differs not much materially from the former of theſe two. As when a Conqueror, either thinks it his Glory, or his Security, to Reſtrict himſelf in that Power which he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Force, and to grant ſuch Rights and Immunities to the People he has overcome, as may make them Love, when they would only Fear him; according to what I ſaid before. Then ſuch a condeſcention is to be Interpreted a voluntary yeilding of that Right which by the Law of Arms was obtain'd. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho ſuch a Soveraign might at firſt have triumphed over his People as Slaves, and kept them under the Terror of that condition; Yet now he ought not to treat them but as Subjects, and to let them poſſeſs thoſe Freedoms, which himſelf was content they ſhould enjoy. Only whatever is not included in the Laws, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54328:29"/>
are made between them, that is to remain with him; ſince all was his before: And ſo without a poſitive Evidence that he paſt from it, his Title thereto muſt ſtill continue valid. Yet it lyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at his door, to prove the Conqueſt, even as to this; becauſe a Natural Right cannot be taken away, without a Poſitive One be brought againſt it, And theſe Subjects, who are thus gainers by this Conſtitution, cannot but be thought to have given a hearty conſent to it, and that they have reckoned themſelves obliged by their Prince when he dealt ſo generouſly with them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, now to return to the matter in hand, it is palpable that nothing can be brought from that <hi>Prior</hi> Eſtate to any Poſitive Conſtitution, wherein Men are by Nature, to overturn This, or That Government. Becauſe every Man has full Right in that, which another, who had Right to it before, tranferr'd the Right of to him: And becauſe no Right can more validly paſs from one to another, than when he who acquires it, has it by the Conſent of him that tranſmits it. Now the Law of Nature oblidges every body to make good and effectual, as far as they can, that Right which they beſtow. And therefore the Law of Nature, or of <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> can never take place in any Government, till once the very Fundamental Conſtitution of that Government ſhal be attacqued by him, to whom the Conſent of being Soveraign was yeilded. However then it ſhall be pretended, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of any Government contradicts the Law of Nature: Yet (ſince it muſt neceſſarily contradict that Law, in as much as it puts Bonds and Reſtraints upon the Natural Liberty, and Right of the greateſt Part, and proportionably encreaſes That of the leaſt) nothing can be gathered from thence, but that the Subjects were perhaps Fools, that at firſt ſubmitted upon ſuch or ſuch Terms, and that now they are to keep themſelves to their bargain.</p>
            <p>And were it otherwiſe, no imaginable kind of Government could be Long-liv'd, or Laſting. Becauſe every man almoſt has a Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Inclination after this or that degree of Liberty; and what has a ſtrong Inclination to back it, ſeldom fails to be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54328:30"/>
a Right by Nature; and ſo there would be as many Syſtemes of Laws of Nature in a Nation, as there would be Heads in it. And conſequently nothing could terminate thoſe diſcords, but a meer State of Nature, wherein every Individual Perſon were to ſhift for himſelf. At this rate therefore the very deſign and end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would entirely be defeated, and none could be kept under, further than as there were an over-awing force hanging over them, to compel them to their Duty; and the bare principle of fear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome other of a more ingenuous kind, uſes not to hold out long, and even when it does it, all things are neceſſarily in a poſture of War. So that, if pretexts from the Law of Nature, could juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take effect, all Government were really but a Sham; and the common honeſty of the World, which Nature dictates to reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures, were but of the ſame Stamp. For the firſt Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Conſent could be retracted when the Conſenters humor took them; and every new Caprice would beget a new Mutiny, whereby Government, and no Government, would become the very ſame thing. Now all that can be objected to this will come more pertinently afterwards to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Whence it was that Our Apoſtle enjoyns Subjection, becauſe <hi>all powers are ordained of God;</hi> That is, God confirms the Titles which Soveraigns have to rule over their People, and ſets his Seal to thoſe Conſents upon which all Government at firſt took Birth; ſo that none can reſiſt the Powers, but he muſt <hi>receive to himſelf damnation,</hi> but he muſt have the Almighty to revenge thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which he ſhall be guilty of toward them. It is alſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that Our Saviour, when he ordered the <hi>Herodians</hi> to <hi>Render to Caeſar the things which were Caeſars,</hi> made no ſearch at all in the Right that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had to Rule over the <hi>Jews;</hi> but ſuppoſ'd that, whether it was by Compact, or Conqueſt, yet it was a good Right, not to be quarrelled by thoſe who were now Subjects to him. The ſame does in like manner flow from St. <hi>Peters</hi> Words, as any that ſhal conſider them will ſee. Wherefore the Chriſtian Religion height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſent unto Conſcience. And that was the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that all Governments received from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54328:30"/>But there is another Error much more pernicious than this, which has, alas! ſadly prevail'd over the moſt part of the Chriſtian World. An Error that has Sown more Serpents Teeth in Chriſtendome, than ever the Sons of <hi>Draco</hi> did in <hi>Thebes,</hi> after his defeat by <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> An Error that has been the Source of more miſchief to the Chriſtian Religion, than all the <hi>Hereſies</hi> that it was ever peſtered with could have been, without it. An Error that has more ſerv'd the Devils turn to ruine Chriſtianity, and to Act his Maſter-Plot againſt it, than any other Engine that Infernal Fiend ever did, ever could, employ. An Error that has at one daſh ſent hundreds of thouſands to their Graves in the moſt Barbarous manner, and has hallowed, has chriſtened Murder, Parricide, Sacriledge, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, Treaſon, Rebellion, and what not? And an Error that by the Effect, tho it ſhould not by the Principle, has fill'd Hell with more Chriſtians, than ever it was ſo by Witch-craft, Adultery, Drunkenneſs, or thoſe other Sins of the Fleſh, that abound moſt among Men. Theſe ſure are Lineaments of the Picture black enough to make it be underſtood. And now the Art of Limning is more accompliſhed, than that we need Paint <hi>A Sathan</hi> over the Head of what naturally reſembles one. Yet if we muſt needs have the Name of a thing told us, before we can learn what it is, however genuinly it be painted forth; It is that Error by which it is thought lawful to ſpue out the moſt furious Zeal, not only againſt all that ſhall be reputed Heretickes, but even againſt all thoſe Magiſtrats, and Soveraign Princes, that ſhall not give full ſcope and range to whatever ſhall be pretended to be for God, and for Religion, or for holy Church.</p>
            <p>Now that it is as repugnant to the genius of our holy and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Religion, as any thing can be, will appear, tho we ſhould only carry the matter home from that Principle that was laid down before: Namely, That Our Saviour never deſign'd that his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould create diſturbance in the World, or ſhould deprive Princes of thoſe Rights which belong to them by the Civil Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of thoſe Nations over which they Rule. But if he had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54328:31"/>
his Followers to aſſert their Religion, perchance Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, by the Sword, to propagate their Faith by Carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and to invade Soveraigns when they would not comply with them; Then had he made the moſt intollerable encroachments upon the Rights of Princes, that poſſibly they could have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For whenever any Cluſter of Subjects ſhould be gained to an Opinion, however abſurd and monſtruous, the State would then be obnoxious to be embroil'd, and to be hurried into Confuſion and Tumult; the Prince would either be conſtrain'd to defend himſelf againſt the growing Inſolencies of a Party ſo principl'd, or elſe to eſpouſe its quarrel, and ſwear to its Dictats; and thus upon every Wind of new Doctrine (which never fails to juſtifie its Title, by its ſudden going to and fro, ſo that none can know when it ſhall ariſe, nor how long it ſhall continue) he ſhould be blown, either from the Rational Liberty of every Mans Soul in chooſing a Religion, or elſe from the Throne he ſits on. But to endeavour to diſcourſe this, were to ſuppoſe that we were living ſixteen, but eſpecially ſix, hundred years ago; and that we were only to talk of the natural tendencies of things, without reflecting upon what has happened in the World, with ſo much Noiſe and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that no Eare could now be one, and yet not have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed with that too. And therefore, if Our Saviour had allowed Chriſtians ſo to maintain, or to ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> their Religion, he had Acted the higheſt contradiction poſſible to himſelf, when he commanded all manner of Subjects to be ſubmiſſive to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, without diſquieting them in the juſt Poſſeſſion of their Rights and Prerogatives. Neither ſhall any be able to ſhow us what could more effectually ſhake all the Monarchies on Earth, than this damnable Principle, of ſighting meerly for Religion, has done.</p>
            <p>It is indeed pretended, that ſince Subjects are not allowed to aſſert their Right in the end of the Government, but when they are to deal Conſcientiouſly with the Higher Powers; and are not denyed to lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k to their Intereſt, when they Act at that Rate: So
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54328:31"/>
if Conſcience be permitted impartially to govern Men, there can be no hazard of ſuch diſturbance to the Government; tho Subjects ſhould have the Liberty to compel the Magiſtrat both to profeſs the true Religion himſelf, and to encourage the profeſſion of it in others. For there being only but one Religion that is not falſe, there can no more prejudice flow from the Subjects being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to aſſert That, than from their freedom to vindicat the Right they have, as they are Subjects. So that the ſame things may here be Argued, if in ſtead of the Word, <hi>Right,</hi> that of, <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhal be uſed. Eſpecially when the true Religion is as obvious to every Body, as the Conſtitution of this or that Nation is; Since the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures are acknowledged, by all Proteſtants, to be both a plain and a ſufficient Rule of Faith; and no Laws are more, as to any ſpecial Conſtitution whatſoever: And when it is chiefly upon Conſcience that all Government does depend; and no Conſcience is abſolutely ſufficient for that end, but in ſo far as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ottom'd upon the true Religion. And thus the true Religion being the beſt Means to ſecure the Government, the Subjects, by their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Right in the End of the Government, have alſo Right in the ſureſt Means that can advance it. It ſeems therefore conſequential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow, that Our Saviour, by ſettling the ſixteſt Foundation of Government, and not prejudging the Subjects Right in the End of it, did, in purſuance of his Deſign, lay a neceſſity upon all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either to Reſign their Thrones, or embrace his Religion, whenever their Subjects ſhould once do it.</p>
            <p>This I think is the moſt that can be ſaid in behalf of this Plea. But yet there are ſeveral things to be urged againſt it. As firſt, That the whole Scheme of it is founded upon this ſuppoſition; That the Bible being a plain and ſufficient Rule of Faith, there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as little reaſon to ſuſpect that Men, notwithſtanding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent depravation of their Nature, will miſtake or err in Matters of Religion, as there is, that they will be deluded in things relating to the Conſtitution of a Nation. It is eaſily yeilded that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are clear and perſpicuous in all neceſſary Points of Faith, to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54328:32"/>
every ſober and ingenuous Enquirer. But when the Doctrine of the Croſs is ſo expreſly ſet down in Scripture, as ſhall by and by be ſhewed, and yet nevertheleſs is controverted ſo vehemently on all hands; Is it not a ſhrew'd indication that the plaineſt things about Religion are not, cannot be, ſo very plain, but that they may be call'd in queſtion? And this were enough, were there no more to demonſtrate what is the influence of Education, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or Bigottry, or a Maggot, or Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when there is only palpable Evidence to ly in the other ſcale againſt them. It were not pertinent here throughly to unravel this Myſtery of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs; or to ſhow why it is that the moſt of Men are ſo ſeduced, ſo bewitched and infatuated, as in ſpight of the brighteſt Light, to bewilder themſelves in the gloomieſt Shades, and <hi>to love darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light.</hi> It ſhall ſuffice to tell you, that the Articles of our Religion are of a Speculative and Abſtruſe nature; and principally do employ our Faith, and not that practical Knowledge, which we uſe to have of thoſe things that concern the affairs of this life. And how ſadly That can be impoſ'd upon, the World is not now, after ſo much experience, to learn. And in contemplation of this it was, that Our Saviour foretold, that <hi>Hereſies mustneeds come.</hi> But the caſe alters quite, when we are to take up meaſures about the Conſtitution of a Government. Since there is no People in the World, but can make the diſtinction between their being Subjects or Slaves: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever are the former, do at leaſt underſtand ſo much of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that they cannot but be ſenſible, when, and when not, there is a certain and great and imminent danger of their being rob'd of their Freedom, and reduced to Fetters. For the Legal Security that Subjects are wont to have for their Religon, their Lives, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, never was yet but ſo manifeſt and conſpicuous, that the very Underſtandings of Men muſt loſe their Names, before any conſideration whatſoever can prevail over them in ſuch a point. And tho that all this can be ſaid in favours of Religion alſo; yet the difference is, as to the Conſtitution of a Government, that This is no more obnoxious to be miſ-conſtrued; than is the common Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54328:32"/>
that ordinarily paſs betwixt Man and Man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Event is the thing mainly aimed at, it is very fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to argue from the Evidence it ſelf that the Scriptures give us of the true Religion, to that which Subjects have of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. 'Tis indeed not to be denyed, but that thoſe who moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly clamour out againſt the Government of any Nation, never fail to Load it the moſt heavily with Tyranny, Oppreſſion, and Arbitrary Power; and have ſtill ſuch a ſtore of Grievances hanging at their Tongues End, as if the Conſtitution were Violated, and all the Rights of the Subject broke and overturned. And we have a fatal example of this from this Day. And ſo it would ſeem, that even the Conſtitution of a Nation is as lyable to be made ſerve the factious Deſigns of ill Men, as the moſt difficult Points of Religion are. The truth is, nothing can be ſo ingenuouſly done by the beſt of Governours, but there will always be ſome found to Calumniat and Wreſt it. But yet when thoſe who do ſo, fall in the hands of Juſtice, the Defences they uſe to make for themſelves, do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently betoken the guilt that hovereth over their Conſciences; and they do ſeldom die, more regrated by all good Chriſtians, than the worſt of Criminals are wont to do. And even when a powerful Party gets the uppermoſt, and God permits them to ſcourge a People, yet all their Arguments depend upon their Swords; and, however much they may force Men outwardly to aſſent to the Juſtneſs of their Cauſe, yet all the Violence wherewith they can harraſs them, reaches not the inward thoughts of their Minds, and they will there condemn what elſewhere they muſt approve. And hence it is, that the Adminiſtration of the Government can never be ſo unjuſtly complain'd of, but that the eyes of all the World will be open to the wrongs it ſhall ſuſtain. But you may alſo remember what was ſaid as to this already.</p>
            <p>The only difficulty therefore that ariſes from this Competition, is, That Conſcience is ſtill but a crazy foundation for any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the true Religion is ſo ready to be worſted by Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Intereſt. But all that I have alledged upon this Head,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54328:33"/>
goes no further, than that in the nature of the thing it ſelf, nothing can be ſo proper for the ſecurity of any Government, as Conſcience rooted in the true Religion; And that Subjects muſt firſt be, either Hereticks, or Debauchees, before their Prince can have ground to miſdoubt them; And conſequently that, ſince the true Religion has all the Evidence for it that can work with ſincere and rational Men, it highly concerns all Princes to uſe their utmoſt endeavours that Prejudice, or Superſtition, or the Deſigns of this World, do not proſper too much in the hearts of thoſe over whom they Reign; as on the other hand it is the intereſt of the Subjects to do all that can be <hi>lawful</hi> for them, to prevent that their Soveraign be not gain'd over to a Religion, from whence they cannot reaſonably expect that full ſecurity to themſelves, which the Profeſſion of the true Religion would afford them. So that <hi>happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> But that Providence, without which the ſmalleſt hair of our heads falls not to the ground, is moſtly to be lookt to, and depended upon, in all this. And in this matter, neither the Prince, nor the People, can be too cautious in what they undertake; leſt a wrong ſtep in the Means, bring on an End of Ruine and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>But, waving all this; If Chriſt had allowed Subjects to force their Prince, either to lay down his Crown, or to profeſs that which they ſhould think to be the true Religion, even when they ſhould not be deceived in it; Then he had manifeſtly made an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Rights of Princes. Becauſe now they were not to hold their Dominions upon the ancient terms of the Conſtitutions of their ſeveral Nations; but alſo upon this new ſupervenient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of being of the true Chriſtian Religion. And there is nothing more clear, than that his Right is invaded, who cannot juſtly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, without performing more, than what by the firſt Articles of obtaining it, he was obliged unto. None will doubt but that our Saviour might have laid this new tye upon all Soveraigns, if he had pleaſed: and thereby have made Infidelity, or Hereſie, a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for their Orthodox Subjects to Depoſe them. But then he had aſſum'd to himſelf a Civil Power and Authority; and had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54328:33"/>
new Modelled the Governments of the World; contrary to what I ſhewed before, and to what this Objection I am Anſwering pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in the third place, tho our Saviour did not meddle with the Civil Rights of Subjects, yet he beſtowed no ſuch Right upon them as might overturn that of their Soveraign. And ſo, however much the true Religion contributes to the advantage of the Government; yet, ſince it cannot be impoſed upon the Prince without encroaching upon his Right, no warrand can be preſum'd from any thing our Saviour ever taught, or did, to dethrone Princes meerly for the ſake of their Religion. Beſides, Religion is no <hi>Civil,</hi> but only a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Mean, for promoting the Intereſt of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore it cannot accreſce to the Subjects Right in the Means requiſite for that end. Otherwiſe it might as well be ſaid, that Subjects have Right, that the Grace of God ſhould work power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon the Soul of their Prince, that he never but act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly in his adminiſtrating the Power he is veſted with. And thus we ſhould fall into that old exploded opinion, That <hi>Dominion is founded in Grace.</hi> No Subject therefore can have reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, as if our Saviour had not dealt kindly enough with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has not put a Sword in his hand, whereby to rob his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of his Crown and juſt Right. Certainly all Subjects owe him the humbleſt reſentments of gratitude, that he ſettled all the Governments in the World more firmly upon their wonted Pillars and Foundations, than ever they were before; Tho he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweave his Religion with their Political Conſtitutions and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments.</p>
            <p>But, laſt of all, Subjects muſt ceaſe to be Chriſtians before they can think upon Fighting at any rate for their Religion, merely as it is ſuch. For, whether the Doctrine, or the Example, of our Saviour be conſidered; It appears manifeſt to all ſober and unprejudic'd men, that nothing can be more repugnant to the deſign of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than that it ſhould be fought for, as if it were ſome Prize or Bootie. And as to the former, What can be more expreſs, Than,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54328:34"/>
               <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven; Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake.

Fear them not therefore; and fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul; but rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell; whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in heaven; but whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny before my father which is in heaven;</hi> from verſ. 17. to 33. <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me; for whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it, but whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake and</hi>

               <hi>the Goſpels, the ſame ſhall ſave it; for what ſhall it profite a man, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul.</hi> Mark 8. verſ. 34, 35, 36. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple; whoſoever he be of you that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple.</hi> Luke 14. from verſ. 26. to 33. And in conſequence of this Doctrine, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely rebuked the two Diſciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when they would have had him <hi>command fire to come down from heaven to conſume</hi> the greateſt Hereticks and Schiſmaticks that were then in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and who denyed him enterance in their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and would <hi>not receive him, becauſe his face was as though he would go to</hi> Jeruſalem; Luke 9. verſ. 51. to 54. Telling thoſe Apoſtles, verſ. 55. <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of; for the ſon of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> Therefore alſo did he uſe the gentleſt method of enforcing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon his Followers, <hi>If any man will be my diſciple; If any man will come after me.</hi> And when <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>did perſecute him, and ſought to ſlay him,</hi> (John 5. verſ. 16. and forward), He took no other courſe to oppoſe them, but only to juſtifie himſelf by the moſt convincing Arguments and Demonſtrations, from the Power of working Miracles that was ſo viſibly lodged in him, from the excellency of his Doctrine, and from his having accompliſhed the Propheſies that the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament contain'd of the Meſſias to come. Thus the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommendeth to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 6. verſ. 1. <hi>To reſtore thoſe that have been overtaken in a fault, in the ſpirit of meekneſs; conſidering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leſt they alſo be tempted.</hi> But we ſhall hardly caſt up any place of the New Teſtament, even at <hi>random,</hi> but we ſhall find ſomething to this purpoſe; there being nothing that goeth more univerſally through the whole Doctrine of Chriſtianity (as a Gold Vein doth through the Ore), than that Chriſtians ſhould ſuffer any thing for their Religion, before they ſhould take up Arms in defence of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54328:35"/>Yet leſt Precept and Teaching had not been enough to have born in this Chriſtian Duty upon us, we have the moſt uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible Pattern ſet before our eyes, that can poſſibly take with thoſe, who are not reſolved, in ſpight of all the methods of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, to ſtand out in behalf of their own Opinion and Humour. And whatever has been ſaid hitherto of our Saviours Example, does in an eminent manner ſpeak to the purpoſe in this place. And here the only proper and true gloſs can be given of thoſe words, which were before cited from St. <hi>Peter, For even hereunto were ye called; becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that ye ſhould follow his ſteps; who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he threatned not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 Epiſt. Chap. 2. verſ. 21, 22 23 Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any tollerable Senſe be put upon that Rebuke this Apoſtle got, for offering to defend his Maſter by the Sword; nor upon that Anſwer our Lord gave <hi>Pilat, My kingdom is not of this world,</hi>  Unleſs, beſides all the reſpective Circumſtances our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſtood in, it ſhall further be granted, that he was bound up by the very tenor of his own Religion neither to call for Legions of Angels, nor yet to command Troups of his Servants, to fight in his defence. For it is quite unaccountable, how one that can reſcue himſelf by a proportionable force, can with any juſtice yield up himſelf to a cruel and barbarous Execution, tho inflicted by the Magiſtrat; if there were not ſome other more ſacred tye upon him to do ſo, than what can flow from the Civil Conſtitution of any Nation. And there is as little ground to think that the Son of God would, merely to undergo a Death for Mankind, have choos'd to do it in a way, that had made it look ſo much like a Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the moſt ingenious Wit of this World could not have even plauſibly excus'd it from being one; without his Sufferings had at once been in conformity to his Religion, and to ſet a Copy to his Followers too. Wherefore, as he ſubmitted to an unjuſt Sentence, becauſe he would not ſtep out of the Circle of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54328:35"/>
Condition; and as at that time he did <hi>this</hi> to fulfil the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; So that which then rendered <hi>this</hi> to be lawful in him, was only the Doctrine which himſelf had taught, the <hi>ſuffering for Righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> And tho the great Errand for which he came into the World, was to redeem the Inhabitants of it, and ſo to die for them; Yet all things relating to his Crucifixion were ſo brought about by the Providence of God, that the King of Kings died as a ſingle Subject, and the Author of our Faith, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And thus his not reſiſting the moſt violent Oppreſſion and Tyranny that ever was acted upon the Earth, when it was in his Power to have done it; became to be lawful in him, or rather to be agreeable to that Holineſs which was eſſential to his Perſon; tho otherwiſe we had been left, either to ſearch out an Apology for it, but in vain; or elſe profoundly to adore thoſe hidden Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which Angels could never have pryed into. And certainly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, ſeems not well to quadrate with thoſe Scriptures that have been Cited, and many others alſo, which are obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, that is but moderatly converſant in the Volumn of them.</p>
            <p>Nothing then can be more contradictory to the true Spirit of our Chriſtian Religion, than is that fierce, that virulent, that furious, that perſecuting, that deſtructive, that exterminating, that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, that aſſaſſinating, that bloody, and that helliſh zeal, or rather rage, whereby ſome men are egg'd on to the greateſt Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Cruelties, both againſt their Neighbours, and their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns alſo, merely for <hi>Conſcience ſake, falſly ſo called.</hi> But, I ſhall conclude this (it being a Matter ſo fully handled by the ableſt Pens, and which I had not ſaid ſo much to, but that my Text obliged me to it, and that it requires <hi>Preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon</hi> as much as any thing can do ſo) in the words of the never enough admired Doctor <hi>Tillot ſon,</hi> Vol. 3. of his Sermons, Page 15. <hi>The Chriſtian Religion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>does as plainly teach the contrary as it does any other matter whatſoever; and it is not more evident in the New Teſtament that Chriſt died for ſinners, than that</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54328:36"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians ſhould not kill one another for the miſbelief of any Article of</hi> revealed <hi>Religion; much leſs for the diſbelief of ſuch Articles as are</hi> invented <hi>by men, and impoſed as the Doctrines of Christ.</hi> Now if the hands of all Chriſtians be ſo tyed up, when Religion only is the Quarrel; What kind of Chriſtians muſt thoſe Subjects be, who think they do God good Service, when they Rebel againſt their Soveraign, merely becauſe he will not, both profeſs himſelf what Religion they would preſcribe to him, and ſuffer them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the whole Common-wealth, that they may get ſuch a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as humours them, introduc'd into it? Certainly they can be of no other Rank, than were thoſe, of whom our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that they would value themſelves upon that ſcore, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſavagely butchered his own Apoſtles, and thoſe who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by him, to preach his Religion to the Infidel World. And hence, tho the Story of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Pigeon had been true, yet it had been as much diſcovered to be a Trick and Impoſture, by fixing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pommel of his Sword, as by picking Peaſe out of his Ear.</p>
            <p>It is therefore quite another thing for Subjects to vindicate the Legal Right they have to profeſs their Religion, from their ſighting for it purely upon its own account. For as Religion is the thing in the World that men ought to be moſt concerned in; ſo none can doubt, but that it is very juſt and lawful for any People, to place the liberty of profeſſing and owning their Religion, among the firſt and moſt Eſſential Priviledges, they as Subjects, are to derive from the Conſtitution of that Government under which they live. And indeed when any Government is a conſtituting, nothing can be more incumbent upon the Subjects, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſufficiently for the free exerciſe of their Religion: As when it is conſtituted, they ought not to be wanting in all the due and lawful means they can employ for ſecuring that to themſelves by Law. Hence the Religion of no Subjects that is eſtabliſhed in this manner, can ever be invaded, without the Conſtitution of their Government to be ſo too. And ſo the ſuffering meerly for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can only be in thoſe Nations, where it is not the Subjects
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54328:36"/>
Right to profeſs their Religion, in the virtue of their Conſtitution. And in thoſe Nations, where the Religion of the Subjects is fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Law, however much they ſhall be perſecuted for their Religion; Yet, beſides what the Prince is guilty of upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as a Perſecutor, he muſt alſo be ſo, upon that of a Tyrant and Oppreſſour; in as much as he muſt break through all the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries betwixt him and his People, before he can trouble them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Religion. So that the Subjects have equal Right to vindicate any encroachments attempted upon their Religion, when the Profeſſion of it is embodied with their Conſtitution, to that they have to aſſert their Lives and their Fortunes. And in this caſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is only to be conſidered as it has become a Civil Right and Property; being here no more, <hi>formally,</hi> but a thing wherein the Intereſt of the Subjects is moſt deeply engaged.</p>
            <p>But it muſt not here be pretended, That no Government can be erected upon ſuch a Conſtitution, as does not <hi>interpretatively</hi> at leaſt, leave Subjects <hi>Right</hi> to exerciſe their Religion: Becauſe, forſooth, all Government owes its Inſtitution to Almighty God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be reputed to have any other Sphere wherein to exert its Power, but what he has chalked out unto it, firſt by the Law of Nature, and then by thoſe Revelations he has been pleaſ'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the World; and conſequently muſt always act in a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to the promoting that great End and Deſign for which he created Mankind, and Government among them too; which the Profeſſion of the true Religion is. And thus the Subjects muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be preſumed to have reſerved to themſelves the Right of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that Religion, which they ſhall think to be true; ſince, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it lyes at their door to transfer any ſuch Power upon their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, as ſhall contradict that Right which eſſentially belongs to them, as they are the Creatures and Servants of God; nor yet can any Monarch aſſume to himſelf a power, which the Soveraign Lord of Lords has originally precluded him from in the firſt Ordination of Government. This, I ſay, is not to be alledged; Becauſe, we have ſeen already how expreſly God has reveal'd himſelf upon the point
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54328:37"/>
of aſſertng the Chriſtian Religion by Arms. And what the mind of God was in the firſt Appointment of Government, we can only learn from the nature of the thing, and from thoſe lively Oracles which are the only Standard of his revealed Will toward Men. None will deny that no Magiſtrate can juſtly perſecute any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, meerly for their Religion, provided it include nothing that tends to the diſturbing the Government, and to encourage thoſe Moral Vices which are a Scandal to all Religion, becauſe ſo to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature it ſelf; and that by no Compact made betwixt him and them, he can lawfully compel them to violate any of the Laws of God, whether they be dictated by Nature, or by Religion. And ſo upon this reſpect it muſt be granted that Subjects have a certain Right founded on their dependence upon God, to do nothing but what is conſonant to the Laws of Nature and Religion. But yet this Right is only <hi>Equivocal</hi> to That, which we have all along been diſcourſing upon: Becauſe it does not but remotely regard the Political Conſtitution of Government; in ſo far, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary deſign of this goes no further, than where mutual Com-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſes and Agreements are ſettled between a People and their Governours, for their publick ſafety and peace, in the enjoyment of thoſe things, which they condeſcend upon, as the matters they are eſpecially concerned in. And ſuch Compacts being neceſſary that Men ſhould live together like Men, and not like Beaſts in a Wilderneſs; God by inſtituting Government, ratified them, and gave his Sanction to that Politick Right, which both the Prince and the People do obtain by them. But it is a great fetch to draw in other things to thoſe Rights, than were at firſt preſum'd to be involved in them. For thus there would be, upon the event (as the World now goes) an Arbitrary Power lodged in the Subjects; whereby upon every Caprice about the Law of Nature, or the true Religion, the whole Settlement of the Government would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; ſince ſtill it might be pretended that, tho ſuch and ſuch things had been at firſt agreed upon at the eſtabliſhing of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, yet it was not in the Subjects Power to diveſt themſelves of ſuch a Right, nor in the Soveraigns to receive it from them; as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54328:37"/>
was ſufficiently demonſtrated before in this Head upon which I now am. Wherefore all the <hi>interpretative</hi> Right that Subjects have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their Conſtitution, muſt only be ſo, as it bears a full Analogy to the very Being and Nature of the Conſtitution it ſelf; as you ſee thoſe things this Objection goes upon cannot do. God therefore, for the ſecurity of Government, has not allowed Subjects to vindicate any other Rights, than what they poſſeſs in a juſt conformity to the Conſtitution in which they are; and has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to ſuffer patiently, and with a Chriſtian Spirit, when-ever they ſhall be perſecuted by a lawful Authority (tho then acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly) becauſe of not complyance with thoſe things that he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the contrary of; promiſing to all that ſhall do ſo in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his will, that <hi>all their light afflictions in this life, that endure but for a moment, ſhall be recompenſed with an eternal weight of glory.</hi> And I doubt not but all thoſe, who uſe ſeriouſly to think two or three conſequences off, will find, that nothing can be a ſufficient foundation for any Government, but meer Force and Power; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thoſe Principles, I have been refuting, be once diſowned; as being of the moſt dangerous tendency to ſhake all Governments looſe, that any can be.</p>
            <p>Yet we muſt carefully obſerve, That all Subjects are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding bound, both by the Law of Nature, and of Religion, not to concurr <hi>actively</hi> with their Prince, when he would be at perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting any of his People, for not doing thoſe things that are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by theſe Laws. For in all caſes whatſoever <hi>God is rather to be obeyed, than Man:</hi> And ſuch an obedience to a Princes command, is ſo far from being Legittimated by the Shroud of his Authority, that it ſhares the Guilt betwixt him that performs it, and him that enjoyn'd it. However there is great circumſpection to be uſed even as to this; that a Princes Commands be not wholly fruſtrated by groundleſs pretenſions of their being unjuſt; and ſo that the whole end of the Government, which depends entirely upon theſe, be not evacuated and diſappointed. And every man is to be guided here by his Diſcretion, and Conſcience; and that at his utmoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, both as to this, and the next World; according to what has been ſaid already in the foregoing Head, and This.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54328:38"/>Having thus abundantly clear'd this matter about fighting merely for Religion; there remains now for me only to lay the charge of the contrary rebellious Doctrine to their door, to whom it does juſtly belong; I mean thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I am ſenſible enough how very invidious it may be thought in me, to fall upon them at this time, and eſpecially for ſuch a Tenet. 'Tis true, I was laid aſide from my Charge, from <hi>February</hi> 1686, to <hi>December</hi> 1687; meerly for Preaching from this Pulpit a Sermon againſt Popery; and how all that while I was treated, the whole Nation knows. And ſo I may be reputed to vent thoſe reſentments, which before I durſt not adventure upon. But I bleſs God, I can heartily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my greateſt enemies. And tho the malice of the Papiſts have harraſs'd me as much, as with any tollerable countenance they could put a face upon it; Yet the utmoſt of my revenge goes no higher, than that it may pleaſe God in his mercy to them, and to me, to bleſs my poor endeavours ſo far, that they may prove ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to their Conviction, and ſo to their abandoning thoſe Errors, that muſt be Errors, if Chriſtianity be not one. And it is my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to hate more to inſult over misfortunate Adverſaries, than to be oppreſs'd by them for a thing that becomes a man to do, to owne his Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither have I any deſign, as God can bear me Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to expoſe them to thoſe ſeverities from the Government, which, if they were not at the mercy of Proteſtants, they might perhaps juſtly enough be afraid of. It is not the perſon of any man I have a quarrel with. And the more I labour to diſcover any mans miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, the more thanks he owes me. But I am not the firſt that has been accounted <hi>an enemy for telling the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the mean time, it cannot be conſtrued impertinent to the preſent occaſion, to Stage the Popiſh Religion for ſuch miſchievous Principles; when it is conſidered, that it was only a Popiſh Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that prevail'd for getting Du <hi>Moulin</hi>'s Book ſuppreſſed; and when ſeveral Memoires and Collections ſhall be impartially lookt into. And I doubt if the Papiſts of that time, could (were they yet living) cleanly wipe off the guilt of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Troubles and Murder. It is indeed the higheſt calumny to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all of that Profeſſion had an acceſſion to them. No certainly;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54328:38"/>
there was many, whoſe Honour and Humanity was too ſtrong for the Bigottry of their Religion; and who therefore ſhew as redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fortitude and Honeſty, in their Maſters behalf, as they were of a Religion, that in it ſelf was baſe and treacherous. And if any thing could juſtifie men againſt the violation of what was ſo Sacred, as is the very Name of Religion; Theſe deſerved to be Crown'd with more immortal Lawrels, than ever Encircled the Heads of ſuch, as had their Religion, and their Duty and Generoſity, of a ſide. And this, I ſay, not to detract from their Perſonal Worth, but only to put us in mind what bad influence ſo ill a Religion can have upon the beſt Actions; when They muſt degenerate, by their very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation with That. But ſtill they were Perſons of the beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Rank that withſtood, that overcame the Dictates of <hi>Rome.</hi> And we ſhall not need to multiply Figures for the whole Number of Prieſts and Jeſuites, that own'd any further concernment in that Royal Martyr, than as the Conjunctures gave them a favourable Proſpect. Thus the men that had that Religion moſtly for their Trade, and their Temper too, made the beſt advantage they could of all our confuſions; hoping in the event to manage them ſo, that out of a blind zeal for Proteſtancy, Popery ſhould ſpring forth. And upon this account, neither King, nor People, was Sacred to them, but in as much, as they ſaw Holy Church was to reſult from their Ruines. But ſtill I will ſay with <hi>Cicero</hi> (tho adding a word to him), <hi>Me Natura miſericordem, Patria &amp; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio ſeverum, crudelem nec Religio nec Patria nec Natura eſſe voluit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall only let all Papiſts ſee, that by the very Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their Religion, they ought to be of ſuch a damnable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as leaves nothing, no Prince, inviolable, when Popery comes in Competition. I know it were needleſs to run to the Practice, and Bulls of their Popes; to the Doctrine of their greateſt Doctors; to the Books of their Cannon Law; or even to the Deciſions of their Councils, for proving this. For a Courtly ſort of Papiſts ſet up in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Brittain</hi> within ſome years ago, have made it their great buſineſs to contradict theſe with a down-right impudence, as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54328:39"/>
manifeſtly, as they uſe to do Senſe and Reaſon in the point of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. Had there been no more writ againſt them, than what the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> has done, one would think, that either ſuch Principles muſt be rejected by them, or elſe Popery it ſelf. But ſome People know how to be Proof againſt all manner of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Peter Welch</hi> has indeed writ well againſt that Doctrine, tho not againſt that Biſhop. He has clearly made it to appear, that by univerſal Tradition, nothing ought to be admitted by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that ſavours in the leaſt of ſuch a Treaſonable tendencie: As Mr. <hi>Allix</hi> has demonſtrated, that Tranſubſtantiation was not the belief of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church before the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And the great thing I admire in the Man, next to his ingenuous following the Truth in it ſelf, is, that he never underſtood he was purſuing a Proteſtant Tenet, upon a Proteſtant Principle. And I'll engadge to refute all the Hereſies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as effectually as he has done That one of it, by the ſame method he has taken in this affair. And when he has, for upwards of ſixteen years, been excommunicated by the <hi>Pope</hi> for ſuch pranks, we may look upon him as a Man of any other Religion, rather than the Popiſh, even when he ſtretches himſelf moſt to vindicat it from the moſt abſurd, and moſt groſs of its Errors; as you ſhall juſt now ſee by what I am to ſay.</p>
            <p>It is then a ſhort courſe I am to take with them; being to Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ad hominem.</hi> And ſo in the firſt place, I lay down this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principle of theirs; Namely, That there is no Salvation out of the viſible Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I need not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to prove that they own this. For if they deny it, Mr. <hi>Nicol</hi> may put up his Pen; and I'll ask no more for overturning St. <hi>Peters</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chair. But none can be in viſible communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but theſe who are in viſible Communion with the Pope. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to the Papiſts, the Pope is the Vicar of Chriſt, and ſo the Head of the Catholick Church, and the Center of Catholick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence the common definition that their Divines give of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, is, <hi>That ſhe is a Society of Men joyned together by the</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54328:39"/>
               <hi>Profeſſion of the ſame Faith, and by the Communion of the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, under the Government of their lawful Pastours, and eſpecially of the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontife, Chriſts only Vicar upon Earth.</hi> And it were wholly unaccountable how the <hi>Pope</hi> could be Head of the Church; and yet one might not be in viſible Communion with him, and nevertheleſs in viſible Communion with the Church; that is to ſay, in viſible Communion with the Body, and not in viſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Head of that Body, which is ſo indiſpenſably its Head, as that it could not be a Body, unleſs it had that Head. I love not alwayes to reproach the Papiſts with Tranſubſtantiation. But bating that, I know few contradictions they could be more courſly guilty of, than they would be, ſhould they attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that one might be in viſible Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet not in viſible Communion with her Head, the Pope. But further; all Papiſts muſt either underſtand by that governing Power, which, they ſay, is inherent in the Pope, as he is Pope; as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat a Juriſdiction over the whole Catholick Church, and all its Members, as any particular Biſhop has over his own Dioceſs; Or elſe they muſt acknowledge him to be no more, but only a certain Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch at beſt. And I would fain have any Papiſt ſtate me any Midle Power of Primacy and Head-ſhip, betwixt ſuch a Juriſdiction, and ſuch a Patriarchal Priority. They muſt ſpeak ſenſe cloſely to the point, and not meer words. But why am I pleading only for an equal Juriſdiction in the Pope, over the whole Church, to that which privat Biſhops have over their reſpective Flocks? For that of Primacy muſt go much higher. And if his Holineſs be a Holineſs at all, he has committed to him the Superintendency of the Faith and Manners of the whole Church, not only in as immediat a manner as any other Biſhop has of that ſpecial portion of Chriſtians which is alloted to his Care; but alſo with a more Authoritative Force, ſuitable unto ſuch a tranſcendent elevation, as is the Papacy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (not to ſpeak yet of any infallibility reſiding in him, when he Acts under the full extent of his Character) he who can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54328:40"/>
command, both thoſe whom another commands, and that other too, who commands them, can much more powerfully by himſelf immediately command them, than can he who is alſo ſubject to be commanded by him. As the Authority of a chief Stewart is much more prevalent, than is that of thoſe Inferiour ones, who, tho conſtituted alſo by the Maſter of all, are yet account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that grand Fellow-ſervant. And all this is manifeſt from the Popes aſſuming a Power to hear, and Judge all Cauſes Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally; and his reſerving many Caſes to himſelf, which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dares not meddle with. Now it is without all doubt, that any ptivate Biſhop may, in virtue of that Power he has over his Dioceſs, not only inflict Cenſures upon the Perſons of thoſe who broach, or maintain things prejudicial to the Faith; but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, or approve Propoſitions, as contrary to, or conſiſtent with it; and annex <hi>Anathema's</hi> to thoſe Definitions, ſo that thereby they become Terms of Communion with him. And this is the known Practice of the Biſhops throughout all the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And whoever conforms not to their Definitions, are actually excluded Communion with them, and are no more Members of that Body (namely their Dioceſian Church) of which they are the Head. From all which it is eaſie to infer, that the Pope may, and does, deal ſo as to the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and that thoſe who do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Definitions, are conſequently exterminated that viſible Communion with him, which is as eſſentially neceſſary to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Member of that Church, as viſible Communion with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Biſhop, is to the being a Member of his particular Church. And this was very palpable in the fate of the <hi>Janſenists,</hi> who were forc'd, either to renounce and abjure thoſe Propoſitions which the Pope had condemn'd, or elſe to ſuffer the infamy, and other Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uſes to pour out upon all thoſe ſhe calls Hereticks. Hence the Popes Faith muſt, either be the chief ſtandard of the Faith of that whole Church; or elſe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what I have now ſo irrefragably proved) one may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54328:40"/>
a Papiſt, or in viſible Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and yet not in viſible Communion with the Pope. Becauſe, if what the Pope has defin'd, may be rejected and laught at, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſible Communion with that Church; one may be out of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Communion with her Head, and notwithſtanding in viſible Communion with her ſelf. And that in plain terms is, to be a Member of that Church, and not a Member of her; ſince according to the Power, (all Papiſts contend) is in the Pope, it is abſolutely neceſſary for being a Member of her, to be in viſible Communion with him. Or, God would require a condition of being a true Member of that Church, which, that one might be ſo, he were obliged not to perform; to wit, in caſe the Pope ſhould define contrary to the true Faith; which undoubtedly he can do, if he be not infallible: Since even then, one were obliged to be a Member of the Catholick Church; But he could not be that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he were in viſible Communion with the Pope; But now he could not be in viſible Communion with the Pope, and a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholick Church too; becauſe, if he were in viſible Communion with the Pope, of neceſſity he muſt outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a Doctrine inconſiſtent with the true Faith, and ſo with being a Member of the Catholick Church; And conſequently, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory obligations were exacted of all Chriſtians, if the Pope could be fallible in his Definitions; and if a neceſſity of conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them were requiſit for being in viſible Communion with him; and viſible Communion with him, were eſſentially neceſſary for being a Member of the Catholick Church. All Papiſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt acknowledge that, either the Popes Definitions are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to be acquieſced in, or that the being in viſible Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, is no Eſſential Conſtituent of being a Member of their Church. And if they cannot deny the latter, as certainly they cannot; then it evidently follows, that his Authority is infallible, in deciding any thing he ſhall take under his cognizance; and that all his Thunders are the Thunders of Heaven indeed.</p>
            <p>It is therefore undenyable, that every Papiſt is bound by his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54328:41"/>
Principles to be of the Popes Faith; and to Pin his Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Holineſſes Sleeve. Neither can any thing be objected to the leaſt Sentence of all this; unleſs it be, That, ſince private Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are not infallible, tho they Excommunicate with an <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> ſo the Pope may be both fallible, and yet have Power to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate with ſuch a heavy Curſe too. But there is a great diſparity between the caſe of private Biſhops, and that of the Pope. For however much they may be in the wrong, there is always Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and place for an Appeal. And before one, or his Doctrine, be condemn'd by the Supreme Judge, tho that private Communion were broke, yet the Catholick would be entire. And God has not abſolutely requir'd the one, as he has done the other. So that the Argument I have here adduced, depends upon no more from the caſe of private Biſhops, than this; That, as they can condemn Propoſitions, and therefore all thoſe in their Dioceſſes, who do not embrace their Condemnation, becomes formally thereby to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded viſible Communion with them; ſo it fares betwixt the Pope, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in general. And I did not infer, that, as therefore thoſe Biſhops ought to be infallible, the Pope is ſo too. For the conſequence of that Antecedent from which this laſt Conſequent is brought, is altogether falſe. But the Popes Infallibility is deduced as a Reſult from theſe three, the firſt, that as privat Biſhops can exclude from Communion with them, thoſe of their Dioceſs who ſubmit not to their Definitions, ſo the Pope can do thoſe of the whole Church; the ſecond, that it is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally requiſite for being a Member of the Catholick Church, to be in viſible Communion with the Pope; and the third, that it is abſolutely neceſſary to the having of the true Faith to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholick Church. Now it not being ſo requiſite for being a Member of the Catholick Church, and ſo for having the true Faith, to be in viſible Communion with any privat Biſhop; the Popes Infallibility can never be denyed, becauſe no privat Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop pretends to it, whatever Power of making Definitions he is inveſted with: ſince thus one part of my Argument is only
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54328:41"/>
conſidered, without reflecting upon the reſt. And here I defie the whole Papiſts in World to give me any ſolid Anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>What elſe then remains for demonſtrating that all Papiſts, either are, or ought to be, of that Opinion, whereby it is held lawful for the Pope to Excommunicate all thoſe Princes he ſhall reckon for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and to looſe their Subjects Oaths of Allegiance to them, <hi/> But only to make it manifeſt, that the Pope, and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> has declar'd, that the contrary Tenet is Erroneous and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, and robs him of that Power, he, as Chriſts Vicar, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him? Now what Popes have done, and what Stile they have uſed in their Bulls toward Princes, ſince Pope <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands</hi> time, all the World knows: As alſo how Cardinal <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> treated our Country-man <hi>John Barclay,</hi> as a Heretick, for maintaining the Intereſt of Princes againſt the Uſurpations of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and how this poor mans Circumſtances obliged him to Retract at <hi>Rome</hi> what he had Printed at <hi>London,</hi> and that in as publick a manner, if a Preface to his <hi>Paroencſis</hi> can be accounted to be ſuch. But I ſhall only Appeal to all thoſe Witneſſes by which the Matter of Fact of this can be Atteſted. I my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have been call'd a Liar to my Face for having ſaid, laſt when I preached in this place, <hi>That the Pope is as tenacious of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as ever he was.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more, but that I might have been allowed as much common Honeſty at leaſt, as not to be thought impudently to Averr thoſe things in a Pulpit, which all that have ever been at <hi>Rome</hi> cannot but underſtand, if they can underſtand any thing there at all. And truly, the very nature of the Tenet renders it a matter of ſuch Vulgar knowledge, that it cannot be leſs notour at <hi>Rome,</hi> than the great Points of Treaſon are here; it being as hazardous there to queſtion the Popes Power over Kings, as it is here to queſtion the Kings juſt Power over his People. One therefore might with equal Confidence Averr at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has no other Government than what is Democratical; as he might pretend here, that the Sentiments of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> are, that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Sword as well as St. <hi>Peters</hi> Keys, was delivered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the Popes hand, if they were not truly ſuch. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54328:42"/>
is of ſuch a Conſequence, as theſe things are, uſe ſtill to be no leſs publick in their reſpective places, than are the Churches and Croſſes that are moſtly ſo in them; the great danger of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverting them, rendering them to be ſo. And the fear of the Inquiſition had made me learn ſo much when I was at <hi>Rome,</hi> tho nothing elſe had done it. Wherefore, tho the Credit of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers is ſometimes wont not to be too much lean'd upon; yet it muſt have ſunk to a very low Character, if what they ſay ſhall be disbeliev'd, merely becauſe they ſay it. And my Aſſertion nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needed to, nor did actually, depend upon my Teſtimony. There are Hiſtories, and Bulls enough extant to clear the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Neither is the Holy League, nor the Gunpowder Plot forgot; not to ſpeak of ſo many horrid Maſſacies as the Popes Fingers were not clean of. And we are not ignorant how the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pope has reſented the late Deciſions that were made againſt him by the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> at that Temporal Anti-Popes, its Kings Command: beſides what has been Father <hi>Maimbourgs</hi> caſe. So that it muſt be <hi>deſperata cauſa Papatus</hi> (as indeed it is however), if this Affair can make no other Shift for it ſelf, but to ſet up upon ſuch a down-right brazen Face, as the denyal of the Matter of Fact will amount to.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now only, as humbly, as earneſtly recommend to all of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that are eſpecially Perſons of any Quality, (for perhaps their Clergy will think themſelves obliged by what I have advanced, to prove the Pope Infallible, according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Popiſh Religion) ſeriouſly to conſider upon what Bottom they have ſettled themſelves. I am very much perſwaded that many of them have naturally ſo much Honour, and ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Senſe of things, that they would not like their Religion the better, that it obliges them to ſuch rebellious, ſuch deſtructive Principles, and (unleſs they be Atheiſts, which God forbid I ſhould think any of them is) to Practices too conſonant unto theſe. If they will but impartially lay to Heart what I have ſaid, I doubt not but they will find that their Pope is as abſolute and illimited a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54328:42"/>
Monarch in Religion, as ever was any Grand Signior in <hi>Turkey.</hi> And I have much better thoughts of them, than to imagine, that they look upon themſelves as mere Arbitrary Slaves to the Pope, as to their Religion. But the great miſchief of moſt mens Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, proceeds from their not pondering ſufficiently, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences the general and confus'd Principles they entertain, are originally the Source of.</p>
            <p>But, what-ever Papiſts have done, or may do; Would to God that many who have call'd themſelves Proteſtants had not writ too much, and too frequently after their Copy. And would to God that none of theſe, for the like Principles, could be charged for being the Executioners of the Martyrdom of this Day. And ſo (having fully diſcuſt all that chiefly concerns this famous Text, I thought moſt ſuitable to be pitcht upon on ſuch an occaſion) my next work is to ſpeak to the Text of the Day.</p>
            <p>But firſt, I muſt tell you, that I doubt not but my Diſcourſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto will by ſome be thought to be like a Quarter-Staff, that ſtrikes at both ends; and by others to be exact Trimming all out; to wit, as they ſtand, who look upon it. But that has ever been, and ever will be, the Fate of all thoſe Truths that happen to be owned, firſt after they were prevail'd over by thoſe Errours that were of the utmoſt contrary Extreams. And I thank God I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured as much, as I could, to exerciſe my ſelf, as to all I have ſaid, in a Conſcience void of offence, both toward God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all men. Neither have I ſuffered my ſelf to fall under any byaſs or prejudice from the Writings of other men; having only made uſe of the Great Doctor <hi>Sherlocks</hi> Book of the <hi>Caſe of Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to the Compiling this Diſcourſe; and never having in all my life read any of thoſe Authors that are commonly ſaid to be of the Republican Stamp. So that the only Guide I have followed is the Holy Scriptures, together with thoſe Suggeſtions of my own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that needed little or no pains to force them out. All the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then that I crave is, that none would make any Application
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54328:43"/>
of the leaſt Syllable I have ſpoke, but in ſo far as I have done ſo my ſelf. For I have uttered abſolute Verities <hi>abſolutely;</hi> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to touch any of thoſe Perſons that may be concerned in them, but in as much as the Tenor of my Diſcourſe did oblige me to it. And if <hi>Intention</hi> comes to be quarrelled, I cannot ſee how others can better judge of mine, than my ſelf. And having thus a little obviated thoſe Calumnies that none can promiſe he ſhall be ſecure from, I proceed in my Deſign.</p>
            <p>But now a Subject offers it ſelf to me, that requires ſuch equal and ſuitable advantages, as I dare not preſume to think I am ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for handling it with. Now I ſhould lay forth the Perfections of a Man; that Heaven had reſolved ſhould be more than a King, a Martyr, both for his Religion, and his Countrey too. Now it lyes upon me to expoſe the greateſt Villany, and Wickedneſs, as well in its Formalities, as in its Subſtance, that ever the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: For its Creators Sufferings made it ſhrink in its Head; and here it had alſo done it, but that there was ſuch a diſtinction to be made by it, when, not the God of Nature, but the beſt King in the World, was Butchered by the bloody hands of impious Men, or rather incarnate Furies. And therefore now I muſt draw a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over that, which I have not skill enough to adorn, with the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, with the moſt deſerved, Colours. And it is only EIKON BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZILIKH that is moſt proper to make us underſtand both what that King was, and how barbarouſly he was treated by his ungrateful Subjects.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall only in a few words, put you in mind, that in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's caſe, the Conſtitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was infinitly broke on the Subjects ſide; And that it was they which, in the moſt unjuſt manner that was poſſible, did Invade the Rights and Royalties of that King, and not He that did ſo with theirs. For ſo many of both Nations have already been ſo much before hand with me, as to this point, that for me to go particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to task with it, were to ſuppoſe we had all been ſleeping theſe 50 years bygone. And beſides, the unanimous Laws both of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54328:43"/>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> have not left us the power of doubting what the nature of that Rebellion was. Neither can I perſwad my ſelf that there is any hearing me, who will not readily aſſent to the juſtneſs of them. I take this then for a thing ſo univerſally granted by all the World, that it were as much to bewray my ſelf, as to encroach upon others, ſhould I any further attempt to prove it.</p>
            <p>Perchance it will here be ſaid, That it was the Body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that roſe againſt that King: And that, ſince the Body of the Nation was the only competent Judge whether or not he had mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt, and violated his original Contract with his People; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they having Judg'd him to ſuffer juſtly, He muſt needs have done ſo. But we all know againſt whom it was alledg'd, <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die,</hi> (<hi>Joh. Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7). And this was the only one inſtance wherein theſe words could have been more unjuſtly applyed, than they were againſt our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Martyr. Neither will any ever pretend that the Body of any Nation is infallibly juſt, when they oppoſe themſelves to their Prince. Otherwiſe all Rebellion were but a meer <hi>Chymera,</hi> a thing abſolutely impoſſible and contradictious. Since no kind of men will ever be ſo infinitly groſs, as to act at that rate againſt their Prince, without ſome Varniſhing Colours to what they do. At leaſt nothing were Rebellion, unleſs there were no more but ſuch or ſuch a proportion of the Subjects concerned in it. And then adieu to all the Rights of Princes. But, if you'll reflect upon what I ſaid before, you cannot but neceſſarily ſee, That God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permits a People to ſcourge themſelves for their ſins, by ſcourging their Prince; And that even then the injury they do him, is palpable and manifeſt. And indeed in the preſent caſe, not only was the King acquitted from thoſe aſperſions that had been caſt upon him, and the Rebellion againſt him condemn'd as ſuch, by the unanimous Vote of the moſt ſolemn Repreſentatives of both Nations, after they had been, firſt wearied with the miſery, and then remorſ'd for the guilt, of their Error: But alſo we may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54328:44"/>
remember by what ſteps and degrees that Rebellion came to its height and full pitch; and that the Redreſs of a few imaginary Grievances began that work, which the too great confidence the King plac'd in his Subjects on the one hand, and their no leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous inſolencies (which proportionably ſwell'd as the Kings good nature was expreſs'd) on the other, brought to ſuch an end as happened to it. I muſt needs confeſs that his circumſtances had look'd ſomewhat ill favoured, had theſe Nations on the ſudden broke out univerſally againſt him, For then there had been ſo much of a Moral Evidence in the matter, as preſumably could not have fall'n out, without ſome correſpondent ground in the Object it ſelf. But that nothing ſuch was then, I referr to the Matter of Fact, as it is to be canvaſs'd by their own Memories who were then, and are yet, living; and by the Hiſtories of that time, by thoſe who have only grown up to be men ſince. Yet after all, I am not to deny, but that King was ſo much a Man, and not an Angel, as to have had his own infirmities, and been of like Paſſions with us. But ſtill I'll avow that he had only ſo much of our frail temper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, as was neceſſary for leaving ſomething for Heaven to do on his account; and that we muſt go there, before we can find a greater Saint.</p>
            <p>But when the King of Heaven has, by his Providence, ſo viſibly interpoſed himſelf to juſtifie that as holy a King as ever ſwayed Scepter upon Earth, againſt the malicious ſlanders of his enraged and treacherous Subjects, that we muſt either make no Arguments from Providence at all, or elſe be convinced by thoſe which here are manifeſt and irrefragable; When, I ſay, God has taken the vindication of that quarrel upon himſelf, we muſt have, as little Religion, as Senſe or Reaſon, if we ſhall any more be to ſeek in this matter. Now it is the obſervation of the Great Doctor <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon,</hi> upon that Text, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation:</hi> That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſins are only puniſht in this World; Becauſe they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſo, or not at all; Since in the World after this, there will be no Nations, or Bodies and Corporations of Men. It is alſo the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54328:44"/>
Obſervation of all Divines, That God does frequently accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and proportion his temporal Judgments to thoſe Sins that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to pour them out; ſo that <hi>face uſes not more to anſwer face in the water,</hi> than the one does the other. And thus <hi>Adonize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſek</hi> had his great Thumbs and Toes cut off, becauſe he had dealt ſo with Seventy two Kings. If therefore we have felt great and remarkable Judgments; and if theſe have traced the very footſteps of thoſe iniquities we were guilty of toward that Royal Martyr: Muſt we not conclude that he, who doth all things in <hi>number, weight, and meaſure,</hi> has been diſpleaſed with us, becauſe of thoſe very ſins which then we committed; and that our National Puniſhment reads to us a Lecture of our National Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>And that thus it has been with us, not only much in <hi>Cromwells</hi> time, (tho I fear too many look upon that Uſurpers Loins, as lighter than the litle finger of the gentleſt Monarch,) but even in theſe laſt days, is but ſadly palpable to all conſidering Men. And I ſhall only inſtance it in the firſt conſiderable aſſault we made upon the Majeſty of Our Royal Martyr; which was, becauſe of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſet up that Worſhip in his Chappel-Royal here, which from his Infancy he had been inured unto. And for this, that Church whereof he was ſo zealous a Member, was branded as a Limb of Antichriſt; and he himſelf was clamour'd againſt, as, either down right Popiſh, or elſe very much inclined to be ſo; and to have lanched forth into a deſign of introducing that Religion into this, and all his other Kingdoms. But have we not had the moſt Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and Magnificent Preparations made for the Maſs it ſelf, in that very place where we would not ſuffer the Ordinances of the Proteſtant Religion to be celebrated with a decent Solemnity, as little Popiſh, as the Fury that roſe againſt it was the contrary. Nay; has not the Maſs it ſelf been as publick, in ſpight of our Noſes, as Sermons even from this Pulpit have been. Whereas, never Man did more firmly, or with greater Conſtancy and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reſolution, adhere to the true Proteſtant Religion, than Our Glorious Martyr did to his laſt breath: And whereas too,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54328:45"/>
that Church, to which he wiſh'd ours to be conformed, has alwayes prov'd to be the <hi>Bulwark and juſt pride and glory of the whole Proteſtant Side.</hi> Neither has ever any Proteſtant Church in the World been ſo much the Envy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that of <hi>England</hi> has been, and will ever be, if our repeated, reſolute Provocations, do not at laſt overcome that Mercy, which hitherto has preſerv'd her in ſo much Purity and Splendor. And even the moſt bigotted Enemies ſhe was wont to have, do now by the publick acknowledgements, all Proteſtants owe to her Biſhops, (that have born an eminent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Proteſtant Cauſe, and have been vouchaf'd upon theſe dreggs of time, to preſerve us from utter darkneſs, both here and hereafter) confirm that there was never a Church leſs infected with Popery, nor more genuinly Chriſtian. And who were the Men that theſe four years by gone have ſo demonſtratively baffled all the Champions and Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome;</hi> that, as never was there any Truth more triumphant, than in that time the Proteſtant has been over the Popiſh Religion, ſo never was there greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage obtain'd over all the ſubtilties of thoſe cunningeſt Sophiſters, than themſelves were forc'd, only not to confeſs? Surely none other can lay the remoteſt claim to this, but the Divines of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And all this, we all know; we have all magnified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd, with raptures, not altogether unproportionable to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites that extorted them from us. God grant that we may never afterwards prove ſo unjuſt and ungratefull, as to undervalue or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe that Church we have ſo lov'd, ſo much admir'd, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we have received from her, when we ſhall come to think that we ſtand not ſo much in need of her aſſiſtance. However, let the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Day make us, <hi>Remember Lots wife.</hi> In the mean time, has not God, no leſs Particularly, than Sufficiently, revenged thoſe injuries that Church has ſuffered from us, and thoſe our Royal Martyr did for her ſake?</p>
            <p>It is but too eaſie to draw a further Parallel. And therefore let me ask you, if you think God is an idle Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of all Humane Affairs? Or that when ſuch ſins went before,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54328:45"/>
and ſuch Judgements followed after; there was no more but meer Chance in all this? Or ſhall we fondly imagine, that the Fates and Revolutions of Nations are matters ſo very triffling, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not himſelf in them, without whoſe ſpecial Providence a Sparrow is not ſold at ſuch or ſuch a price in the Mercat? We muſt then conclude that the Nation was horridly guilty in what they did toward this Royal Martyr, were there no other thing to make us do ſo, but ſuch a compariſon of what he ſuffered from us, and what we have ſuffered by the permiſſion of God ſince.</p>
            <p>Theſe things indeed are become now to be in the mouths of all Men. But, alas! they are as little conſidered as they ought to be, as they are much talkt of. And we rather ſeem to be itched with them, becauſe of their oddneſs; than to make that Spiritual Improvement of them, which, as we are Chriſtians, we ſhould, and which God expects we will, and for which we muſt one day be anſwerable before his Tribunal. What! Is our <hi>converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo little in heaven,</hi> that the greateſt of its Providences work no Heavenly Impreſſion upon us? Or are we ſo engroſt with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of this World, that we cannot ſpare one ſober thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon thoſe of that to come? Good God! Is it poſſible that rational men, who believe they have immortal Souls within them, can ſo ſquander away ſuch excellent Beings in the drudgery of low and vulgar conſiderations, as not to make the leaſt ſuitable regard of thy moſt ſignal and extraordinary Dealings toward them? But I leave this to the Conſciences of all Men, as they ſhall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able to be accountable to that Vicegerent God has planted in their Boſoms.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the Rebellion againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt has been condemn'd by the greateſt Authority, both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in Earth; let us now lay the Line to the Plummet, and meaſure how hainous the Sin of it was in it ſelf. And this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better do, than by making a ſerious review of the foregoing Parts of this Diſcourſe. And firſt; If Subjection to the Higher Powers be ſo directly commanded in the Scriptures: then muſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54328:46"/>
not Rebellion be the moſt contradictory thing to them imaginable? Secondly, Did our Saviour lay the ſureſt Foundations for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Principle of Conſcience; muſt not therefore the tearing up a Government by the roots in deſpight of him, in the very face of Conſcience, be an iniquity not to be thought of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horrour and deteſtation? Thirdly, Has our Saviour been ſo very careful of the Rights of Subjects, as to leave them entire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt encroachment made upon them; Are not then the violences of Subjects againſt their Soveraign, aggravated by all the black circumſtances that can render Rebellion abominable? Surely, 'tis a thouſand times more intollerable for Subjects, whoſe Rights are not invaded, and who conſequently enjoy all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Humane Life that the ſtate of this World can allow; I ſay, it is infinitely more inexcuſable for Subjects to run head-long upon ſuch a Wickedneſs, than it can be for Slaves to do it; theſe having all the Temptation poſſible that Reaſonable Creatures can have, for prompting them to riſe up againſt that Power, by which they are depreſſed. And Laſtly, Has our Saviour ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Obligation of Conſcience to that of the Law of Nature, in repreſſing Subjects from diſturbing the Government under which they live, upon the account of that innate Freedom, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretences would ſtrive to Aſſert; Is not therefore a Rebellion founded on imaginary Complaints about the Subjects Right by the Law of Nature, equally againſt all the Natural, and Reveal'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World? And has our Religion bound us up <hi>not to think it ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened; but to rejoyce in as much as we are partakers of Christs ſufferings</hi> (1 Pet. <hi>chap. 4. verſ.</hi> 12, 13.); And is not a ſuperſtitious rebelling for this or that Pin of the Tabernacle, the moſt repugnant Sin to the nature and genius of Chriſtianity, that can be next to the ſhaking it ſelf off for good and all; nay, in a manner worſe, by how much to act with the greateſt contradiction poſſible to a fixed Principle, is more impious, than firſt to believe nothing, and then to do every thing? And does the Doctrine of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54328:46"/>
Overturning States and Empires, of Depoſing Soveraign Princes, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> merely for the ſake of Religion, owe its original to the Popes and Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And can there be any more inſufferable Scandal upon Proteſtants and the Proteſtant Religion, than to out-do Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in its livelyeſt Colours, and when it acts moſt like it ſelf, and to play the Boute-feu and Incendiary more violently, than ever the Conſiſtory inſpir'd its Votaries to be? I know I need not tell you that the Rebellion againſt our Holy Martyr, had all theſe malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Ingredients in it, to enhanſe it unto as terrible a Crime as ever a Nation was guilty of.</p>
            <p>But if our Sin has been great, let our Repentance be no leſs. We may flatter our ſelves with the vain imagination that now we are not concerned in what was done almoſt in our fore-fathers days, and by a few leading Men, that then had a privat Intereſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. But you have heard how God has made it a National Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with us, and has to this very day been reſenting it as ſuch. It is remarkable that the Angel commanded St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 3. v. 19. to tell the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that <hi>as many as God loves he rebukes and chaſtens, and therefore all ſhould be zealous and repent.</hi> We have been ſadly rebuked; God has given us great and manifeſt Warnings; and has not only tryed what our Ingenuity, but what our Fears can work upon us. And that, not only becauſe we have not throughly enough laid to Heart how unworthy we ſhewed our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves to be of ſo good a King, and ſo great a Chriſtian; but alſo becauſe our temper, as to our Religion, has been but <hi>Laodicean,</hi> but <hi>luke-warm, neither hot nor cold.</hi> And indeed we have ſerved our Deſigns much more with our Religion, than our Religion with our Deſigns; and it muſt be confeſs'd, that either Pique, or a certain miſtaken Point of Honour, or this or that Intereſt, has been the great Springs upon which the Religion of the Nation (as to the univerſality) has chiefly mov'd, ever ſince the late Troubles began. I ſay God has ſufficiently rebuked us for this. But if now we ſhall not be <hi>truly zealous and repent,</hi> we may expect the <hi>Chaſtening</hi> is yet to come; and that God will not be mocked any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54328:47"/>
longer with us, but will either give us up to that <hi>reprobate mind</hi> we ſeem ſo much to court, or elſe to pour out Plague upon Plague upon us till we ſhall be utterly deſtroyed, and become <hi>a hiſſing to the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to conclude, Let us learn from this Day to beware of rebelling againſt thoſe lawful Princes whom God places over us. We have a ſad Example before our Eyes, and ſad Judgments too. And if we love our Peace and Felicity, our Religion and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo our God and our Saviour, let us never bring a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Reproach upon our Holy Profeſſion, by doing thoſe things whereof the Heathens are aſhamed, and which are the fouleſt ſulliage and pollution upon Chriſtianity that it can be prophaned with; I mean, let us always <hi>be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now unto the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; unto him by whom Kings Reign, and Princes decree Judgment; be all Praiſe, Honour, and Glory, from this time forth, and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
