            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Summary Reasons, humbly tendered to the most Honourable House of Peers by some Citizens and Members of <hi>London,</hi> and other <hi>Cities, Boroughs, Corporations,</hi> and <hi>Ports,</hi> against the new intended <hi>Bill</hi> for <hi>Governing and Reforming CORPORATIONS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FIrst, this Bill deprives all <hi>Cities, Boroughs, Corporations, Ports</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> (8. times particularly named and comprised in the <hi>Act of Oblivion and Indempnity</hi>) with all their Magistrates, Officers and Members, of the common benefit, pardon, grace therein intended, and equally granted to them, as well as to other Subjects, without discrimination, by the Kings Most Gracious Majesty, who in his successive printed Messages, Declarations, Speeches to the last and present Parliament, hath solemnly promised in his own Royal Person and Ministers, and conjured all his Subjects, and this present Parliament in their proceedings, most religiously and inviolably to observe the same, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part and branch thereof, without the least infringement: By reviving not onely the former marks and names of distinction between his Subjects, but also the memory, infamy, reproach and punishment of all their formerly remitted and forgotten Crimes, even unto the un-magistrating, dis-officing, dis-franchising and dis-membring of them in the respective Cities, Boroughs, Ports, and Corporations where they live, to their own and their Posterities obloquy and disgrace, even since his Majesties and this Parliaments fresh confirmation of that Act, and his <hi>Royal advice and command to Both Houses of Parliament</hi> on Monday last, <hi>only to look forwards, but not back to any thing that was past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. It is directly contrary to the <hi>Great Charter</hi> of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> made in the 9th year of King <hi>Henry the third,</hi> c. 9 (since ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ified by <note n="a" place="margin">Sir Edward Cooks Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his 2. Institutes.</note>

               <hi>That the City of</hi> London, <hi>and all other Cities, Boroughs, Townes, the Barons of the Cinque-ports, and all other Ports, shall have all their old Liberties and free Customes,</hi> whereof this is one principal branch, <hi>freely to elect, place and displace their own Magistrates, Officers, Members, and not to be visited, placed or displaced by any Foreiners, Visiters, Commissioners,</hi> as is evident by their respective <hi>Charters,</hi> the <hi>Statute</hi> of 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5 the Customs of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Ashe</hi> his Repertory, Tit. <hi>London,</hi>Sect. 6.38, 39, 40, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. It invalidates, rescinds, annulls all the particular Charters of former Kings, and all private Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> confirming them, formerly granted to <hi>London</hi> and other <hi>Cities, Boroughs, Corporations, Ports</hi>; which all our Kings by their <note n="c" place="margin">Tottles Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramentum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis quando Coronatur. cl. 1 R. 2. m. 44. 1 H. 4. Rot. Parl. numero 70. The Form of the Kings Coronation.</note> Coronation Oaths, (and his Majesty at his late Coronation) have <hi>sworn to grant, ratifie, and maintain to their Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4ly. It gives the numerous Commissioners named in the Bill, or any five of them (who are all Commoners) an absolute arbitrary power over the greatest Peers of the Realm (as the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> Earles of <hi>Pembroke, Salisbury,</hi> and other Lords who are <hi>Officers, Stewards, Wardens</hi> of several Cities, Boroughs, Ports, Corporations of this Realm) to remove and displace them at their pleasure and discretion, without any <hi>legal tryal,</hi> contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> their <hi>Peerage</hi> and <hi>privilege of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>; And it likewise impowers them, or any five of them, though no Members, to remove and displace all the Members of the Commons House, who are Magistrates, Officers or Members of any City, Borough, or Port, (as divers of them are) notwithstanding their Privilege of Parliament, and so by consequence to make them no Members of this Parliament, there being no exception nor provision for the Peers or Members in this Act, to exempt them from this new Visitation.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly. It enables these Commissioners, or any five of them, joyntly and severally by their Warrants, to summon all <hi>Magistrates, Officers and Members of every City, Corporation, Borough and Port of England and Wales,</hi> from out os their respective Precincts, to what place soever they shall sit, within the County where they are situated, though 20, 30, 40, or 50. miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, if they please to call them thither, the Act confining them to no certain place or distance: which how vexatious, chargeable, injurious it may prove to the Persons sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, and how destructive to many Cities, Boroughs, Ports and Corporations Charters, prohibiting any to draw them out of their own Cities and Corporations for any matter or offence relating thereunto,<note n="d" place="margin">Ch. 29. Cooks 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes.</note> We humbly refer to your Lordships serious consideration.</p>
            <p n="6">6ly. It authorizeth the Commissioners appointed for the Cities and Corporations of <hi>York, Glocester, Exeter, Bristol, Newcastle, Canterbury, Lincoln, Pool,</hi> &amp;c. (which are Counties within themselves) to summon all their Magistrates, Officers and Members to appear before them out of the limits of their particular Counties, at any place of the Shire wherein they are situated, contrary to their antient <hi>Charers</hi> and privileges, the Law of the Land, and Reason of the Statutes enacting, <note n="e" place="margin">1 E. 3. Stat. 2. c. 5. H. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That no man shall be compelled to go out of his own County, for the publique defence and safety of the Realm, unlesse in case of Necessity, by reason of forein Enemies coming into the Realm,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">29 H. 8. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>nor cited out of his own Diocess, to answer any particular offence,</hi> much lesse then to go out of his own County and Precincts thereof, upon such a strange, unnecessarie Visitation and Occasion as this, which hath neither president nor parallel in any Record or Historie that can be produced.</p>
            <p n="7">7ly. It utterly subverts, annulls and extirpates the grand fundamental Law of <hi>England,</hi> the Great Charter, and all Acts of Parliaments, antiently &amp; lately made for the securitie of the Subjects <hi>Freeholds, Liberties, Franchises, and free Customes</hi> against Arbitrarie and Tyrannical invasions; particularly the Statutes of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> cap. 29.25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. cap. 1, 2.28 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. cap. 1. and near 40. other Acts of Parliament for confirmation of the Great Charter in general, 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. c. 9.15 <hi>Ed.</hi> Parl 2. c. 5.23 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. c. 4.28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. c. 3.38 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. c. 9.42 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. c. 2, 3.2 <hi>H.</hi> 4.

All which declare and enact, <note n="g" place="margin">Cooks 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit, on Magna Charta, c. 29. Cooks 11. Rep. f. 99.</note> 
               <hi>That no Freeman shall be disseised or put out of his Freehold, Franchises, Liberties, free Customes, Lands or Tenements, nor put to answer for the same, unless he be brought in to answer by due processe of Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old Law of the Land, or fore-judged of the same by matter of Record in due Course of Law, by the lawfull Tryal and Iudgement of his Peers, and Law of the Land; and if any thing be done to the contrary it shall be void and nought in Law, and holden fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> errour.</hi> Now this Act authorizeth the Commissioners, or any five of them, to displace, disseise, out all and every Magistrate, Officer, Freeman, Citizen, Burgess, Member of any City, Borough, Port or Corporation aforesaid, both of his Office, Franchise and Liberty, (wherein he hath as absolute and good a <hi>Freehold in Law</hi> as any Lord, Knight, Member of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or other Freeman of <hi>England</hi> hath in his Lands, Tenements, Offices or Honours) without any legal Processe, original Writ, Endictment, Declaration, Tryal, Jurie, Oath of Witnesses, Legal Process or Judgement, at their mere Arbitrary discretion; An Injustice, Arbitrary proceeding and tyranny, oft provided against and condemned by all former English Parliaments; therefore not to be approved or countenanced in the least degree by this Parliament and your Lordships, who so much condemne the late arbitrary powers, proceedings of <hi>Sequestrators, Decimators,</hi> and Committee-men during our Warrs, and sad confusions; which these Proceedings not onely imitate but exceed in some degree, being without <hi>oath,</hi> or <hi>legal accusation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8ly. The Commissioners appointed by this Act, as th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y have a more absolute, arbitrary, boundlesse power, to displace all Magistrates, Officers, Members of Cities, Boroughs, Ports and Corporations, without any distinction of persons, or rules of Law, then was ever granted to any sort of Judges, Justices or Commissioners in former ages; so they have no Oath at all prescribed to them before they Act, to prevent the Abuses and Extravagancies which may happen in the Execution thereof, as all other <note n="h" place="margin">Rastal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices in Eyre, cap. 4.18, &amp; 20 Ed. 3.

            <p n="9">9ly. There is no appeal provided in this Act from any five of the Commissioners sentence, and removal of any Magistrate, Officer or Member aforesaid, (though never so injurious) either to the Major part of the Commissioners of each County, or to the Justices of the peace in their Quarter-Sessions, Judges of Assize, Kings Bench, or other his Majesties Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> or to the Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> or Lords in Parliament, as is <note n="i" place="margin">23 H. 8 c. 5.2, &amp; 3 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 1.43 Eliz. c. 12.</note>

               <note n="k" place="margin">43 Eliz. c. 4.24 H. 8. c. 12. Brook Error. Baggs Case. Cook 11 Report. f. 94, 98, 99.</note> and erronious Judgements in the Kings own Courts there, are remediable in the Exchequer Chamber, and Lords House, by Writ of Error or Appeal; All erronious Acts, and unjust Judgements in one Parliament, are reversable in another, because all Commissioners, Courts, Judges, &amp; Parliaments too may erre, and it is most just and reasonable that parties injured by one Judicature, should be righted and relieved by another, not left remedilesse: Much more therefore in this Case, where the proceedings are meerly arbitrary, without any Rules of Law, to which other Judicatures are confined.</p>
            <p n="10">10ly. It gives the Commissioners power to destroy all the Cities, Burroughs, Corporations, Ports of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and their respective Charters, under pretext of confirming them, For the Commissioners or any five of them may put out and displace all, or so many of their Magistrates, Aldermen, Common-counsell men, and Members at their discretion, if they please, as there will not be left a Competent number to elect others in their places, according to their Charters, whereby the <note n="*" place="margin">20 H. 6, 7, 8.3 H. 6.23.
