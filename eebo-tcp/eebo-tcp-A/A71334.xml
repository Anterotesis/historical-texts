            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THere was lately an Adverriſement in ſome Books, publiſhed by the Office of Intelligence, of a miſreport ſcandalous and falſe (as he calls it) concerning the death of Major <hi>Aberin,</hi> who as he ſaith, died a natural death, and lived a pious life, which was well known to all that lived about him, and confirmed by many perſons of Quality that were preſent with him when he died. My Correſpondent in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> writing none of the beſt hand, and it being a Scotch name (a thing I am not very well acquainted with) in haſte I miſtook <hi>Aberin</hi> for <hi>Abernethy</hi>; I have inquired of ſeveral <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen in Town, whether there were any Major <hi>Aberin</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom my miſtake might have injured, but I cannot hear of any of that name, and ſhall willingly

confeſs it an Error, if the Newsmonger can in his next acquaint me of any one that know ſuch a man in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though he pretends he was well known by all about him, to be a man of a pious Life, and that it was confirmed by many perſons of quality who were preſent, that he died a natural death.</p>
               <p>When a Friend ſhewed me in his Book this Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I read ſome few lines further of the Votes of the Houſe of Saturday laſt, in his Book called the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer, wherein he tells you firſt, that Col. <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> late Lieutenant General, had rendered himſelf to the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereas it was Col. <hi>George Fleetwood,</hi> one of the Kings Triers, never known by that Title of Lieutenant General. In the ſecond Vote he makes that the Houſe ordered the Books of Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Milton</hi> to be burnt whenas they only reſolved that his Majeſty ſhould be deſired to order it. In the third Vote, That all the woods of the Kings and Queens Lands that were not really ſold, ſhould be ſeiſed upon; whereas all Wood and Timber felled off the ſaid Lands, are to remain and continue upon the ſaid Lands, without farther diſpoſal, till the Parliament ſhall give a farther order therein. In his fourth Vote he puts Cheney for Chancery. I have no time to amend all his faults, it would ſwell my Book too much, but by this you may judge the reſt. I ſhall only give a further account of ſome faults which I am deſired by ſome Members of the Houſe to take notice of. That at a Committee of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections on Saturday <hi>June</hi> 16. he ſeems to inſinuate ſome unhandſome carriage of Mr. <hi>Richard Ballice,</hi> and that they reſolved the Petition concerning the choice at <hi>Eveſham</hi> to be vexatious, whenas his demeanors there was obſerved to be no other then civil, and no ſuch reſolve made concerning the Petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am likewiſe to take notice of an antient Liſt of the Privy Council, taken out of an old Book of ours, which he in his laſt Publick Intelligencer, put out as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The new Queen was conducted to the rich Coach the King gave her by the Duke of Bournonville her Knight of Honor and the Count de Hautefort her firſt Gentleman Uſher. Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties were at one end of the Coach, the Queen-Mother at the other, and the Kings Brother at the boot: the new Queen cryed all the while, and being asked by the Queen Mother, whether ſhe would return into Spain, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe owed that to her Fathers tenderneſs, and that ſhe was not ſorry to leave Spain upon ſo good a Subject as the making of Peace. They arived late here, and the King taking the new Queen by the hand conducted her to the Queen-Mothers Lodgings, being attended by 25 Spaniſh Ladies, that came along with her. The King, the two Queens, the Kings brother and the 3 Princeſſes ſupped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The King kept company with the new Queen until ſhe was a bed, and came to ſee her in the morning at her Riſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaw her dreſſing herſelf ſtill in the Spaniſh Faſhion, with a Waiſcoat of White Sattin, a very ſhort Petycoat, a black Lace tyed about her neck, no haires upon her Forehead, and thoſe behind tyed. In the afternoon ſhe paſſed her time in looking upon the Cloths and Jewels the King gave her, which ſhe liked very well.

               <p>Beſides the particulars of late here, which have bin ſo various and many, that it hath bin impoſſible either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, or to ſend them all at once, take theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: At the firſt interview of the two Kings, which was the 6 inſtant, the French Horſe and Foot were diſpoſed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Rivers ſide, the French and Switzer Guards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the head of them, at the foot of the Mountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all of them in blew Caſſocks, with Gold and Silver Gallume and a white Croſs before and behind; next to them were the Kings Genſdarms, the Lifeguard, the Kings Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers on horſeback, and the light horſemen. The Pages both of the great and leſſer Stables, were likewiſe along the Rivers ſide with a Led-horſe every one of them in their hands, all in rich imbroidered footcloath. The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Guards on foot ſtood all along the other ſide of the River (over againſt the French Guards) in their yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Caſſocks, with the Kings Arms imbroidered in Silk. The King being come to the Bridge of the Iſle, made a halt, tarrying until the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was landed. Then the two Kings advanced on towards the other with the like gravity, until they came to the Line that divides their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and there both falling upon their knees, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced each other with a reciprocal joy. After their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, the King ſaluted the new Queen his Spouſe, whilſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſaluted the Queen Mother his Siſter, who having told her Brother, that the King her Son, and her ſelf, were much ingaged to him, for travelling ſo far in the heat of weather to meet them; he anſwered, that had he not bin able to come in a Coach or on Horſeback, he would have come a foot to ſatisfie his deſire of ſeeing the King, and once more before his death to embrace her. Then were Madamoiſele, the two Princeſſes her Siſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> preſented to him by the ſaid Queen Mother; and afterwards the Count of <hi>Charr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Guards, brought in all the Grandees of the French Court, according to the Liſt drawn by his Majeſty, with the Cardinal and Monſieur <hi>de Villeroy</hi> to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute his Spaniſh Majeſty. When Marſhal <hi>de Turenne</hi> was preſented to him, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſaid to his ſiſter, I know him well, he hath cauſed me often to have little reſt in the night. At the ſame time the Spaniſh Grandees were preſented to the King by Don <hi>Lewis d'Aro.</hi> After theſe mutual Complements, a Table was brought in, and both Kings kneeling down before it, ſwore the obſervation of the Peace, each of them in his own language, with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies mentioned in my laſt: Beſides, the eternal and inviolable Peace, they ſwore each to other a very ſtrict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Then all their Guards and Forces gave out many ſhoots and volleys, the Trumpets blowing mainly in the interim. At their going out of the Hall, the two Kings to avoid turning their backs one to another, went backward, ſtill making courteſies one to another until they were out of the Room. The like was obſerved in the conference of the next day, at which time the two Courts took leave one of the other. The French Court being upon their vvay hither, not far from the Iſle, vvhilſt the New Queens Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage vvent by, being carryed by 24 Mules, vvith fine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings with the Kings Arms, all of Crimſon Velvet, and her four Coaches vvherein vvere her Ladies and Maids of Honour; the Queen Mother gave her a Collation. Being arrived here, the King and the ſaid Queen Mother, did what they could to make the new Queen forget her ovvn Country, and the abſence of her Father, to vvhom ſhe vvrote, as I have told you before, and her Letter was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the Marquis of <hi>Villequier.</hi> The 9th, the laſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of the Marriage vvas performed.

The King received the Ring from the Biſhop, and put it upon the Queens Finger, to whom he gave the pieces of Gold conſecrated with the Ring by the Biſhop: As they went to the Offering, Monſieur preſented the Taper to the King, and Madamoiſelle to the Queen: The Abbot of <hi>Coaſtin,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> carryed the Canopy over their heads. The officiating Biſhop, after the Maſs, made them a ſhort exhortation about the Marriage; the Medals thrown out of the windows, after the Dinner, mentioned in my laſt, had the Pictures of the King and Queen looking one upon the other, of one ſide with their Names, and on the other ſide, Clouds dropping abundance of Rain, with that Motto, <hi>Non laet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
