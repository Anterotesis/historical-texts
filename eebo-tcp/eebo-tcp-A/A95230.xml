            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true Relation brought over by a Noble Gentleman Sir <hi>Hards Waller</hi> by name, of a Å¿harpe SkirmiÅ¿h which there happened on the 29. day of <hi>June</hi> 1642.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T happened that the Enemy lying within Å¿even or eight miles of our EngliÅ¿h quarter at <hi>Downarayle</hi> aforeÅ¿aid; and conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of about twenty five hundred foot, and a Troope of HorÅ¿e, had a DeÅ¿igne (as wee knew by good intelligence) to confront our Forces there, if not to fall foule with us. The Å¿aid Lord <hi>Inchguin</hi> with the adviÅ¿e of the other Commanders, reÅ¿olved by way of prevention, to march away towards them all night from <hi>Downarayle,</hi> which enterpriÅ¿e they Å¿o dexterouÅ¿ly purÅ¿ued, that with five hundred MuÅ¿quetiers, and two hundred HorÅ¿e; they were ready to give them a BreakfaÅ¿t the next morning very early: and albeit thoÅ¿e Rebels had gotten Å¿ome private advertiÅ¿ement of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and had therefore Å¿tood all that night to their Armes. Yet did our Å¿aid Commanders find the meanes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them; and to trye their mettle, began to Å¿alute them with a Volley of Å¿hot, which Å¿econded by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->Troopes did Å¿o daunt them at the very firÅ¿t encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they preÅ¿ently were Rowted, and betooke them with all poÅ¿Å¿ible diligence to their heeles, towards a Wood and Bogge, about halfe a mile off from that place. And our valiant Troopes then purÅ¿uing them, did through Gods eÅ¿peciall favour leÅ¿Å¿en their number by about Å¿ixe hundred men, and tooke Å¿ome of their Commanders PriÅ¿oners, with five of their Colours; they have hereby alÅ¿o aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their Å¿tore of Armes with many MuÅ¿quets, and many more Pykes in this Conflict which I may Å¿ay, was a very Å¿harpe one on their Å¿ide, but miraculouÅ¿ly favourable on ours. As having loÅ¿t but one man, nor any hurt but one Sergeant, (thankes to the Lord of HoaÅ¿ts.) This and the like Å¿trange Victories wee now and then obtain againÅ¿t the Rebels, doe give us no Å¿mall heart and courage amidÅ¿t the great wants we often undergoe in this now almoÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olate Countrey; And makes our men goe on with Å¿uch incredible reÅ¿olution, as we reade of the old Romans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the Barbarous Nations, without being any more daunted with the preÅ¿ent diÅ¿tractions betwixt the King and Parliament, then were thoÅ¿e Romans abroad, when their Emperours and ConÅ¿uls brought the Scene of warre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath pleaÅ¿ed God nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e to temper our late Triumph with Å¿ome Å¿orrow.

               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->and Waggons, &amp; having pillaged their Town, we burnt it to the ground, and brought away Å¿ix EnÅ¿ignes, eight Drums, and took Arms for five hundred men, had we been furniÅ¿hed with Å¿ufficient forces, wee might have Å¿aved the Town and left a GarriÅ¿on in it, which (through Gods aÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance might have much advanced the Å¿ervice.</p>
            <p>The 30 of <hi>June,</hi> my Lord <hi>Keloumikie,</hi> (Å¿on to the Earle of <hi>Gork</hi>) his HorÅ¿e being in number but 38, marcht out of <hi>Bandonbridge,</hi> and in the compaÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿ix miles brought in a thouÅ¿and Å¿heep and foure hundred head of Cattle, but in their return, the Rebels (being one thouÅ¿and Å¿trong) were got between our men and the Towne, yet they kept their pray, brought it into the Town, and kild threeÅ¿core and ten of the Rogues with the loÅ¿Å¿e of two men.</p>
            <p>The third day of <hi>July,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Broughall</hi> marched out to relieve Sir <hi>Philip Percivals</hi> CaÅ¿tle, with his owne troop onely, and two hundred and fifty foot, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by a thouÅ¿and of the Rebels horÅ¿e and foot, who after a fierce aÅ¿Å¿ault kill'd one hundred of the Rebels, and relieved the CaÅ¿tle, and in their returne skirmiÅ¿hed againe with the Rogues, and kill'd one hundred and fifty more of them, with the loÅ¿Å¿e of two men onely, bleÅ¿Å¿ed be God who putteth courage into the hearts of our men, teaching <hi>their hands to warre, and their fingers to fight,</hi> and giveth them victory, wee have taken of late many brave CaÅ¿tles with much proviÅ¿ion.</p>
