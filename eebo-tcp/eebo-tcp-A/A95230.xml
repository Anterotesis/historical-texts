            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true Relation brought over by a Noble Gentleman Sir <hi>Hards Waller</hi> by name, of a ſharpe Skirmiſh which there happened on the 29. day of <hi>June</hi> 1642. Betwixt the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Inchguin,</hi> Captaine <hi>William Iephton,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Courtney,</hi> on the Engliſh party, and the Rebels on the other ſide, in the Province of <hi>Munſter.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T happened that the Enemy lying within ſeven or eight miles of our Engliſh quarter at <hi>Downarayle</hi> aforeſaid; and conſiſting of about twenty five hundred foot, and a Troope of Horſe, had a Deſigne (as wee knew by good intelligence) to confront our Forces there, if not to fall foule with us. The ſaid Lord <hi>Inchguin</hi> with the adviſe of the other Commanders, reſolved by way of prevention, to march away towards them all night from <hi>Downarayle,</hi> which enterpriſe they ſo dexterouſly purſued, that with five hundred Muſquetiers, and two hundred Horſe; they were ready to give them a Breakfaſt the next morning very early: and albeit thoſe Rebels had gotten ſome private advertiſement of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and had therefore ſtood all that night to their Armes. Yet did our ſaid Commanders find the meanes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them; and to trye their mettle, began to ſalute them with a Volley of ſhot, which ſeconded by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111394:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->Troopes did ſo daunt them at the very firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they preſently were Rowted, and betooke them with all poſſible diligence to their heeles, towards a Wood and Bogge, about halfe a mile off from that place. And our valiant Troopes then purſuing them, did through Gods eſpeciall favour leſſen their number by about ſixe hundred men, and tooke ſome of their Commanders Priſoners, with five of their Colours; they have hereby alſo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their ſtore of Armes with many Muſquets, and many more Pykes in this Conflict which I may ſay, was a very ſharpe one on their ſide, but miraculouſly favourable on ours. As having loſt but one man, nor any hurt but one Sergeant, (thankes to the Lord of Hoaſts.) This and the like ſtrange Victories wee now and then obtain againſt the Rebels, doe give us no ſmall heart and courage amidſt the great wants we often undergoe in this now almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Countrey; And makes our men goe on with ſuch incredible reſolution, as we reade of the old Romans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Barbarous Nations, without being any more daunted with the preſent diſtractions betwixt the King and Parliament, then were thoſe Romans abroad, when their Emperours and Conſuls brought the Scene of warre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed God nevertheleſſe to temper our late Triumph with ſome ſorrow. For upon the fourth of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt, our moſt Noble and never-enough lamented Sir <hi>William Leger,</hi> Preſident of this Province is departed this life, dying in his bed, of an infirmity which his Phiſitian ſayes was occaſioned by this reſtleſſe care and ſtudy in his Charge.</p>
            <p>Wee daily are put in hope of freſh ſupplyes out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> but they are ſo long a comming, that wee begin to

            <p>The 29 of <hi>June,</hi> wee marched with our Engliſh forces being four hundred foot, and four Troops of Horſe towards the Enemy, and having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them, wee found them to be three thouſand Foot and Horſe, and yet we gave them battail, and ſuch was the goodneſſe of God unto us that wee forced them to retreat into a Town, where continuing our purſuit beat them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and forced them utterly to flight, in this ſervice our Horſe and Foot killed ſix hundred of them, took their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition

               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->and Waggons, &amp; having pillaged their Town, we burnt it to the ground, and brought away ſix Enſignes, eight Drums, and took Arms for five hundred men, had we been furniſhed with ſufficient forces, wee might have ſaved the Town and left a Garriſon in it, which (through Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might have much advanced the ſervice.</p>
            <p>The 30 of <hi>June,</hi> my Lord <hi>Keloumikie,</hi> (ſon to the Earle of <hi>Gork</hi>) his Horſe being in number but 38, marcht out of <hi>Bandonbridge,</hi> and in the compaſſe of ſix miles brought in a thouſand ſheep and foure hundred head of Cattle, but in their return, the Rebels (being one thouſand ſtrong) were got between our men and the Towne, yet they kept their pray, brought it into the Town, and kild threeſcore and ten of the Rogues with the loſſe of two men.</p>
            <p>The third day of <hi>July,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Broughall</hi> marched out to relieve Sir <hi>Philip Percivals</hi> Caſtle, with his owne troop onely, and two hundred and fifty foot, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by a thouſand of the Rebels horſe and foot, who after a fierce aſſault kill'd one hundred of the Rebels, and relieved the Caſtle, and in their returne skirmiſhed againe with the Rogues, and kill'd one hundred and fifty more of them, with the loſſe of two men onely, bleſſed be God who putteth courage into the hearts of our men, teaching <hi>their hands to warre, and their fingers to fight,</hi> and giveth them victory, wee have taken of late many brave Caſtles with much proviſion.</p>
            <p>Surely according to theſe experiments of Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull aſſiſtance to our poore forces, it may well be hoped that if we had money to pay our Souldiers, five thouſand foot with a proportionable number of horſe would enable us to bid our friends welcome, and to repell enemies, and therefore I earneſtly beg of God to compoſe the unhappy
