         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Lord hath many wayes to bring the enemies of the
Goſpel to the loue thereof. Eſpecially he requireth of
vs the defence of his trueth, and earneſt prayer that
ſuch defenſe may reforme the iudgement and conſcience
of the aduerſarie. For though there were will and labour
for the trueth on both ſides (which is to be wiſhed) yet it is
not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God
that ſheweth mercie. This mercie we muſt pray at Gods
hand, that our planting and watering may receiue of him
daily and great increaſes. Therefore, good reader, when
this ſmal, or any great defenſe of the trueth cometh to thy
hand, reioyce that the trueth is defended, that error and
vanitie is diſcouered: but ioyne with that ioye a care to
haue him brought into the waye of ſaluation, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorantly or wilfully wandreth from the ſame. Hate
his errors, but in compaſsion pray for his reformation. Who
knoweth whom and when the Lord will call? Moreouer
when thou ſeeſt the diligence and boldnes of the enemies
ſo great in repayring the ruines of Babylon: pray alſo that
we marking what wiſedome they haue in their generation,
may the rather be prouoked to greater diligence &amp; might
infiniſhing the walles of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Laſt of al let vs as manie
as profeſſe the Goſpel, bring forth fruites worthie of the
Goſpel, leaſt the Papiſts on the one ſide, and the godleſſe
familie of ſelfeloue on the otherſide preuaile more and
more againſt the trueth, for a iuſt puniſhment of our ſinnes
in contemning the Goſpel, which by doctrine with diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and by mercie with iuſtice muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and bring forth fruite to the
glory of God, and the peace
of his Church for euer.
Amen.</p>

yet he hath a purpoſe to diſturbe all by the
very proclayming of this ſpiritual fight, and
by giuing aime to them, that in the ſame
league attempt otherwyſe more dangerous
matters againſt the ſtate.</p>
            <p>Theſe letters comming to my hand, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had read them, and conſidered his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
vaunts againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth, ioyned with
woordes pretending great humilitie, his
proteſtation of zeale to ſaue ſoules, deliuered
with matter that draweth them into damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hereſies, I expected a preſent yſſue by
<pb facs="tcp:19858:3"/>
his perſonall anſwere, before them to whom
ſuch cauſes apperteine. But not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of any ſuch yſſue, and finding the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be more and more ſpred as Libels,
abuſing the name and holy authoritie of the
Counſell, and that they prepare inconſtant
mindes to the miſlike of religion, and deſire
of Poperie (which plainely appeareth to be
the practiſe of the Champion in ſcattering
them) I thought it my dutie to anſwere the
ſame, in reſpect of the publique iniurie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
to religion, with all humilitie offering
this anſwere, or further proceeding with the
ſaide Libell, to their honours moſt wiſe
conſideration.</p>
            <p>But before I come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particular points
of his letters, I am ſhortly to touch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe
and onely matter therein pretended: which
is a deſire to haue a diſputation graunted, or
ſolemne audience for ſome ſermons to bee
made in the mayntenance of the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
abandoned Popiſh religion.</p>
            <p>This petition ſeemeth to all Papiſts
needfull, &amp; I can not blame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for it would
do them good to obteine, if it were but a
queſtion for ſomewhat, who haue right to
nothing. But I would wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, if any which
profeſſe the Goſpell ſhould now looke for a
<pb facs="tcp:19858:4"/>
diſputation, to anſwere euery vaine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
&amp; that after ſo many &amp; bleſſed yeeres,
wherein error hath euery way bene confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp; the trueth eſtabliſhed. For our partes,
we are ſo aſſured of the manifeſt trueth, that
we make no doubt thereof. For their parts,
if they ſought conference in a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp; with a deſire to learne, it were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to regard their deſires, &amp; to relieue their
conſcience. But returning into the lande,
with vngodly vowes and obſtinate mindes
to perſiſt in their errors, and hauing hope
with their maſkes to deceiue many, it is
meete to keepe them as farre from doing
harme by their lies, as they withholde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
farre from receiuing good by our
trueth. For to our profeſſion they minde not
to be brought, they are votaries to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.
What then ſhall we gaine by diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with them, when they will not bee gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the trueth? To our ſelues alreadie
through the great mercie and power of God
and his word, we haue by diſputations made
great gaine within the realme and abroade,
and the ſame gaine increaſeth to the ſaintes
of God, with increaſe of ſorowe and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to all that yet haue traffique with the
whore of Babylon.<note place="margin">Reue. 18. 11.</note> Moreouer in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb facs="tcp:19858:4"/>
to ouerthrowe the chalengers by
the worde (as often their maſters haue bene,
and they eaſily may bee) what great victory
can it bee ouer two or three of the laſt &amp; leaſt
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarrel? They make accompt to gayne
nothing indeede, yet by falſe report of ſome
that ſtand readie preſt, to poſt away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newes
of victorie, before there be a ſtroke ſtriken,
they may winne ſome piece of their deſire.
Alſo they think it ſome profit, onely to barke

many of them, as by diligent hearing of the
worde haue not attained to the certeine loue
of the trueth. Neuertheleſſe, although I
thinke it inconuenient in a ſettled eſtate, to
haue the trueth of God, and her Maieſties
moſt godly proceedings called into diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by theſe men, who are her alienated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
and in this maner againſt a ſingular
peace: yet vpon other circumſtances, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
haue bene heretofore graunted, ſo
they may agayne. For not wee, but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
refuſe lawfull diſputation: not we, but
they feele and confeſſe that they get nothing
thereby.<note place="margin">R. Maffeus in Iudam. Watſon and others at home.</note> The inconueniencie is that, which
I note in the ſeditious practiſe of this man,
and his confederates. Otherwiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth hath more cauſe then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
to dreade their forces. Wee ſeeke not to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
we any ſnare they can laye: we feare not
their euidence, or doubt of our owne title.
They haue had and may haue the libertie of
their pen: if theſe Ieſuites haue any thing
that their maſters had not, or which our
fathers in the Goſpell haue not anſwered,
let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lay it downe in writing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> true forme
of argument, (which is the moſt certeine
<pb facs="tcp:19858:6"/>
tryall, &amp; of greateſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) &amp; in writing,
by the grace of God, they ſhalbe anſwered.
For howe litle we feare them, &amp; howe much
they feare vs, it appeareth by that they ſuffer
not a ſcroule of religion, or tending neuer ſo
litle that way, in any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hand, but it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
a matter for the inquiſition. Yea, they
withhold the very word it ſelfe. Wheras we
find y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the very view of their outward Rome
with her abominations, and the inward ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heart of popiſh religion, with her
abſurdities, haue made many, as well groſſe
Papiſts, as others indifferent betwene both
religions, to ſtand reſolued in the trueth, and
to acquaint themſelues with the cleare and
comfortable doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, after
the execrable ſuperſtitions of the Pope once
throughly knowen.</p>
            <p>But nowe to come to his letters, I finde
(to ſpeake generally) that they haue a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to nine articles: the preface and articles
being to the ſame purpoſe. For all is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
thus much: that he hath taken a farre &amp;
dangerous iourney, boldly &amp; plainely to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
himſelf a procter to mainteine againſt al
commers in diſputation, at the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Pope, the Popiſh religion, &amp; to
confute the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus. This
<pb facs="tcp:19858:6"/>
is the chalenge. The promiſe is to perſuade
euen Prince &amp; people profeſſing the trueth,
that they are in error: as if both Prince and
people had not ſufficient aſſurance of their
faith: or the chiefeſt Papiſtes did not from
day to day receiue great ouerthrowes both
in diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and writing. For (to the glory
of God in the miniſterie of the Goſpell be it
remembred, and to the heart griefe of al Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Catholiques) the Lord addeth to the
true Catholique Church of his elect, great
numbers continually: &amp; to thoſe that openly
profeſſe the religion, many notable cities,
which lately were firſt in the zeale of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and are nowe not the laſt of them that
embrace the trueth: notwithſtanding ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
artes and inſolencies vſed to ſtoppe the
courſe and increaſe of the Goſpell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if the Lord do not puniſh our contempt
of the word we profeſſe, what hope may our
Chalenger haue, that the Pope ſhall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
others, when he can not keepe his own,
no not them that lately carried the canopie
ouer his head?</p>
            <p>In the preface, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſuite reporteth his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
<hi>out of Germany and Boeme into
Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his deare cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of his ſuperiours y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſent him,</hi> where he giueth
<pb facs="tcp:19858:7"/>
a note of his danger &amp; of his obedience. But
touching his obedience, it commeth to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
afterward. As for his da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, I ſee them
not ſo great as he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. For I dout not
but he was wel contented that this place fell
to his lot: &amp; that he wayted a time to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
himſelfe, when there was, in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
leſſe danger then heretofore, &amp; more hope
of ſome golden daye. But the man <hi>is come
into this noble realme for the glorie of God
and the benefite of ſoules.</hi> What glory of
God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come by a man ſworne to Antichriſt
againſt Gods glory: ſworne to the Councill
of Trent againſt the peace of this kingdom?
What care of ſoules can hee haue, which
would withdraw their foode, &amp; in enraged, &amp;
therfore would enrage others with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup of
poiſon wherwith the whore of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath
heretofore poyſoned the princes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth?<note place="margin">Reuel. 17. 2.</note>
What benefite of ſoules can poore ſoules
looke for at his hand, that in place of the moſt
cleare light of the Goſpel, would bring in a
greater plague of darkenes, then that of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt?
This is the effect of the Ieſuites loue
which he would ſhew to his deare cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo many yeeres abſence out of her ſight.</p>
            <p>Being now arriued, he keepeth his perſon
ſecret, that he may vnderhand &amp; ſafely ſowe
<pb facs="tcp:19858:7"/>
matter of hereſie &amp; ſedition: but by letters he
maketh his purpoſe knowen with cunning
ſpeaches. Why he keepeth himſelfe ſecret ſo
long as he may, one reaſon is to auoide, that
hee would ſeeme to make none accompt of:
namely a iuſt puniſhment of his contempts
againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law. Another reaſon is (as I ſayd)
to make way for the Pope priuately, becauſe
he dareth not effect his meſſage ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly. That
he deliuereth his minde in writing, not as a
priuate letter in one copie, but as a publique
matter in many copies all abroade, it is to
entertaine ſliding mindes with vaine hope:
to caſt ſome diſgrace vpon the cauſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
&amp; all by a promiſe of that which all the
Ieſuites in the worlde can not performe,
though this Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion alone doth vndertake
it. Such vndertakers are like ynough to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake
ſome ſimple ones, not yet cleanſed
from the dregges of Properie: otherwiſe it
will be hard to preuayle with men of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
who euer ſuſpect them of bankrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that aſke ſo much credit of their owne
word w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any ſureties. Thus it appeareth
that this Ieſuites promiſes, &amp; crauing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
to be beleeued in ſo great things, is but
to withdrawe many of her Maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
from the loue of the Goſpel, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:19858:8"/>
they are taught to their owne ſaluation: and
conſequently from regard of them ſelues, &amp;
from obedience to her Maieſties moſt noble
and godly proceedings. Yet as if he did not
minde this matter, he doth inſinuate his own
danger for weldoing: as if it were like, that,
notwithſtanding his cloſe dealing, as much
to keepe himſelfe as he may, <hi>this buſie world
might finde him out ſooner or later, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt</hi>
a buſie felow, &amp; this <hi>watchful world
would finde him</hi> out for all his watchfulnes.
But I would this <hi>ſuſpicious worlde</hi> would
more ſuſpect them that come to vs in ſheeps
clothing, being inwardly rauening wolues.
It is to ſmall purpoſe that he layeth downe
the confeſſion of the matter without preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the man. For if the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were founde,
there is matter ynough againſt him without
his confeſſion. Yet he would be accounted a
good dealer, and to ſaue his examiners from
ſome labour when he ſhall <hi>haply be founde</hi>
and brought to examination. Neuertheleſſe
if in theſe letters al be not plainely confeſſed,
that may iuſtly be implyed, then <hi>he hath not
eaſed his examiners from the practiſe of
their wit in finding</hi> out more daungerous
practiſes concealed, then are thoſe, which
are here expreſſed to cloke the reſt. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb facs="tcp:19858:8"/>
to ſpeake of his articles <hi>layd downe

            </p>
            <p>1 In the firſt hee confeſſeth his calling,
<hi>That, albeit vnworthy, hee is a prieſt of the
Romiſh church,</hi> which he doth falſly honour
with the name of <hi>the Catholique Church.</hi>
Such as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church is, ſuch is his prieſthood
alſo: the Church Antichriſtian, &amp; the prieſts
thereof miniſters of Antichriſt, taking vpon
them againſt the manifeſt worde of God to
offer vp a ſacrifice for the quicke &amp; dead. An
intolerable blaſphemie againſt the all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſacrifice of the Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26. &amp; 10. 12. &amp; 18.</note> offring him

vnworthy of ſo foule a prieſthood, what ſhal
he be worthy of? Not <hi>by the great mercie,</hi>
but by the iuſt iudgement <hi>of God</hi> worthy of

            <p>In this place, becauſe theſe ſcorpio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites

Nowe it was not ſo vile a thing before, to

Theſe new Ieſuites muſt be called

haue called themſelues Ieſuites, may
be called Iebuſites, without offence to the
Lord Ieſus, &amp; moſt aptly in reſpect of their
dealings. As their name, ſo chalenged to
themſelues, is abſurd, ſeruing them only to
make a ſhew of holineſſe, and to deceiue the
poore people: ſo their practiſes are yet more
deteſtable. For they gather learning onely,
as the ſpider gathereth poyſon, that they
may infect the heart &amp; ſtomake of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.

though in their owne conſcience neuer ſo

But what authoritie hath the Pope
to ſend out ſwarmes of Ieſuites into all the

Cunning wordes to cloke an euill

ſinging Maſſe, and corrupt baptiſme, with

If it be of obedience to God vnder Chriſtes

            <p>2 The ſecond &amp; third article are one in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:

of order make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the place where he
is to exerciſe his charge, before the charge be
expreſſed. To folow him &amp; his order, in this
article he mentioneth his returne into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
as for great good: but paſſeth by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
thence with ſilence, as carying a
plaine note of much euil. <hi>He taketh his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
from Prage to Rome, and thence</hi> into
England being commanded <hi>by a warrant
from heauen and an oracle of Chriſt.</hi> Great
wordes emporting a great ambaſſage. But
leaſt any ſhould take it, that hee receiued his
warrant in a dreame, or hearde a voyce in
deede out of heauen, he expoundeth him ſelf,
yet with wordes doubtfull, as oracles
<pb facs="tcp:19858:13"/>
among the Gentiles were wont to ſpeake.
For whether hee vnderſtande the generall
Prouoſt of the Ieſuites onely, or whether
hee vnderſtande the Pope him ſelfe, it is
ſomewhat doubtfull. If he meant not the
generall Prouoſt of the Ieſuites, (which I
rather thinke) then hee auoyded the name of
Pope, as iuſtly odious euery where for his
abominable ſuperſtitions, pride, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
ouer mens liues and conſciences: but in
England moſt of all,<note place="margin">His moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and malicious Bull. 1569. anſwered by M. Bullinger</note> for that he hath againe
and againe throwen out his thunderbolts of
curſe both againſt the Prince, and agaynſt
the people. Wherin, by the way, let vs looke
to the effect of thoſe curſes. Did not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
turne them into bleſſings? Did it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
euen to the Papiſts howe vnderſerued
the curſes were, and howe litle the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
ſuppoſed omnipotencie of the Pope
can doe? Was not Salomons Prouerbe
iuſtified in thoſe Bulles?<note place="margin">Prou. 26. 2.</note> As a byrde wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth,
and a ſwallowe flyeth away, ſo doeth
a curſe that is vnderſerued.</p>
            <p>But to returne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doubtful ſpeach, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he meant the Pope, or the Ieſuites ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
what blaſphemie is it to attribute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of <hi>a warrant from heauen, and the
voyce of Chriſt,</hi> to a man whoſe breath is in
<pb facs="tcp:19858:14"/>
his noſtrelles, and whoſe ſinnes reach vp to
heauen, calling for vengeance? Doe we now
perſwade and preach men?<note place="margin">Galat. 1. 10.</note> or rather, as the
Apoſtle ſaith, Ought not euen the Apoſtles
themſelues to preach Chriſt Ieſus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde,
and them ſelues ſeruantes?<note place="margin">3. Cor. 4. 5.</note> Saint Paul
woulde not preach otherwiſe then the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
no not at the voyce of an Angell from
heauen:<note place="margin">Galat. 1. 8, 9.</note> and theſe come to preach Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie
at the voyce of the man of ſinne.
Therefore, how are all men, eſpecially they
whom the Lorde hath exalted to his place of
iuſtice, howe are they to take diligent heede
of theſe men, and of the matter they bring,
much more dangerous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former buls?
If the Popes worde be to them <hi>a warrant
from heauen, and an oracle of Chriſt,</hi> then
at his word they muſt inuade kingdomes,
throwe downe eſtates, change gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
roote out the Goſpell, and plant ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
with all other their beggerly and
wicked ſuperſtitions that acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

<hi>alwayes reſiant at Rome:</hi> but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſuite muſt
remember that hee may remooue his chaire
to Sibyllas denne, or any other place by the
doctrine of the Ieſuites. As for <hi>his readie
mynde to haue gone ioyouſly into anie</hi>

the power of God.</p>
            <p>8 That the righteous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liueth by ſaith,
he hath it not in Chriſt, but by his owne
workes. Cenſ. Col. 118. <hi>A contrary place in

            <p>9 Men doe ſurely hope that euerlaſting

            <p>11 Chriſt neuer ſaid to the lay men, Do

            <p>13 We muſt worſhip the image of Chriſt

with like honour that wee doe the holy

ſaith S. Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 15. <hi>What agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is there betweene the Church of God
and Idoles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and many other blaſphemies doe
the Ieſuites maintaine. There is not a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
nor a ſpiders web in any corner of the
Popes breſt, but theſe Doctors will hold it
no leſſe holy, then that which commeth out
of Chriſtes breſt. But doe not euen the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
that know theſe things, eaſely ſee, how
the Ieſuites in theſe doctrines bewray the
ſpirit of Antichriſt,<note place="margin">Apoc. 16. 14.</note> that went out into all the
world to deceiue and deſtroy? Surely none
can ſee,<note place="margin">Acts. 16. 14.</note> except the holye Ghoſt open their
heart:<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 16.</note> none can depart out of Sodom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Lorde doe drawe them. Although I
haue bene long in this matter, yet for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcouery, and for plaine warrant that
the ſect of Ieſuites is moſt wretched, at the
ende of my anſwere I haue added a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a booke,<note place="margin">Colloquium Ieſuiticum.</note> wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſect is notably diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
by a teſtimonie out of their own heart.</p>
            <p>Nowe to returne to Campions wordes:
<hi>He hath bene a Ieſuite theſe viii. yeeres.</hi> A
long time to ſee ſo many enormities, &amp; in al
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace not to returne from them to the Go-ſpel,
<pb facs="tcp:19858:15"/>
with a ſhort pardon, which cannot be rooted
out but by much preaching. Their confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of errors is in deede a confutation of
the trueth, and a confirmation of lies, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
nowe more then the lyght of the
Sunne at noone. For as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of them,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 8.</note> They ſhall preuayle no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
their madneſſe is made euident to all
men, as the inchantment of Iannes and
Iambres. As theſe withſtoode Moſes: ſo
the Ieſuites reſiſt Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; the lyght
of the Goſpel, men full of ambition in their
corrupt mindes, and enemies to the Croſſe
of Chriſt. That he thinketh <hi>his poore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen
abuſed with proude ignorance,</hi> I
maruell what hee meaneth to blame igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in any. For we that profeſſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
lament and crye out againſt <hi>ignorance:</hi>
our aduerſaries they alwayes haue made
much of it, as the mother of deuotion: yea
euen the moſt famous order of the Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Fryers, that extol Francis their Father,
and their order aboue the heauen of heauens,
they haue a rule that <hi>the vnlettered among
them ſhoulde not care to learne letters.</hi>
But the Ieſuites, they profeſſe and teache
knowledge. Let vs ſee, what knowledge,
and for what cauſe. It is the very ſame
<pb facs="tcp:19858:16"/>
knowledge which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſerpent performed:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 1.</note> who
promiſed the knowledge of euill, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the knowledge of good: who promiſed
life, and brought in death. Therein alſo the
cauſe appeareth: for this maſter promiſeth
<hi>to roote out proude ignorance,</hi> minding in
deede to roote out the fyncere knowledge of
the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> which is the power of God to
ſaluation. Here the Ieſuite moſt wickedly
calleth the knowledge of the Goſpel, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
and the ſtedfaſt confeſſion of our faith
&amp; hope that wauereth not,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 22, 23.</note> he termeth pride.
But Poperie, which this rooter out of the
Goſpell woulde plant in place thereof, is in
deede proude ignorance, and a treading vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foote of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of Chriſt. For it proudly
refuſeth to heare, and reioyceth to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vnderſtanding. Therefore Poperie is
that proud ignorance that muſt not reenter,
and the diſeaſe therof remaining in many, is
that which muſt be more &amp; more rooted out.
For, though it promiſe all good things,
what one good thing can that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring,
which ioyneth the merittes of man with the
merittes of Chriſt, which matcheth, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcheth
the worde of God with traditions,
the commandement of God with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaund
of the Pope, the Temple of God
<pb facs="tcp:19858:16"/>
with Idoles? Which doctrines and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are the doctrines of men, as contrary to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy worde of God, as is darknes to light,
&amp; infidelitie to faith in Chriſt Ieſus. What,
I ſay, can the Ieſuites religion bring, but
ſome vnbleſſed bleſſings of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which draw
after them the euerlaſting curſes of God?
The ſunne of righteouſnes, that ſhineth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our hearts, being thus taken awaye, this
Ieſuite would bring vs to ſome knowledge
of the woman that is arayed with purple &amp;
ſcarlet,<note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 4.</note> &amp; ouerlaid w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gold, precious ſtones,
and pearle. Which woman is ſet out vnto
the carnall eye, &amp; ſenſe, by ſuch allurements
to recouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth her old louers,
that ſhe may make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drunken againe with
her cup of fornications. Therefore in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
of Ieſus I beſeech all my deare coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
men not to be deceiued by this Ieſuite,
who bringeth into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a worſhip cleane
contrary to the worſhip of God. For Gods
worſhip is in Spirit and trueth:<note place="margin">Ion. 4. 23. 24</note> and poperie
is in gold and ſiluer &amp; pearle, and crucifixes,
and Agnus deis, all for the eye, and to ſnare
the heart of a carnall man, bewitching it
with ſo great gliſtering of the painted har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot.
It is alſo in all kynde of muſike to fyll
the eare with delight, and in all excellent
<pb facs="tcp:19858:17"/>
perfumes to pleaſe the ſmell. Theſe and all
the reſt are carnall intiſements, to quenche
the Spirite, bewraying that Poperie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in vs, not a feeling or iudgement of
Gods ſeruice in Spirite, but of fleſhly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
to cary vs away to the fornications of
that ſtrumpet of all the worlde. Nowe as
Popery is not a worſhip of God in Spirit,
ſo is it not ioyned with any worſhip of God
in trueth, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> canons &amp; decrees of men,
who, to rayſe vp their owne kingdome, goe
about to throw down both the kingdome of
men, and (which is their chiefeſt practiſe) the
kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore it
was too broade to charge the Goſpel nowe
preached, as an <hi>abuſing of his poore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen:</hi>
whereas he himſelfe ſeeth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are many of them abuſed from
Rome, and by theſe cloſe meſſengers from
thence: namely with moſt fooliſh and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
traſhe, as Bulles, pardons, holie
graines, copper pieces of Agnus dei, with
ſuch other childiſh inuentions, wherein (if a
ſtrong ſpirit of error did not reigne in ſome)
I maruell that the beggerlineſſe and follie
of their religion is not more eſpied and had
in a perpetuall deteſtation.</p>
            <p>4 The fourth article doeth ſhew as much
<pb facs="tcp:19858:17"/>
trueth in his words, as is in his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For
in wordes hee doeth openly deny that which
is moſt apparant in his doinges, and moſt
neceſſary for his cauſe. <hi>He neuer had mind,
and was ſtreightly forbidden by his father
that ſent him, to deale in any reſpect with
any matters of ſtate, &amp;c.</hi> Here he doeth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
affirme that which muſt not be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
here he doeth perſwadingly craue that
which muſt not at al be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. He would
be thought no enemie of the ſtate, no dealer
with the common wealth or policie: &amp; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
a reaſon, (if you wil beleue him,) <hi>It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteineth
not to his vocation: and from it
he doeth gladly eſtrange, and ſequeſter his
thoughtes.</hi> But all theſe wordes are as if a
man woulde manifeſtly wounde his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to the heart, and yet in the deede doing
cry out, ſaying, I doe not ſo much as thinke
him any harme. For he that ſmiteth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
woundeth our common wealth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our bleſſed eſtate of policie ſtandeth
in defence of religion, and our moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
religion laboureth in the mayntenance
of the common wealth. Religion and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in Englande are, through Gods ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
bleſſings, preſerued together in life, as
with one ſpirite: hee that doeth take awaye
<pb facs="tcp:19858:18"/>
the life of the one, doeth procure the death of
the other. Neyther can any Ieſuite from
Prage or Rome, come ouer to confute and
alter religion, but hee muſt attempt the
change of the ſtate, to the lamentable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the lande. Hee can not agayne
bring in the Pope, but he muſt take awaye
from her royall Maieſtie, her iuſt ſupreme
ſoueraintie, and depriue her at one clappe
of the authoritie ſhee hath ouer all perſons
and ordinances. She muſt haue nothing
to doe with the bodie or goods of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
(as they ſpeake:) ſhee muſt ſeeke a
reconciliation from the Popes curſe: her
chiefe lawes muſt bee no lawes: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
gouernement, that I may not ſaye
the preſent gouerner, muſt bee changed,
a newe eſtabliſhed, and made ſubiect to the
checke of the Prieſt of Rome. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this man that woulde ouerthrowe
all, woulde make vs beleeue his purpoſe
is to touche nothing. Becauſe he caryeth
no ſworde, he woulde hee thought to cary
no weapon. But is not one trumpet worſe
then many ſwordes? What manifeſt diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
is then in the champions wordes?
what playne contrarietie? But it is no
new thing: for his whole pamphlet is full of
<pb facs="tcp:19858:18"/>
ſuch monſterous contrarietie, while hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth
humilitie in ſhewe, but pryde in
deede: agayne, while he vttereth the words
of ſwelling pryde, hauing no matter but
vile and baſe. But Antichriſt and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
muſt needes learne of their father
his chiefeſt leſſon, which is to lye, that the
ſaying of Chriſt may appeare,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 44.</note> Satan
is a lyer, and the father of lyes. As for his
reaſon, that <hi>thinges of policie appertayne
not to his vocation:</hi> although it bee true
in deede, yet it is ſo ſayde onely to couer
his purpoſe, which is to the contrary. For
appertayneth it to Saunders in Irelande
by the ſame oracle, and doeth it not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
to Campion in England? Surely it
doeth apperteyne aſmuch but the open at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
is not ſo ſafe. Therefore it commeth
here to bee conſidered, that the oracle hath
a double heart and a double tongue, ſet at
large to denye or breake euen an othe made
to one, not of his ſect, and euermore to ſay
and vnſaye, to promiſe, and breake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
as may make moſt for his deuiliſh
practiſes.</p>
            <p>5. Now foloweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> execution of his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
wherein he aſketh with ſhewe of great
humilitie, the thing that bewrayeth his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

and learned men: and againſt them,
notwithſtanding their ſtrength, and the

of this renowmed eſtate, ſo enriched with

ſpirituall</hi> (as he ſpeaketh) <hi>and temporall.</hi>
But let vs further examine what hee vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
In this place the Ieſuite a man profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo great knowledge knoweth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he remembreth not in this article, what
he ſolemnly proteſted in the former. For
there he affirmed that <hi>he minded not, that
he might not in any reſpect deale with
matters of ſtate:</hi> but now as hauing his will
altered and a ſecrete diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the
charge of his fathers, <hi>he wil diſcourſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſo far as it toucheth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth
&amp; their nobilities.</hi> But out of the abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:19858:20"/>
of the heart,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 34.</note> doth the mouth ſpeaketh, &amp; the
pen writeth. It foloweth, wherof he maketh
moſt account, to try the matter out with <hi>the
doctors, &amp; maſters of ech vniuerſity.</hi> What
he bringeth from a newe forge, I may more
eaſely geſſe, then determine. But if it be no
more, then his maſters of theſe &amp; all other v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities
haue brought already into their
bookes &amp; diſputations, it is nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> long
agoe hath not bene confuted. It may be, not
hauing better reaſons, he preſumeth of him
ſelfe that he hath fayrer colours then they
had, and a ſtronger ſpirite of illuſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
and cary away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preiudicate &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
hearer againſt reaſon. The manifolde
waies he promiſeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince by, are <hi>profes
inuincible, ſcriptures, &amp;c.</hi> If he can prooue
his cauſe by <hi>inuincible ſcriptures,</hi> it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
there neede no further proofes. But
if he alledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures for his cauſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 4 6.</note> as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
did, &amp; as heretikes doe, vſing ſome of the
words, &amp; leauing the fulnes of the ſentence,
or peruerting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words to another ſenſe then
the holy Ghoſt deliuereth, then ſhall he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
as Satan did, and his reward ſhalbe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the falſe prophetes.<note place="margin">Councils. Fathers. Stories.</note> As for <hi>Councils,
Fathers, and ſtories,</hi> they are rather witneſſe
one to another of ſome contrarietie, and all
<pb facs="tcp:19858:21"/>
witneſſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, howe corruptions crept
into the Church, then authentical iudges in
cauſes of religion. Neuertheleſſe we haue
(if we woulde vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) in their true allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
matter ſufficient to confute y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the
Ieſuite hopeth to confirme by falſe allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Touching places in the fathers to the
contrary, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are alredy condemned
of baſtardie, being places manifeſtly forged:
other not gyltie of forgery, howe great ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he, being now arraigned, is no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

theſe Councils make warre againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

Ieſuite, not ſo carefull to performe, as to

me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to looke for profes of his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where

foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the ſande, or a place of light
in the kingdome of darkenes. So impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
are the things that now he vndertaketh.
For among other proofes, he vndertaketh
<hi>to auow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of the Catholike Church,
by naturall and morall reaſon,</hi> which are
two great enemies of true religion, &amp; two
great nourſes of Atheiſme and hereſie. The
Apoſtle teacheth this, that the naturall man
can not diſcerne the thinges of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> they
ſeeme fooliſhnes to him. Dauid finding the
rebellion and ignorance of a naturall heart,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 10.</note>
craued a cleane heart to bee created within
him, and a newe ſpirit: newe, not onely in
affections, but in vnderſtanding, that hee
myght learne the iudgementes of God. For
want of this heart,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 11. 5. 1. Kin. 3. 12.</note> Salomon was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

coulde not receiue the reuelation of fayth
from fleſh and blood: but this Ieſuite can
deliuer it from thence. Therefore the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which muſt haue gods to goe before them<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 1.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:19858:22"/>
that is, they muſt haue a religion allowing
gods, &amp; images, &amp; worſhippings in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feeling

of law, ſtanding yet in force &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</hi>
Wherein againe he promiſeth to paye
out that, which he neuer receiued in. But if
he hath borowed ſomewhat out of the lawes
to ſaue his credit, let vs examine howe farre
it may go for paiment. Among other lawes
he relieth moſt vpon the Canon lawe,<note place="margin">Canon lawe.</note> and
ſome ſuch fragments thereof as yet he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to ſtand in ſome force. To ſpeake ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the Canon law, many matters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are ſo groſſe, that euen many Papiſtes,
which otherwiſe haue a harlots forehead, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not read them without bluſhing. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
out of a ſea of ſuch abſurdities, there is
a booke extant,<note place="margin">Sententiae Halleri ex decretis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. collectae</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath gathered many nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
places to proue aboue thirtie poyntes of
our religion. This was the iuſt iudgement
of God againſt the Popes, that they ſetting
<pb facs="tcp:19858:22"/>
downe wicked canons, ſhoulde not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good. Nowe for ſo much
of that law as is in practiſe, if it be not pure,
let not the worlde maruaile, if in purging
the Church from ſo many abominations
wherewith the aduerſaries had in all places
and ſo long time together defiled it, ſome
ſmall matter remained not ſwept away and
caried out with the reſt.<note place="margin">Common lawe.</note> As for the poſitiue

woulde ſeeme to haue knowledge and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for maintenance of his popiſh ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they make wonderfully againſt him. I
ſpeake not this onely in reſpect of the moſt
godly lawes made of late vnder King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the eyght, her Maieſties father of noble
fame, or ſince vnder the Joſias of theſe ages
King Edward the ſixt, and in the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and proſperous raigne of her Maieſtie:
but lawes made in the time of Edwarde the
firſt, Richard the thirde, and ſome others
before and after.<note place="margin">A treatiſe of the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie. Alſo ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and bookes by Tunſtall, Gardiner, Bonner, and other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt the Pope.</note> For euen theſe haue made
auncient lawes (as appeareth by a booke
written onely of this argument aboue four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeeres ſince) to abandon the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
which head of the Popiſh Church
being taken away, the body can not remaine
but as a dead carkeis, that muſt haue preſent
<pb facs="tcp:19858:23"/>
buriall: or remaine as one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> antique ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Rome, that hauing loſt the head, yet
is highly eſteemed onely for antiquitie.</p>
            <p>6 In the ſixt article firſt he ſheweth how
litle power he hath ouer his tongue, or ouer
his pen. For <hi>being loth to ſpeake any thing
that might but ſounde of an inſolent brag
or chalenge,</hi> yet hee doeth moſt inſolently
bragge more then any, and chalenge more
then all. For what one man hath made ſuch
a bragge, or ſuch a chalenge, as out of al ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
againſt al men to mainteyne that that
for want of maintenance is fallen, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
prophecied of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fall,<note place="margin">Reuel. 14. 8. &amp; 18. 2.</note> ſaying, Great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
is fallen, &amp; the inhabitants &amp; friendes
thereof ſee her dayly fall, and there is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
violence nor ſubtiltie that can lift her
vp againe. But the Ieſuite moueth pitie, &amp;
rendereth a reaſon why he may not boaſt.
<hi>He is a dead man to this worlde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Friers and ſuch like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into their order, are ſaide to die &amp; may make their will, which is proued &amp; ſtandeth in force, as if they were dead.</note> In what
ſenſe he is dead, I know not. In deede as yet
he can neither be founde aliue, nor dead, nor
the place of his buriall. Whatſoeuer other
may thinke, hee thinketh not himſelfe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
dead: but dead by reſignation of a
worldly life, or danger of death that may
come by iuſtice of lawe. Whatſoeuer it
is, he woulde be pitied, before he commeth
<pb facs="tcp:19858:23"/>
neere any danger. As he moueth pitie, ſo he
beggeth loue for the wonderfull loue &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
minde he would ſeeme to beare towarde
euery man. He offreth hayle maſter, as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
did, &amp; a kiſſe downe to the ground. But
we muſt not beleeue words of loue from an
enemie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſheweth malice in deede. Yet there
is ſome thing in his profeſſed loue. For to
treade afterward proudly vpon our heads, &amp;
to make vs kiſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes feete, he wil in the
Popes ſeruice firſt <hi>laye his head vnder our
feete, &amp; kiſſe the ground we tread vpon.</hi> O
falſe ſhew of gracious lowlines! O ſeruile
wordes of flatterie, ioyned with intolerable
pride of a deceitfull heart! For to whome is
not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> notorious pride, &amp; hideous crueltie of
Antichriſt knowen? It foloweth to ſee how
ſoone &amp; ſuddenly a double minded man ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
him ſelfe inconſtant in all his wayes.<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 8.</note>
He that in one line abaſeth him ſelfe to the
duſt, in the next exalteth him ſelfe againſt
heauen. He nowe pretending the defence of
<hi>the maieſtie of Chriſt,</hi> and yet intending to
defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyranny of Antichriſt, doeth diſplay
<hi>his courage, his affiance, his aſſurance, his
euidence, ſo impregnable, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may
encountre with him.</hi> As before he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to crye a falſe Alarme againe ſinne, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:19858:24"/>
nowe in preſumption of himſelfe he ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the victory, and proclaimeth a triumph,
and that before he hath ſhewed his face in the
field. If thoſe wordes did no more tickle the
Papiſts that beleeue all and receiue al from
Rome, then they doe vs, who examine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
by the worde, he might haue reſerued
them for a fitter time, and a better place. In
a good cauſe, it is good alwaies to be bolde,
to haue <hi>ſingular affiance in the gratious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> On the other ſide in
an euil cauſe to truſt to a broken reede of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
is a double folly, &amp; bringeth a double
miſchiefe: firſt an ouerthrow in the attempt,
and afterward the ſhame of an euill matter.
Moreouer, for an enemie of the kingdome
of Chriſt to call <hi>Chriſt his King,</hi> and to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
his name to iuſtifie a foule enterpriſe,
it is nothing elſe, but to ſinne the ſinne of
them that ſweare,<note place="margin">Iere. 5. 2.</note> The Lord liueth, and yet
deceyue. For therein the offender maketh
the Lord of hoſtes a witneſſe,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7. 10.</note> &amp; a reuenger
of his impietie. In the wordes folowing (if
his heart varyed not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his pen) he maketh
account to haue very fauorable readers, that
will beleeue ſo great matters in ſo ſlender
a man.<note place="margin">Papinianus. Ael. Spartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in vita Caracalli.</note> For, as one ſayde of another matter,
It is eaſier to commit murther then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende

it, ſo is it eaſier to fal into the error of
Poperie, then to mainteyne it. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
this chalenger doeth ſo vndertake the
maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as if nothing could be replyed
againſt him. And not contenting himſelfe
to ſay, The Proteſtants cannot anſwere, he
doeth in ſpitefull wordes of diſgrace eaſe
his ſtomacke of much gall againſt the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and againſt their pulpits: againſt the
hearers, and their vnlearned eares. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of malice are ſo ſtrong, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
conceiued of his owne ſufficiencie ſo
great,<note place="margin">Horatius: Quid dignu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tanto feret hic promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor hiatu.</note> that he vaunteth, ſaying, <hi>I know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
that no one Proteſtant, nor all the
Proteſtants liuing can mainteine their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
They haue mainteined it by the word
of might and trueth againſt all the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in writing and ſolemne diſputation, as
hath bin noted. And can they not now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
it againſt one man, but of eight or nine
yeeres ſtanding in his profeſſion, as litle in
deede, as he is great in his owne conceipt?
Yes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaneſt of many by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God
can mainteyne it, and ſhall preuayle. And if
our aduerſaries wyll looke into our defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
already publiſhed, they ſhall ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our religion ſo great, and the cauſe
ſo manifeſt, that I may truely vſe theſe
<pb facs="tcp:19858:25"/>
wordes againſt the chalenger on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
No one Ieſuite, nor all the Ieſuites
liuing ſhall be able to anſwere that that is
written, or to roote out that which is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
We <hi>face not men downe in our pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits</hi>
(which is his foule reproch againſt our
holy exerciſe of preaching) but wee labour
by the powerfull worde of God to bring all
men to the knowledge and obedience of the
trueth. As for <hi>our kingdome of Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
againe I vnderſtande not his taunt.
Wee prayſe God for the knowledge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tongues by many Grammers: and for
the knowledge of Grammer, that leadeth
into further vnderſtanding: and theſe gifts
wee vſe to the glory of God, and the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of your religion. If his taunt was to
note, that we want other good artes, &amp; haue
onely ſome ſwaye in Grammer, herein alſo
he is gyltie of a falſe and ſpitefull accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For we can make proofe that the Lorde
hath giuen vs of the ſpoiles of Egypt, of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,
of Iewry, and of Rome. But it may
be he noteth it, that many nowe rule in the
Church, that in times paſt haue ruled one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Grammer ſchooles. I graunt that
ſome fewe ſuch are amongſt vs: but ſuch
profitable and ſufficient teachers of men,
<pb facs="tcp:19858:25"/>
that it were pitie, they ſhoulde any more
teache children. Nowe let vs paſſe from his
ſcoffes, and come againe to his vaunts. The
Campmaſter hauing with Rabſhaketh deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the arme of our God to be able to deliuer
vs,<note place="margin">2. King. 18. 30.</note> and condemning our cauſe before it bee
indited, doeth notwithſtanding <hi>craue the
combat with all and euery one of vs,</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>beſt welcome to him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
beſt furniſhed.</hi> I anſwere, Theſe are
wordes. The prouerbe maketh it a vayne
fight to fight with a ſhadowe: but wee haue
not ſo much as his ſhadowe for a meaſure of
the Champion, or for an argument that hee
is at hande. But as already he hath vaunted
of the vniuerſalitie of his knowledge, ſo
nowe he ſetteth out the vniuerſalitie of his
powers, making him ſelfe a monſter that
hath infinite perſons to ſtand it out, infinite
eares to heare, and infinite tongues to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
all and euery Proteſtant. Can hee
ſpeake wiſely in a ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
folly in a premeditate and weightie
letter? will he looke to win, that knoweth
not how to make his match? The laſt point
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> article is his proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ioy to meete
with no vnarmed enemie: but <hi>the better we
come furniſhed, the better welcome.</hi> We
<pb facs="tcp:19858:26"/>
haue nowe heard more then ynough of his
ſelfe liking: more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needed of his chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,
wherin hitherto we finde nothing hard, but
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he doeth not brag of: namely where
to finde him. For ſome will beare me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it is harder to finde him, then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
him when hee is founde. But theſe
wordes are deliuered to draw credit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and his cauſe: alſo to caſt diſcredit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vs, and our religion: Wherein he doeth ſtill
affirme the concluſion that ſhoulde be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
It is not ynough for a Ieſuite, or for
the oracle of the Ieſuites to affirme, except
proofes appeare. But we muſt tarry till the
Champion come to the liſtes.</p>
            <p>7 In the ſeuenth article he ſpeaketh good
words &amp; true, touching <hi>the ſingular graces
of God, wherewith he hath enriched her
Maieſtie in noble giftes of nature, learning
&amp; princely education.</hi> It is very wel if you
thinke thus duetifully in your heartes, and
ſpeake ſo reuerently of her Maieſty abroad,
and in your ſecret prayers. But why do you
paſſe ouer the grace of graces in her, which
deſerue perpetuall honor: namely her godly
zeale and knowledge, in profeſſing &amp; publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorious Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;
in abandoning your popiſh ſuperſtitions?
<pb facs="tcp:19858:26"/>
Why moreouer did you not yeelde to her
highnes al tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart, for her excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
clemencie, by the which many of you
liue, &amp; yet ſhew your ſelues vnworthy of ſo
great mercie? If the giftes of enemies be
giftleſſe gifts (as the prouerbe noteth) what
are the bare words of them that are more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall
in deede, then they can ſhewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
loyall in wordes? But be it knowen
to you, that her Maieſtie by her rare giftes
which you acknowledge, woulde eaſily ſee
your flattering hypocriſie, and your groſſe
preſumption of her readineſſe to incline, or
rather to decline to you: and moreouer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
iudge of your ſandy foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
morter, if either your letters were
worthy the leaſt reading, or your ſelfe meete
for any place in her moſt honorable preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
Your faire light woulde be dimme in the
brightneſſe of her wiſedome, your good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
would appeare to haue a great maime
at her learned conſideration, &amp; your playne
dealing would ſhew it ſelfe plaine dallying
with Gods cauſes, if in the ſingular dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of her iudgement, ſhee were preſent at
your diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to giue ſentence.
Therefore let mee heere once chalenge and
charge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chalenger, that he did ſo far breake
<pb facs="tcp:19858:27"/>
out into ſeditious and diſloyall ſpeach, as to
offer that wrong to her Maieſtie &amp; wiſdom,
in ſuggeſting to her ſubiects, that ſhe can be
remoued with a ſhaken reede, who was not
moued in the cauſe, at the earneſt ſutes, and
threates of mightie Princes. Wherein as
her Maieſtie hath receyued a notable prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
of Gods fauour, and hath ſingular
cauſe to reioyce before him in the peace of
conſcience, that paſſeth al vnderſtanding: ſo
ſhe hath made proofe to the worlde, that ſhee
is reſolued for the happy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of that,
which hath had ſo happie and manifold bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,

            <p>As for her Maieſties <hi>loue to her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and their moſt dutifull loue and ioye to
her againe, it requireth no Popiſh Doctor
or doctrine to alter it: being already eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in the knowledge of the Goſpel, which
worketh the effectuall bonde of peace and
perfection in Prince and people.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 3. Col. 3. 14.</note> Therefore
the ſecond poynt of this article is as preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
as the firſt. The firſt in drawing her
Maieſties excellent iudgement and zeale of
Gods houſe into doubt of alteration vpon a
diſputation or a few ſermons: the ſecond in
calling her beſt proceedings into accuſation
<pb facs="tcp:19858:27"/>
as hurtfull to the Realme. But it is not the
Goſpell that hurteth the realme: it is you,
ye Papiſtes, and your religion that hurt it,
and would bring it to miſerable deſolation,
to ſet vp agayne your abomination. Yea
many yeeres ſince you had done it, but that
the Lord, of mercy and iudgement, ſtriueth
whether he may ſhew greater tokens of his
gracious fauour to her Maieſtie &amp; the land,
or indignation to you, and your moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
attemptes, in diſcouering from time to
time ſo many of your ſecrete conſpiracies
and deepe practiſes: and in meeting ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
with your open rebellions and inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
In the wordes following, the chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
doeth trippe himſelfe, for hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
before prayſed her Maieſtie, nowe
correcting himſelfe, he doth vtter his griefe
agaynſt her, that hee and his confederates
<hi>are oppreſſed,</hi> and finde not equitie at her
hande. O vniuſt complaynt, that I ſaye no
more. Her mighty arme and ſword hath not
bene ſo heauie, as the little finger of thoſe
that perſecute the Church. Therefore, if
mine aduiſe may be taken in good parte, I
woulde wiſh you that are ſo great oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
except ye were oppreſſed, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you Ieſuites (who notwithſtanding the
<pb facs="tcp:19858:28"/>
ſaluation ſignified by the name of Ieſus,
which you take, yet you are the bellowes to
kindle and increaſe the fire of perſecution
more then any, in all places where you can
preuayle) not to complayne of oppreſſion,

            <p>8 From preſuming of her Maieſties plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
to their ſide, he returneth to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable

For attributing to them the <hi>prayſe of

backſliding in their honors, if he did not

iudge of their excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie. But how doth this
inconſtant Ieſuite ſtill giue in one line, and
take away in another? Haue her Maieſties

this Ieſuite writeth to their honor without

be, and what hath bene ſaid for Popiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>he wil now open the queſtions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

Phiſitions, Phiſitions of no valew?</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how this Ieſuite chargeth
the Lordes, as not hauing their eyes yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to ſee what religion is, and alſo noteth
the wantes of his maſters, that haue not

himſelf may ſooner with Atlas beare the
weight of the worlde vpon his ſhoulders,
then mainteine ſo great a quarell, as is the
defenſe of the Romiſh Church againſt the
Goſpel of God: as is the maynteining of
the worldly kingdome of the Pope, againſt
the ſpirituall and mightie kingdome of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. After theſe things he returneth
<pb facs="tcp:19858:29"/>
to his ſlaunders againſt the preachers of the

whatſoeuer the Ieſuite thus caſteth out in
malicious &amp; falſe termes, God bath bleſſed
the preachers of the Goſpell with worthie
gifts, and a pure forme of preaching, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the puritie of the Goſpel which they
profeſſe. So that if our aduerſaries, &amp; their

appeare to al men, that if Papiſts haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ſo we alſo: if they haue order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode,
ſo wee alſo: if they haue giftes to
perſwade, we much more, vpon more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
groundes. And (which is more then all)
whereas they preach men, we preache God,
whereas they preache error, we preache the
trueth, not according to men, but according
to the foundation of the holy Prophets and
Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 20</note> Chriſt Ieſus being the head cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

then I know that they wil draw byaſe,
whether they huddle or no. The worlde is
yet full of volumes, wherein their ſermons
are penned downe, but with matter ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
and Latine ſo barbarous, that all
bookes written to make ſport, muſt giue
place to them. From charging the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,

The time is neither ſhorter, nor longer, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

ſpeach, he couertly chargeth the
gouerners of the time. Wherein he againe
vttereth his murmuring, &amp; repineth that his

take no place. But bleſſed be the Lord, that
hath ſtretched out his arme, the ſwaye and
ſtroke whereof preuayleth againſt all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

let not their praiſes die for euer, whome the
Lord hath rayſed vp to be his inſtruments
in ſo glorious a worke. As for <hi>the beſt
blood in your bodies which you woulde
ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for their honors,</hi> which of them require
<pb facs="tcp:19858:30"/>
any ſuch ſacrifice at your hande? who ſtand
in neede of it? In ſo euil a cauſe, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading

may againe aduiſe you, keepe it to preſerue
life: it may be the Lord hath appointed a
day for your true repentance, that renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
your former workes of merite and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation,
you may receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of the

of Chriſt alone,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7. &amp;c.</note> which ſhalbe your
owne ſaluation. And leaue to profeſſe loue,
where you practiſe treaſon: ceaſe to promiſe
<hi>the ſheading of your blood</hi> willingly, as
in a good cauſe, whereas experience hath
lately ſhewed that you &amp; your confederates
loſt blood in a notorious euill cauſe.<note place="margin">In Ireland 29. Nouemb.</note> But
that was the mercy of God that watcheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

Againe the Ieſuite flaunteth in words,
&amp; vaunteth of <hi>his innocent handes lifted vp
to heauen euery day &amp; euery houre,</hi> as for
the good of their honours. To make your
hands no fowler then they are, yet thoſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
handes</hi> haue written no innocent

bookes: they haue caſt abroade no innocent
libels: they helde out no innocent banner of
Popiſh obedience in their actual rebellions
heretofore in England, &amp; preſently in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
But if thoſe handes may be <hi>innocent</hi>
that haue done theſe things, and moreouer
crucifie the ſonne of God againe euerie day
in their moſt blaſphemous ſacrifice of the
Maſſe: yet when you holde vp thoſe handes
in prayer, I doubt not, but it is with deſire
to haue Popiſh religion reſtored, to haue the
Lords of the Counſell remoued: to haue
way made for you to returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
eſtate to the dignities and regencie of
the lande. And why then doe you, that are
knowen to make this prayer, and to followe
your prayers with practiſes, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
make mention of them as a dutiful and
holy ſeruice towarde the Counſell. If the
things ye ſeeke by prayer &amp; otherwiſe, were
good, then the prayer &amp; enterpriſe alſo may
be good: but if ye aſke the thinges that are
euil, the praier is turned into ſinne: and you
finde, how true the wordes of Iames are,
concerning ſuch praiers and ſuch purpoſes,
you aſke,<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note> and receiue not. But howſoeuer
you pray or purpoſe, we in all trueth &amp; loue,
holde vp both our handes and heartes vnto
<pb facs="tcp:19858:31"/>
God for you, that are in darkenes and in the
ſhadowe of death, praying him in his deare
ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to caſt vpon you the
light of his countenance, that you may ſee &amp;
finde that righteouſnes which S.<note place="margin">Phil. 37. &amp;c.</note> Paul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
with the loſſe of al the other helpes &amp;
preeminences: namely, not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which was his owne, which is of the
lawe, but the righteouſnes which is of God
through faith. This is vnfeinedly our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and priuate praier for you, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
ſupplication, that God woulde make
vs all ſheepe of the ſame folde, whereof Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt alone is the great Paſtor.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10. 11. heb. 13. 20.</note> To
come againe to that which followeth in the

beyonde Sea,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ſhal not die.</hi> No more ſhall the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Antichriſt, til they and their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be brought into iudgement. <hi>As for the
vertue &amp; ſufficient knowledge which they
gather,</hi> I would know whether it be vertue
or knowledge that cauſe them in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to carie letters, &amp; to enter into ſedicious
matters priuilie: in other places to carrie
armes againſt her Maieſtie openly. Other
fruite of their abandoning the lande, &amp; great
ſtudies beyond ſea I heare of none, a fewe
<pb facs="tcp:19858:32"/>
motiues excepted. In the next wordes you
profeſſe better vertue, and more knowledge,
if the euil cauſe were not ſtil the ſame. For
in deede it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly gift of God in our
calling to deſpiſe the death of the bodie,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 17, 30</note> for
the life of their ſoules, whom otherwiſe we
cannot in our miniſterie bring to ſaluation.
But your cauſe tendeth not to the ſaluation,
but to the condemnation of thoſe whom you
carie away with your carnall worſhippings
and falſe doctrine. Moreouer it may be,
theſe are but wordes of a vaine bragge, as
hitherto appeareth. For albeit you woulde
ſeeme determined, <hi>vpon your league neuer
to giue ouer the Lords of the Counſel, but
either to winne them to heauen</hi> (as if now
they were loſt to hell) <hi>or to die vpon their
pikes:</hi> yet you that haue taried ſo long, from
ſo great a worke, tarie yet longer, making
no haſte to come to ſo good a match. Theſe
valiant &amp; reſolute ſouldiers vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes
banner of obedience appeare not: euen this
Campmaſter appeareth not. But it may be,
he hath withdrawen himſelfe, to write his
letters conſolatorie into Ireland, and backe
againe to Rome: and among other his large
offers, he mindeth to afforde vs this, that we
ſhall haue ſome time to prepare for ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb facs="tcp:19858:32"/>
a combat. To let this paſſe, that
which followeth, doeth ſhew his ſpirit. For
out it muſt with ful mouth and great ſound,
he can no longer keepe his own counſel. It
woulde be marked, and taken heede of, not
for feare of the matter, but to ſee the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the men. The ſocietie of Ieſuites pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
by their trumpet Maſter Campio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
make it knowen, <hi>that they haue all made a
league not to leaue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues aliue,
free from the honor of Stories Tiburne, or
conſumption in priſon, til they haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached
all the practiſes of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi> Feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wordes threatning paper ſhot. But the
weakenes of their force, taketh nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the greatneſſe of their malicious and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
purpoſe. For if their power were as
their purpoſe, ſee, I pray you, what an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
they would ſoone worke in this land!
Neuertheleſſe theſe Ieſuites that minde to
leaue no way, that they thinke may eſtabliſh
the beaſt, whom they worſhip, yet they vtter
this traiterous branch of the vnholy league,
as if it were no other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by preaching
to winne men to ſaluation. But I haue
largely ſhewed, that it is deſtruction that
they call ſaluation. Therefore to conclude
theſe matters, his purpoſe is with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
<pb facs="tcp:19858:33"/>
by al meanes to ſubdue men to the
Popes bondage: and in this piece of ſeruice
to preuayle, or to die vpon any daungers. A
great offer for ſo ſmall gayne: a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for ſo wretched a purpoſe. But if the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
report the concluſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> league true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when it is put in execution (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they wil flee more then we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
feare) it wil not go ſo ill with the Church of
God in England, as it will go wel with all
other Churches. For if all the Ieſuites in
the worlde bend their forces towarde Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and come to carie the croſſe, that here
ſhalbe layd vpon them, we ſhalbe ouerlayed
with thoſe ſwarmes of graſhoppers, except
the Lord prouide a mighty weſt wind to caſt
them violently into the Sea: but all other
Churches ſhalbe free from that plague. But
if anſwereably to our profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we remaine
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſrael of God, though Egypt be plagued,
yet there ſhalbe no complaining in the tents
of Iacob. After theſe bragges in words on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
howe readie they are in the planting of
Popiſh religion to die at Tiburne or in any
other torments, he ſheweth vs <hi>that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
is reckoned, the enterpriſe is begun.</hi>
To gather theſe matters, Firſt he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
a general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracie of al the Ieſuites
<pb facs="tcp:19858:33"/>
in the world (and they were not alone in the
decree) <hi>to die vpon our pikes,</hi> or to draw vs
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darily he forewarneth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitiuely,
<hi>that this their league, ſucceſſion
&amp; multitude, muſt ouerreach al the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of England:</hi> Thirdly that <hi>the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt is
made, &amp; the enterpriſe begun.</hi> In reſpect
of any thing theſe Ieſuites, or their adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
can doe, we haue no cauſe to feare at all, for
their rage ſhal turne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of God, who
wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his trueth, &amp; to get glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his name. But in reſpect of our ſinnes,
in not bringing forth fruites worthie of the
Goſpell, we may feare leaſt ſome of theſe
noyſome beaſts in their ſwarmes caſt ſome
ſhadow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tree of life. Touching thoſe
laſt wordes ſo playnely laying downe their
multitude, confederacie, threats and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
I leaue any further to examine them:
they are for an other examination, as draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neere the heart of the common wealth,
for the purpoſe and execution thereof. The
laſt wordes of this article are in ſound very
plauſible (as the reſt of his ſpeeches) preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
nothing but trueth in his falſe cauſe, &amp;
nothing but loue in his ſeditious pamphlet.
Therfore let them be examined. Speaking
of Popiſh religion, he ſayth <hi>it is of God.</hi> A
<pb facs="tcp:19858:34"/>
bare affirmation without any proofe. So in
all his letter he onely affirmeth, referring
vs to his credite: whereas men would rather
be caried w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reaſon. But his reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are to be
looked for, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he commeth to anſwere his
chalenge. Yet to anſwere him with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Poperie is not of God, for then it could
not haue receiued ſo great ouerthrowes, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the word of God. Neither was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
religion planted in blood, neyther is it
like (whatſoeuer is layd downe in bragges)
that in blood theſe Ieſuites or any other wil
reſtore it. Otherwiſe the wordes may haue
this true conſtruction: Popiſh religion was
planted in ſtrength, by ſheading the blood, &amp;
aboliſhing the doctrine of the Martyrs: &amp; in
like ſort they hope to reſtore it agayne. By
perſecutions it preuayled at the firſt, and by
perſecutions they looke to preuayle at the
laſt. But bleſſed be God that hath ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
vanitie of this hope, by ſhewing in our daies
that the blood of his Martyrs, whoſe godly
cauſe iuſtifie their godly death, is the ſeede
of the Church. France, Flanders, and our
owne countrey are wonderfull arguments
of this, if any man will deſcend into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the particulars. If the Lord

            <p>9 In the laſt place he aggreueth the fault

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
if they will not receyue that which he
doeth not offer. For, although his letters
be full of promiſes and verball offers, yet in
trueth and deede, he offreth nothing, no not
ſo much as theſe letters. They were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
abroade before any copie came to their
handes: ſo it appeareth, that as he meant
not to ſtand to the anſwere of his chalenge,
ſo he meant not ſo much as to ſende the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of chalenge, whyther he woulde haue
them thought to be directed. Now after all
ſtormes, and other outrageous actes in this
tragedie and imaginarie chalenge, the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite
hauing charged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords for their part,
<hi>if they reiect his offer, &amp; reward his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
and pilgrimage of many thouſande
miles with rigour:</hi> he for his part falleth to
a calme concluſion. Therein he promiſeth
(<hi>hauing no more to ſay) to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende our
<pb facs="tcp:19858:35"/>
caſe and his owne to Almightie God the
ſearcher of hearts, and prayeth that in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
we may be made friends.</hi> This prayer
if he will make from the heart, we alſo will
pray that through their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion God may
graunt it in Chriſt Ieſus. If he wil pray it
in loue and trueth, to that praier he ſhal haue
our Amen. But let euery man that ſpeaketh
well, meane accordingly, leaſt the ſearcher
of hearts finde out &amp; puniſh their hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
His laſt wordes ſomewhat touch the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſore, &amp; therefore muſt not be paſſed ouer
with ſilence. In being our remembrancer,
<hi>that in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all iniuries ſhalbe forgotten,</hi>
he couertly complaineth againe of iniuries.
The iniuries he ſuſteineth, he alone is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of. For what greater iniurie can be done
to another, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath done vnto himſelf? He
hath departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, left his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey,
&amp; refuſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> protection of a gracious Prince,
with many other honours &amp; felicities, as he
declared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt article. In him therfore,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of iniuries is vniuſt: but againſt
him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> complaint, not of iniuries alone, but
of ſeditions, of hereſie, &amp; of impietie is very
iuſt: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is to take heed hereafter vnto his
ſteps, leaſt, though <hi>al iniuries be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> yet for want of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſuch iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:19858:35"/>
receiue puniſhment in an other place.</p>
            <p>Therefore, briefly to ſee into al this matter
&amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, theſe letters of Ed. Campion
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſuite, which were caſt abroad w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
to comfort the Papiſts, &amp; ſweetely to
feed them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hope of a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt againſt
the religion, are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon examination to
ſound a falſe Alarme, hauing nothing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Papiſts to feede vpon, but vaine hope, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
to ſatiſfie a hart nouriſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reproches:
nothing to truſt vnto, but a broken reede, &amp;
that not yet in hand. Touching the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
the ſame libel hath nothing, that can
either ſtrike the leaſt feare into them, or caſt
the leaſt diſcredite vpon them, or their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Notwithſtanding againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts,
and for the Proteſtants, eſpecially thoſe in
place further to conſider it, the pamphlet
hath (beſide the vanitie) many points diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering
as well great miſchiefe intended
againſt her Maieſties peaceable and godly
gouernement, as againſt the heauenly and
moſt fruitful preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel. Which
miſchiefe notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the Lord our God
hath from time to time, and lately wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
diſappoynted, that the Papiſts which
will not heare what is taught out of the
worde, may ſee and conſider what the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:19858:36"/>
preacheth to them in thoſe his notable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and that we, both Prince &amp; people
ſo bleſſed of God, woulde with new ſongs
praiſe the Lord, who is euermore good to
Iſrael: the Lord, I ſay, whoſe mercie
and trueth endureth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth
for euer.
Amen.</p>
