         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In avouching these substantial Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, thou mayst, perhaps conceive, I have too severely reprehended the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists,</hi> to the Eclipsing the Illustrious Fame of such Learned Clerks, whom both Great and Small in all Ages have


<pb facs="tcp:37887:6"/>
Admired. To which I reply, I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied within my own Breast, that I have in no wise wronged them (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have me often-times) in laying to their Charge what they are not guilty of, being ready upon all fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, to demonstrate what I have here declared. Besides, so weighty and Precious is the Praedicate, or Subject we handle, that it would be an Offence more hainous in me above others, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering my Immortal Part, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious what Slaughter of Mankind is daily made by their Pseudo-Method of Curing, I should be silent, Indulge, Connive at, Extenuate, or Palliate such Capital Crimes: This considered, with their delight in the darkness of <hi>Galenical</hi> Falsities; also their Active, Obstinate Ignorance: Now, when the splendid Beams of Chymical Truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they deserve to be handled with far greater Rigour than I have expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

themselves as Candidly, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously to me as I to them, they would soon find me alter from an Acid to an Alkali Nature; from a Tart, to a sweet Disposition. If they would please to put me to the Tryal, they will find me really what I profess, a Lover of my King and Countrey, upon the Foundation of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Virtue; a Hater of Vice, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, Lewdness, all Irreligion in any whatsoever; a Resolute Promoter, to my Power, of all good Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, especially that of Healing Man's Infirmities; a Defender of Learning, and an Admirer of great Abilities and Integrity.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. A Brief Examination of the Original Matter of Natural Bodies, with their Dissolution.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall first declare what Nature is, according to our Philosopher; <hi>viz.</hi> A Power implanted in the Creature, to act in such a manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure according to the will of the Creator, for ends best known to himself. The Course and Order of producing Effects suitable to the


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37887:9"/>
first Seminal Cause, is constant, unless hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by cross Accidents intervening, or by some extraordinary stop put thereto by Him, who is the chief Mover of all Essences. I look upon the <hi>Materia Prima</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, a meer Chimaera. <hi>Galen</hi> and his Sectaries are much mistaken in delivering the Four Elements: <hi>Earth, Water, Aire, Fire,</hi> the Material Cause of all things: which being (as they say) variously mixt and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by power of an Active Form, bring forth Bodies of different Shapes, and Kind, one from another.</p>
               <p>The late Chymical Philosophers reject the former Opinion, and being frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in Opening all sorts of Bodies by the Fire (which they will by no means allow to be an Element) and meeting frequently with <hi>Salt, Sulphur, Mercury,</hi> have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently taught, that these are the Beginning Matter of all things tangible. Others add two more; <hi>i. e. Water</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> all which (as is Asserted) they can at their pleasure demonstrate, or lay open to View when they make Separations.</p>
               <p>This Discovery by Fire indeed seems far more plausible, and favourable for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Principles of all Bodies, than the former Conceit; yet, upon severe Search, it will not hold true. For as I have published


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37887:9"/>
in <hi>Haemati.</hi> directed by <hi>Helmonts</hi> Doctrine, these which they call Principles, are made by the Fire, not actually existent before in the Compound Body: Neither can <hi>Salt, Sulphur, Mercury</hi> be extracted by any Art whatsoever out of all things tractable. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, their unsteadfastness shews them to be no Principles, for they are easily changed one into another, contrary to the Nature of what ought to be the Beginning of things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his Doctrine taken from <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Valent.</hi> or <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> and trimly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished for Sale, is to be rejected, as being not only false in the first Instructions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Nature, but also dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive if made use of, according to what he hath delivered for the Cure of Diseases.</p>
               <p>Learned <hi>Helmonts</hi> discovery of <hi>Acidum, i. e.</hi> Sharp, of a binding rough Condition, and an Alkalie of a lixiviate smooth Nature, either volatile or fixed, having a property to scour or loosen, is by <hi>Tachenius,</hi> and some excellent Philosophers owned to be the best of Sensibles; whereby we can most experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, and effectually, derive the nighest Origination of all things endewed with a Corporeal Being: into which Acidum, and Alkali, Art is able to bring back the same. Besides these two Luminaries in Physick, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the clearest Directions for the Cure of the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37887:10"/>
worst Maladies; the only chief End, for which the upright Physitian is to put out himself: notwithstanding these (how specious soever Principles reputed) are not really so; for they as well as the former may be reduced into Water, which by the Authority of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> and my own Proof in some measure, I set down as the Principle, and Ultimate Matter, the Beginning, and End of all Elementarie Bodies.</p>
               <p>For according to the diversity of Ferments, the Activity of the Seminal Spirit, and the peculiar Image delineated by it, this Liquid Matter is moulded into those infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of various kinds of Creatures. This is that Abyss, or Deep on which the Spirit of God moved at first, now successively the Spirit of the World, which out of this never failing Treasure of Water, frames those innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Kinds of things obvious to our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Now of all Tangible Essences, Nothing is more similar or freer from Alloy &amp; Mixture than Water, nothing more capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, nor susceptible of a Seminal Spirit, and so easie to be brought to this or that Form.</p>
               <p>Hence 'tis manifest, there is not any thing chiefly more requisite for the production of all Corporeal Beings, than this Material Subject, namely Water: and an Efficient cause, <hi>viz.</hi> a Spirituous Seed working (by means of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37887:10"/>
or a certain Volatile, Spreading, Swelling, Chafing Scent) according as it frames that Idea, or Picture of the thing it intends to bring by degrees to Perfection: till which time, the same Agent (if not impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by some Accidents) which began makes a constant progress, till the whole be finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bringing it to the highest State; from whence, by little and little it declines, at length returning to that, from which it took its first Being.</p>
               <p>What I have here delivered, The sensible Seed of Animals, Plants and Minerals Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm: for they all consist of a Jelly-like Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, easily to be brought into Water.</p>
               <p>The Corporeal Seed of all Animals are as it were a Mucilage, or the White of an Egg: the Seed of all Vegetables may by digestion be turned into the like Consistence.</p>
               <p>As to Minerals, The best Inquirers into them affirm, that a certain green, glutinous, slimy Water flowing in peculiar places of the Earth, gives them their first Birth.</p>
               <p>So that an able Chymical Philosopher hath no reason to doubt what <hi>Helmont</hi> hath set down; to wit, that all Bodies have their Beginning from Water; that he could by means of his Liquor <hi>Alkahest,</hi> cause them to return again to the same.</p>

by an odorous Ferment peculiarly inherent in the Seminal Matter, or the place where it resides, invites such a portion of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Spirit (according as it is capable) to mould it by degrees into such a Species, or individual Being, proportionable to the Plat-form laid at first. (All outward Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies concurring.) Withal, as Concretes or Bodies are generated from VVater, so are they likewise chiefly nourished thereby: For the Experiment of our Philosopher confirms it thus.</p>
               <p>He took an Earthen Vessel, filling it with 200 weight of Earth dried in an Oven, in which, moistened with Rain-water, he set the Stem of a VVillow of five pound weight. This being for the space of five Years irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, was nourished only with Rain or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled water as there was need, (the vessel being covered over with a Plate of Tin full of holes lest any dust from without should fall into it) after five years growth the Plant put into the Scales, weighed 169 pound, besides the quantity of Leaves four years eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Autumn left out. Then at last he weighed the foresaid Earth dried, and it wanted of the former weight not above two ounces: upon this account 164 pound of VVood, Bark, and Root sprang from VVater alone. This Experiment of <hi>Van Helm.</hi> did that excellent

Searcher into Nature, the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, by the encrease of a Shrub kept a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time in VVater. The same VVater feedeth 40 distinct Plants growing on one bed.</p>
               <p>Also divers Animals do plainly arise from a waterish Matter: they are likewise preserved Principally therewith. In the Stomach of the <hi>Salmon</hi> is seldome any solid matter found: neither can the <hi>Sturgeon</hi> take into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach any gross matter for nourishment, the passage belonging thereto being so small, that scarse any thing but VVater can enter.</p>
               <p>Some Men and VVomen have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to live with VVater alone for many dayes.</p>
               <p>That Pretious and Viler Stones are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by VVater, and encreased by the same, is manifest, according to the Tryal of <hi>Van Helmont.</hi> Touching those Existents which the Chymists call Principles, they are not really such; for they have their rise from VVater, and may be specified, yea although they seem to be Singular, yet may they be severed into diversity of parts. <hi>E.

               <head>CHAP. III. Concerning the Aitiologie, Efficient, Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and Material Cause of all Diseases.</head>
               <p>WHat the Antients generally, and some at this day call the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, or immediate Cause of Diseases, I shall (with most knowing <hi>Helmont</hi>) assign to be the Occasional, Provoking, or Incensing. Forasmuch as, whosoever desires to enquire into the Nature of things aright, ought to be informed, concerning the very Being of the same, as it relates to that which made it so.</p>
               <p>Now no Disease can have any Subsistence, Mansion or Lodging place, but in a Body endued with a Vital Spirit (albeit in the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37887:13"/>
Dead the Four Humours of the <hi>Galenists,</hi> and the three Principles of the <hi>Chymists</hi> be not wanting.) For this Reason the Archeus or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit must of Necessity be the nighest Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Beginning of all Maladies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. For as our Health depends upon this Living Spirit, when it is in all respects duly constituted, without any considerable defect in it; so Sickness ariseth when the same Preserver of Strength, is depraved or estranged from that Clearness, Proportion, and Regularity, which ought to be in it. Those Degenerate, or Bastard Juices engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered through manifold Errors in the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montion</hi> six Digestions, especially the First, are only means to put the Living Spirit into Perturbation, Vexation, and Inordinate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby it frames Images of Evils, according to the Condition of the Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, Abusive Intruding Guest: So that in short, the Seed of this, or that Disease, with an absolute Pattern how it is to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is planted in this first Founder of the whole Fabrick: the Grief being as insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Vital Spirit, as Life it self; yea it is even concentrated or seated in the very middle point thereof, and never to be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therefrom, till the Kernel, wherein this Diseased Image is drawn, be extinct, and quite abolished.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:37887:13"/>This Doctrine may seem strange to those, who are unacquainted with the Writings of our Profound Philosopher; however so great is the Truth thereof, that 'tis impossible any one should either Prevent or Cure Diseases to a purpose, unless he be well Disciplined in this Solid Knowledge. Hence it is that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionative Doctors do so often blunder and mistake in Healing any Rooted Infirmities; because they either insist upon their four <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian</hi> Elements and Humours, Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to them, as Choler, Phlegm, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Blood, with the Distemper coming from thence, or take their false Measure of Curing from the Principles (I mentioned before) borrowed of the Chymists, which some will have to be the next Cause of Diseases; whereas they being present, only vex, gaul, bring into divers Passions, the Archeus: whereupon that which before did perform all things requisite in the Body, decently and in order, is now become tumultuous, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an inconvenient preposterous manner. By this means the Ferment or Dissolvent in the Stomach produces many Raw Juices, Fretting Liquors, which congeal the Blood, or melt it into filthy Matter, then follows a detention of Excrements, or a profuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet throwing out good and bad; also a Specifick Poison is created proportionable to


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37887:14"/>
those without: hence a Crowd of sad Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms appear. Wherefore I repeat, the great cause why the <hi>Galenists</hi> have been so unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful in their Curing is, because they did not truly distinguish between Prevocative, Occasional, and the Essential inseparable Cause between the Concomitants, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Products, and Consequents of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Calamities.</p>
               <p>For while they conclude a Feaver to be principally Heat, they have thereby taken a false Indication or Instructions, to free the Body from that Affliction; neglecting to blot out the Image of the Sickness, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the enraged Vitals, and to remove the Vexatious, Thorny, Degenerate, Dead Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without empairing Nature, wronging the Stomach, or offering any Violence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shop ordained for Digestion. They may plainly perceive (if Sordid Gain did not blind them) 'tis labour in vain to Purg Bucketfuls of Choler, and Melancholy, (which they suppose to be the Conjunct united Cause of the Evil) to let out great quantity of Blood from the Limbs for the Cure of the Scurvie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sith generally the Patient is more weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and his Evil oftentimes more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereby. Assuredly did they set Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Legs, when she is either sitting, or prostrate under any Calamity, she would


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37887:14"/>
soon conquer her Enemy, which kept her in Subjection. Would they but follow <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who taught them that <hi>Naturae sunt Morborum Medicatrices,</hi> they would speedily renounce Bleeding, and Feeble, Hurtful Purgatives, to be looked upon as Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Factors of filthy Matter, which the Expulsive Power stirred up, casts out with the Poison: So that in reality, the Common Way of Purging is only like Pumping, without stopping the Leak. For as <hi>Hippo.</hi> delivers, 'tis not how much, but what is cleansed away doth good; the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional, Exciting, Peccant, Fermenting Matter being often very small as to its bulk.</p>
               <p>Humane Sickness hath a Spiritual begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Progress, State, and Declination, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from a Seed, as all other things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have a Real Entity, consisting of an Efficient and Material Cause, both seated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the Spirit of Life, Active and Passive in Contriving its own Ruine, when at any time it is disturbed through any outward Accident. When any thing very injurious to Nature approaches from without, or is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered within our Bodies, the Archeus, or Vital Aire takes notice of it, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed, it frames in it self some Ill-favoured Dark Images, agreeable to the Cause Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. According to this Model or Proportion


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37887:15"/>
it Acts, never ceasing to follow the Copy or Draught of the Malady made by its own Activity, in a certain determinate quantity of it self, even to its own great damage and destruction, unless the Character of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease be blotted out, or the Archeus pacified; and diverted by some pleasing Object, or the External Vexing Occasion removed.</p>
               <p>Those Defunct Excrements, or Superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties separated from Life, never to be rconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, are most tedious and noisome to the Vital Spirits: wherefore becoming impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they Rage, Fret, Chafe at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of so unwelcome Guests. Hereupon they stir upon the Ferments, or Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Transfigurators, to become disordered, sometimes to cause a Confusion, Tumult, Boiling, and Huffing in the Juices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Feaver is kindled; sometimes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Congelation of the Blood, otherwhile to turn it into sharp gauling Liquor, causing many long Calamities.</p>
               <p>Now the Filth or Dregs lodging in our Bodies, are not Diseases themselves, but stir up the Archeus to create those Evils, we are liable to. These are either Antecedent Causes of our Maladies; or they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, and Consequents, stirring up Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Calamities, accompanied with various Symptoms, Accidents, Dispositions, and


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37887:15"/>
Alterations. Moreover, the Miseries of our Bodies, do now and then begin from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, Immaterial Occasion, imprinting in our Phansies, a lively Character of a Disease, which converting the Good Juices into Bad, both Foment the present Evil, also excite the Vitals to procreate more Mischiefs through the Contagion of a Seed implanted in the Life.</p>
               <p>That the Phansie can out of a <hi>Non Ens,</hi> or Nothing, frame <hi>Hoc Aliquid,</hi> or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this or that Species, is evident in Women with Child, who upon earnest longing after Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or some sudden Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, make the Idea, or Figure of what they greatly Covet, or are terrified at in their Spirits, which conveied to the Womb, is absolutely conformed in that part of the Child, which answers to the place, the Woman at that instant touched, when she was so passionately affected. Withal, this Plant or Living Creature pictured in the Skin, shall express all those remarkable Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Defections, Vigour, and Matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Real Type, or Example of what is shaped is subject to, at certain times of the year.</p>
               <p>Thus 'tis plain, that the Spirits being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, excited, or put into a vehement Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through any notable Passion can fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37887:16"/>
that, (bringing it to visible Light on the Superficies of the Skin) which before lay hid within.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I doubt not there is as perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous a Signaturi of every Disease in the Spirits, as the Platform of the Plant to be produced in a Bean divided. The Principle Difference being, that the one is more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, the other Corporeal.</p>
               <p>The Seminal Figure then of all Diseases made in the Spirit of Life is, the only Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Active Cause of their Being.</p>
               <p>Likewise some Degenerate Portion of the Spirit, wherein the Calamitie is as it were stamped (separated from that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in its Integrity) becomes the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subject thereof.</p>
               <p>That 'tis the Blast of Life which conceives and brings forth all manner of Evils is most evident, seeing no Dead Body is capable of Sickness; this being the true only Reason to be given, that the Principal Contrive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Archeus or Vital Spirit is wanting.</p>
               <p>For the Forbidden Fruit which <hi>Adam</hi> took into his Stomach, having a Power inserted into it of stirring up Lust, or Concupiscence (The Omnipotent for that Reason giving Advertisement to Man not to meddle with) was appropriated; and applicated by means


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37887:16"/>
of the Animal Spirits to the Immortal Soul; whereby it presently sets up Images of filthy Diseases, forthwith entertaining the Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Soul common to all Beasts; being then, so continuing to this day the Fundamental Cause of all Calamities.</p>
               <p>I assert; the Irregular Imagination of the Living Spirit of Man in the Stomach, chiefly the Brain, and every Part besides, doth first set on work every Infirmity seizing upon us; which at first seems very inconsiderable, but in process, through the uncessant Motion of the First Mover, it arrives to a great Height of Malignity, as appears by various sad Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Accidents, and Products to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished precisely from the Substantial Being of Diseases.</p>
               <p>For Example, A Stone in the Kidneys, Bladder, or elsewhere, likewise any congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Matter, or Cancrous hollowness are not Diseases, but the Products, Effects, or Fruits thereof. The Petrifying Imaginary Seed, closely seated in the Archeus, is that which first laid the Foundation of the Stone, carrying the same on, as it began, to full growth: so that although the Stone be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the Kidneys, as long as there remains that stonifying Seed, or invisible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the Person before rid of this hard Concretion, may ere long (if the Idea, the


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37887:17"/>
Principle of the Congealing be not absolutly brought to naught, or blotted out) be vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tortured or crucified with the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Matter again.</p>
               <p>That the Archeus should be put into such a disturbance or Passion through any disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to frame within its own Bowels such a dreadful, unhandsome Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is to be lamented, but that the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Character of the Stone should be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, fomented, born with us, taking deep root, as we grow up, is far more deplorable.</p>
               <p>For Diseased Seminal Ideas derived from the Matrice are hardly to be razed out: they are so incorporated with our Constitutes, challenging as great priviledge to act their part upon the Stage of this Little World in an uniform Manner, and Dress; though depraved, as Nature in its Integrity, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wholsome Images, performs all things orderly, according to just proportion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Rules of Sanity.</p>
               <p>At that very time, when the chief Author moulds the Seed, containing the shadowed Likeness of what is to be made capable of a perfect Form, doth the same Workmaster draw the Pourtraiture of those manifold Mischiefs, which happen to Body and Mind many years after. So fixed are those Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Miseries, that although the whole Mass


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37887:17"/>
of every Numerical Part of the Body be changed again and again, yet the Radical Tincture or dye of the Congenite Disease shall remain, ready to put forth it self, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, spread into various Branches, and Fruits, when the full time is come that it meets with an Outward Cause to stir it up.</p>
               <p>This is demonstrable in the Gout, the Stone, Consumption, Madness, Small Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whose Images for some years lie as it were asleep, till they be roused up through some Provocative Occasions.</p>
               <p>The Idea's of Evils, which the Archeus contrives when we are come out of the Womb abroad in the open Aire are flitting, may easily be blurred, wiped off by a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Figure: these often interfeering each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at length clash together, and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come annihilated.</p>
               <p>Infinite are the Number of Idea's or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations made by a Working Phansie, some of which are no sooner framed, but strait vanish, becoming <hi>Non Entia:</hi> for they are momentany, and easily thrust out by the next Successour. But when any Object shall often savourly and seriously affect us; then the Representation of the same doth take deep Roots in the Spirit, altering the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Blood, Latex or Lympha; so that according to the Species of the Immoderate


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37887:18"/>
Passion, and the Picture thereof drawn either in the Innate Archeus, or that continually repaired, different Accidents, Symptomes, Signs and Effects arise.</p>
               <p>That all Diseases have a Type, Copy, or Example set, (according to which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus that first moulded it, acts) may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Uniformity, Regular Motion, Inseparable Appearances or Signs belonging to them, from which they receive a Name proper to their Nature: Those tell us of what kind the Sickness is, insomuch a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Physitian is able as well to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, between one Maladie and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as between a Pippin and a Pearmain; an Almond and a Chesnut; likewise to sort them into several Kinds, Classes, Forms, Degrees; a thing never to be done, if there were not a certain Director, Informer, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> first Mover, that laid a Platsom of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Grief, depending upon an Efficient and Material Cause, as all other Sublunaries.</p>
               <p>Again that the Archeus doth first make a draught of the Evil in self, working after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accordingly to its own Hurt or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, may be proved by that Intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Silence, we find in Feavers, Falling-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Gout, Stone, Convulsions Tissick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which as it were sleep for some time, then awake, repeating their former Tragical

Act exactly. Certainly if there were not an Agent lead by a strict Rule, it were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble such a constant Mode and Method could be observed in the Beginning, Progress, Height, Declension, and Determination of Maladies.</p>
               <p>Briefly therefore the true Efficient with the Material Cause of all Diseases is, not any Distemper of the Elementary Qualites, not any of the supposed four Humours derived from the four Elements, not <hi>Salt, Sulphur, Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. not any thing meerly Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious, Vexatious, Ambient: but the Vital Spirit stirred up to Indignation, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by some loathsome tedious Object pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: whereupon it makes the very shape, planting the Seed of the Maladie in some Portion of that Aetherial Blast, separated from that in Integrity: upon which Matter, as a Patient, the Seminal Ideal Agent works shooting forth those Manifold Fruits or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in Sickness.</p>

This Noble Part is with Care and Tenderness to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected above any other: for this purpose nothing is to be taken, offending it, either in Quality or Quantity. Neither is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Quality of any Nourishable, to be insisted upon so much, as the just Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we are to observe: for if the Stomach earnestly desire what is generally Reputed to

be hard of Digestion, or to afford bad Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; notwithstanding if there be an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Appetite to the same, this Noble Part is to be indulged, or favoured in such a Case; only allowing a lesser Quantity. Doubtless this most sensible Membrane, of Exquisite Gust doth for the most part best prompt u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to what is for the Good of the whole: so that giving a Repulse or Check to a vehement Appetite, hunting after any thing eatable, or drinkable, we oftentimes cause a cloudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, dulness, sullenness, and darkness in the Vital Spirits, bringing them into such a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they Coin many foul, black Images, whereas, if the Archeus of this eminent Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle were gratified and humoured, in what it extreamly desires, there would be a sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and lustre in the Spirits, and then al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The severity of some Physitians in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Patients to eat that to which their Appetite is exceedingly addicted, hath caused no small discommodity. Neither do they less offend who strictly impose upon them such a Diet, as they, according to some ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules, apprehend most fitting, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from bare Qualities of Heat and Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not considering that in all Diseases, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially those of long duration, enquiry ought to be made to what Diet the Sick is

most naturally inclined to, and accustomed, what his Gust doth best relish, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that account to grant him some small Portion of what he eagerly covets, although usually reckoned amongst Food of hard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, of ill juice, of bad quality, or very Hot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For none can give better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Diet, more proper for the satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Appetite, than a Man himself, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be of years, carefully taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what doth most agree with the Genius of his Stomach.</p>
               <p>I have known Posset-drink, out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to cool, prescribed by some Doctors, Humorists, (without farther Examination of an Antipathy thereto) even to the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the Life, in Malignant, ill-condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Feavers. Such Darkness hath forthwith seized upon their Spirits, and such Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some foul Shapes have been delineated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: that they have approached the shadow of Death, undoubtedly perishing, had not prevalent Art blotted out speedily those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Figures. So hazardous it is to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what Nature doth most Sympathize with, or to offer what it bears an inbred Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to. This certainly is to be known by a Mans own Experience, whether he have an absolute dislike to Honey, an Egg, Sider, any Spice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:37887:21"/>For this Reason (methinks) 'tis great vanity in those, who will undertake to be Magisterial, and over-rule Persons in Diet, more able to judge of this Matter than Physitians: who presume, no less ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously, than ignorantly, to enjoyn <hi>Iohn, Thomas, William,</hi> the same Food, Order, Season, and Measure, of taking it alike, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having respect to any Individual or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Stamp made upon the Spirits in the Womb, whence <hi>Qot Homines, Tot Diaetae observendae:</hi> As many Men as there are in the World, so many inseparable Properties are to be indulged as to the election of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking this or that.</p>
               <p>If our <hi>Galenical</hi> Physitians (who stand so much upon their bare Qualities of Heat and Cold in the Cure of Griefs, according to the Rule of Contraries, directing them as they say, but upon false grounds, to extinguish one by another) did rather aim at the Cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and blotting out these perverse, deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, crooked Impresses or Characters born with us, and in process growing up to such a height, insomuch that they become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable, Mortals would certainly enjoy both a sounder Body and Mind, be free from Melancholy, enjoying far more clearness of Spirit.</p>
               <p>I am Confident that the Stomach, whose


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37887:21"/>
Digestive properly is utterly estranged by a Feaver, or long Imbecillity, being whetted by a strong affection may alter a Red-her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Oysters, a Lobster, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> better than Veal, Chicken, Broth, Gellies, or any such contrived Cookeries. Therefore to urge the Sick to Eat Sodden, when he lusts after Roasted; or Liquid, when he requires Solid, is to cross Nature, supposed either can be made fit for nourishment.</p>
               <p>In all those states wherein I find the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Person's Stomach uncapable to make a formal chang of the Food, for want of a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ferment or Dissolvent (as for Example, in all Feavers, and very ill habits of Bodies) there I generally injoyn the best Liquors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with good Spirits, easily to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Vitals, leaving no considerate foulness or dross behind (the watrish part entering into the Vessels carrying off some Superfluities it meets with, by Urine and Sweat) so that my Practice hath taught me many years what <hi>Hippo.</hi> hath delivered, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius est refici potu quum cibo.</hi> The Vital steam is with more speed refreshed, and longer maintained by Spirituous Liquors, than by Flesh, or its Juices, which for want of, a Living Dissolvent, requisite for this chief Cook-room, become Degenerate, Dead, and stinking; whereupon a Feaver is added

               <p>No less Mischievous is the <hi>Galenical</hi> Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Cooling Liquors in Feavers, <hi>viz.</hi> their Maukish, Spiritless, Dull, Flat Posset-drink, Small-beer, Barly-water, loathsome Decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of cooling crude Herbs, Pippin Liquors, and the like, which starve the Vital Spirit, bringing a numness upon it, that it cannot do any thing effectually for the expulsion of its Enemy: They likewise wedge in the ill Juices, so that either Nature is totally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, yielding to its Fate, or led Captive

               <p>Whosoever then falls into a Feaver, or any other Calamity, I advise him (upon Fundamental Trials made many years) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the aforesaid poor Starvling Liquors, to apply himself to the drinking of that, which will enable the Archeus strongly to resist its Enemy, to frame benign, clear, lightsome Imaginations tending to Health, to subdue the detestable filthy Matter, holding no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Life, by Sweat, Urine, Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Vomiting, or Stool: Yet still let Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration be the Guide in all things, for the most Commendable things may be abused, witness those to whom I allowed to drink now and then a Glass of Sack in a high Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who unadvisedly fortewith poured down a whole Quart-bottle to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
               <p>As I never forbid any in a Feaver good Strong Liquors, to quench Thirst, to strengthen the Stomach and Spirits: So I admonish all to make use of Temperance: Neither do I prohibit Broaths, Collises, Eggs in any Maladie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon any other account, but that they become corrupt in a Stomach, whose Ferment cannot turn them into a nourishable Juice.</p>

Also the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Haemorrhoides or Piles opened are to be indulged: for the draning of these, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle frication to and fro with a Tuft of Grass, when the Fundament is open, is of singular use where there is any propensity in Nature to evacuate foeculent, fretting blood, from the Mesentary or Spleen; I look upon this as a most noble Emunctory to disburden each. Neither ought a supurfluity of Seed to be kept too long in peculiar Bodies, especially if there be danger it may contract an ill odour to the Annoyance of the Kidneys, Spleen, Head: for seeing the Testicles have no small influence upon the parts tending to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, if they be in their right Tone, certainly then if out of order they dart hurtful beams to the notable damage of that Organ where they lights.

               <p>THe third Diaetetical necessary Support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a happy life, and Restorer of it


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37887:28"/>
when impaired, is good Aire, which if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the Lungs is as welcome to it, as some Food to a rightly disposed Stomach. What Famous Cures holsome Air, with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters, have effected, is well known to those, whom the <hi>Galenists</hi> have left as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparate: for whereas they at first upon a false Supposition that the Air did chiefly conduce to the cooling of the Heart, and explosion of Fuliginous Particles generated from excessive Heat, did take their Indication of cooling more or less according as any Febrile Disease did invade the Patient (but all in vain having exhausted both the Strength and Purse of the Sick Person) thus missing a sanative End, they at length study to find out some pure Aire, to which they commit the Patient, although often too late to be Cured) yet is he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beyond expectation revived (even to their astonishment) who are ignorant of the true cause thereof. For those Coagulations, dreggy grosness in the Blood (rather augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than diminished by faeculent Medicaments Enemies to the Stomach) are by the subtil Ambient dissolved, rarefied, volatilized and sent packing without any filthy settling left behind. Hereby the Stomach recovers its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, and the Blood runs freely in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Channels, so powerful is the Air with the Ferments to refine the Juices, attenuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37887:28"/>
all tenacious Matter residing in them, or lurking about the Spleen or Stomach, whose Appetite and Digestion are much advanced or depressed, according as the Ambient is Thin or Thick, Defaecated or Dreggy. This great Separator of Moisture doth in some places so rarefie and consume the solid Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mans Body, that although he eat plentifully, Quadruple to what he doth at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times in some Regions, yet shall he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in perfect health, obtaining the same weight of Body, he had some weeks before: (few visible Excrements in comparison of those insensibly dissipated to be discovered.)</p>
               <p>This is the happy effect of subtil, fresh, well clarified, often changed, cold, piercing Aire, grateful to the Lungs: on the other side, where this Ambient is gross, restagnant, stuffed full of foul corpuscles, to which one is confined, misty or foggy, many discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of Health ensue, as dull Appetite, In digestion, crudities, contamination of the of the Blood, flatness, heaviness of the Spirits, depravation of the Ferments, whence troops of Diseases invade us.</p>
               <p>Where the Atmosphere is well qualified, and constituted, men enjoy length of days, as well as at present a sound Body, where 'tis otherwise disposed, the thread of Life is shortned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37887:29"/>In general, the Aire destitute of Noisome Exhalations from the Earth and endued with Benevolent Influences from the Heavens is profitable for the Lungs. In particular, that Air chiefly concerns the preservation from Sickness, and the Restauration of Sanity, which doth best agree with the Individual, whose approbation comes from Experience. For there is a Natural appetite in the Lungs of some, to embrace this or that Air above another, as it is inhaerent in the Stomach to be affected with certain peculiar kinds of meat.</p>
               <p>Where the Aire is culpable, Art ought to amend it, which is done by imitating Nature, ventilating it when restagnant, heating and subtillizing it by good Fires when 'tis cold or gross, consuming or putting to flight stinking Particles by the diffusion of acceptable good Odours. If the Air abound with excessively <hi>Acid,</hi> or foul <hi>Nitrosulphurious Atoms</hi> it is to be rectified with the breath of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <hi>Askali's</hi> and the Fumes of well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>Sulphurs.</hi> By this means many Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may be prevented, and in some sort cured.</p>

of, A probable hope of some good not long to be deferred, at length a sweet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which is durable, and capable to usher in better things: For I am of a very brave Man's Opinion; The Comfort of our whole Life depends upon expectation of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things. Also Magnanimity or Courage founded upon Virtuous Enterprizes, aspiring to Noble Designs, for a Publick as well as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interest, do sweetly enlarge the Spirits, quickning the Ferments, causing an expulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Superfluities: Yea just Indignation, kept within its due Limits, facilitates Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Transpiration and Pulsation.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, Fear, Sorrow, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hatred, Jealousie, Envy contract the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphragme, and the Muscles of the Breast, hindering legitimate breathing, occasioning an Immature Importunate Systole, or a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine Connivence in the Arteries.</p>
               <p>It is not amiss sometimes to be transported beyond the common bounds of Moderation; to be agitated with some Extraordinary passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, and to sustain tedious Labor, that the sweeter composition of Mind, and most delightful rest of Body may follow; sith one constant strict tenor pertaining to Diet is hardly to be obtained, without greater damage, whensoever we offend, not to be avoided by any Man, who hath a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

               <p>I advise those parts should undergo most gentle Exercise, which are weakest; to walk oftner upon the lower Limbs when they are somewhat feeble; to move rather the Arms and Hands when incident to a debility, lest the stronger by motion defraud the weaker, and so <hi>Alogotrophia</hi> or disproportion in the nourishment of parts follow.</p>
               <p>I approve Frication of all parts, especially three noted Emunctories; the Groin, Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and Neck with a course Cloath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out curious superstition of rigtht oblique or transverse Directions.</p>
               <p>Combing the Head every Morning is an exercise profitable for the Brain and upper Limbs encreasing their vigour and opening the Pores for the emission of Excrements en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the sixt Digestion, which is not a little depraved by a superfluous covering, so that the Brain through too much Heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Effeminate, Soft and Imprudent.</p>

On the other side, how Hot and Dry have I known some Phlegmatick Bodies in Feavers, even beyond Cholerick? In this Case, how, without contradiction to their Theorems, can they without lethiferous Mistakes, give cooling things, for the encrease of Phlegm, and Hot for the advancement of Choller: were not this to augment the cause of the

Is not this rather the very strait course to relieve the misaffected, to exempt the Thorn or Splinter out of the Finger? the Mote &amp; Fragment of Class out of the Eye by proper Instruments? also to attenuate, rarifie Phlegm, to mitigate, Edulcorate, Retund and alter Choller, by what is adaequated opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for the ablution, abstersion, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away both. <hi>Sospite Stomachi ac Naturae robore,</hi> through all the most requisite Sluces of the Body.

               <p>By reason of ignorance herein, those at first great applauders of <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> for his profound knowledg in Metallurgie, have Apostatiz'd from his sincere Doctrine of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the most Contumacious Maladies, by those compact Sulphureous Bodies, vaunting that they were furnished with Vegetable and Animal Preparations every way able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the most Monstrous Diseases in Nature with as much certainty activity, as the best instituted Metaline, or Mineral Sulphurs. This the Author of <hi>Vita Sana &amp; Longa</hi> (I heard) asserted to the great disparagement of this Science, and to the discovery of his evident weakness in Pyrotechnie.</p>
               <p>We dare Practically affirm for the defence of our Philosophy, that the exalted Sulphurs, derived from these most solid Concretes, do generally far transcend in Iatrical excellency, either Vegetable or Animal, whensoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fixed Disease comes to be eradicated, able to elude the best parts extracted out of Plants or living Creatures: yea I aver (challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one of a contrary mind to the test thereof) that the Provision we make for the Cure of our Griefs, by means of this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Subterranea,</hi> is every jot as safe, but of far more generous Issue than any desumed from the superficies of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Well then, if this be true, let us in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner put out our selves in the indaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that pretious Pharmacy which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath with great care shut up in these close solid Bodies. <hi>Qui vult nucleum nucem frangat.</hi>

They may make momentany Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and rarefaction of the massie, close hard, firm Constitution of Gold taking into their bosome, and there obsconding from the eye, those small Pulviscles: yet for as much as no real dissolution is made, the dissolvent upon the contact of what is more desired, leaves the lacerated particles of Gold to it self, easily capable without the loss or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of its Substance, to be reduced to the same ponderous solid constant matter it had before. Now the reason why it is so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to separate a pure Tincture from Gold, arises from the Ignorance of destroying it; <hi>quod, qui novit Aurum destruere, noverit itidem construere,</hi> saith <hi>Van Helmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these alterations it undergoes by usual Corrosives, moist, or dry, are but disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses put upon this <hi>Solar</hi> Concrete. 'Tis not a harsh, boisterous, precipitate course, can make it yield a Tincture, but a calm, mild, mollifying, indulging, familiar means, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a parity with it's Nature, will so work upon this <hi>Solar</hi> Genius, that it is prone to expire it's Soul or Sulphur.</p>
               <p>The Menstruum to be made choice of, must be of a Sulphureous Nature, upon which Gold hath a Friendly aspect. This


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37887:59"/>
Liquor can insinuate into the close Compage of this Metal sweetly Elicitating a splendid Tincture.</p>

The way of reserating the Body of Gold by long Triturtion, that the Acid Air may insinuate into it, and dissolve, is a rare Invention.</p>

               <p>If these Catharsists were Legitimate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples of a Master so excellently well Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Healing, they would never thus promiscuously exclude good and bad Juices, by their colliquating Solutives, without any

               <p>The miserable Experience of Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Purgatives, taken into my own Body, the space of Seven or Eight Years, without any solid Cure, taught me that the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Catharticks of the Dispensatory often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

carry off peccant Juices, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, making as much as they discharge, wronging the Ferments, weakning the Tone of the Stomack, forcing Nature to move a way contrary to the stream of her own <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And when at any time there succeeds any Redress after plentiful Evacuations by this means, it is by Accident in Robust Bodies, where the Disease is trivial, Nature stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon her own Leggs, the Vessels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable; also an Impetuous motion in the Matter attenuated, ready upon an easie Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be sent packing. However this Exploit will not Nobilitate a Physitian, or his Art, seeing (take one time with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) this way doth double the mischief to the Good.

               <p>For all that, let me give a Caution to those, who without scruple swallow down

               <p>Neither do I charge their own proper Emeticks, or Catharticks, as Malefactors, but I moreover accuse those they have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of the vulgar Chymists, <hi>viz.

For I can prove it in the General Impossible ex Facto (if I were put to it) that any but the Legitimate Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, can Relieve, or Cure Uterine Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities safely, gratefully, effectually, and speedily. The truth of what I here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver time will make perspicuous.</p>
            <p>When I was first called to this Science of Physick, I was Advised to apply my Studies in especial manner to the Art of Midwifery, which I easily listned to, being captivated with considerable gain amounting thereby, apprehending it principally a Manual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not difficultly to be attained. But my modesty, and second thoughts of aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a more ample Knowledge in Physick, took me off. And well it so happened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Divine Providence, sith had I insisted upon that Subject, I had neither been any whit an Experienced Physitian, nor skilful in the Feat of obstetricating. For I plainly discovered afterward, that to

            <p>Wherefore the accomplished Chymist, who can Vindicate his Analeptica, Antipy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reta, Antihysterica, and Anodyna far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending the <hi>Galenical</hi> Preparations in all stubborn Maladies whatsoever, ought to be especially consulted with, when sorrows of bringing forth infest the Miserable Woman.

I say, the more these Chymicophants have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sink down this Noble Remedy, the more it hath sprung up, and flourished to their grand shame: Yea, I dare averr upon Reasonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental grounds, this Polyacea will be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Posterity one of the best Medicines for it's general Utility to the Life of Mortals, Innocent Nature, Pleasant Gust, and easie purchase that ever yet came to light. He that will may read the just Vindication of it, Published formerly, none of my Adversaries daring to oppose it openly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a tergo sneakingly below a Generous Man.</p>
            <p>What Excellency I have here Attributed to it, rather comes short, than transcends it's desert. This Medicine is not with little Labour Fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being brought over in Glasses above twenty several times, and digested many days.

            <p>It exceedingly strengthens the Stomack, helps it's Digestion, encreaseth and maketh Active the Vital Spirits, and their Instruments by which they work (called Ferments) rectifies the Spleen, scatters and expels Wind, Vapours, or any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring wild Spirit, which flies in a moment from one place to another, vexing the parts.

It also causeth Urine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Gravel from the Kidneys, hindring that it may not be engendred and fixed. It is helpful in difficulty and pain of making Water, coming forth sometimes by drops. 'Tis of great Service against pains of the side, the Colick, Griping of the Guts. It is a very great Cordial, preserving from fainting, and restoring those who are surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with loss of Vital Spirits. It is very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to keep one from, and to Cure Surfeits. It is very powerfully good against the Scurvy, or any poysonous, ill-conditioned, infectious Evils. It prevents, and helps to Cure all kind of Feavers. It quencheth the Thirst to an Admiration, above all supposed cooling things whatsoever.</p>
            <p>It bringeth Preternatural heat or coldness to a due moderation, by removing the Efficient Cause thereof, reducing the parts to their former strength. It is available against Fits of the Mother; the Whites. It dissolves Congealed, Curdled Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ripeneth raw Juices, bringing them either to a better Condition for the Use of Nature, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them to be sent packing out of the Body, by convenient ways and Medicaments. It abates a nauseons Disposition, or Vomiting, by confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Membranes of the Stomack, and by promoting the throwing off that which disturbs it. It cutteth, and cleanseth away slimy Birdlime-like Flegm, giving ease in difficulty of Breathing, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating the violence of the Tissick.

            <p>I cannot but experimentally commend it as one of the best asswagers of the pain of the Teeth, I have hitherto met with. It is also of great force to preserve them from corruption, likewise in part to restore them; resisting the putrifaction of the Gums.</p>
            <p>Neither is it to be contemned for the mitigation of the pains of any part, strengthning and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Vital Spirit thereof.</p>

They prevent the Stone, and carry off Gravel. They sweeten sharp Liquors in the Body. They overcome the Venereal or foul Disease, if taken a considerable time: neither is it to be suspected, that one may be weakned by the long frequent use of them; for they, contrary to other purging Concretes, make one more lusty and vigorous, as I have found in my having taken many thousands of them with an advancement of my strength. They reform the Spleen; help to cure Feavers, prevent relapses and long Maladies.</p>
            <p>They may be swallowed at any time of the day or night; neither will they cause injury, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit, if they loosen not the body in twenty four hours, which is rare, for usually they give a stool or two in that space.</p>
            <p>The Dose is two or three Pills a little before Supper, or early in the Morning. The Patient proceeding thus for three or four days, and resting a day or two, and then repeating them.</p>

            <p>In my Minority I have been a little amazed to hear the Religion of Physitians indifferently, yea, slightingly, Ironically spoken of: So that I have not without some indignation, Vindicated it; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading my self, that there were many, who, like Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> were able to assert it practically. But coming to greater Maturity in the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Things, I found, for the most part, that really True, which before I apprehended was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately spoken by the vulgar. For I dare averr, if a Man may judge of a Tree by it's Fruits, or of the Nature of any Corporeal Existent by Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Impresses, and Accidents, Products, Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, and Effects; so certainly may a Man censure most of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Tribe, sitting to be Ranked among <hi>Plato</hi>'s Classes of Atheistical, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Wretches; not only Poysoning others by their Deletery, virulent, intoxicating Physick, but also by their <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>How in Truth can it be otherwise, sith their


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37887:102"/>
Minds are Corrupted by their malignant Physick, Through the want of a True Benign mundifier of their Vitals.</p>
            <p>Besides, how is it possible they should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in the least mith a Deity, who are so grosly ignorant of the Aitiologie of things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Needs must they be stone Blind as to any right apprehension of an Omnipotent Creator, a Wise Supporter, Disposer; and Governor of all things: Sith their Understanding is so extremely to seek concerning the Material, Efficient Cause of all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Beings. How can they who are so much mistaken concerning the Essence of Fire, approach him infinitely transcending any consuming Fire.) How is it possible they should have any Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Father of Lights, who know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light be Accident or a Substance. Had they been better acquainted with Nature, the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all things, would have Communicated himself more clearly. Now, sith they have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinded themselves through Vile Interest, at the presence of that which is obvious to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, 'tis but just they should continue in Cimmerian Darkness, without the true Discovery of things invisible. It hath been a Curse upon the <hi>Galenists</hi> 1600 Years, not to be capable to Cure Radicated Diseases, because they slighted him who is the great Healer of all our Infirmities, <hi>Nam Deus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avit Medicum non Homo.</hi> This considered, 'tis no wonder they are thus accused of Atheism.</p>
            <p>If so, the only way to make them Religious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes, and to bring them to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is to convince them of their Errors in Philosophy, to demonstrate how miserably they are out of the way of Curing their own, as well as others Evils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:37887:102"/>What imperfect, yea hurtful means they use to remedie their own <hi>Laesam Imaginationem</hi> by Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tabefying, Colliquating, Carharticks and duil Cordials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to indicare to them <hi>Ortho-Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus fanandi Chymica,</hi> that there may be an <gap reason="foreign">

Thus when the Doctor is convinced, many Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles will follow his Example: this will be the most assured way to make a Reformation in the World, and to take us off from unprofitable Disputes in Religion.</p>
            <p>The Abuses and extravagant Practices in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Physick being <hi>Chymically</hi> redressed, the Corruptions, Prevarications and unjust Dealings in the Law are like to be quickly voted out of doors: For the Irregularities in Divinity and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick confound the whole world.

            <p>Next our Ethicks or Morality may by wholsome <hi>Chymical</hi> Physick be meliorated: One Reason why we are at this day so depraved in our Manners, may with plausible reason be attributed to New feral Diseases, which rage among us as the <hi>Scorbutum, Lues Venerea,</hi> single &amp; complicated: likewise to the increase of the Cacoethie, or Malignity of former Diseases now graduated, and guarded with more cruel Symptoms, aggravated by Cacost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Tis not to be admired, why we are at this day so Melancholy, Discontented, Distracted with inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Passions and Perturbations, so Malicious, Perfidious, Falshearted, dishonest, full of Hatred, Pride, Vain-glory, Hypocrisie, Covetousness, Faction, Rebellion, Lightness and Phantastical Aemulation of Forreign Nations, unworthy of an <hi>English-man</hi>: For as much as most of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Compositions <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> corrupt Body and Soul.</p>
            <p>Again, 'tis singular Policie in the Magistrate to promote and cherish this <hi>Chymical</hi> Method of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: for his own and the peoples sake. He being by this means enabled to enjoy sounder Body and Mind, to Govern long, making Good Laws; and his Subjects hereby multiplyed will be ready to embrace them and obey him: both using a direct way to clarifie the Organs of the Soul for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Truth, and the right discretion or elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of what is best. By vertue of this Art, his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will be more Magnanimous, Valiant, empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the better to defend him and his Territories, to vindicate his Rights, to make enquiry abroad for New Plantations, and Colonies, to prevent Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses incident to the Climate, to oppose any Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies stoutly that shall invade us, to heal their Wounds, to save many Limbs from being muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or cut off. Doubtless had his Majesty been throughly acquainted with the excellent Efficacie of the <hi>Stomach Essence</hi> in Healing both Inwardly


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37887:103"/>
and Outwardly, injoyning a large Quantity to be made for the use of his Fleet against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hundreds of those brave Men might have been preserved, who perished for want of true <hi>Chymical</hi> Remedies. Neither would this or the like have only Cured their Scorbutical Infirmities, Healed their grievous Soars, but also have maturated their Stratagems, magnified and animated their Spirits for the execution of far greater Actions.</p>
            <p>Were there not some among us, who envie that the Nation should enjoy such a time of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> or <hi>Halcyonian</hi> days, wherein the state of Body and Soul might be amended, they would suggest to his Majesty the extraordinary Emolument or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie would arise to Him, His Posterity and the People, if this Enterprize were set on foot.</p>
            <p>It would appear Honest and Noble Policy to Purg the Schools by <hi>Paracelsian</hi> Physick from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital <hi>Galenical</hi> Errours, at this day predominant in Physick, to eradicate those Corruptions so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded <hi>tam frequentes foedasque in Philosophia nundinationes</hi> (as an Antient Academical <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signanus</hi> of Learning expresses) those unworthy respects of conferring Degrees on those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be termed no better than <hi>Philosophastri, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologastri, Idiotae, Nugatores, Sycophantae, Otiateres, Compotores, Indigni libidinis voluptatumque ministri, Hinc Rude vulgus, Inops, Sordidum, Leve, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicum Rebelle, Contumax, Refractarium ac Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Magistrate be pleased to cause the <hi>Helmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Institutions to be introduced into the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies instead of <hi>Aristotelian,</hi> according as one shall be found experimentally true, and the other false, the whole Kingdome will by degrees be brought


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37887:104"/>
into a far more flourishing Condition than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Hereupon Able Physitians will be sent into all parts to keep men in Sanity (the direct way to Prosperity in the General) which before was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by <hi>Galenists,</hi> Mountebanks, Quacks, who giving Medicaments noxious, as Hemlock instead of Parsley, have made the Nation Brain-sick, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical, Scorbutical, Unconstant, Rebellious, Idle, full of Beggars, Querulous, prone to extreams, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, affected with Outsides and Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rather than solid Worth. Thus the trading for Mens Skins might be abolished, Physick, Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and Pharmacopoie united, <hi>Materia Medica</hi> better improved, better attendance given to the Sick in time of the Plague, and a prevention made of Fugitive Physitians in our greatest extremity, whose Courage may be encreased by appropriate Antidotes against so great a poison.</p>
            <p>Let us but turn over to the <hi>Chymical</hi> Page; His Majesty will always enjoy Virtuous, Prudent, Sage, Valiant, Upright Counsellours: Good Men will still be encouraged with just Rewards, and Evil punished; those who have Real Intrinsical Worth preferred, those making an Outward seeming shew rejected: for assuredly the reason why we do not esteem things as they are in themselves, proceeds from <hi>Laesa Imaginatio,</hi> a crasie Phansie to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected principally by powerful <hi>Chymical</hi> Physick.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Consideration how ready at hand our Remedies are upon all occasions, safe and effectual, may plead for their protection by the Magistrate: Suppose a Prince or any Great Man be surprized with a Lipothymie, Epilepsie, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, Vertigo, in a place remote from any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarie, certainly he may himself, or his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37887:104"/>
attending him, carry a few light <hi>Paracelsian</hi> Remedies, which may in a moment relieve him; whereas should he send a Prescription so far as the unsupportable bulk of an Apothecarys Pharmacy resideth there to be dispensed, this Noble Person might in the mean time perish. I add to this, 'tis no small politick Satisfaction to a great Man, who prizes his Life, to see a Physitian, or any other in Health, to take some Chymical Arcana with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Nocument, which is tendred to the Patient for his Restauration, which I'le undertake to make good upon my own Body, or anothers. I shall not omit how satisfactory 'tis to one, who in his Prosperity, loves to breath in this Atmosphear, to hear a plain comfortable Prediction from an Adeptus, that he is capable of Recovery, or if not, that he may settle his Affairs, while he hath Mature Judgment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Dogmatical Guessers, bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, blunder, juggle, speak as amphibologically, as the Orac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to forsake their destructive paths.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Princes encouraging Pyrotechnie may obtain far more Active Antidotes against poyson, than hath hitherto been known, whereby the thread of their Life may be protracted; they may also discover how, not only vain, but injurious the Common Catharticks are in stubborn Maladies, studying to avoid them as Poysons either manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurting at present, or privily shortning their days for the Future.</p>

            <p>That Catalogue of Incurable Diseases, given in by the <hi>Galenists,</hi> will be Cancelled, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate means found to Remedy the most Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent Sickness, and Atrocious virulent Malady. <hi>Deus Omnes Nationes fecit sanabiles.</hi> The Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Benign Father of every good and perfect Gift hath Created a Salve for every Sore; onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, sloathful, supine Man will not exert his Faculties, for the Indagation, or narrow search of such precious latrical Pearls to be valued above any thing in this World; yea, so indifferent he is, so Paralytical in his desires towards the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Bonum,</hi> Sanity of Body, and Soul, so wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miserable, that he is loath to put out his Hand to receive so great a favour, though he may have it <hi>gratis,</hi> rather Envying, retarding, than furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring those who labour for a publick good.</p>
            <p>Were this Iatro Chymical Exploit indulged and quickned by those in Authority, such Polyacea's might be brought to light, enriched with Virtues abundantly sufficient to Conquer, and quite cut off those complicated Evils, which like <hi>Hydra</hi>'s Heads elude the Vulgar Medicaments.</p>

All Feavers might in a few days be strangled. The Measles and Small Pox might be Cured without Scandal, in the same manner as other defaults in Nature, to the Contempt of Ignorant and Presumptuous Nurses, Midwives, and the like Gang, who in this stare fear to meddle (not without just Reason) with Opinionative Physitians, having been so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously un-successful in the management of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Disease: Neither let any one think that their Method is more prevalent to Cure other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feavers, no such Matter; onely their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky dealing is more obvious to the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Cutaneous affect, who cannot in more obscure passages so easily pry into their egregious Imperfections.</p>
            <p>Were there frequent consultations of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Spagyrists receiving mutual Assistance one from another; the Liquor <hi>Alkahest</hi> and <hi>Butler</hi>'s stone might in all probability be enucleated, and set on work for Mortals Good: The Magical, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical, and Sympathetical Mystery of Healing might be improved and confirmed.</p>
            <p>The Feat of Obstetrication might be far more advanced, to the Grand disgrace of certain Men, who profess it; and to the Regulating of some self-conceited, rash Women.</p>
            <p>Chirurgery made appear to belong principally (setting aside Manual Operation) to the Skilful Chymists, who have in their Custody such morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers

            <p>Lastly, if such a Philosophical Chymical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany be Authorized and Countenanced, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks will be much promoted, their Manual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be more dextrously carried on: The Art of Gilding, Painting, Writing, Artillery may be wound up to a higher pitch. Metals might be more intimately purged, refined, volatile made more fixed, the terrestrial parts more sublimed, their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and sound exalted, those friable made Ductile, the Ignobler provected, and Generous augmented. <hi>Mercury</hi> precipitated, coagulated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with multiplicity of Bodies with which it will shew variety of Shapes useful for divers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Factures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antimony</hi> likewise technically prepared might be employed for the advancement of many Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycrafts,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sulphur Anreum Fulminans</hi> might be made in greater quantity and cheaper for the atchievement of many rare Designs.</p>
            <p>Such Electrums might be made which would perform Stupendious things. A clearer Light of the <hi>Lapis Chrysopoeus</hi> might be given. Doubtless Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers

would find that the compleat Learned Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrist would be able to instruct them for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving of several Mechanies to his advantage, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be attained by Ideot-Chymists.</p>
            <p>I hope these Important Motives and Persuasive Reasons will excite the Magistrate to Constitute with all Expedition, such a Learned Society of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho-Chymists,</hi> that they themselves, and these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may gather the delicious fruits thereof, and Forreigners may be lured to follow their good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Withal, I Supplicate the Omnipotent to put it into the Hearts of the more Generous and Refined Spirits of the <hi>Galenists,</hi> to take for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Right Measures for the Cure of Humane Griefs, to wave (when they are to aim at Essential Sanation) those Childish Fopperies of Heat and Cold, and to abdicate and proscribe their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet, either secretly noxious or openly lethife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Bleeding, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to lay down those Pernicious Instruments, and to take up Salutary.</p>
            <p>If the Juniors (leaving the Old Doting Fellows to themselves, as a very Learned Man calls them. who will no more be brought to learn better things in Healing, than an Old Dog to Fetch and Carry) will couragiously, and resolutely bend their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to carry on this Heroical Pyrotechnical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, they shall find me ready to serve them (according to that little Talent I have) in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of those Physical Verities which have cost me nigh 30 years Labour of Brain and Sinews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Hazzard of my Life by Assassinating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>algars of Metals and Minerals, together with the treacherous Gas of Charcole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also the dangerous Essayes I have made upon my own Stomach, for the discovery of the Operation of my own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures: add to these the continual Opposition,


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37887:107"/>
the Obloquies I have sustained, Abuses, Slanders, Disrespects thrown upon me undeservedly, enough to deter any man from being a Sceptick in Physick, or to digress from the Common Road of Healing.</p>
            <p>I shall, I say, communicate Real Arcana to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Literate Candid Persons, fitting to lay the Foundation of a Salutary Colledge. Then for my part I shall be willing to sequester my self out of Secular Tumults, Uproars and Turmoils, thinking it the happiest Condition in the world to live privately.</p>
            <p>I question not but other <hi>Ortho-Chymists</hi> will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Pattern, and contribute to the Honour and Enlargment of such a Scientifick Society.</p>

            <p>IF the <hi>Galenists</hi> find any Substantial remarkable Errors in this Syntagm, or a late Tract, Called <hi>Epilogis. Chymic.</hi> I am willing to be Rebuked as sharply as they please, but not scurrilously: However, I ought to be convinced by Matter of Fact, as well as Reason, which those of the Royal Society are bound to grant me, without Favour, Affection, Partiality, or Obligation to each other. This denyed me, they still persisting to set at naught Essential, Medical ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, back biting and vilifying us and our Remedies: Let them be assured I shall in general publish in lively Colours a Character of them. Next in particular I shall attack <hi>J. G. J. K. J. B. H. B. T. C. H. G. D. W. J. L. J. D. W. D. T.

Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> Sir <hi>George Viner</hi> and his Lady, Lord <hi>Conwallis;</hi> yea, the Reason of the shortning the Life of divers other Great Persons ought to be strictly Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and a History of the management of their Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be exposed to Publick view for Caution to others. I shall especially take to Task Dr. <hi>C.

            <p>I shall in good time match the Cock of our Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Boasters, who accused me of Presumption, for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a Pestilential Body, when they, for want of a stock of Powerful Prophylacticks, and Therapeuticks, never attempted it but with loss of Life.</p>
            <p>I shall farther Vindicate (as the first) the Credit and Propriety of Splenectomia, <hi>i. e.</hi> the cutting the Spleen out of a Dog (the Animal surviving the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration two years and a Quarter) Vsurped by Dr. <hi>C.

            <p>I shall, in convenient time, call to a Reckoning a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical</hi> Doctor (whose Name is Consonant with Stults, a proper Etymon for an Ignorant Physitian) Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to a purpose, for maligning my Practice, and offering abuses to this Innocent Art.</p>
