            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Next day his buſineſſe being finiſhed,</l>
                  <l>He did take horſe, and homeward then he rid,</l>
                  <l>And as he rid, it was his hap as then,</l>
                  <l>To ouertake Lord <hi>Cheiney</hi> and his men.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>With ſalutations they each other gréet,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And being that we homeward are to ride,</l>
                  <l>I haue a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then <hi>Arden</hi> anſwered with this courteous ſpéech,</l>
                  <l>Your Honours pardon now I doe beſéech,</l>
                  <l>I made a vow, if God did giue me life,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Well, ſaid my Lord, your oath hath got the day,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>On <hi>Raymon-Downe,</hi> as they did paſſe this way,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Black-will,</hi> and <hi>Shakebag</hi> they in ambuſh lay,</l>
                  <l>But durſt not touch him, cauſe of the great trains</l>
                  <l>That my Lord had: thus were they croft againe.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>With horrid oathes theſe Ruffians gan to ſweare,</l>
                  <l>They ſtampe and curſt, and tore their locks of haire</l>
                  <l>Saying, ſome Angell ſurely him did keepe.</l>
                  <l>Yet vow'd to murther him ere they did ſleepe.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now all this while my husband was away,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Mosby</hi> and I did reuell night and day;</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Suſan,</hi> which my waiting maiden was,</l>
                  <l>My Loues owne ſiſter, knew how all did paſſe.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But when I ſaw my <hi>Arden</hi> was not dead,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>I</hi> welcom'd him, but with a heauy head:</l>
                  <l>To bed he went, and ſlept ſecure from harmes,</l>
                  <l>But I did wiſh my <hi>Mosby</hi> in my armes.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet ere he ſlept, he told me he muſt goe</l>
                  <l>To dinner to my Lords, hee'd haue it ſo;</l>
                  <l>And that ſame night <hi>Blacke-will</hi> did ſend me word,</l>
                  <l>What lucke bad fortune did to them offord.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I ſent him word, that he next day would dine</l>
                  <l>At the Lord <hi>Cheinies,</hi> and would riſe betime,</l>
                  <l>And on the way their purpoſe might fulfill,</l>
                  <l>Well, Ile reward you, when that you him kill.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Next morne betimes, before the breake of day,</l>
                  <l>To take him napping then they tooke their way;</l>
                  <l>But ſuch a miſt and fog there did ariſe,</l>
                  <l>They could not ſee although they had foure eyes.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Arden</hi> ſcap'd theſe villaines where</l>
                  <l>And yet they heard his horſe goe by that way,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>I</hi> thinke (ſaid <hi>Will)</hi> ſome Spirit is his friend,</l>
                  <l>Come life or death, I vaw to ſee his end.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then to my houſe they ſtrait did take their way,</l>
                  <l>Telling me how they miſſed of their pray;</l>
                  <l>Then preſently, we did together gree,</l>
                  <l>At night at home that he ſhould murdered be.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Mosby</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> and all, our plot thus lay,</l>
                  <l>That he at Tables ſhould with <hi>Arden</hi> play,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Black-will,</hi> and <hi>Sakebag</hi> they themſelues ſhould hide</l>
                  <l>Vntill that <hi>Mosby</hi> he a watchword cride.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The word was this whereon we did agree,</l>
                  <l>Now (Maſter <hi>Arden) I haue taken ye:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Woe to that word, and woe vnto vs all,</l>
                  <l>Which bred confuſion and our ſudden fall.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When he came home, moſt welcome him I made,</l>
                  <l>And Iudas like I kiſt whom <hi>I</hi> betraide,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Mosby</hi> and he together went to play,</l>
                  <l>For I on purpoſe did the tables lay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And as they plaid, the word was ſtraightway ſpoke,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Blacke-Will</hi> and <hi>Sakebag</hi> out the corner-broke,</l>
                  <l>And with a Towell backwards pul'd him downe,</l>
                  <l>which made me think they now my ioyes did crowne</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>With ſwords and kniues they ſtab'd him to the heart</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Mosby</hi> and I did likewiſe act our part,</l>
                  <l>And then his body ſtraight we did conuey</l>
                  <l>Behind the Abbey in the field he lay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And then by Iuſtice we were ſtraight condemn'd,</l>
                  <l>Each of vs came vnto a ſhameleſſe end,</l>
                  <l>For God our ſecret dealings ſoone did ſpy,</l>
                  <l>And brought to light our ſhamefull villany.</l>
               </lg>
