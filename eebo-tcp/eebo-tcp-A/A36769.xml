         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE
ANSWER
AND
DECLARATION
OF THE IVDGES,
Vnto the questions tranſmitted from the Honorable
Houſe of Commons unto the Lords Spirituall and
Temporall in Parliament aſſembled, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they deſired their Lordſhips, to require
the ſaid Iudges anſwers in writing
forthwith. <date>May 25. 1641.</date>
               </head>
               <p>IN all humbleneſſe the ſaid Iudges doe deſire, to
repreſent unto your Lordſhips, the great ſence
of griefe that they apprehend out of their feare,
that they are falne from that good opinion, which
they deſire to retayne with your Lordſhips and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48487:7"/>
the ſaid houſe of Commons in that (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their humble petition and reaſons to the
contrary exhibited in writing, and declared in
this moſt honorable houſe) your Lordſhips have
over-ruled them, and often commanded their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
unto the ſaid <hi>Questions,</hi> although they have
informed your Lordſhips, and ſtill with aſſurance
doe averre, that no preſident in any age can be
ſhewen that any Iudges before them were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or commanded to give anſwer in writing, or
otherwiſe unto ſuch generall, or ſo many <hi>questions,</hi>
in ſuch a manner in Parliament, or elſewhere, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it were in that time of <hi>King Richard</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>
which they humbly conceive, is not to be drawne
into example. And therefore they yet humbly
ſupplicate your Lordſhips ſo farre, to tender their
profeſſion and places, and their relation, to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
ſervice, as to take into your ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
the reaſons that they have annexed
to this their anſwer, before their anſwer be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
or admitted, among the Acts of this high
Court, and that if your Lordſhips in your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
ſhall after thinke fit to give any Copies
of their Anſwers, that for their Iuſtification to
the preſent and ſucceeding times your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
will be pleaſed to require the Clerke of
this moſt honorable Houſe, that no Copies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48487:7"/>
may be given of the ſaid anſwers without the ſaid
reaſons.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secondly</hi> the ſaid Iudges humbly deſire
your Lordſhips to be pleaſed, to be informed, that
the words in his Majeſties writs, by which they are
commanded to attend in Parliament, are, that the
ſaid Iudges ſhalbe preſent with the Lords-Iuſtices
or other chiefe Governor and your Lordſhips, at
the ſaid Parliament, called <hi>Pro arduis &amp; urgentibus
regni negotijs ſuper dictis negotijs tractaturi &amp; conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ſuum impenſuri:</hi> And they deſire your Lordſhips
to take into your conſideration whether any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
may be required by your Lorpſhips, from
them, but concerning ſuch particular matters, as
are in treaty and agitation and judicially depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
before your Lordſhips, upon which your
Lordſhips may give a judgement, order, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
to be recorded among the Records and Acts
of this honorable Houſe, and whether they may
be commanded by your Lordſhips, to ſubſcribe
their hands unto any opinion or advice they ſhall
give upon any matters in debate before your
Lordſhips there, and whether your Lordſhips can
conceive any finall reſolution upon the matters
contayned in the ſaid <hi>Questions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> although the ſaid queſtions are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48487:8"/>
but twenty two in number, yet they ſay, that they
contayne at leaſt fifty generall queſtions, many of
them of ſeverall matters, and of ſeverall natures,
within the reſolution of which moſt of the great
affaires of this kingdome, both for Church and
Common-wealth, for late yeares may be included;
and therefore the ſaid Iudges do openly aforehand
profeſſe, that if any particular, that may have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to any of thoſe queſtions ſhall hereafter
come judicially before them, and that eyther up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
argument or debate (which is the ſive or fann
of truth) or diſcovery of any generall inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
to the King or Common-wealth in time
(which is the mother of truth) or by further ſearch
or information, in any particular, they ſhall ſee
cauſe, or receive ſatisfaction for it, they will not be
concluded by any anſwer, they now give to any of
theſe generall queſtions: but they will upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ground and reaſon with their predeceſſors the
Iudges in all ages with holy Fathers, Councels,
and Parliaments, retract, and alter their opinion
according to their conſcience and knowledge, and
the matter and circumſtances of the cauſe as it
ſhall appeare in judgement before them, it being
moſt certayne that no generall caſe, may be ſo put,
but a circumſtance in the matter or manner may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48487:8"/>
alter a reſolution concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the ſucceeding Iudges, and age
notwithſtanding any anſwer given by the now
Iudges, may be of another opinion then the now
Iudges are, without diſparagment to themſelves,
or the now Iudges, in regard that many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
circumſtances, in many particular caſes may
fall out, that may alter the reaſon of the Lawes,
in ſuch a caſe; which could not be included or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene
in a generall queſtion, or anſwer thereunto:
And therefore they deſire your Lordſhips to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of what uſe ſuch anſwers may be, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and future times.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> many of the ſaid queſtions, as they
are propounded (as the ſaid Iudges humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
doe concerne his Majeſty in a high degree,
in his Regall and prerogative power, in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in his Revenue, in the Iuriſdiction of
his Courts, in his Martiall affaires, and in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of State, ſo that the ſaid Iudges conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Oathes, &amp; the duty which by their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they owe unto his Majeſty humbly conceive
they may not with ſafety give anſwer thereunto,
without ſpeciall licence from his Majeſty, and
therefore they ſtill humbly pray your Lordſhips
(as formerly they did) not to preſſe any anſwers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48487:9"/>
from them untill his Majeſties princely pleaſure,
therein be ſignified.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> if the matters of theſe queſtions
which ayme at ſome abuſes of former times, were
reduced into Bils, they conceive it were the ſpeedy
way to have ſuch a reformation which might bind
the preſent times, and poſteritie, and in ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
they ought and would moſt cheerefully
contribute their opinions &amp; beſt endevors, but in
ſuch a courſe (as they apprehend it) which points
at puniſhment they have reaſon to bee ſparing in
giving any opinion further then the duty of their
places doth command from them.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> although it may be conceived,
that the anſwering of ſuch and ſo many generall
queſtions, by the now Iudges may contribute ſome
helpe to the reformation now ſo much deſired, yet
no man knoweth but this new preſident in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
of ſuch queſtions to Iudges in ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
times (as the Iudges &amp; frame &amp; conſtitution
of the Common-wealth may be) may fall out to
bee moſt prejudiciall to the State and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Eightly,</hi> moſt of the matters in ſeverall
of the ſaid queſtions, are already by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and the ſaid houſe of Commons voted and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48487:9"/>
repreſented to his Majeſty for grievances, and
therefore no opinions of the Iudges, under favour
are needfull or to bee required thereunto, unleſſe
the ſame ſhall come in further agitation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
in this honorable Houſe.</p>
               <p>9. The Iudges opinions are not uſually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon in Parliament, but when upon debate
great and difficulte points in Law doe ariſe, where,
this moſt honorable houſe doth thinke fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their opinions, but no reſolutions, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto the ſaid Iudges, in Parliament, but unto
your Lordſhips; Yet in the front and preamble of
the ſaid queſtions, the reſolution of the ſaid que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
by the Iudges, is forthwith deſired, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by your Lordships in writing, although the
firſt queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the ſubjects of this
kingdome be a free people, &amp;c. be poſitively, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by the preamble to the ſaid queſtions, in
which it is likewiſe declared that the ſaid Iudges
anſwers thereunto, are not deſired for any doubt
or ambiguitie which may be conceived or thought
of, for, or concerning the premiſſes, nor of the
ſaid queſtions; but for manifeſtation and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a cleere truth, and of the Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
already planted and ſetled in this kingdome:
And they ſay that it is impoſſible, to make any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48487:10"/>
manifeſtation or declaration of Law, or ſtatutes,
which may hold or be uſefull, upon ſuch generall
queſtions as moſt of theſe are, namely. By what
Law? in what caſes? of what? and which of them?
of what power? of what force? how? where? by
whom? why? wherefore? what puniſhment? by
what rule of policy? in what condition of perſons?
in regard that the next ſucceeding Iudges may be
of another opinion, and that a circumſtance may
alter the reaſon of this Law, in many particular
caſes, which the wit of man is not able to forſee, or
give a generall rule in. And they ſay that to give
anſwers unto ſuch queſtions as might give any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to your Lordſhips, or to the honorable
houſe of Commons, would make up a great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
and require more time than your Lordſhips
have afforded unto the ſaid Iudges, conſidering
their great toyle, in their Circuites the laſt ſhort
vacation, their other imployments in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and their daily attendance on your
Lordſhips in Parliament, and the ordinary Courts
of Iuſtice: And yet leaſt they might ſeeme to come
any way ſhort in performance of that duty, which
they confeſſe to be due unto your Lordſhips, or
be wanting in promoting or advancing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
which they beleeve to be aymed at by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48487:10"/>
the ſaid queſtions, though it may ſeeme to drawe
damage or prejudice upon their particulars, they
doe in all humbleneſſe preſent unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
the enſuing anſwers unto the ſaid queſtions
which is as much as by their Oathes or in the duty
they owe unto his Sacred Majeſty (before his
princely pleaſure bee therein ſignified) they can
anſwer thereunto.</p>
               <p>1. To the firſt, they anſwer, that the ſubjects
of this kingdome are a free people and are, for the
generall to bee governed onely by the Common-lawes
of <hi>England</hi> and ſtatutes of force in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
yet they ſay that as in <hi>England,</hi> many ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
are growen <hi>obſolete,</hi> and out of uſe, and ſome
particular ancient Lawes (aſwell in criminall as in
Civill cauſes) have beene changed by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Iudges there, as they found it moſt
agreeable to the generall good of the Common-wealth,
and as the times did require it; So, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
the Iudges of this kingdome as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
of the times did move them, did declare
the law in ſome particular caſes otherwiſe than the
ſame is practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> which the now Iudges
cannot alter, without apparent diminution of a
great part of his Majeſties ſtanding revenue, and
opening a gap for the ſhaking and queſtioning of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48487:11"/>
the eſtates of many of his Majeſties ſubjects, and
the overthrowing of ſeverall Iudgements, Orders,
Decrees, which depend thereupon. For example,
If it be found by office of Record, ſufficient for
forme that a man was killed in actuall rebellion,
and at the time of his death was ſeized of lands,
hereditaments, goods, or chattels, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
declaration of Law, and practiſe of former
times here, the Crown was intituled to ſuch lands,
goods, and chattels, and many mens eſtates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
thereupon, and yet the law is not ſo taken in
<hi>England,</hi> So if one or more commit Felony, and
then ſtand out upon his or their keeping, and hee
or they will not ſubmit themſelves to be tryed by
the law, but being in that ſtate doe robbe or ſpoyle
and terrifie his Majeſties people, wherby the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
is diſquieted, this by the conſtant opinion of
our predeceſſors in this kingdome hath beene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
a leavying of warre within the <hi>Statute 25.
Edw.</hi> 3. and ſo conſequently treaſon. Alſo by the
common received opinion &amp; practiſe in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the <hi>VVife</hi> is to have a third of all the goods,
chatels and credits of her husband (the debts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
payed) although he diſpoſe of all by his will
from her: And yet the conſtant practiſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in <hi>England,</hi> and other inſtances of that kind,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48487:11"/>
might be made, ſo that the words (onely) muſt
receive a benigne expoſition before the firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
can receive a generall anſwer, in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Secondly, many cauſes of great weight and
conſequence in this kingdome, are to bee decreed
and ordered by equitie in the proper Courts of
equitie, and in courſe of State at the Councell-board,
and by particular cuſtomes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to law, for which the Common-law and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of force in this kingdome give no remedie.
Thirdly, there are ſeverall other lawes of force in
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo farre as they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
which though ſome would have to be part
of the Common-law of <hi>England,</hi> yet we find them
particularly diſtinguiſhed from it in our Printed
Bookes in Parliament Rolles in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Lex eſt
conſuetudo Parliamenti, jura belli,</hi> Eccleſiaſticall or
Canon law in certaine caſes, Civill law in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
not onely in Eccleſiaſticall Courts, but in the
Courts of Conſtable and Marſhall, and of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
and upon particular occaſions, in the
other Courts <hi>lex Mercatoria, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To the ſecond, They ſay that the Iudges
of this kingdome doe take the Oath of Iudges,
which Oath is ſpecified amongſt the ſtatutes in 18.
<hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and is after explaned by the ſtatute of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48487:12"/>
20. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and that they may not ſtay, hinder, or
delay the ſuite of any ſubject, or his judgement,
or execution thereupon (otherwiſe then according
to the law and courſe of the Court, where they ſit)
under pretence of any act of ſtate, proclamation,
writ, letter, or direction under the great or privy
Seale, or privie Signet, or Letter, or other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
from the Lord Lieutenant, Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,
Iuſtice, Iuſtices, or other chiefe Governor
of this kingdome, moſt of which, doth appeare by
their Oath expreſſed in the ſaid ſtatutes, and the
ſaid ſtatute of 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 8. and the ſtatute of
28. <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 2. as to Barons of the Exchequer.
And that as they know no puniſhment due to
Iudges, for their deviations &amp; tranſgreſſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other aggravation; So they know no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
layd downe by any law againſt them for
their deviations and tranſgreſſions, in hindering
ſtaying, or delaying of Iuſtice, contrary to their
ſaid Oath, other then what is declared in their ſaid
Oath, and the ſtatute of 20. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>3. To the third, they ſay that it is part of
their ſaid Oath, as Iudges, that they ſhall not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
or aſſent to any thing that may turne to the
damage or diſheriſon of our Soveraigne Lord the
Kings moſt Excellent Majeſtie, by any manner of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48487:12"/>
way or colour. And that they ſhall give no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
or counſell to any man great or ſmall in no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
wherein the King is a party, And they shall
doe and procure the profit of the King and his
Crowne, in all things where they may reaſonably
doe the ſame; And that in the explanation of their
ſaid Oathes, by the ſtatute of 20. <hi>Edw. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap.</hi> 1. It
is declared that they shall give no counſell to
great men, nor ſmall, in caſe where the King is
party, or which doth or may touch the King in
any point. And as your Lordships have beene
honorably pleaſed by an order of this honorable
houſe, bearing date the firſt of <hi>March Anno Dom.
1641. Anno<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> Regni Caroli decimo ſexto</hi> to give way,
that they should not be compelled to anſwer any
part of thoſe queſtions, which did concerne his
Majeſties prerogatives or were againſt their oathes
ſo they humbly repreſent unto your Lordſhips,
that they conceive that the anſwering of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of this queſtion, doth concerne both, for
that the Kings privie Counſell as the queſtion
tearmes it, or the Councell-board, is a Court of
his Majeſties high prerogative, where all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
are before him, and his Counſell, or before
his Governor (who doth immediately, to many
purpoſes repreſent his Majeſties perſon) and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48487:13"/>
Counſell. And where the great affaires of ſtate
concerning his Majeſties honor, government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and of great perſons and cauſes concerning the
Common-wealth, which, may not conveniently
be remedied by the ordinary rules of Common-law,
and many other cauſes have beene treated, of,
and managed. And as his Majeſty is the fountayne
of all Iuſtice, with in his kingdomes and may grant
Cognizance of pleas unto his ſubjects, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
and may by his Commiſſion authorize
whom he ſhall thinke fit, to execute many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his authoritie, ſo they humbly conceive, it
doth not ſtand with their Oathes or duties of their
places, who are but Iudges of the ordinary Courts
of Iuſtice, before his Majeſties pleaſure ſignified
in that behalfe, to ſearch into the Commiſſions or
inſtructions of the chiefe Governor and Counſell,
or to give any opinion concerning the limits, juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
orders, decrees, proceedings, or members
of that high Court, and that the King hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
for the hearing ſome of the matters in this
queſtion ſpecified before his chiefe Governor; We
beſeech your Lordſhips to caſt your eyes on the
ſtatute of 28. <hi>H. 6. cap.</hi> 2. in this kingdome, where
after m<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ters are directed to be ſent to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Courts, yet the Kings prerogative is expreſſely
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48487:13"/>
ſaved, notwithſtanding all which his gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
(for whom it is moſt proper) hath of late
beene pleaſed to limit the proceedings of that
Board by his inſtructions in print.</p>
               <p>4. To the <hi>fourth,</hi> they anſwer as to the <hi>Third.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. To the <hi>fift</hi> they ſay that generally all grants
of <hi>Monopolies,</hi> whereby trading, manufacture, or
commerce is reſtrayned, &amp; the profit which ſhould
goe to many hindred &amp; brought into a few hands,
are againſt law, the liberty of the ſubject and the
good of the Common-wealth, though they carrie
never ſo faire a pretence of reforming abuſes, and
that the pretended tranſgreſſors againſt ſuch
grants are not at all puniſhable by any rule of law,
that they know of, And yet they ſay, that they
conceive that his Majeſtie, that is, the head and
father of the Common-wealth may reſtrayne the
uſe and importation and exportation of certaine
commodities, or confine the ſame into a few hands
for a time where there may be likelyhood of his
Majeſties profit, (which is the profit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,)
and no apparent prejudice to the
Common-wealth doth appeare, and that when
time ſhall diſcover ſuch prejudice, then ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints
ought to ceaſe; So if a man by his owne
invention at home, or travell, obſervation, or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48487:14"/>
charge abroade doth introduce a new profitable,
and uſefull trade or profeſſion into the Common-wealth,
in ſuch caſes his Majeſty may lawfully
grant &amp; licence the only making of ſuch commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
or teaching or uſing of ſuch trade for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
time, and the tranſgreſſors againſt ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
grants, may be puniſhed by payment of
damages unto the Patentee, in an ordinary courſe
of Iuſtice, or otherwiſe, as the nature of the offence
and matter doth deſerve; and as the conſequence
and importance of the matter may be to the King,
State, or Common-wealth. And they ſay that the
matter, manner, reſtrictions, limitations, reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and other clauſes contayned in ſuch grants
or licences, and the Commiſſions or Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
thereupon and undue execution thereof, and
ſeverall circumſtances may make the ſame lawfull
or unlawfull, whereof they are not able to give any
certayne reſolution (before ſome particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
in judgement before them) neyther are they
otherwiſe able to anſwer the generall in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of the ſaid queſtion, of what, in what caſes,
how, where, and by whom, or which of them,
wherein whoſoever deſireth further ſatisfaction he
may pleaſe to have recourſe unto the knowne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of <hi>Monoplies,</hi> Printed authorities, and written
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48487:14"/>
Reports, and unto the ſtatute of 21. <hi>Ia.</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
concerning <hi>Monopolies,</hi> and the ſeverall exceptions
and limitations therein.</p>
               <p>6. To the <hi>ſixt,</hi> they ſay they can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
anſwer then they have already in their anſwer
to the third queſtion, for the reaſons therein ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth.</p>
               <p>7. To the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> they ſay, that a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or act of State cannot alter the common-law,
and yet Proclamations are acts of his Majeſties
prerogative, and are, and alwayes have beene of
great uſe, and that the contemners of ſuch of them
as are not againſt the law, are and by the conſtant
practiſe of the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> in <hi>England</hi> have beene
puniſhed, according the nature of the contempt,
and courſe of the ſaid Court, and although acts of
State, are not of force to bind the goods, poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or inheritance of the ſubject, yet they have
beene of great uſe for the ſetling of the eſtates of
very many ſubjects in this kingdome, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the <hi>Report</hi> of the caſe of <hi>Iriſh gavelkind</hi>
in Print. And further to that queſtion they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
anſwer for the reaſons in their anſwer unto the
third queſtion ſet forth.</p>
               <p>8. To the <hi>eight,</hi> they ſay, that they know no
ordinary rule of law, by which the ſubjects of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48487:15"/>
kingdome are made ſubject to Marſhall-law in
time of peace, and that they find the uſe thereof in
time of peace, in <hi>England,</hi> complayned off, in the
petition of right, exhibited to his Majeſtie in the
third yeare of his raigne, And that they conceive
the granting of authority and Commiſſion for
execution thereof, is derived out of his Majeſties
Regall and prerogative power, for ſuppreſſing of
ſuddaine and great inſolencies and inſurrections,
among armies, or multitudes of armed men law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
or unlawfully convented together, (the right
uſe wherof in all times hath beene found moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in this kingdome) And further to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
they cannot anſwer, for that as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
it doth concerne his Majeſties Regall power,
and that the anſwering of the other part of the
queſtion doth properly belong to another profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
whereof they have no Cognizance.</p>
               <p>9. To the <hi>ninth</hi> they ſay, that as the taking of
any Oath before any but ſuch Iudges or perſons as
have power to give or demaund an Oath, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of controverſies, is by moſt Divin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in moſt
caſes counted to be a raſh Oath, and ſo an offence
againſt God, within the third Commandement, ſo
the preſcribing and demaunding of a ſet Oath by
any that cannot derive power ſo to doe from the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48487:15"/>
Crowne (where the fountaine of Iuſtice under
God doth reſide) is an offence againſt the law of
the Land, and as for voluntary and extra judiciall
Oathes, although freely taken before arbitrators
or others, they ſay (as this kingdome is compoſed
in many particulars, as the nature &amp; conſequence
of the cauſe, or the quality of the perſon who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
or before whom the ſame is taken, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the Common-wealth, or the members ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
ſuch taking of ſuch Oathes or proceeding or
grounding on ſuch Oath in deciding of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
according to the ſeverall circumſtances,
that may occurre therein, or the prejudice, it may
introduce to the Common-wealth, may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Common-law, or (if it grow unto an
height or generall inconvenience to the common-wealth
or members thereof) in the <hi>Castle-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
For though ſuch an Oath be voluntary, yet
in moſt caſes, it is received by him, that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ground his Iudgment thereon, and after
the Oath is taken, the arbitrator, or he that intends
to yeeld faith to the party, that tooke the Oath,
doth examine him upon one or more queſtions,
upon the ſaid Oath, unto the anſwer whereof, hee
doth give faith and aſſent, truſting on the ſaid
Oath. And whereas Oathes by Gods inſtitution
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48487:16"/>
were chiefly allowed to bee taken before lawfull
Magiſtrates, for ending of controverſies, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience doth teach in this kingdome, that
oftentimes orders and acts grounded on ſuch vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Oathes, beget ſtrife, and ſuits; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſuch orders when they come to bee meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by rules of law, or equitie in the Kings Courts
become voyde, after much expence of time, and
charge that we ſay nothing of that, that thereby
many cauſes proper to the Kings Courts are drawn
<hi>ad aliud examen,</hi> and thereby the Kings juſtice and
Courts often defrauded and declined.</p>
               <p>10. To the <hi>tenth,</hi> they ſay, that they are not
Iudges of rules of policie, but of law, and that
they know no certayne rule of law, concerning
reducement of fines. The ſame being matters of
his Majeſties own meere Grace, after a man is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
for any offence: And that they know no law,
that none ſhall be admitted to reducement of his
fines or other penalties in the Courts in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
ſpecified, untill he confeſſe the fact for which
he was cenſured. But foraſmuch as the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to a reducement after conviction, for an
offence, is matter of Grace and not Iuſtice; It hath
beene the conſtant courſe of theſe Courts both
here and in <hi>England,</hi> for cleering of his Majeſties ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48487:16"/>
(where the partie will not goe about to cleere
himſelfe, by reverſall of the cenſure or decree) not
to admit him to that grace, untill he hath confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the juſtneſſe, of the ſentence pronounced by
the Court againſt him. And that the rather for
that commonly the ability and diſabilitie of the
partie doth not appeare in judgement before them
but the nature and circumſtances of the offence,
according to which, they give ſentence againſt him
or them, <hi>in terrorem</hi> after which, when the partie
ſhall make the weakneſſe of his eſtate appeare, or
that the Court is otherwiſe aſcerteyned, that they
doe of courſe proportion the cenſure, or penaltie,
having regard to his eſtate.</p>
               <p>11. To the <hi>eleventh,</hi> they ſay, That neither
the Iudges of the Kings Bench (as they informe
us, that are of that Court) or Iuſtices of Gaole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
or of any other Court, doe or can by any
law they know, deny the copies of Indictments,
of Felony, or Treaſon, to the partie only accuſed
as by the ſaid queſtion is demanded.</p>
               <p>12. To the <hi>twelfth,</hi> they ſay, that where lands
are holden of the King by the Knights ſervice, <hi>in
Capite,</hi> the tenant by the ſtrict courſe of Law
ought in perſon to doe his homage to the King,
and untill he hath done his homage, the ancient
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48487:17"/>
courſe of the Exchequer hath beene &amp; yet is, to iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
proceſſe of <hi>distringas</hi> out of the ſecond remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
Office, to diſtrayne the tenants <hi>ad faciendum
homagium</hi> or <hi>pro homagio ſuo reſpectua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do,</hi> upon which
proceſſe, the Shiriffes returneth iſſues. And if the
Tenant doe not therupon appeare and compound
with the King, to give a fine for reſpite of homage,
then the iſſues are forfeyted to the King for his
contempt, but if he appeare, then the Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
doth agree with him to reſpite his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for a ſmall fine, wherein they regulate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
under the rate expreſſed and ſet downe in
<hi>England</hi> by vertue of a privie Scale in the 15. yeare
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby the rates are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
ſet downe, according to the yearely value
of the Lands, which rates are confirmed by act of
Parliament in 1. <hi>Iacob. Regis cap.</hi> 26. in <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which time there was not any ſuch certayntie,
but the ſame reſted in the diſcretion of the Court
by the rule of Common-law, and ſo it doth at this
day in <hi>Ireland,</hi> howbeit we conceive that the Court
of Exchequer here doe well to regulate their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
by thoſe rates in <hi>England,</hi> and rather to be
under then to exceede the ſame, which the Barons
there doe, as they doe informe us, that are Iudges
of the other Courts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48487:17"/>
13. To the 13. they ſay, that they know no rule
of Law or ſtatute, by which it ſhould be ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſurable,
in the ſubjects of this kingdome to repayre into
<hi>England,</hi> to appeale unto his Majeſty for redreſſe of
injuries, or for other their lawfull occaſions, unles
they be prohibited by his Majeſties writ, or procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
or, other his Command. But they find that
by the ſtatute of 5. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. the paſſage of the ſubject
out of the Realme, is prohibited without ſpeciall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
excepting Noblemen, &amp; others in the ſaid
ſtatute ſpecially excepted, &amp; ſome inference to that
purpoſe may be made upon the ſtatute of 25. <hi>Hen 6
cap.</hi> 2. in this kingdome.</p>
               <p>14. To the 14. they ſay, that ſome Deanries &amp;
dignities, not Deanes or dignitaries (as the queſtion
propounds it) are properly, &amp; <hi>de mero jure</hi> donative
by the King, ſome Elective, &amp; ſome Collative, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the firſt foundation &amp; uſuage of ſuch
Churches, &amp; they humbly deſire that they may not
be required to give any further anſwer to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
for that it may concerne many mens eſtates
which may come judcially in queſtion before them</p>
               <p>15. To the 15. they ſay, that they conceive that
where priviledges are claymed by any body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
or other, the Kings Counſell may exhibite <hi>à


quo-warranto</hi> to cauſe the parties clayming ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48487:18"/>
priviledges, to ſhew by what warrant they clayme
the ſame, &amp; that the Court cannot hinder the iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of proceſſe at the inſtance of the Kings Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or hinder the Kings Atturney to exhibite ſuch
informations. But when the caſe ſhall upon the
proceedings be brought to judgment, then &amp; not
before the Court is to take notice and give judg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon the merite &amp; circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances of the cauſe,
as upon due conſideration ſhalbe conceived to be
according to law, in which caſe the Iudges or the
Kings Atturney (as they conceive) ought not to
be puniſhed by any ordinary rule of law or ſtatute
that they know. But for the particular caſe of <hi>Quo-warranto</hi>
for that it hath beene a great queſtion in
this preſent Parliament, &amp; ſo concernes the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Court of juſtice in this kingdome, &amp; alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
two other of his Majeſties Courts of juſtice,
&amp; therin his Majeſties prerogative in thoſe Courts,
they ſay that they cannot ſafely deliver any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therein, before it comes judicially before them,
and that they heare it argued and debated by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Counſell on both ſides.</p>
               <p>16. To the <hi>ſixteenth</hi> they ſay, that although the
Iurors be ſole Iudges of the matter of fact, yet the
Iudges of the Court are Iudges of the validitie of
the evidence, and of the matters of law ariſing out
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48487:18"/>
of the ſame, wherein the Iury ought to be guided
by them. And if the Iury in any criminall cauſe
betweene the King and party, give their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
contrary to cleere and apparent evidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in Court, they have beene conſtantly,
and ſtill ought to be cenſured in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Caſtle-chamber</hi> here, for this miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor
in perverting the right courſe of juſtice, in
ſuch fines and other puniſhment as the merites &amp;
circumſtances of the cauſe doth deſerve, according
to the courſe of the ſaid Courts, for that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
ought to be directed by the evidence, and
not to bee miſguided by their wills or affections.
And if the Iury know any matter of fact, which
may eyther better or blemiſh their evidence, they
may take advantage thereof, but they ought to
diſcover the ſame to the Iudges. And they ſay that
this proceeding in the Court of <hi>Castle-chamber</hi> is
out of the ſame grounds, that writs of attaint are
againſt a Iury that gives a falſe verdict, in a Court
of Record at the Common-law betwixt partie and
partie, which falſe verdict being found by a Iury of
twenty foure, notwithſtanding that the firſt Iurie
were Iudges of the fact, yet that infamous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was pronounced againſt the firſt Iury, which
is next or rather worſe then judgment to death, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48487:19"/>
did lay a perpetuall brand of perjury upon them,
for which reaſon it was anciently called the <hi>villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
judgement,</hi> and they ſay that the law to direct
the puniſhment for ſuch offences is the courſe of
the ſaid Court, which is a law as to that purpoſe, &amp;
the ſtatute of 3. <hi>Henr. 7. cap.</hi> 1. and other ſtatutes in
force in this kingdome.</p>
               <p>17. To the <hi>ſeventeenth,</hi> they ſay, they can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
no otherwiſe, then they have in their anſwer to
the next precedent queſtion.</p>
               <p>18. To the <hi>eighteenth,</hi> they ſay, that in a Legall
conſtruction the ſtatute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> in which
the words <hi>Salvo contenemento</hi> are mentioned is only
to be underſtood of amerciaments &amp; not of fines,
yet where great fines are impoſed <hi>in terrorem</hi> upon
the reducement of them regard is to be had to the
abilitie of the perſons.</p>
               <p>19. To the <hi>nineteenth,</hi> they ſay, that if one doth
ſteale a ſheepe or commit any other ſelony, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flyeth the courſe of juſtice, or lyeth in woods,
or mountaynes upon his keeping, yet doth he not
thereby become a Traytor, neyther doth a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
make him ſo, the chiefe uſe whereof in ſuch
a Caſe is, to invite the partie ſo ſtanding out to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelfe to juſtice, or to forewarne others of
the danger they may runne into by keeping him
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48487:19"/>
company, or giving him mayntenance, and reliefe
whereby he may the rather ſubmit to Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>20. To the <hi>twentieth,</hi> they ſay, that the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Rebels, or Traytors under protection of
Theeves, or other infamous perſons is not to bee
uſed or preſſed as convincing evidence upon the
tryall of any man for his life, and ſo is his Majeſties
printed inſtructions, as to perſons condemned, or
under protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet the teſtimony of ſuch perſons
not condemned &amp; being fortified with other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
proofe, or apparant circumſtances may be
preſſed upon any tryall, and for diſcovering of
their fellowes, abetors, or relievers as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
may offer themſelves in their examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
eſpecially if before they confeſſe themſelves
guiltie of the offence in imitation of the approver
at the Common-law, whereof no certaine rule
may be given. And it neede not be made a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
here, whether the Iurors or Iudges ought to
be Iudges of the matter of fact, it being poſitively
layd downe in the ſixteenth queſtion that they are.
And though their falſe verdict doth convince, or
not convince the priſoner, yet they may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned,
and puniſhed for a falſe verdict, as in
their anſwer to the ſixteenth is already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48487:20"/>
21. To the <hi>twentie one,</hi> they ſay, that that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is now judicially depending, and hath beene
already ſolemnely argued in his Majeſties Court
of <hi>VVardes,</hi> in which Court their aſſiſtance for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the law therein is already required.
And therefore they humbly deſire they may not
be compelled to give any opinion touching that
point untill it be reſolved there.</p>
               <p>22. To the <hi>twentie two,</hi> they ſay, that they doe
conceive, that there is no matter of Law contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the ſaid queſtion, yet for the further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of your Lordſhips, they ſay that upon
view of an Act of ſtate, bearing Date at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> the <hi>twenty fourth</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
1636. grounded upon his Majeſties Letters of
the <hi>fift</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> then laſt paſt, it appeared unto them
that foure ſhillings in the pound, as of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
free gift and reward, out of the firſt payment
of the increaſe of rent reſerved to his Majeſtie,
was allowed to the Iudges that were Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and attended that ſervice. And we humbly
conceive that the receiving of that foure ſhillings
in the pound, of his Majeſties bountie, ſtands well
with the integrity of a Iudge, and thoſe Iudges did
informe them that they did not avoyde any Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-Patents
upon the Commiſſion of Defective
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48487:20"/>
Titles but received ſuch to compound as ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the ſtrengthning of their defective Patents
and Titles, and ſuch as would ſtand upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of their grants were left to the tryall at law.
And that the Compoſitions made after the ſaid
grants of the foure ſhillings in the pound were
made according to rules and rates agreed upon
by all the Commiſſioners before his Majeſties ſaid
Letters or the ſaid Act of State, and not otherwiſe.</p>

aſſembled repreſenting the whole

have heretofore preſented unto the Lords Houſe

to the end their Lordſhips might thereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the anſwer of the Iudges in writing, which
being long ſithence accordingly commaunded by

in, a writing to the Lords Houſe by them ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>an Anſwer unto the ſaid Questions,</hi> which being
ſent to the Commons houſe to be taken into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,

               <p>This my Lords being the occaſion of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,

being ſquared by the <hi>Lesbian line</hi> of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie,
as contrary to the lawes aforeſaid, as any
(<hi>oppoſitum is in objecto</hi>) produced the <hi>firſt queſtion,</hi>
and I hope not improperly.</p>
               <p>The reaſon for the ſecond in part ariſeth out of
the Oath of a Iudge 18. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">2. q. 2. rat.</note> to be found among
the Printed ſtatutes <hi>Polton fol.</hi> 144. and out of the
ſtatutes of 20. <hi>Edw. 3. cap. 1. 2. &amp; 3. Polton fol.</hi> 145.
This Oath is comprehenſive and extends to the
Iudges, the Barons of the Exchequer, and Iuſtices
of Gaole-delivery, and their aſſociats.</p>
               <p>This great and ſacred Oath contaynes ſeverall
branches. Firſt, well &amp; lawfully to ſerve the King &amp;
his people in the Office of a Iuſtice. Secondly, not
to Counſell or conſent unto any thing tending to
the Kings damage or diſinheriſon. Thirdly, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48487:23"/>
warne the King of his damage when hee knowes
it, Fourthly, to doe equall Iuſtice to rich and
poore, &amp;c. without reſpect of perſons. Fiftly, to
receive no reward. Sixtly, to take no Fee of any
other then the King. Seventhly, to commit ſuch
as breake the peace in the face of Iuſtice. Eightly,
not to mantayne any ſuite. Ninthly, not to deny
Iuſtice notwithſtanding the Kings Letters or
Commandements, and in that Caſe to certifie the
King of the truth. Tenthly, by reaſonable wages
to procure the profits of the Crowne. Eleventhly,
if he be found in default, in any the matters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
to bee in the Kings mercie, body, Lands, and
goods.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon principally moveth from
the following particulars; In the Kings Bench
the Major-part of the Iudges denyed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
writ of prohibition to the late Court called
the high Commiſſion, in a cauſe meerely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
The foure Courts of Iuſtice durſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in any cauſe depending before the chiefe
Governor, or at the Counſell-board upon paper
petitions, or rather voyde petitions, theſe paper-petitions
being the oblique lines aforeſaid, grave
Iudges of the law were commonly aſſiſtants, and
more commonly referrees in the proceedings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48487:23"/>
theſe paper-petitions, in what cauſes? in all
cauſes proper for the Cognizance of the Common-law,
and determinable by writs of right, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of right, and ſo to the moſt inferior action,
the like of the Courts of equitie, whether this be
lawfully to ſerve the King and his people, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King, was at loſſe by the non-proſecuting
of the cauſes aforeſaid in their proper orbes, by
originall writs, which might afford the King a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
revenue, and likewiſe by the loſſe of fines, and
amerciaments, naturall to actions at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law,
or whether the loſſe aforeſaid was made
knowne to his Majeſtie, or who conſented to the
Kings damage therein, or whether this be a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of juſtice? to deferre it upon paper Orders or
Commaunds, be conformable to that Oath, I will
pretermit; yet your Lordſhips may even in this
miſt diſcerne a cleere ground for the ſecond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>The motive which in part ſtirred the third,<note place="margin">3. &amp; 4. q. 3. &amp; 4. ratio.</note> and
fourth queſtions, was the infinity of Civill cauſes,
of all natures without exception of perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
limitation of time proceeded in, ordered, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
and determined upon paper-petitions at
Counſell-board, &amp; by the chiefe Governor alone;
The Commons of this kingdome obſerving the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48487:24"/>
Iudges of the law who were Counſellors of eſtate,
to have agreed and ſigned unto ſuch Orders, the
Iudges of the foure Courts, and Iuſtices of Aſſize
in all the partes of the kingdome to bee referrees
upon ſuch proceedings, wherby theſe new deviſes,
were become ſo notorious, that as all men heavily
groaned under them, ſo no man could bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them.</p>
               <p>By the colour of Proclamations more &amp; more
frequent,<note place="margin">5. 6. 7. q. 5. 6. 7. rat.</note> and of the Orders, and Acts of ſtate at
Counſell-board, which were in a manner infinite,
and other proceedings mentioned in theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
theſe effects were produced; Firſt impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cloſe impriſonment, of ſuch numbers, that
a great defeate in a battle could hardly fill more
gaoles and priſons, then by theſe meanes were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Secondly by ſeizures made by
crewes of Catchpoles and Caterpillers, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Leige people loſt their goods, as if loſt in a
battaile, nay worſe without hope of ranſome;
Thirdly poſſeſſions were altered, and that ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and ſo many, that more poſſeſſions were loſt
by theſe courſes in a few yeares, then in all the
Courts of Iuſtice in <hi>Ireland</hi> in an age or two; The
fourth effect was this, after liberty was taken away,
propertie altered, and poſſeſſion loſt, by the wayes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48487:24"/>
aforeſaid, that was not ſufficient, the ſubject muſt
be pillored, papered, ſtigmatized, and the image
of God ſo defaced with indignities, that his life
became a continuing death the worſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in theſe feates were adviſing, and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſome grave and learned Iudges of the Land,
who were Counſellors of eſtate, as by their ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may appeare.</p>
               <p>The houſe of Commons finding as yet no
warrant of preſident, nor countenance of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the law of <hi>England,</hi> to beare up the courſes
aforeſaid, have drawne the ſaid <hi>Queſtions</hi> from the
effects aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8. q. 8. rat.</note> the liberty, eſtate in lands or goods,
the perſon of the ſubject; nay his honor and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
being invaded, altered, and debaſed in manner
aforeſaid, there remayned yet one thing, his Life:
See how this is brought into play, nothing muſt
eſcape, were not the Gates of <hi>Ianus</hi> ſhut up, was
not the Kings peace univerſall in his three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
when a Peere of this Realme, a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of the Kings, a great Officer of ſtate was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to be ſhot to death in a Court Marſhall,
what the cauſe was, what defence was permitted,
what time given, and what loſſe ſuſtayned? I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to your Lordſhips, as therein moſt neerely
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48487:25"/>
concerned, were not others actually executed by
Marſhall law, at ſuch time as the Kings Iuſtice in
his Courts of law, was not to be avoyded by any
perſon whatſoever. This was in part the ground
of the eight queſtion.</p>
               <p>This queſtion is plaine,<note place="margin">9. q. 9. rat.</note> a late introduced pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
here, contrary to former uſe, and no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
preſident to warrant ſuch proſecution for a
voluntary Oath, and the great benefit, and quiet
accrewed to his Majeſties people by arbiterments
conceived by conſent of parties, hath in part occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Heretofore this Confeſſion was not required,<note place="margin">10. queſt. 10. ratio.</note>
for the Iuſtneſſe of the Iudgements was then able
enough to beare them up, and if the judgement
in ſome Caſe had beene otherwiſe, what force can
the confeſſion of a delinquent add to a Iudiciall
act,<note place="margin">11. queſt. 11. ratio.</note> this is part of the reaſon for this queſtion.</p>
               <p>A complaint exhibited in the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
touching the denyall of the Copy of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
which the complaynant undertooke to Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
in part raiſed this queſtion.</p>
               <p>In <hi>King Iames</hi> his time,<note place="margin">12. q. 12. rat.</note> by an order concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Court of Exchequer upon great debate,
and warranted by ancient preſidents the reſpite of
homage was reduced to a certaintie, <hi>viz.</hi> two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48487:25"/>
ſixe pence ſterling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For a Mannor yearly, and
ſo for Townes, and other portions of Land, this
courſe was alwayes held untill now of late the
reſpite is arbitrarily rayſed as appeares by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

but cannot finde any order or warrant for it,
untill the fifth yeare of the ſaid Kings raigne, and
there, in <hi>Easter Terme</hi> 1607. I finde an order en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
directing what homage every man ſhould pay
a Copy whereof you have already from mee, the
preamble of which orders ſheweth that, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had beene long depending in the Court unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
which induceth me, to beleeve that there
was no former preſident or order in it. About
three yeares after, the freeholders of the Countie
of <hi>Antrim</hi> as it ſhould ſeeme, finding this rate to
be too heavy for them, they petitioned to the Lord
<hi>Chichester</hi> then Lord Deputy for reliefe therein, &amp;
I finde his Lordſhips opinion to the Court thus
Recorded.</p>

where his preſence is more apparant and eſſentiall

               <p>It appeares copiouſly by the great Charter, and

               <p>So that the anſwer as to the words (in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall)
is ſhort and ought to be poſitive.</p>
               <p>As to the Courtes of equitie they have beene
ancient in <hi>England,</hi> and the Courts of eqnity here,
ought to bee guided by the conſtant proceedings
in <hi>England</hi> in ages paſt, I meane not, by this or
that Chancellor but by that naturall and juſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Courts here obſerved. This equitie is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48487:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of abſolute neceſſitie in many caſes (<hi>ipſae etenim le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

within the law of the Land, and not to bee
devided from it, as out of this writing it may bee
inferred.</p>
               <p>As to the caſe of killing in rebellion to operate
an Attaynder, if this bee no law in <hi>England</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee law here, <hi>vide Dame-hales caſe com. 263. a.
8. Edw. 3. 20. fitz Dower 106. Cromptons Iuriſdiction
fol. 84. a.</hi> by which it may be urged, that it is an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynder
for that hee prevented the judgement of
law by fighting againſt the Crowne, and by his
killing therein, which enſued his unlawfull and
trayterous act, but I obſerve to the contrary, the
books of 7. <hi>Henr. 4. 32 b. &amp; Cook. 4. 57. Sadlers caſe.</hi>
I doe confeſſe that in <hi>England</hi> ſtatutes may be <hi>obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete</hi>
as the ſtatute of <hi>VVilliam Butler,</hi> by which the

<hi>Merton</hi> of diſparagment as to an action to bee
brought for the ſame, ſo are ſome antiquated lawes,
40. <hi>Edw. 3. 42. 42. aſſ. 8. &amp;</hi> 25. one preſent &amp; aiding

<hi>Hen. 7. 18. Com. 99. &amp;</hi> 100. a Vicar could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

entry upon a <hi>feoffee</hi> with warranty <hi>ſit fol.</hi> 23. 24. in
the caſe of diſparagement, give the reaſon, becauſe
that thoſe ſtatutes and lawes were never uſed, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>obſolete,</hi> our caſe is nothing like, for life, liberty,
and propertie being in debate, but an <hi>obſolete</hi> law is
no law in force. Therefore the anſwer as to that is
defective.</p>
               <p>As to the caſe of a fellon upon his keeping and
terrifying of the people, I conceive the anſwer is
uncertaine and dangerous, if ſuch a fellon raiſe an
armed power againſt the Crowne and terrifie that
way no doubt this is treaſon within the ſtatute of
25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. or the equity of it, and by the ſtatute of
10. <hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 13. in <hi>Ireland, ſtatuto Hiberniae fol.</hi> 62.
but if ſuch terrifying be without raiſing armes,
or by committing the ſame or the like fellonies, it
is no more then the caſe of purſe-takers by force
in the high wayes of <hi>England,</hi> many a man was
terrified thereby in <hi>Salisbury-plaine,</hi> and yet no
treaſon; and if there be no ſtatute here, which is
not in <hi>England,</hi> to make it treaſon certainly it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be treaſon; ſince the Conqueſt, writ of error
have been brought for to reverſe Iudgments given
in the Kings Bench here, in the Court of Kings
Bench in <hi>England,</hi> no courſe here which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to law, can alter the law of <hi>England,</hi> therefore, to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48487:36"/>
what purpoſe is a declaration of Iudges here, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the law there. This writ of error is a writ
framed in the Regiſter and appeares by common
experience. I will offer a notable caſe which I ſaw
adjudged in the Kings Bench in <hi>England, Paſc. 18.
Iacobi</hi> for <hi>Stafford</hi> againſt <hi>Stafford</hi> in a writ of error
for to reverſe a Iudgment given in the Kings
Bench in <hi>Ireland</hi> when <hi>Sir VVilliam Iones</hi> was Chiefe
Iuſtice here, in an <hi>ejectione firme,</hi> for that in the
declaration there was contained among other
things <hi>ducentas acras Montani. Sir VVilliam Iones</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>England,</hi> affirmed the courſe here, to have
been ſo, and vouched many notable Preſidents,
thereupon an order was conceived that <hi>Sir Iames
Ley, Sir Humphry VVinch,</hi> and <hi>Sir Iohn Denham</hi>
knights, who were formerly Chiefe Iuſtices here
ſhould certifie the courſe, who made report that
the courſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> was and ought to be, in writts
originall and Iudiciall to be directed by the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
in pleading to be guided by the books of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and thereupon the Iudgement was reverſed,
And the Chiefe Iuſtice <hi>Mountague</hi> ſaid, that if they
did not proceed in <hi>Ireland</hi> according to law, they
ſhould learne it, And ſo I conclude that the anſwer
to the firſt Queſtion, is inſufficient.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſecond Queſtion,<note place="margin">2. Queſt.</note> which is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48487:37"/>
concerning the Oath which this Iudges doe take,
the queſtion is whether the Iudges of the land doe

               <p>The anſwer of the Iudges to the firſt part is,<note place="margin">2. Anſwe.</note>
that they confeſſe they take the Oath of Iudges,

may not ſtay, hinder, or delay the ſuite of any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

otherwiſe then according to the law and courſe of
the Court, where they ſit under pretence of any

under the great Seale, or privie Seale, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
Signet, or Letter, or other Commandement
from the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Deputy Iuſtice,

moſt of which doth appeare by their Oath
expreſſed, expreſſed in the ſaid ſtatutes, and the
ſtatute of 2. <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 8. and the ſtatute of 20. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
as to the Barons of the Exchequer, and as they
know no puniſhments due to the Iudges for
their deviations and tranſgreſſions without other
aggravation, ſo they know no puniſhment layd

and tranſgreſſions, in hindering, ſtaying, or

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48487:37"/>
other then what is declared in their ſaid Oath, and
the ſtatute of 20. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>I conceive the anſwer is not a full and perfect
anſwer to the <hi>Question.</hi> For where the <hi>Question</hi> is
whether the Iudges under pretext of any act of
ſtate, proclamation, writ, Letter or direction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great, or privie Seale, or privie Signet, or
Letter, or other Commandement from the Lord
Lieutenant, Lord Deputie, Iuſtice, or Iuſtices, or

they may hinder, ſtay, or delay the ſuite of

if ſo, in what caſes, and whether, if they doe
hinder, ſtay, or delay ſuch ſuite, judgement, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
thereupon, what puniſhment doe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
for their deviations and tranſgreſſions
therein.</p>
               <p>To this they anſwer, that they may not ſtay,
hinder, or delay the ſuite of any ſubject, or his
judgement, or execution therupon otherwiſe then
according to the law, &amp; courſe of the Court, where
they ſit, under pretence of any act of ſtate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
writ, letter, or direction, under the great
or privie Seale, or privie ſignet, or letter, or other
commandement from the Lord Lieutenant, Lord
Deputy, Iuſtice, or Iuſtices, or other chiefe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48487:38"/>
or Governors of this kingdome, whereas they
ought to have expreſſed the particular of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
for by that clauſe, it is ſuppoſed, or may
be ſtrongly implyed, that in ſome caſes they may
hinder, ſtay, or delay the ſuite of any ſubject, or
his judgement, or execution therupon, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of any act of ſtate, proclamation, letter, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
under the great or privie Seale, or privie

other chiefe governor, or governors of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which they ought to have expreſſely layd
downe, the queſtion being if they may ſtay, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or delay the ſuite of any ſubject upon any ſuch
pretext, then to ſet forth in what Caſes, which
ought to be particularly anſwered unto.</p>
               <p>In the next place the <hi>Question</hi> is, if they doe
ſtay, hinder, or delay ſuch ſuite, judgement, or
execution therupon, then to ſet forth what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they doe incurre for their deviation, or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
therein.</p>
               <p>Vnto this they anſwer, they know no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to the Iudges for their deviation, and
tranſgreſſions without other aggravation,</p>
               <p>This I conceive is an implication, that there
is a puniſhment where there is matter of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48487:38"/>
and therefore it ought to be expreſſed what
matter of aggravation they intend the ſame to be.</p>
               <p>They further ſay, they know no puniſhment:
layd downe by any law againſt them, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations
or tranſgreſſions in hindering, ſtaying or
delaying of Iuſtice contrary to their Oath, other
then what is declared in their ſaid Oath, and the
ſtatute of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>This I conceive not to bee a full anſwer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the puniſhment layd downe in that Oath, is
in a generality; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Iudges ſo offending
contrary to their Oath, are to be at the Kings will
of body lands and goods, which they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
and expreſſe how farre that puniſhment
extendeth in their bodies, lands, and goods.</p>
               <p>Whether impriſonment of their bodies, or in
their lives, and whether in forfeiture of their lands
goods, or how elſe?</p>
               <p>The breach of an Oath is a very high offence,
and the higher it is, that the matter it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
is the greater, and therefore it is much, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
ſubjectam materiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be conſidered to whom the oath of a
Iudge is made, and what matter it doth concerne.</p>
               <p>To the firſt the Oath is made to GOD, the King
and to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48487:39"/>
For the matter, it is concerning the true and
equall adminiſtration and diſtribution of Iuſtice
to the people.</p>
               <p>If the Iudge doe offend contrary to his Oath,
he commits breach of the truſt repoſed in him by
the King, beſides the violation of his Oath. Looke
upon truſt betweene Common perſons. A man
makes a Leaſe for yeares, the Leſſee makes a ſcoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this is a forfeyture of his eſtate by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law,<note place="margin">5. Ed. 4. 2.</note>
by reaſon of the breach of truſt. Leſſee
for life in an action brought againſt him prayes
in ayde of a ſtranger: this is a forfeyture of his
eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A quid Iuris clamat</hi> brought againſt Leſſee for
life,<note place="margin">36. Hen. 6. 29.</note> he claymes a fee, which is found againſt him,
this is a forfeyture of his eſtate. So much for
breach of truſt.</p>
               <p>To come unto a falſe verdict given by a Iurie,<note place="margin">14. Hen. 7. 13.</note>
which is a breach of their Oath, they being ſworne
<hi>ad veritatem dicendam.</hi> For this falſe verdict an
attaynt lyeth at Common law againſt the petit
Iury.</p>
               <p>The judgement at the Common-law in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynt
importeth eight grievous puniſhments. 1.
<hi>Quod amittat liberam legem in perpetuum. 2. quod
forisfaciat omnia bona &amp; Catalla ſua, 3. quod terrae
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48487:39"/>
&amp; tenementa in manus Domini Regis capiantur, 4.
quod uxores &amp; liberi extradomus ſuas eijoiantur, 5.
quod domus ſuae proſtrentur, 6. quod arbores ſuae extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentur,
7. quod prata ſua arentur, 8 &amp; quod cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora
ſua Carceri mancipentur.</hi> So odious is perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in the eye of the Common-law. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
therefore that the breach of the Oath of a
Iudge, <hi>materia conſiderata,</hi> in regard it tends to the
ſubverſion of Iuſtice, is an offence of an higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deſerving a farre greater puniſhment in his
body, lands, and goods, as I conceive.</p>
               <p>This queſtion is very ſhort and as plaine,<note place="margin">3. queſt.</note> it is
no more then whether the <hi>Councell-table</hi> be <hi>a Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie,</hi>

or practiſe contrary to ſo many ſtatutes are
of no uſe, in many ages paſt encroachments were
made upon theſe juſt liberties, which were alwayes
removed by Parliaments. Yet I muſt confeſſe that
of all antiquity ſome pleas have beene held in the
Kings Royall houſe, as in the Court held by the
Marſhall of the Kings houſhold for things ariſing
within the <hi>Verge, Fleta, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 2. but when that
Court exceeds its due bounds, declaratory ſtatutes
were alwayes made to meete them as miſchiefes in
the common-wealth, when they medled with land
or the like, as appeares by the ſtatute of <hi>Articule
ſuper Chartam 28. Edw. 1. 15. R. 2. cap.</hi> 12. all theſe
ſtatutes <hi>My Lords,</hi> and many more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
are undenyably of force in this kingdome,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48487:40"/>
and none of them can be with impunitie ſaid to be
<hi>obſolete</hi> or antiquated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> they raiſe another doubt, <hi>viz</hi> that as
the King may grant cognizance of pleas to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
or the like, and therefore to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-table;
if this neede an anſwer, I will anſwer it
thus, that a grant of cognizance never was, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it be otherwiſe, then to proceede <hi>per legem
terrae,</hi> or <hi>per judicium parium,</hi> &amp; in the ſame manner
as Courts doe proceede at Common-law, and not
upon paper petitions, or ſummary hearings ſuch
cognizance was never granted, the King is at loſſe
by ſuch proceedings, he looſeth fines upon origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
he looſeth amerciaments, and fines incident
to every judgement at Common-law, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I he ſubject undergoeth an inconvenience.
Firſt the law will decline, writs originall will by
diſuſe be forgotten, Clerks who ſhould draw them
diſcouraged to learne, legall proceedings out of
doores being the foundation of the law, and in
ſtead of regular and orderly proceeding, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and barbariſme introduced, the ſubject will
looſe the benefit of his attaynte and writ of error;
by which the law might relieve him againſt falſe
verdicts or erroneous judgments he will looſe the
benefit of his warranty, which might repaire a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48487:41"/>
in caſe his acquired purchaſe were not good.
Whereas if a Iudge or Iuror doe wrong, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is at hand, but againſt the Lord Deputy and
Councell, who will ſeeke for it? therefore the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of this <hi>Iudicature</hi> in Common-pleas, is
againſt the Kings prerogative, and the peoples juſt
rights: both which the Iudges ought to maintaine,
and likewiſe againſt the intent of your Lordſhips
order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> the ſaid ſeverall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

                  </note> whereas in

is of matters of puniſhment, in an extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

of the puniſhment due to ſuch as vote for

matters there is no anſwer at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> the ſtatutes and authorities before

againſt the determination at Councell-board, or

do cleare this buſineſſe, as to the puniſhments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending

And as for ſuch as voted, and acted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
if they beſworne Iudges of the law, the before
recited Oath of 18. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. declares enough.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty at his Coronation is bound by
Oath to execute juſtice to his people according to
the lawes, this great truſt the King commits to his
Iudges, who take a great Oath to diſcharge this
truſt, if they fayle therein. <hi>Sir VVilliam Thorp</hi> in

things, was indicted thus. <hi>Quia praedictus VVilliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

               </p>
               <p>The truſt betweene the King and his people is
threefold; Firſt as betweene Soveraigne and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
Secondly, as betweene a Father and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>under Pater Patriae;</hi> Thirdly, as betweene Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">7. Queſt.</note> I doe conceive that an act of ſtate or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation

the old, nor introduce a new law, and that
the ſame hath no power, or force to bind the goods
lands, poſſeſſions, or inheritance of the ſubject,
but that the infringing thereof is onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
which may bee puniſhed in the perſon of
the delinquent, where the Proclamation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant,
and agreeable to the lawes, and ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of the kingdome, or for the publicke good,
and not againſt law, and not otherwiſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable.</p>
               <p>I do conceive, that a Proclamation is a branch
of the Kings prerogative, and that the ſame is
uſefull and neceſſary in ſome caſes, where it is not
againſt the law, wherein the publicke weale is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted,
or concerned, but that any clauſe therein,
contayning forfeyture of the goods, lands, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the ſubjects, is meerely voyde; for
otherwiſe this inconvenience will enſue, That
Proclamations or acts of ſtate, may bee made in
all caſes, and in all matters to bind the libertie,
goods, and lands of the ſubjects; and then the
Courts of Iuſtice that have flouriſhed for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ages may be ſhut up, for want of uſe of the law,
or execution thereof, and there is no caſe where
an offence is committed againſt law, but the law
will find out away to puniſh the delinquent.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48487:48"/>
leſſe force then the Kings patent under the great

               <p>And in the <hi>caſe</hi> of <hi>Iriſh Gavelkind,</hi> it is not
the proclamation, or act of ſtate, that did abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,

               <p>If an act of ſtate bee made,<note place="margin">11. Co. 86.</note> that none within

this act is voyde, for the King himſelfe, cannot

of good and wholeſome lawes.</p>
               <p>Therefore I conceive, that all proclamations

how far an Oath in the particular is puniſhable,
I will not ſpeake of an Oath exacted, or tendered,

in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> as the Iudges would
affirme, which I conceive to bee againſt the law:
Firſt, for that wee cannot learne any preſident in

therefore the houſe of Commons is unſatisfied
with the anſwer to this queſtion, in <hi>Boyton</hi> and
<hi>Leonards caſe</hi> in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> in <hi>Ireland, Boyton</hi>
was diſmiſſed in a Caſe to this purpoſe about the

               <p>It hath beene the late introduced courſe of the

                  <note place="margin">10. Queſt.</note> and <hi>Councell-table</hi> not to admit the

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48487:50"/>
hee acknowledged the juſtneſſe of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
pronounced againſt him, and that for divers
reaſons, Firſt, the courſe of a Court being as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
as the Court, and ſtanding with law is <hi>Curiae
lex,</hi> as appeareth by our bookes, 2. <hi>Co. 16. b. Lanes
caſe 17. Long 5. Edw.</hi> 4. 1. but if it be a courſe intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>de novo</hi> in mans memorie, or a courſe that

<hi>conſuetudo licet ſit magnae authoritatis nunquam tamen

               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore examine the courſe alleadged
here, in both thoſe points, and if it be found to faile
in eyther of them it is to be rejected.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, I cannot find or read any preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of it untill of late, and the uſage of it for a
few yeares cannot make it to be <hi>curſus Curiae</hi> which
ought to bee a cuſtome uſed time beyond the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of man.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, it is confeſſed by the Iudges,
that they know no law to warrant this courſe, let
us ſee then whether it be againſt law, or ſtandeth
with the law, and I conceive it is againſt law for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the Common-law, if a judgement be
given againſt a man after a verdict of twelve men,
which is the chiefe and cleare proofe which the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48487:51"/>
law looketh upon, or upon a demurrer after ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
argument he ſhall in the one caſe have an
attainte againſt the Iury, &amp; in the other a writ of
error to reverſe the judgement; but in this caſe by
the confeſſion of the juſtneſſe of the ſentence all
the meanes to reverſe the ſentence is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and therefore contrary to law, and reaſon.
Whereas by the Common-law, fines ought to bee
moderate <hi>ſecundum quantitatem delicti in reformatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
&amp; non in destructionem,</hi> of late times, the fines
have beene ſo high in deſtruction of the party in
the <hi>Caſtle-chamber,</hi> as his whole family and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
if hee did pay the fine ſhould bee driven to
begge, and without performance of the ſentence
hee could not be admitted to reverſe the ſentence,
in reſpect of all which, howbeit in his conſcience
he is not guiltie, yet to gaine his libertie, and ſave
part of his eſtate, hee is neceſſitated to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the juſtneſſe of the ſentence, ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
is extorted from him, and conſequently is
againſt law.</p>
               <p>Third reaſon if the fine were <hi>ſecundum quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
delicti,</hi> as it ought to be without danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
the reducement of the fine had not been
ſo neceſſarie: and therefore no juſt ground for this
confeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48487:51"/>
Laſtly, the confeſſion of the party after ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
doth rather blemiſh the ſentence then any
way cleare it, for the confeſſion comming after the
ſentence, which ought to be juſt in it ſelfe can adde
nothing to it but draw ſuſpition upon it, and in
that reſpect a confeſſion is ſtrayned, the racke uſed
by the courſe of the Civill law in criminall cauſes,
to cleare the conſcience of the Iudge to proceede
to ſentence, is intollerable in our Common-law.</p>
               <p>And therefore this courſe being an innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt law, &amp; without any reaſonable ground;
the ſaid Iudges ought in their ſaid anſwer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
ſo much, to the end a courſe might bee taken
for aboliſhing the ſame.</p>
               <p>This anſwer I will not now draw into queſtion,<note place="margin">11. Queſt.</note>
I could wiſh the reſt were anſwered no worſe.<note place="margin">11. Anſw.</note>

&amp;c.<note place="margin">12. Anſw.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto this they anſwer, that untill the Kings
Tenant by knights ſervice in <hi>capite</hi> hath done his
homage, the ancient courſe of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> hath
beene, and ſtill is, to iſſue proceſſe, to diſtrayne
the tenants <hi>ad faciendum homagium,</hi> or <hi>ad faciendum
finem pro homagio ſuo reſpectuando,</hi> upon which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48487:52"/>
the Sheriffe returnes iſſues, and if the tenant
doe not appeare, and compound with the King to
give a fine for reſpite of homage, then the iſſues
are forfeyted to the King. But if the Kings te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
will appeare, the Court of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> doth
agree with him to reſpite his homage for a ſmall
fine.</p>
               <p>They ſay further,<note place="margin">Vide 5.</note> that it reſteth in the diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Court by the rule of the Common-law
to lay downe a fine for reſpite of homage,<note place="margin">Henr. 7. 9. a. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Cattle untill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, not good.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the yearely value of the ſaid lands, which
I conceive to be very unreaſonable and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
that it ſhould lye in the power of any to
aſſeſſe a fine for reſpite of homage, ſuch as to him
ſhall be thought meete in diſcretion, for if ſo hee
may raiſe the fine to ſuch a ſumme, as may exceed
the very value of the lands. Neyther hath the
ſame beene the ancient courſe, for it appeares by
ſeverall ancient Records, and by an Order of the
Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> made <hi>Termino paſcae</hi> 1607. that
there ſhould be payed for reſpiting of homage for
every Towneſhip xx. d. <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and for every Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

paſture, or of any of them xx. d. <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and no
more, and according to that rate, and proportion
if a greater, or leſſer number of Acres, and for
every houſe without ground iiij. d. <hi>Iriſh,</hi>

               <p>And I conceive where a man holdeth ſeverall
parcels of land of the King by ſeverall homages,
that in ſuch caſe he is to pay but for one reſpite of
homage onely and no more, for that a man is to
doe homage but once, and conſequently to pay
for one reſpite of homage onely.</p>
               <p>The late courſe in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> here hath been
contrary, whereas in their anſwer they goe in the
<hi>Exchequer,</hi> according to the ſtatute of <hi>primo Iacobi

cleare contrary, for that ſtatute was made in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,

<hi>England,</hi> and 25. <hi>Henr. 6. cap.</hi> 2. in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as to
the ſubjects of <hi>Ireland.</hi> As for the firſt the <hi>Register</hi>
hath a writ framed in the point, <hi>viz.</hi> the writ <hi>De
ſecuritate in venienda quod ſe non divertat ad partes
extras ſine licentia Domini Regis, Fitz. Natur. br. fol.</hi> 85
the words of this writ cleares the Common-law
in the point, it begins with a <hi>datum eſt nobis intelligi,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48487:53"/>
&amp;c.</hi> The King being informed that ſuch perſon or
perſons in particular doe intend to goe, whether
<hi>ad partes exteras, viz.</hi> foraigne Countries, to what
purpoſe, to proſecute matters to the prejudice of
the King &amp; his Crowne, the King in ſuch a caſe by
his writ, warrant, or Command under the great
Seale, privie Seale, privy Signet or by proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may command any ſubject not to depart the
kingdome without the Kings licence; this writ is
worthy to be obſerved, for the cauſes aforeſaid
therein expreſſed, the writ extendeth only to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſon or perſons, &amp; not to all the ſubjects
of the kingdome, no man can affirme that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is <hi>pars extera</hi> as to us, <hi>Ireland</hi> is annexed to the
Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and governed by the lawes
of <hi>England:</hi> our queſtion ſet forth the cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
to appeale to the King for Iuſtice, or to goe to
<hi>England,</hi> for other lawfull cauſes, whereas the ſaid
writ intends practiſes with foraigne Princes to the
prejudice of the King and his Crowne; At the
Common-law, if a ſubject in contempt of this
Command went <hi>ad partes exteras,</hi> his Lands, and
goods ought to be ſeized, 2. <hi>&amp; 3. Philip. &amp; Mary
Dy. 128. b.</hi> and yet if the ſubject went to the parts
beyond the Seas before any ſuch ſpeciall inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this was not puniſhable before the ſtatute of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48487:54"/>
5. <hi>Rich. 2. cap.</hi> 2. as appeares, 12. <hi>&amp; 13. Elizab. Dy.
296. a.</hi> So that before the inhibition, the law was
indifferent, now the queſtion is at Common-law,
whether the ſubject of <hi>Ireland</hi> having no Office,
can be hindered to appeale or goe to the King for
Iuſtice: The King is the fountaine of Iuſtice, and
as his power is great to command, ſo the Scepter
of his Iuſtice is as great, nay the Scepter hath the
priority, if any be, for at his Coronation, his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is on his right ſide, &amp; his Sword on his left ſide
to his Iuſtice he is ſworne, therefore if any writ,
Commandement or proclamation bee obtayned
from him, or publiſhed contrary to his Iuſtice, it
is not the act of the King, but the act of him that
miſinformed him, then will I adde the other words
of the queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> or other his lawfull occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as I ſaid before in the caſe of a writ of error
in the Kings Bench of <hi>England,</hi> or in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> which are remedies given by the
law, therefore the Common-law doth not hinder
any man to proſecute thoſe remedies which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to everie ſubject by the ſame <hi>A ſcire facias</hi>
may be brought by the King in <hi>England</hi> to repeale
a patent under the great Seale of <hi>Ireland</hi> of lands

               <p>An exchange of lands in <hi>England</hi> for lands in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48487:54"/>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> is a good exchange in law, 8. <hi>aſs. placit. 27.
10. Edw. 3. fol. 42. tempor. Edw. 1. Fitz voucher</hi> 239.
What law therefore can prohibit any ſubject for
to attend this <hi>ſcire facias</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or to make uſe
of his freehold got by exchange.</p>
               <p>The law being thus, then it was conſidered,
what alteration was wrought by one branch of
the ſtatute of 5 <hi>Rich. 2. cap.</hi> 2. by which the paſſage
is ſtopped out of the kingdome (Lords, notable
Marchants, and the Kings ſouldiers excepted) I
conceive this ſtatute doth not include <hi>Ireland, I</hi>
never heard any <hi>Iriſhman</hi> queſtioned upon this
ſtatute for going into <hi>England,</hi> nor any <hi>Engliſhman</hi>
for comming into <hi>Ireland</hi> untill the late procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
by the ſtatute 34. <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 18. in <hi>England,</hi>
all perſons which have their heritage or poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may come with their beaſts, corne,
&amp;c. to and fro, paying the Kings dues. The ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 5. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. did never intend by implication
to avoyde the ſaid expreſſe ſtatute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Kings two kingdomes, being governed
by one law, &amp; in effect the ſame people, the words
of the ſtatute of 5. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. are obſervable, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ſcope of it is againſt the exportation of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
in the later part there is a clauſe for licences
to be had in particular Portes, by which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48487:55"/>
that the Cuſtomers of thoſe Portes may
grant a let paſſe in ſuch Caſes.</p>
               <p>It is therefore to be conſidered, whether that
branch of the ſaid ſtatute of 5. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I thinke it is cleare it was not, for
by the ſtatute 10. <hi>Henr. 7. cap.</hi> 22. in <hi>Ireland,</hi> all the
generall ſtatutes of <hi>England</hi> were received in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with this qualification, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as were for
the Common and publicke weale, &amp;c. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it cannot be for the weale of this kingdome,
that the ſubjects here be ſtayed from obtayning
of Iuſtice, or following other lawfull cauſes in
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

which is never in greater ſplendor or Majeſtie

was done in our caſe in one day, ſix ſuch dayes may

Parliaments, eſpecially as this caſe was,

in objecto,</hi> to admit them Burgeſſes, and to

were formerly, both anciently and recently ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in Parliament, <hi>Master Littleton,</hi> the firſt
booke we reade cleares this queſtion, <hi>ſectione</hi> 164.
There are ancient Townes called <hi>Borroughs,</hi> the
moſt ancient Townes of <hi>England,</hi> all Cities were
Borroughs in the beginning, and from them
come <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> to the Parliament, ſo that in effect
if an ancient Borrough, <hi>ergo,</hi> they ſent Burgeſſes
to the Parliament; all theſe ancient Townes in
<hi>England,</hi> did remayne of Record in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
40. <hi>aſſ. plac.</hi> 27. In <hi>Ireland</hi> they doe remayne
of Record in the Parliament Rolles, the tryall of
them is by the Record it ſelfe, and not otherwiſe;
If a Towne ſend <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> once or twice, it is Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
enough to ſend ever after, 11. <hi>Henr.</hi> 4. 2. So if
a Peere called once by writ, and once ſitting as a
Peere, <hi>Co. inſtitut. fol. 9. b.</hi> hee is a Baron ever
after.</p>
               <p>In the foure ordinary Courts they have privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for the meaneſt of their members, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
why not the Parliament. It was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the ancient grave Iudges to conſult with
parliaments in cauſes of difficultie &amp; weight, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was then to be at hand, they did not ſtay
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48487:58"/>
to adviſe with them in a point which concerned
the parliament, ſo neerely and which was of the
greateſt weight of any cauſe that ever was agitated
in the kingdome: In our books, &amp; all the entries it
is true and cleare, that <hi>Quo-warrantoes</hi> are brought
and ought to bee brought againſt ſuch as clayme
priviledges, Franchiſes, Royalties, or the like
flowers of the Crowne: but to queſtion Burgeſſes
in this nature is to queſtion the Kings preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in an high degree; priviledges take from the
King, parliaments adde, and give unto him great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and profit, in parliaments he ſits eſſentially,
in other Courts not altogether ſo, but by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,
what greater diſſervice could bee done
the King, then to overthrow parliaments, how
ſhall Subſidies bee granted, or the kingdome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
how ſhall <hi>ardua Regni</hi> be conſidered? Oh
the Barons of the Exchequer, I wot will ſalve all
theſe doubts.</p>
               <p>I may not forget <hi>My Lords,</hi> how the law of the
land, &amp; the whole Common-wealth is herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and upon that I will offer a Caſe or two,
If a ſtatute be made wherein the private intereſt
of a ſubject, or the generall intereſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
be enacted, the King by his Letters-patents
cannot diſpence with this ſtatute, <hi>Co. 8. 29.

nor make any grant, <hi>Non obstante</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law,
therefore I conclude this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is againſt the Kings prerogative,
to iſſue ſuch <hi>à Quo-warranto,</hi> as is here ſtated. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
it is againſt the Common-wealth, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of parliaments, and conſequently of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Thirdly this is no priviledge but a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
done to the King &amp; whole Common-wealth,
which cannot receive ſo much as a debate but in
parliament. Fourthly all the proceedings in the
Excheqver, touching this parliament were <hi>Coram
non judice,</hi> as was already voted in both houſes, as
for the puniſhment, we come not to urge your
Lordſhips to puniſh other then with reference to
that which I ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> the Oath.</p>

to be in affirmance of the ancient Common-law,
as to this point of law, the Iudges of the law are
Iudges of the validitie of the evidence, but under
favour not of the truth of the fact, as it is ſet forth
in the anſwer; if the Iudges of the law doe erre in
matter of law, the party grieved hath his remedie

and other bookes by the ſame reaſon the Iudges
of the fact, if they goe according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
as our queſtion is ſtated, if the Iury in this
caſe goe contrary to their evidence, the Common-law
gives a full remedy by attainte, wherein the
judgement is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſt heavie if the Iurors have done
amiſſe as I ſaid before to another queſtion, yet in
this action the law gives credit to the verdict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48487:60"/>
it be falſified, for if a judgement be given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this verdict and after an attainte is brought,
no <hi>ſuper ſedeas</hi> can bee in this writ to hinder the
partie who recovered from his execution, 5. <hi>Henr.
7. 22. b. 33. Henr.</hi> 6. 21. otherwiſe in a writ of
error.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhips therefore may ſee what faith
is given to verdicts at Common-law, I obſerve
the notable caſe of 7. <hi>Henr. 4 41 b.</hi> where <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi>
anſwereth the King that would give judgement
contrary to his private knowledge.</p>
               <p>As for the next part of theſe two queſtions, it
was the late height of puniſhments, and the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of more cauſes to that Court, then in former
times, moved this debate, out of the ſtatute of
3 <hi>Henr. 7. cap.</hi> 1. concerning this Court. I make
theſe obſervations, firſt, that the Iudges of that
Court according their diſcretion may examen
great offences,<note place="margin">Verba Statut.</note> ſecondly, that they may puniſh
according to the demerits of delinquents after
the forme of the ſtatute thereof made, thirdly, in
like manner &amp; forme as they ſhould or ought to
be puniſhed if they were convict by the due order
of the Common-law For the firſt, what diſcretion
this is, we finde in our books, <hi>Co. 5. fol. 100. Rookes
caſe,</hi> diſcretion is to proceede within the bounds
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48487:60"/>
of law and reaſon, at Common-law a Man in a
Leete is fined but in ten groats for a light bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
in the <hi>Castle-chamber</hi> a Noble-man for an
offer of a ſwitch to a perſon inferior to him, upon
provocation perhaps given, was fined in foure
thouſand pound,<note place="margin">Lo. Viſc. Clanmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> committed to long impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and low acknowledgements were impoſed
on him. For the ſecond and third obſervations, if
men of quality and ranke were pillored, papered,
ſtigmatized, and fined to their deſtruction, in
caſes where if they had beene convicted by due
order of law, they could not be ſo puniſhed by any
law or ſtatute, I humbly offer to your Lordſhips
ſad and grave conſideration.</p>
               <p>And whether theſe courſes be warranted by the
ſaid ſtatute of 3. <hi>Henr. 7. cap.</hi> 1. or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
law or ſtatute of force in this Realme, and

what ſhall become of that great and noble try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
by which all the matters of our law regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
are tryable; And ſo I conclude that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to theſe two queſtions are not ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Whether in the Cenſures in the <hi>Caſtle-chamber,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18. Queſt.</note>

I conceive that in the Cenſures in the <hi>Caſtle-chamber,</hi>
regard is to bee had to the words of the
great Charter, <hi>viz. Salvo contenemento, &amp;c</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the great Charter, and in the ſtatute of
<hi>VVeſtminst. 1. cap. 6. amerciamentum</hi> and <hi>miſericordia</hi>
are expreſſed and not fines or <hi>redemptio,</hi> becauſe
a fine and an amerciament are in the old yeare
bookes uſed promiſcuouſly as <hi>Synonima,</hi> for one
and the ſame thing, and therefore in 10. <hi>Edw. 3.
fol. 9. &amp;</hi> 10. The Iurors of the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Ramſeis

ſtatutes of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>VVestm.</hi> 1. fines and
amerciaments had not beene or taken to be <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma,</hi>
the feazors of thoſe acts would not have ſo

which were alwayes moderate, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>à moderata miſericordia</hi> did lie for all men, <hi>ab enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meratione

Feoudo, &amp;c.</hi> and have thought of no redreſſe or
moderation of fines, which are more grievous,
and of late times infinitely ſwolne above amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaments,
for in 19. <hi>Edw. 4. fol.</hi> 9. and 21. <hi>Edw. 4.
fol.</hi> 77. the amerciament of an Earle Baron, &amp;c.
is but five pounds, and of a Duke ten pounds, yet
a Barons ancient fee or livelyhood conſiſteth of

foure hundred pounds, a Dukes of eight hundred

               </p>

                  <hi>miſericordiae,</hi> becauſe great moderation and mercy
muſt be uſed in taxing of them, <hi>Griſleyes caſe, 8.
Rep. fol. 48. a. b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, in caſe fines bee not within theſe
words of <hi>Magna Charta, amercietur ſalvo contene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,
&amp;c.</hi> yet ought they by law to be reaſonable
and not exceſſive, for every exceſſe is againſt law,

diſtreſſe is prohibited by the Common-law
41. <hi>Edw. 3. fol.</hi> 26. So is exceſſive and outragious

35. and by <hi>Glanv. l. 9. fol.</hi> 70. an aſſize lies for often
diſtrayning becauſe it is exceſſive, and therefore
againſt law an exceſſive fine, at the will of the
Lord is an oppreſſion of the people, 14. <hi>Henr. 4.

the Lord of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> cannot exact unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

of the fines ſhall bee determined by the Iudges
having reſpect to the value of the <hi>Coppy-hold, 4.
Rep. fol. 27. b.</hi> The King before the making of
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> had <hi>rationabile reliuum</hi> of noblemen
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48487:62"/>
and it was not reduced to any certaintie, yet ought
it to have beene reaſonable and not exceſſive, <hi>Co.
institut. 83. b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay that in a legall conſtruction, the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in which the words <hi>ſalvo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenemento</hi>
are mentioned, is onely to be underſtood
of amerciaments and not of fines, yet where great
fines are impoſed <hi>in terrorem,</hi> upon the reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of them, regard is to bee had to the ability
of the perſons.</p>
               <p>Now whereas they alleage that upon the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cements
of fines, regard is to bee had to the eſtate
of perſons, I humbly conceive that makes but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
eyther for the eaſe or ſecuritie of the ſubject,
or the providence or wiſedome of the law, for that
ſuch reducements are not grounded upon any
rule of law, but reſt meerely in the Kings grace
and bountie, which if the Prince ſhould withdraw,
and leave the ſubject to the law, in what caſe he is
in, I leave it to your Lordſhips. If there bee no
rule in this caſe, it may reſt in the arbitrarie will
of foure or five perſons in that Court to deſtroy
any man, &amp; in their will to reduce as they pleaſe,
but never to reduce before confeſſion of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which is deſtructive, wherein perhaps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is

The Common-law of the land hath three dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
life, libertie, and dower, the former recited
ſtatutes give protection to three things, to life,
eſtate, and libertie, the life of man is the eldeſt
Child admitted to the favour of the law, and the
firſt and chiefe within the protection of theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
the other two are but miniſters and ſervants
unto it, the tryall of this life by the law and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
aforeſaid is regularly <hi>judicium parium,</hi> to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
caſes upon ſo plaine a learning, were but paſſe
time, or waſt time, your Lordſhips have other
buſineſſe of weight and conſequence: the proofe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48487:63"/>
which taketh away this life with infamy, which
corrupts the bloud of him and his poſterity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feates
the wife and innocent Children of their
fame and ſubſtance, ſurely ought to be cleare and
convincing proofe.</p>
               <p>The caſe of an approver is the onely caſe wee
finde in our law, where a perſon infamous may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
another for his life, this accuſation cannot
take away the life of any man, otherwiſe then by
a legall tryall, <hi>viz.</hi> by a tryall of Iurors, who ought
to have other good proofe before they finde a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
guilty, or by both, wherein the approver ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
his owne life, which is ſacred unto him by
the law. This approver is not received in another
felony, or treaſon then he himſelfe is guiltie of by
confeſſion, of the fact, nor for his reliefe, after hee
commits the crime confeſſed, <hi>Stamford pleas of the
Crowne, fol.</hi> 142. 143. for notorious rebels or male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
I finde not any booke in law to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
unto ſuch teſtimony. I finde in the fourth
article of the Kings printed booke of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that ſuch teſtimony ſhall not be preſſed when
any man ſtands upon tryall of his life. The Iudges
doe anſwer well to one part, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is not convincing, but they goe further that
the teſtimony of ſuch perſons, not condemned
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48487:64"/>
concurring with other proofe or apparant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
may bee preſſed upon the tryall of a
man for his life; the ſaid Article in the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſaith it ſhall not be preſſed at all, no law war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
ſuch preſſure.</p>
               <p>It is quite different from the caſe of an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who confeſſeth himſelfe guiltie, and who is
limitted to the crime whereof he is guiltie, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
is left at large to prove any crime, nay the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The teſtimony mentioned in the queſtion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
in all things from the approver, therefore
they cannot bee reſembled; the concurrence of
ſuch teſtimonie with other proofes is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
for other proofe will doe the deede without
this bad concurrence, and ſo will a violent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
as if two goe ſafe into a Roome, one
of them is found ſtabbed to death the other may
ſuffer, this preſumption is inevitable the law of
God, the lawes and ſtatutes of the Realme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect

               <p>For this queſtion,<note place="margin">21. Queſt.</note> I will ſtate it without any

I conceive it will not for ſundrie reaſons.
Firſt from the beginning there have beene Fayres
and Markets, and no preſident, booke-caſe, or
Record, to warrant the new opinion in this Caſe
before <hi>Trinitie terme</hi> 1639. in the Court of wards.
Secondly the practiſe of that Court was alwayes
before to the contrary in the ſame, and the like
Caſes. Thirdly, it is a thing as the queſtion is

               <p>2. The King may reſerve a tenure in all

               <p>3. Heere it is left to conſtruction of Law,
which is <hi>aequiſsimus Iudex,</hi> and lookes upon the
nature of things, and therefore in Caſes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Land, or where land may come in liew ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
a tenure may be by implication, as a meſnalty
a reverſion expectant upon an intayle &amp; the like,

               <p>4. No tenure can be implyed by reaſon of a

               <p>5. The diſtreſſe upon other land is the Kings

a diſtreſſe may be for rent in other land by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

7. If the Patentee here had no land, there
can be no diſtreſſe in this caſe.</p>
               <p>8. This is a meere priviledge, it iſſueth out
of no lands, and participates nothing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of land, all the caſes of tenures in our bookes
are eyther of land or things ariſing out of land, or
ſome way or other of the nature of land, or that
