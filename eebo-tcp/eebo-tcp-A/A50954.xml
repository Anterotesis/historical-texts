            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things has ever wrought much mischief to the Church
of God, and the advancement of Truth; <hi>Force</hi> on the one
side restraining, and <hi>Hire</hi> on the other side corrupting
the Teachers thereof. The latter of these is by much the
more dangerous; for under force, though no thank to
the Forcers; True Religion oft-times best thrives and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes;
but the corruptions of Teachers, most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the effect or hire, is the very bean of truth in
them who are so corrupted. Of force not to be used in matters of Religion I
have already spoken; and so stated matters of Conscience and Religion
in Faith and Divine Worship and so severed them from Blasphemie
and Heresie; the one being properly as is dispiteful, the other such as
stands not to the Rule of Scripture, and so both of them not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, but rather against it, that to them who willyet use
force, this only choise can be left; whether they will force them to believe,
to whom it is not given from above, being not forc'd thereto by any
Principle of the Gospel, which now is the only Dispensation of God to all
men, or whether being Protestants, they will punish in those things wherein
the Protestant Religion denies them to be Judges, either in themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
or to the Consciences of other Men; or whether lastly, they think
fit to punish Error supposing they can be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>allible that it is so, being not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but conscientious, and according to the best light of him who errs, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on Scripture: which kind of error all Men religious, or but only
reasonable, have thought worthier of pardon; and take growth thereof to
be prevented by spiritual means and Church Discipline, not by civil laws and
outward force; since it is God only who gives as well to believe aright, as to
believe at all; and by those means which he ordained sufficiently in his Church
to the full execution of his divine purpose in the Gospel. It remains now
to speak of <hi>Hire,</hi> the other evil so mischievous in Religion; whereof I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31824:3"/>
then to speak further, when I should find God disposing me, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
inviting. Opportunity I find now inviting, and apprehend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the concurrence of God disposing, since the maintainance of Church-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;
a thing not properly belonging to the Magistrate, and yet with such
importunity call'd for, and expected from him, is at present under publick
debate. Wherein least any thing may happen to be determined, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
prejudicial to the right and freedom of Church, or advantageous to such
as may be found hirelings therein, it will be now most seasonable, and in
these matters wherein every Christian hath his free suffrage; no way mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
Christian Meekness to offer freely, without disparagement to the
wisest; such advice as God shall incline him to propound. Since hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Commonwealths of most Fame for Government, Civil Laws were
not established till they had been first for certain days published to the view
of all Men, that who so pleas'd might spake freely his opinion thereof, and
give his exceptions, ere the Law could pass to a full Establishment. And
where ought this Equity to have more place, than in the liberty which is
unseparable from Christain Religion? This I am not ignorant will be a
work unpleasing to some: But what truth is not hateful to some or other;
as this in likelihood, will be to none but <hi>Hirelings.</hi> And if there be among
them, who hold it their Duty to speak Impartial Truth, as the work of their
Ministry, though not performed without mony; let them not envy others,
who think the same no less their Duty by the general office of Christianity,
to speak truth, as in all reason may be thought, more impartially and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspectedly
without mony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hire</hi> of it self is neither a thing unlawful, nor a word of any evil Note,
signifying no more than a due recompenee or reward; as when our Saviour
saith, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> That which makes it so dangerous in
the Church, and properly makes the <hi>Hireling,</hi> a word always of evil significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
is either the excess thereof, or the undue manner of giving and taking
it. What harm the excess thereof brought to the Church; perhaps was not
found by experience till the days of <hi>Constantine;</hi> who out of his zeal, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he could be never too liberally a nursing Father of the Church; might be
not unfitly said to have either overlaid it or choaked it in the nursing.</p>
            <p>Which was foretold, as is Recorded in Ecclesiastical Tradition; by a
Voice heard from Heaven, on the very day that those great Donations and
Church Revenues were given, crying aloud. <hi>This day is poison pour'd into
the Church.</hi> Which the event soon after verifi'd, as appears by another no less
ancient observation, <hi>That Religion brought forth Wealth, and the Daughter devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Mother.</hi> But long ere wealth came into the Church, so soon as any
gain appeared in Religion, <hi>Hirelings</hi> were apparent; drawn in long before
by the very sent thereof. <hi>Iudas</hi> therefore, the first <hi>Hireling,</hi> for want of
present <hi>hire</hi> answerable to his covering, from the small number of the
meanness of such as then were the Religious, sold the Religion it self with
the Founder thereof; his Master <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the next, in hope only that
Preaching and the Gifts of the Holy Ghost would prove gainful, offered
before-hand a sum of mony to obtain them. Not long after, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
foretold; <hi>Hirelings</hi> like Wolves came in by <hi>Herds, Acts 20. 29. For,
I know this, that after my departing, shall grievous Wolves enter in among you,
not sparing the Flock.</hi> Tit. 1. 11. <hi>Teaching things which they ought not, for
Lucres sake.</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 3. <hi>And through covetousness make merchandize of you.</hi>
Yet they taught not false Doctrine only, but seeming Piety; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5.
<hi>supposing that gain is Godliness.</hi> Neither came they in of themselves only,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31824:3"/>
but invite oft-times by a great audience; 2 <hi>Tim, 4. 3. For the time will come,
when they will not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own Lusts they will heap
to themselves Teachers, having itching ears:</hi> And they on the other side, as
fast heaping to themselves Disciples, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 30. doubtless had as itching
palms<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 15. Following the way of</hi> Balaam, <hi>the son of</hi> Bosor, <hi>who loved
the wages of unrighteousness.</hi> Jude 11. <hi>They ran greedily after the Error of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam
<hi>for reward.</hi> Thus we see, that not only the excess of <hi>Hire</hi> in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest times, but also the undue and vicious taking or giving it; though
but small or mean, as in the primitive times, gave to <hi>Hirelings</hi> occasion,
though not intended, yet sufficient, to creep at first into the Church. Which
argues also the difficulty, or rather the impossibility, to remove them
quite; unless every Minister were, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> contented to teach <hi>gratis;</hi>
but few such are to be found. As therefore we cannot justly take away all
<hi>Hire</hi> in the Church, because we cannot otherwise quite remove all <hi>Hirelings;</hi>
so are we not for the impossibility of removing them all; to use therefore
no endeavour that few may come in, but rather in regard the evil, do
what we can, will always be incumbent and unavoidable; to use our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
diligence, how it may be left dangerous. Which will be likeliest
effected, if we consider, first, what recompence God hath ordained should
be given to Ministers of the Church; (for that a recompence ought to be
given them, and may by them justly be received, our Saviour himself
from the very light of reason and of equity hath declar'd: <hi>Luke 10. 7. The
Labourer is worthy of his Hire)</hi> next, by whom; and lastly, in what manner.</p>
            <p>What recompence ought to be given to Church Ministers; God hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably
ordained according to that difference which he hath manifestly
put between those his two great Dispensations, the Law and the Gospel.
Under the Law he gave them Tithes; under the Gospel; having left all
things in his Church to Charity and Christian freedom, he hath given
them only what is justly given them. That, as well under the Gospel as
under the Law, say our English Divines; and they only of all Protestants), is
Tithes; and they say true, if any man be so minded to give them of his own
tenth or twentieth but that the Law therefore of Tithes, is in force under
the Gospel; all other Protestant Divines, though equally concerned, yet
constantly deny. For though <hi>Hire</hi> to the Labourer be of moral and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
right; yet that special kind of <hi>Hire,</hi> the tenth, can be of no right
or necessity, but to that special Labour for which God ordained it. That
special Labour, was the <hi>Levitical</hi> and Ceremonial Service of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 21. 31. wich is now abolished: the right therefore of
that special <hi>Hire</hi> must needs be withall abolished, as being also ceremonial,
is plain; not being given to the <hi>Levites,</hi> till they had bin first offered a
Heave-offering to the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. 28. He then, who by that Law brings
Tithes into the Gospel, of necessity brings in withall a Sacrifice, and an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
without which Tithes by that Law were unsanctifi'd and polluted,
<hi>ver.</hi> 32. and therefore never thought on in the first Christain times, till
Ceremonies, Altars and Oblations, by an ancienter corruption were brought
back long before. And yet the <hi>Iews</hi> ever since their Tample was destroyed,
though they have Rabbies and Teachers of their Law, yet pay no Tithes,
as having no <hi>Levites</hi> to whom, no Temple where to pay them; no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
whereon to hallow them; which argues that the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought Tithes moral, but ceremonial only. That Christians therefore
should take them up, when <hi>Iews</hi> have laid them down, must needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
absurd and preposterous. Next, it is as clear in the same Chapter, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31824:4"/>
the Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> had not their Tithes for their Labour only in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle;
but in regard they were to have no other part nor inheritance in
the Land, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 24. and by that means for a tenth lost a twelfth. But our
<hi>Levites</hi> undergoing no such Law of Deprievement, can have no right to
any such compensation; nay, if by this Law they will have Tithes,
can have no Inheritance of Land, but forfeit what they have: Beside,
this, Tithes were of two sorts, those of every year, and those of every
third year: of the former, every one that brought his Tithes, was to
eat his share. <hi>Deut 14. 23. Thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place
which he shall choose to place his name there; the Tithe of thy Corn, of thy Wine,
and of thine Oyl, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, though he could not bring his Tithe in kind, by
reason of his distant dwelling from the Tabernacle or Temple, but was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
forc'd to turn it into mony, he was to bestow that mony on whatsoever
pleased him, Oxen, Sheep, Wine or strong Drink; and to eat and drink thereof
there before the Lord, both he and his Houshould, <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25, 26. As for
the Tithes of every third year, they were not only given to the <hi>Levite,</hi>
but to the Stranger, the Fatherless and the Widow, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. 29. and <hi>Chap.</hi>
26, 12, 13. So that ours, if they will have Tithes, must admit of these
sharers with them. Nay, these Tithes were not paid in at all to the <hi>Levite.</hi>
but the <hi>Levite</hi> himself was to come with those his fellow-guests, and eat
his share of them only at his house, who provided them; and this not
in regard, of his Ministerial Office, but because he had no part nor Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
in the Land. Lastly, the Priests and Levites, a Tribe, were of a
different constitution from this of our Ministers under the Gospel. In them
were Orders and Degrees, both by Family, Dignity and Office, mainly
distinguished; the High Priest, his Brethren and his Sons, to whom the
<hi>Levites</hi> themselves paid Tithes, and of the best, were eminently superior, <hi>Num.</hi>
18. 28, 29. No Protestant, I suppose, will liken one of our Ministers to a
<hi>High Priest,</hi> but rather to a Common <hi>Levite.</hi> Unless then, to keep their
Tithes, they mean to bring back again Bishops, Archbishops and the whole
Gang of Prelatry, to whom will they themselves pay Tithes, as by that
Law it was sin to them, if they did not, <hi>ver.</hi> 32? Certainly, this must
needs put them to a deep demurre, while the desire of holding fast their
Tithes without sin, may tempt them to bring back again Bishops as the
likeness of that <hi>Hierarchy</hi> that should receive Tithes from them, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to pay none, may advise them to keep out of the Church all Orders
above them. But if we have to do at present, as I suppose we have, with
True Reformed Protestants, not with Papists or Prelates; It will not be
denied that in the Gospel there be but two Minesterial Degrees, <hi>Presbyters</hi>
and Deacons which if they contend to have any Succession, Reference or
Conformity with those two Degrees under the Law, <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites;</hi>
it must needs be such, whereby our Ministers may be answerable to Priests,
and our Deacons to Levites; by which Ru<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> by all this which hath been shewn, that the Law of Tithes is partly
Ceremonial, as the work was for the which they were given, partly judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
not of common, but of particular right to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> nor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31824:4"/>
to them alone, but to the Owner also and his Houshold, at the time of
their Offering, and every third year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Stranger, the Fatherless and
the Widow, their appointed Sharers, and that they were a Tribe of Priests
and Deacons improperly compared to the constitution of our Ministry, and the
Tithes given by that People to those Deacons only: It follows that our
Ministers at this day, being neither Priests nor Levites, are not filthy answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to either of them; can have no just Title or pretence to Tithes, by
any consequence drawn from the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> But they think they have
a better Plea in the Example of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> who took Tithes of <hi>Abram</hi> ere
the Law was given; whence they would infer them to be of moral right. But
they ought to know, or to remember, that not Examples, but express
Commands oblige our Obedince to God or Man. Next, that whatsoever
was done in Religion before the Law written, is not presently to be counted
moral; when as so many things were then done, both Ceremonial and Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
Judicial, that we need not doubt to conclude all times before Christ,
more or less under the Ceremonial Law. To what end served else those Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
and Sacrifices, that distinction of clean and unclean entring into the Ark,
Circumcision and the raising up of Seed to the Elder Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38, 8?
If these things be not moral, though before the Law, how are Tithes,
though in the example of <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Melchisedec?.</hi> But this Instance is so far
from being the just ground of a Law, that after all Circumstances duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both from <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. it will not be allowed them so much
as an example. <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> besides his Priestly Benediction, brought with
him Bread and Wine sufficient to refresh <hi>Abram</hi> and his whole Army; inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to do so, first, by the secret Providence of God, intending him for a Type
of Christ and his Priesthood; next by his due thankfulness and honour to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram;</hi>
who had freed his Borders of <hi>Salem</hi> from a Potent Enemy: <hi>Abram</hi> on
the other side, honours him with the tenth of all, that is to say (for he took not
sure his whole Estate with him to that War.) of the Spoils, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4. Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
also by the same secret Providence, to signifie as Grandfather of <hi>Levi,</hi>
that the <hi>Levitical Priesthood was excelled by the Priesthood of Christ.</hi> For the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a tenth declared it seems in those Countrys and times, him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
who received it. That which next incited him, was partly his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Present, partly his Reverence to the Person and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to his Person, as a King and Priest also, but not a King. And who
unhir'd will be so hardy as to say, that <hi>Abram</hi> at any other time ever paid
him Tithes, either before or after; or had then, but for this accidental
Meeting and Obligement? or that else <hi>Melchisedec</hi> had demanded or exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, or took them otherwise, than as the voluntary Gift of <hi>Abram?</hi>
But our Ministers, though neither Priests nor Kings more than any other
Christian, greater in their own esteem than <hi>Abrams</hi> and all his Seed, for the
Verbal Labour of a Seventh days Preachment, not bringing like <hi>Melchisedec,</hi>
Bread or Wine at their own cost; would not take only at the willing hand of
Liberality or Gratitude, but require and exact as due the tenth, not of
Spoils, but of our whole Estates and Labours; nor once, but yearly. We
then it seems by the example of <hi>Abram</hi> must pay Tithes to these <hi>Melchisedecs;</hi>
but what if the Person of <hi>Abram</hi> can either no way represent us, or will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Minister to pay Tithes no less than other Men? <hi>Abram</hi> had not only
a Preist in his Loins, but was himself a Priest; and gave Tithes to <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi>
either as Grandfather of <hi>Levi,</hi> or as Father of the Faithful: If as Grandfather
(though he understood it not) of <hi>Levi,</hi> he oblig'd not us but <hi>Levi</hi> only, the
Inferiour Priest, by that homage (as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> clearly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31824:5"/>
enough explains) to acknowledg the greater. And they who by <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>
claim from <hi>Abram</hi> as <hi>Levi's</hi> Grandfather, have none to seek their <hi>Tithes</hi>
of but the <hi>Levites,</hi> where they can find them. If <hi>Abram</hi> as Father of the
Faithful paid Tithes to <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> then certainly the Ministers also, if
they be of that number, paid in him equally with the rest. Which may
induce us to believe, that as both <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> so Tithes also in
that action Typical and Ceremonial, signifi'd nothing else but that subjection,
which all the Faithful, both Ministers and People owe to Christ, our High
Priest and King. In any literal sense from this example they never will be able
to extort, that the People in those days paid Tithes to Priests; but this only,
that one Priest once in his life, of Spoils only, and in requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al partly of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Present, partly of a Benediction, gave voluntary Tithes, not to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Priest than himself, as far as <hi>Abram</hi> could then understand, but rather to a
Priest and King joyned in one Person. They will reply, perhaps, that if one
Priest paid Tithes to another, it must needs be understood, that the People
did no less to the Priest. But I shall easily remove that necessity, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
them that in those days was no Priest, but the Father, or the first born
of every Family; and by consequence, no People to pay him Tithes, but his
own Children and Servants, who had not wherewithal to pay him, but of
his own. Yet grant that the People then paid <hi>Tithes;</hi> there will not be the
like reason to enjoyn us: they being then under Ceremonies, a meer Laitie;
we now under Christ, a Royal Priesthood, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 9. as we are Coheirs,
Kings and Priests with him, <hi>a Priest for ever after the Order or manner of
Melchisedec.</hi> As therefore <hi>Abram</hi> paid <hi>Tithes</hi> to <hi>Melchisedec</hi> because <hi>Levi</hi>
was in him; so we ought to pay none because the true <hi>Melchisedec</hi> is in
us, and we in him: who can pay to none greater, and hath freed us by our
union with himself, from all compulsive <hi>Tributes</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> in his Church.
Neither doth the collateral place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, make other use of this Story,
than to prove Christ personated by <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> a greater Priest than <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ver. 4. Now consider how great this man was, &amp;c.</hi> and proves not in the
least manner, that Tithes be of any right to Ministers, but the contrary: First,
the Levites had <hi>a commandment to take Tithes of the People according to the Law,
that is of their Brethren, though they come out of the Loins of Abram, ver.</hi> 5. The
Commandment then was, it seems, to take Tithes of the <hi>Iews</hi> only, and
according to the Law. That Law changing of necessity with the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
no other sort of Ministers, as they must needs be no other sort, under
another Priesthood, can receive that tribute of Tithes which sell with that
Law, unless renew'd by any other express command, and according to no
other Law: no such Law is extant. Next, <hi>Melchisedec</hi> not as a Minister, but
as Christ himself in person blessed <hi>Abraham, who had the Promises, ver.</hi> 6. and
in him blessed all, both Ministers and People; both of the Law and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
that Blessing declar'd him greater and better than whom he blessed,
<hi>ver.</hi> 7. receiving Tithes of them all, not as maintainance, which <hi>Melchisedec</hi>
needed not, but as a sign of homage to their King and Priest: whereas
Ministers bear not the Person of Christ in his Priesthood or Kingship, <hi>bless
not as he blesses,</hi> are not by their Blessing greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the
Faithful with themselves included in him; cannot both give and take Tithes
in <hi>Abram;</hi> cannot claim to themselves that sign of our Allegiance due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to our Eternal King and Priest, cannot therefore derive Tithes from
<hi>Melchisedec.</hi> Lastly, the eighth verse hath thus: <hi>Here men that die receive
Tithes: there he received them, of whom it is witness'd that he lived.</hi> Which
words intimate that as he suffered himself once for us, so he received
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31824:5"/>
once of us in <hi>Abraham;</hi> and in that place the Typical acknowledgment of our
Redemption: which had it been a perpetual Annuitie to Christ, by him claim'd
as his due, <hi>Levi</hi> must haue paid it yearly, as well as then, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and
our Ministers ought still to some <hi>Melchisiedec</hi> or other, as well now as they did
in <hi>Abraham.</hi> But that Christ never claim'd any such tenth as his Annual due,
much less resign'd it to the Ministers, his so officious receivers without express
commission or assignment, will yet be clearer as we proceed. Thus much
may at length assure us, that this example of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Melchisedec,</hi>
though I see of late they build most upon it, can so little be the ground of
any Law to us, that it will not so much avail them as to the autority of
an example. Of like Impertinence is that example of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 28. 22.
who of his free choise, not enjoyned by any Law, vow'd the tenth of all that
God should give him: which for ought appears to the contrary, he vow'd
as a thing no less indifferent before his vow, than the foregoing part thereof;
that the Stone which he had set there for a Pillar should be God's House.
And to whom vowed he his tenth, but to God; not to any Priest; for we read
of none to him greater than himself: and to God, no doubt, but he paid what
vowed; both in building of that <hi>Bethel</hi> with other Altars elsewhere, and
the expence of his continual Sacrifices, which none but he had right to off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
However therefore he paid his tenth, it could in no likelihood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by such an occasion as befel his Grandfather, be to any Priest. But,
say they. <hi>All the Tithe of the Land, whether of the Seed of the Land, or of the
fruit of the Tree, is the Lords, holy unto the Lord; Levit,</hi> 27. 30. And this
before it was given to the <hi>Levites;</hi> therefore since they ceased. No Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
<hi>for the whole earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof, Psal.</hi> 24. 1.
and the light of nature shews us no less; but that the tenth is his, more than
the rest, how know I, but as he so declares it? He declares it so here of the
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> only, as by all circumstances appears; and passes, by deed of
Gift, this tenth to the <hi>Levite;</hi> yet so as offered to him first a <hi>Heave-offering,</hi> and
confecrated on his Altar, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. all which I had as little known,
but by that Evidence. The <hi>Levites</hi> are ceased, <hi>the Gift returns to the Giver.</hi>
How then can we know that he hath given it to any other, or how can these
men presume to take it unoffered first to God, unconsecrated, without an
other cllear and express donation; whereof they shew no evidence or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.
Besides he hath now alienated that Holy Land; who can warrantably
affirm that he hath since hallowed the tenth of this Land; which none
but God hath power to do or can warrant? Their last Proof they cite out
of the Gospel, which makes as little for them; <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. where our
Saviour denouncing <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oe</hi> to the Scribes and Pharisees, who paid Tithe so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and omitted weightier matters, tells them, that these they ought to have
done that is, to have paid Tithes. For our Saviour spake then to those who
observed the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which was yet not fully abrogated, till the
destruction of the Temple. And by the way here we may observe out of
their own Proof, that the Scribes and Pharisees though then chief Teachers of
the People, such at last as were not <hi>Levites,</hi> did not take Tithes, but paid them
so; so much less were the Scribes and Pharisees in those worst times than
ours at this day. This is so apparent to the reformed Divines of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys,
that when any one of ours hath attempted in Latine to maintain this
argument of Tithes, though a man would think they might suffer him
without opposition in a point equally tending to the advantage of all Ministers,
yet they forbear not to oppose him, as in a Doctrine not fit to pass unop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
under the Gospel. Which shews the modesty, the contentedness
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31824:6"/>
of those Foreign Pastors with the maintainance given them; their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
also in the truth, though less gainful, and the avarice of ours; who
through the Love of their old Papistical Tithes, consider not the weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or rather conjectures and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urmises which they bring to defend them.
On the other side, although it be sufficient to have proved in general,
the abolishing of Tithes, as part of the Judaical or Ceremonial Law, which
is abolished, all, as well as that before as that after <hi>Moses;</hi> yet I shall
further prove them abrogated, by an express Ordinance of the Gospel, founded
not on any Type, or that Municipal Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but on moral and general
Equity, given us instead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>Know you not that they who mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; and they which wait at
the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? So also the Lord hath ordained; that
they who preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.</hi> He saith not, should live
on things which were of the Temple or of the Altar, of which were Tithes,
for that had given them a clear Title; but abrogating that former Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> which determined what and how much by a latter Ordinance of Christ,
which leaves the what and how much indefinite and free, so it be sufficient
to live on; he saith, <hi>The Lord hath so ordained; that they who preath the
Gospel, should live of the Gospel,</hi> which hath neither Temple, Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor Sacrifice. <hi>Heb. 7. 13. For be of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to
another Tribe, of which no man give attendance at the Altar.</hi> his Ministers
therefore cannot thence have Tithes. And where the Lord, hath so ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
we may find easily in more than one Evangelist. <hi>Luke.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7, 8. <hi>In
the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is worthy of his Hire, &amp;c. And into what City soever you enter, and
they receive you; eat such things as are set before you.</hi> To which Ordinance of
Christ it may seem likeliest, that the Apostle refers us, both here and
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 18. where he cites this, as the saying of our Saviour, <hi>That the
Labourer is worthy of his Hire:</hi> and both by this place of <hi>Luke,</hi> and that of
<hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 9, 10, 11. it evidently appears, that our Saviour ordained no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
maintainance for his Apostles or Ministers, publickly or privately in
house or City received, but that what ever it were, which might suffice
to live on; and this not commanded or proportioned by <hi>Abram,</hi> or by
<hi>Moses,</hi> whom he might easily have here cited, as his manner was; but
declared only by a rule of common equity which proportions the hire
as well to the abilitie of him who gives, as to the labour of him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives;
and recommends him only as worthy, not invests him with a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
right. And mark whereon he grounds this ordinance; not on a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
right of Tithes from <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> as <hi>Hirelings</hi> pretend, which he
never claimed either for himself, or for his Ministers, but one the plain
and common equity of rewarding the Labourer; worthy sometimes of single,
sometimes of double honour, not proportionable by Tithes. And the Apostle
in this forecited chapter to the <hi>Corinthians, ver.</hi> 11, affirms it to be no great
recompence, if carnal things be reaped for spiritual sown; but to mention
Tithes, neglects here the fittest occasion, that could be offered him, and
leaves the rest free and undermined. Certainly if Christ or his Apostles
had approved of Tithes, they would have either by writing or tradition
recommended them to the Church; and that soon would have appeared in
practise of those Primitive and the next Ages: But for the first three
hundred years and more, in all the Ecclesiastical Story, I find no such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or example; though error by that time had brought back again Priests,
Altar, and Oblations; and in many other points of Religion had miserably
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31824:6"/>
Judaiz'd the Church. So that the defenders of Tithes, after a long
pomp and tedious preparation out of Heathen Authors, telling us that
Tithes were paid to <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> which perhaps was imitated from
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and as it were be speaking our expectation, that they will bound
much more with autorities out of Christian Story <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have nothing of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
approbation to begin with, from the first three or four Ages, but
that which abundantly serves to the confutation of their Tithes, while
they confess that Church-men in those Ages lived meerly upon Free-will
Offerings. Neither can they say, that Tithes were not then paid for want,
of Civil Magistrates to ordainthem; for Christians had then also Lands, and
might give out of them what they pleas'd; and yet of Tithes then given we
find no mention. And the first Christian Emperours, who did all things
as Bishops advis'd them; suppli'd what was wanting to the Clergy,
not out of Tithes which were never motioned, but out of their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Revenues, as is manifest in <hi>Eusebius, Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> from
<hi>Constantine to Arcadius.</hi> Hence those ancientest reformed Churches of the
<hi>WALDENSES,</hi> if they rather continued not pure, since the Apostle
deni'd that Tithes were to be given, or that they were even given in the
Primitive Church; as appears by an ancient Tractate inserted in the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>
History. Thus far hath the Church been always, whether in her
Prime, or in her ancientest Reformation, from the approving of Tithes;
nor without reason, for they might easily perceive, that Tithes were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Iews</hi> only; a National Church of many incomplete Synagogues
uniting the accomplishment of Divine Worship in one. Temple; and the

dwelling nigh together; but by free consent, choosing both their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

these Christian Priviledges will be disturbed and soon lost; and with them
Christian Liberty. The first Autority which our Adversaries bring, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

stitutions of this Land, <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, Edicts of Kings, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
from <hi>Athelstan</hi> in the year nine hundred twenty eight, that Tithes by
t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te were paid; and might produce from <hi>Ina</hi> above two hundred years
before; that <hi>Romescot</hi> or <hi>Peters-penny,</hi> was by as good Statute Law paid
to the Pope from seven hundred twenty five, and almost as long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd.
And who knows not, that this Law of Tithes was enacted by
those Kings and Barons, upon the Opinion they had of their Divine
Right, as the very words import of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, in the close
of that Law: for so Blessed <hi>Austin</hi> preached and taught; meaning the Monk,
who first brought the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion into <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Pope. And by the way, I add, that by these Laws, imitating the
Laws of <hi>Moses</hi>; the third part of Tithes only was the Priests due; the
other two were appointed for the Poor and to adorn or repair Churches,
as the Canons of <hi>Echbert</hi> and <hi>Elphric</hi> witness: <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> If then these
Laws were founded upon the Opinion of Divine Autority, and that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
be found mistaken, and erroneous, as hach been fully manifested;
it follows, that these Laws fall of themselves with their False Foundation.
But with what face or conscience can they alledge <hi>Moses,</hi> or these Laws
for Tithes, as they now enjoy; whereof <hi>Moses</hi> ordains the Owner, as we
heard before, the Stranger, the Fatherless and the Widow partakers with
with the <hi>Levite</hi>; and these Fathers which they cite; and these though
<hi>Romish</hi> rather than <hi>English</hi> Laws, allotted both to Priest and Bishop the
third part only. But these our <hi>Protestant,</hi> these our new reformed <hi>English
Presbyterian</hi> Divines, against their own cited Authors, and to the
shame of their pretended Reformation, would engross to themselves all
Tithes by Statute, and supported more by their wilful obstinacy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of filthy Lucre, than by these both insufficient and impertinent Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
would perswade a Christian Magistracy and Parliament, whom
we trust God hath restored for a happier Reformation, to impose upon
us a Judaical Ceremonial Law, and yet from that Law to be more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and unwarrantable, more complying with a covetous Clergy, than
any of those Popish Kings and Parliaments alledged. Another shift they
have to plead that Tithes may be Moral as well as the Sabbath, a tenth
of fruits as well as a seaventh of days. I answer, that the Prelates who
urge this Argument, have least reason to use it; denying morality in
the Sabbath, and therein better agreeing with reformed Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
than the rest of our Divines. As therefore the Seaventh day is
not moral, but a convenient recourse of worship in fit season; whether
seaventh or other number: so neither is the tenth of our goods, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31824:7"/>
only a convenient subsistance morally due to Ministers, The last and lowest
sort of their Arguments, that men purchas'd not their Tithe with their Land
and such like Pertiforggery, I omit, as refuted suffoiently by others: I omit also
their violent and irreligious exactions, related no less credibly: their seising
of Pots and Pans from the Poor, who have as good Right to Tithes as they;
fromsome, the very Beds; their sueing and imprisoning, worse than when
the Canon Law was in force; worse than when those Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> were
Priests, whose manner was thus to seise their pretended Priestly due by
force, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12, <hi>&amp;c. Whereby men abhorred the offering of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
it may be feared that many will as much abhor the Gospel, if such violence
as this be suffered in her Ministers, and in that which they also pretend to be
the offering of the Lord. For those sons of <hi>Belial</hi> within some limits
made seisure of what they knew was their own by an undoubted Law: but
these, from whom there is no Sanctuary, seise out of mens grounds,
out of mens houses their other goods of double, sometimes of treble value,
for that, which did not Covetousness and Rapine blind them, they know to be
not their own by the Gospel which they preach. Of some more tolerable than
these, thus severely God hath spoken; <hi>Isa 46. 10. &amp;c. They are greedy Dogs; they
all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</hi> With what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

Lands (and none but Fools, part with their Estates, without elearest of
evidence, on bare supposals and presumptions of them who are the gainers
thereby) that he required the tenth due to him or his son perpetually and
in all places? Where did he demand it, that we might certainly know, as
in all claims of temporal right, what is just and reasonable? or if demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

left not under the Gospel whatever his right was, to the Free-will offerings
of men? Which is the greater Sacriledge, to belie Divine Autoritie, to
make the name of Christ accessary to violence; and robbing him of the
very Honour which he aimed at, in bestowing freely the Gospel,
to commit Simonie and Rapine, both Secular and Ecclesiastical, or on
the other side not to give the tenth of civil right and propriety to the
tricks and impostures of Clergy-men; contriv'd with all the art and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

when as <hi>Melchisedec</hi> in that passage rather gave maintenance to <hi>Abram;</hi>
in whom all, both Priests and Ministers, as well as Lay-men, paid Tithes,
not received them. And because I affirm both; beginning this first part
of my Discourse, that God hath given to Ministers of the Gospel that
maintenance only which is justly given them; let us see a little what hath

of free gift if they be exacted or established; they become unjust to them

For it the Minister be maintain'd for his whole Ministry; why should he
be twice paid for any part thereof? Why should he, like a Servant seek
above his wages? As for Christnings, either they themselves call Men to
Baptism? of Men of themselves come: If Ministers invite, how ill had it
becomed <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist to demand Fees for his Baptising, or Christ
for his Christnings? Far less becomes it these now; with a greediness
lower than that of Tradesmen, calling Passengers to their Shop, and yet paid
before hand, to ask again, for doing that which those their Founders did
did freely. If Men of themselves come to Baptised, they are either brought
by such as already pay the Minister, or come to be one of his Disciples and

exacted or demanded for Sacraments, Marriages, Burials, and especially for
interring, are wicked, accursed, Simoniacal and abominable. Yet thus
is the Church, for all this noise of Reformation, left still unreformed,
by the censure of their own Synods, a Den of Theeves and Robbers. As
for Marriages that Ministers should not meddle with them, as not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or legitimate without their Celebration, I find no ground in Scripture,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31824:8"/>
either of precept or example. Likeliest it is; (which our <hi>Selden</hi> hath well
observ'd, <hi>l. 2. c. 28. ux. Eb.)</hi> That in imitation of Heathen Priests, who
were wont at Nuptials to use many Rites and Ceremonies, and especially
judging it would be profitable, and the increase of their Autority, not
to be Spectators only in busineses of such concernment to the Life of Man;
they insmuated that Marriage was not holy without their Benediction, and
for the better colour, made it a Sacrament; being of it self a civil Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
a Houshold contract, a thing indifferent and free to the whole Race
of Mankind, not as religious, but as men; best indeed, undertaken to
religious ends; and as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. In the Lord.</hi> Yet
not therefore invalid or unholy, without a Minister and his pretended
necessary hallowing, more than any other Act, Enterprise or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of Civil Life; which ought all to be done in the Lord and to his
glory. All which; ho less than Marriage, were by the cunning of Priests
heretofore, as material to their profit, transacted at the Altar. Our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
denie it to be a Sacrament, yet retain'd the Celebration, till prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a late Parliament recovered the civil liberty of Marriage from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroachment;
and transferred the ratifying and registring thereof, from
Canonical Shop to the proper Cognizance of Civil Magistrates. Seeing then,
that God hath given to Ministers under the Gospel, that only which is Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given them, that is to say, a due and moderate Livelihood; the hire of
their Labour; and that the Heave-Offering of Tithes is abolished with the
Altar, yea though not abolished, yet lawless, they injoy them; their

            <p>The next thing to be considered in the maintainance of Ministers, is by
whom it shall be given? Wherein though the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

first of King <hi>Iohn, any man might have his Tithes to what spiritual Person he

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31824:9"/>
Decretal bound not the Subjects of this Realm, but as it seem'd just and reasonable.</hi>
The Pope took his reason rightly from the above cited place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11.
But falsly suppos'd every one to be instructed by his Parish-Priest. Whether
this were then first so decreed, or rather long before; as may seem by the
Laws of <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Canute,</hi> that Tithes where to be paid, not to whom he
would that paid them, but to the Cathedral Church or the Parish Priest.
It imports not, since the reason which they themselves bring, built on a false
Supposition, becomes infirm and absurd, that he should reap from me,
who sows not to me; be the cause either his defect or my free choise. But
here it will be readily objected; what if they who are to be instructed be
not able to maintain a Minister, as in many Villages? I answer, that the
Scriptures shew in many places what ought to be done herein. First, I
offer it to the Reason of any Man, whether he think the Knowledg of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion harder than any other Art or Science to attain. I suppose
he will grant that it is far easier, both of it self, and in regard of Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Spirit; not particularly promis'd us to the attainment of any other
Knowledg, but of this only: since it was preached as well to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
of <hi>Bethleem</hi> by Angels; as to the Eastern Wife Men by that Star: and
our Saviour declares himself <hi>anointed</hi> to preach the Gospel to the Poor, <hi>Luke.</hi>
4. 18. then surely to their capacitie. They who after him first taught it,
were otherwise unlearned Men. They who before <hi>Hus</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> first
reformed it, were for the meaness of their condition, <hi>called the poor men of
Lions:</hi> and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> at this day, <hi>les gueus,</hi> which is to say Beggars. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are the Scriptures translated into every vulgar Tongue; as being held in
main matters of Belief and Salvation, plain and easie to the poorest; and such
no less than their Teachers have the Spirit to guide them in all Truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
14. 26. and 16. 13. Hence we may conclude, if Men be not all their Life
time under a Teacher to learn Logic, Natural Philosophy, Ethics or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics,
which are more difficult; that certainly it is not necessary to
the attainment of Christian Knowledg, that Men should sit all their Life
long at the feet of a Pulpited Divine; while he a Lollard indeed over his
Elbow-Cushion, in almost the seaventh part of 40. or 50. years, teaches
them scarce half the Principles of Religion, and his Sheep oft-times sit the
while to as little purpose of Benefitting, as the Sheep in their Pues at <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field;</hi>
and for the most part by some Simonie or other, bought a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fault, as through the unskilful and immethodical Teaching of their Pastor;
teaching here and there at random, out of this or that Text, as his ease or

may be so easily attain'd, and by meanest capacitles; it cannot be
much difficult to find waies, both how the Poor, yea all men may be
soon taught what is to be known of Christianity, and they who teach them,
recompenc'd, First if, Ministers of their own accord, who pretend that they
are call'd and sent to preach the Gospel, those especially who have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

they will soon reply, we our selves have net wherewithall; who shall bear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31824:9"/>
the charges of our journey? To whom it may as soon be answered, that in
likelihood they are not poorer, than they who did thus; and if they have not
the same faith, which those Disciples had to trust in God and the promise of
Christ for their maintenance as they did, and yet intrude into the Ministery
without any livelihood of their own, they cast themselves into a miserable
hazard or temptation, and oft-times into a miserable necessity, either to
starve or please their Master rather than God; and give men just cause to
suspect, that they came neither call'd nor sent from above to preach the word,
but from below, by the instinct of their own hunger, to feed upon the
Church. Yet grant it needful to allow them both the charges of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,

have done as much as the Apostles were wont to do in propogating the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

translated into <hi>English;</hi> with plenty of Notes; and some where or
other, I trust may be found some wholsome Body of Divinity, as they
call it, without School-Terms and Metaphysical Notions, which have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scur'd,
rather than explain'd our Religion, and made it seem difficult
without cause. Thus taught once for all; and thus now and then visited
and confirmed, in the most destitute and poorest places of the Land, under
the Government of their own Elders, performing all Ministerial offices
among them, they may be trusted to meet and edifie one nother; whether
in Church or Chappel, or to save them the trudging of many Miles thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

not to be preached in a Barn; and that by such Meetings as these being
indeed most Apostolical and Primitive; they will in a short time advance
more in Christian-Knowledge and Reformation of Life, than by the many
years preaching of such an Incumbent, I may say such an Incubus oft-times,
as will be meanly hired to abide long in those places. They have this left
perhaps to object further, that to send thus and to maintain, though but
for a year or two, Ministers and Teachers in several places, would prove
chargeable, to the Churches, though in Towns and Cities round about. To
whom again I answer, that it was not thought so by them, who first
thus propagated the Gospel, though but few in number to us, and much less
able to sustain the expence. Yet this expence would be much less, then to hire
Incumbents, or rather Incumbrances for a Life-time; and a great means
(which is the Subject of this Discourse) to diminish <hi>Hirelings.</hi> But be
the expence less or more, if it be found burdensome to the Churches, they
have in this Land an easie remedie in their Recourse to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
who hath in his hands the disposal of no small Revenues left, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
anciently to Superstitious, but meant undoubtedly to good and best
uses; and therefore once made publick, appliable by the present Magistrate,
to such uses as the Church or solid Reason from whomsoever shall convince
him to think best. And those uses may be, no doubt, much rather than
as Glebes and Augmentations are now bestowed, to grant such requests
as these of the Churches, or to erect in greater number all over the Land,
Schools, and competent Libraries to those Schools; where Languages and
Arts may be taught free together, without the needless, unprofitable and
inconvenient removing to another place. So all the Land would soon be
better civili'zd, and they who are taught freely at the publick cost, might
have their education given them on this condition; that therewith content,
they should not gad for Preferment out of their own Country, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
there thankful for what they have received freely, bestowing it as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on their Country, without soaring above the meanness wherein they
were born. But how they shall live when they are thus bred and dismis'd,
will be still the sluggish objection. To which is answered, that those Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Foundations may be so instituted, as therein may be at once brought
up to a competence of Learning, and to an honest Trade; and the Hours
of Teaching so ordered, as their Studie may be no hindrance to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
or other Calling; this was the Breeding of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though born of
no mean Parents, a Free Citizen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: so little did his
Trade debase him, that it rather enabled him to use that Magnanimitie of
preaching the Gospel, through <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> at his own charges. Thus
those Preachers among the Poor <hi>WALDENSES,</hi> the Ancient Stock
of our Reformation; without these helps which I speak of; bred up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Trades, (and especially in Physick and Surgery, as well as in the
Study of Scripture (which is the only True Theology) that they might be
no burden to the Church; and by the Example of Christ, might cure
both Soul and Bodie; through Industry joining that to their Ministry, which,
he joyned to his by Gift of the Spirit. Thus relates <hi>Peter Giles</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the <hi>WALDENSES</hi> in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> But our Ministers think scorn
to use a Trade, and count it the Reproach of this Age, that Trades-men
preach the Gospel. It were to be wished they were all Trades-men; they
could not then so many of them, for want of another Trade, make a
Trade of their Preaching; and yet they clamor that Trades-men Preach,
and yet they Preach while they themselves are the worst Trades-men of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31824:10"/>
all. As for Church-Endowments and Possessions; I meet with none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
before <hi>Constantine,</hi> but the Houses and Gardens where they met,
and their places of Burial: and I perswade me, that from them the
Ancient <hi>WALDENSES,</hi> whom deservedly I cite so often, held, <hi>that
to endow Churches, is an evil thing;</hi> and that the Church then fell off, <hi>and
turned Whore, sitting on that Beast in the Revelation,</hi> when under Pope <hi>Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
she received those Temporal Donations: So the forecited Tractate of their
Doctrine testifies. This also their own Traditions of that Heavenly Voice
witnes'd, and some of the Ancient Fathers then Living, foresaw and deplor'd.
And indeed, how could these Endowments thrive better with the Church,
being unjustly taken by those Emperors without Suffrage of the People, out
of the Tributes and Publick Lands of each City whereby the People became
liable to be oppressed with other Taxes? Being therefore given for the
most part by Kings and other publick Persons, and so likeliest out of the
Publick; and if without the Peoples consent, unjustly, however to publick
ends of much concernment to the good or evil of a Commonwealth; and in
that regard made publick though given by private Persons; or which is worse,
given, as the Clergy then perswaded Men, for their Soul's health, a pious
Gift; but as the truth was, oft-times a Bribe to God or Christ for Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
as they were then taught, from Murders, Adulteries, and other
hainous Crimes: what shall be found heretofore given by Kings or Princes
out of the publick, may justly by the Magistrate be recall'd and reappropriated
to the Civil Revenue; what by private or publick Persons out of their own,
the Price for Blood or Lust, or to such Purgatorious and Superstitious Uses, not
only may but ought to be taken off from Christ, as a foul dishonour laid
upon him, or not impiously given, nor in particular to any one, but in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to the Churches good, may be converted to that use, which shall be
judged tending more to that end Thus did the Princes and Cities of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
in the first Reformation; and defended their so doing by many Reasons,
which are set down at large, in <hi>Sleidan l. 6. an.</hi> 1526, and <hi>l. 11. an.</hi> 1537.
and <hi>l. 13. an</hi> 1540. But that the Magistrate, either out of that Church-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
which remains yet in his hand, or establishing any other Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
instead of Tithe, should take into his own power the Stipendiary
Maintenance instead of Church Ministers, or compel it by Law; can stand
neither with the People Right nor with Christian Liberty, but would
suspend the Church wholly upon the State, and turn her Ministers into
State Pentioners. And for the Magistrate in Person of a Nursing Father to
make the Church his meer Ward, as alwaies in Minority, the Church
to whom he ought as Magistrate, <hi>Esa. 49. 23. To bow down his
face toward the Earth, and lick up the dust of her feet;</hi> her to subject
to his Political Drifts, or conceived Opinions by mastering her Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and so by his Examinant Committees, as send her free Election of
Ministers, is neither just nor pious; no honour done to the Church, but a
plain dishonour; and upon her, whose only head is in Heaven, yea upon
him, who is her only Head, sets another in effect, and which is most mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
a Human on Heavenly, a Carnal on a Spiritual; a Political Head
on an Ecclesiastical Body; which at last by such Heterogeneal, such Incestuous
Conjunction, transforms her oft-times into a Beast of many Heads and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Horns. For if the Church be of all Societies the Honest on earth; and
so to be reveng'd by the Magistrate; not to trust her with her own belief
and integrity, and therefore not with the keeping, a least with the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of what Revenue shall be found justly and lawfully her own, is to count
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31824:11"/>
the Church not a holy Congregation, but a Pack of giddy or dishonest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to be ruled by civil Power in sacred Affairs. But to proceed further in the
truth yet more freely, seeing the Christian Church is not National, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of many particular Congregations, subject to many changes, as well
through civil Accidents as through Schism and various Opinions, not to be
decided by any outward Judge, being matters of Conscience, whereby these
pretended Church-Revenues, as they have been ever, so are like to continue
endless matter of dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ention both between the Church and Magistrate, and the
Churches among themselves. There will be found no better remedy to these
evils, otherwise incurable, than by the incorruptest Council of those <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses,</hi>
our first Reformers, to remove them as a Pest, an Apple of Discord
in the Church, (for what else can be the effect of Riches and the snare of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in Religion?) and to convert them to those more profitable uses above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
or other such as shall be judged most necessary; considering that the
Church of Christ was founded in poverty rather than in revenues, stood
purest and prospered best without them, received them unlawfully from them
who both erroneously and unjustly, sometimes impiously, gave them, and so just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was ensuared and corrupted by them. And least it be thought that these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
withdrawn and better imployed, the Magistrate ought instead to settle
by statute some maintenance of Ministers, let this be considered first, that it
concerns every mans Conscience to what Religion he contributes: and that
the Civil Magistrate is intrusted with Civil Rights only, not with Conscience,
which can have no Deputy or Representer of it self, but one of the same mind:
next, that what each man gives to the Minister, he gives either as to God, or
as to his Teacher; if as to God, no Civil Power can justly consecrate to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
uses any part either of Civil revenue, which is the Peoples; and must save
them from other Taxes; or of any mans Propriety, but God by special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
as he did by <hi>Moses,</hi> or the owner himself by voluntary Intention, and
the perswasion of his giving it to God. Forced Consecrations out of another
mans Estate, are no better than forc'd vowes, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ateful to God, <hi>who loves a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Giver,</hi> but more hateful, wrung out o mens purses to maintain a disappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Ministery against their Conscience; however unholy, infamous and
dishonourable to his Ministers and the free Gospel, maintained in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
manner as by violence and extortion: if he give it as to his Teacher,
what justice or equity compels him to pay for learning that Religion which
leaves freely to his choise, whether he will learn it or no, whether of this
Teacher or another, and especially to pay for what he never learned, or
approves not; whereby besides the wound of his conscience, he becomes
the less able to recompence his true Teacher? Thus far hath been enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by whom Church-Ministers ought to be maintained, and hath been
proved most natural, most equal and agreeable with Scripture, to be by
them who receive their teaching; and by whom, if they be unable. Which
waies well observ'd, can discourage none but Hirelings, and will much les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
their number in the Church.</p>
            <p>It remains lastly to consider in what manner God hath ordained that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
be given to Ministers of the Gospel: And by all Scripture it will appear
that he hath given it them not by Civil Law and Freehold, as they claim, but
by the benevolence and free gratitude of such as receive them: <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7, 8.
<hi>Eating and drinking such things as they give you. If they receive you, eat such things
as are set before you,</hi> Mat. 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 7, 8. <hi>As ye go, preach, saying, The Kingdom of God is
at hand, &amp;c. Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> If God have ordained Ministers
to preach freely, whether they receive recompence or not, then certainly he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31824:11"/>
hath forbid both them to compel it for them. But freely given to himself: <hi>Phil.</hi>
4. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Ye sent once and again to my necessity. Not because I desire a gift; but I
desire fruit that may abound to your Account. Having received of</hi> Epaphroditus <hi>the
things which were sent from you, an odour of sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well
pleasing to God.</hi> Which cannot be from force or unwillingness. The same is said
of Alms, <hi>Heb. 13. 16. To do good and to communicate, forget not: for with such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
God is well pleased.</hi> Whence the primitive Church thought it no shame
to receive all their Maintenance as the Alms of their Auditors. Which they
who defend Tithes, as if it made for their Cause, when as it utterly confutes
them, omit not to set down at large; proving to our hands out of <hi>Origen, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,
Cyprian,</hi> and others, that the Clergy lived at first upon the meer bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
of their hearers: who gave what they gave, not to the Clergy, but
to the Church; out of which the Clergy had their portions given them in bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets;
and were thence called <hi>Sportularii, Basket-Clerks:</hi> that their portion was
a very mean allowance, only for a bare livelihood; according to those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 7, &amp;c. the rest was distributed to the poor. They
cite also out of <hi>Prosper,</hi> the Disciple of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that such of the Clergy as
had means of their own, might not without sin partake of Church-maintenance;
not receiving thereby food which they abound with, but feeding on the sins
of other men: that the holy Ghost saith of such Clergy-men, they eat the sins
of my people: and that a Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the year 340, suffered not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Priest or Bishop to live on Church-maintenance without necessity. Thus
far Tithers themselves have contributed to their own confutation, by confessing
that the Church lived primitively on Alms. And I add, that about the year
359, <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperor having summoned a general Council of Bishops
to <hi>Ariminum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and provided for their subsistence there, the <hi>British</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> Bishops judging it not decent to live on the publick, chose rather to be
at their own charges. Three only out of <hi>Britain</hi> constrained through want,
yet refusing offered assistance from the rest, accepted the Emperors provision;
judging it more convenient to subsist by publick than by private sustenance.
Whence we may conclude, that Bishops then in this Island had their Livelihood
only from Benevolence; in which regard this Relater <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> a good
Author of the same time, highly praises them. And the <hi>WALDENSES,</hi>
our first Reformers, both from the Scripture and these Primitive Examples,
maintain'd those among them who bore the Office of Ministers, by Alms on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Take their very words from the History written of them in <hi>French,
Part. 3. l. 2. c. 2. La nourriture &amp; ce de quoy nous sommes converts, &amp;c. Our
Food and Cloathing is sufficiently administred and given to us by way of Gratitude
and Alms, by the good People whom we teach.</hi> If then by Alms and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
not by Legal Force, not by Tenure of Free-hold or Copy-hold: for
Alms, though just, cannot be compell'd; and Benevolence forc'd is Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
rather, violent and inconsistent with the Gospel; and declares him no
true Minister thereof, but a rapacious Hireling rather, who by force receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, eats the bread of violence and exaction, no holy or just livelihood, no
not civilly counted honest: much less beseeming such a Spiritual Ministry. But,
say they, our maintenance is our due, Tithes the Right of Christ, unseparable
from the Priest, no where repeal'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if then, not otherwise to be had, by Law
to be recovered: for though <hi>Paul</hi> were pleased to foregoe his due, and not to
use his power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. yet he had a power, <hi>v.</hi> 4 and bound not others. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
first, because I see them still so loath to unlearn their decimal Arithmetick
and still grasp their Tithes as inseparable from a Priest, that Ministers of the
Gospel are not Priests: and therefore separated from Tithes by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31824:12"/>
being neither called Priests in the new Testament, nor of any Order
known in Scripture: not of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> proper to Christ only; not of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron,</hi>
as they themselves will confess: and the third Priesthood only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is common to all the faithful. But they are Ministers of our high Priest. True;
but not of his Priesthood, as the <hi>Levites</hi> were to <hi>Aaron:</hi> for he performs that
whole Office himself incommunicably. Yet Tithes remain, say they, still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>released,
the due of Christ: and to whom payable, but to his Ministers? I
say again, that no man can so understand them, unless Christ in some place or
other so claim them. That example of <hi>Abram</hi> argues nothing but his voluntary
Act: Honour once only done, but on what consideration, whether to a Priest
or to a King, whether due the honor, arbitrary that kind of honor or not, will
after all contending be left still in meer Conjecture: which must not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the claim of such a needy and subtle spiritual corporation pretending
by Divine Right to the Tenth of all other mens Estates: nor can it be allowed
by wise men or the Verdit of Common Law. And the Tenth part, though once
declared holy, is declar'd now to be no holier than the other Nine, by that
Command to <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 10. 15, 28: whereby all distinction of holy and unholy
is removed from all things. Tithes therefore though claimed, and holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, yet are now released and quitted both by that Command to <hi>Peter,</hi>
and by this to all Ministers, abovecited, <hi>Luke</hi> 10; <hi>eating and drinking such things
as are given</hi> in reference to this Command: which he calls not holy things or
things of the Gospel, as if the Gospel had any consecrated things in answer to
things of the Temple, <hi>v.</hi> 13, but he calls them <hi>your carnal things, v.</hi> 11. without
changing their property. And what power had he? not the power of force but
of Conscience only, whereby he might lawfully and without scruple live on
the Gospel: receiving what was given him, as the recompence of his labor.
For if Christ the Master hath professed his Kingdom to be not of this World, it
suits not with that profession either in him or his Ministers to claim Temporal
Right from spiritual respects. He who refused to be the divider of an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
between two Brethren, cannot approve his Ministers by pretended right
from him to be dividers of Tenths and Freeholds out of other mens possessions,
making thereby the Gospel but a Cloak of carnal interest, and, to the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Master, turning his heavenly Kingdom into a Kingdom of this world,
a Kingdom of force and rapin. To whom it will be one day thundered more
terribly than to <hi>Gehazi,</hi> for thus dishonouring a far greater Master and his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>is this a time to receive money and to receive Garments and Olive-yards and
Vineyards and Sheep and Oxen?</hi> The leprosie of <hi>Naaman</hi> linked with that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
Curse of perishing imprecated on <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> may be feared will
<hi>cleave to</hi> such <hi>and to</hi> their <hi>seed for ever.</hi> So that when all is done, and Belly hath
used in vain all her cunning shifts, I doubt not but all true Ministers, considering
the Demonstration of what hath been here proved, will be wise, and think it
much more tolerable to hear, that no maintenance of Ministers, whether Tithes
or any other, can be setled by Statute: but must be given by them who receive
Instruction, and freely given, as God hath ordained. And indeed what can be
a more honourable maintenance to them, than such, whether Alms or willing
Oblations as these, which being accounted both alike as given to God, the only
acceptable sacrifices now remaining, must needs represent him who receives
them, much in the care of God and nearly relating to him, when not by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
force and constraint, but with Religious Awe and Reverence, what is given
to God, is given to him, and what to him, accounted as given to God? This
would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be well enough, say they; but how many will so give? I answer
as many, doubtless, as shall be well taught; as many as God shall so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31824:12"/>
move. Why are ye so distrastful, both of your own Doctrine and of Gods
Promises, fulfilled in the experience of those Disciples first sent: <hi>Luke.</hi>
22. 35. <hi>When I sent you without Purse and Scrip and Shoes; Lacked ye any
thing? and they said, nothing.</hi> How then came ours, or who sent them
thus destitute, thus poor and empty, both of Purse and Faith? Who stile
themselves Embassadors of Jesus Christ; and seem to be his Tithe-gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:
though an Office of their own setting up to his Dishonour; his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters,
his Publicans rather, not trusting that he will maintain them in
their Embassy, unless they bind him to his Promise by a Statute-Law that
we shall maintain them. Lay down for shame that Magnifie Title, while
ye seek maintenance from the People. It is not the manner of Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to ask maintenance of them to whom they are sent. But he who is
Lord of all things, hath so ordained; trust him then; he doubtless will
command the People to make good his Promise of maintenance more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
unasked, unracked for. This they know, this they preach, yet believe not;
but think it as impossible without a Statute-Law to live of the Gospel, as if
by those words they were bid go eat their Bibles, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> did
their Books; and such Doctrines as these are as bitter to their Bellies; but
will serve so much the better to discover <hi>Hirelings,</hi> who can have nothing,
though but in apperance, just and solid to answer for themselves against what
hath been here spoken; unless perhaps this one remaining pretence, which
we shall see either to be false or uningenuous. They pretend that their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
either at School or Universitie hath been very chargeable; and
therefore ought to be repaired in future by a plentiful maintenance: whenas
it is well known, that the better half of them; and oft-times poor and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Boyes of no merit or promising hopes that might entitle them to the
publick Provision, but their poverty and unjust favour of Friends, have
had most of their Breeding both at School and Universitie by Schollarships,
Exhibitions and Fellowships at the publick cost, which might ingage them
the rather to give freely, as they have freely received: or if they have
miss'd of these helps at the latter place, they have after two or three years
left the course of their Studies there, if they ever well began them, and
undertaken, (though furnished with little else, but Ignorance, Boldness
and Ambition, if with no worse vices;) a Chaplainship in some Gentlemans
House, to the frequent imbasing of his Sons illiterate and narrow Principles.
Or if they have lived there upon their own, who knows not that seaven
years charge of living there, to them who fly not from the Government of
Parents to the License of a Universitie, but come seriously to study, is
no more than ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be defrai'd and reimburs'd by one years Revenue of
an ordinary good Benefice? if they had then means of Breeding from their
Parents, 'tis likely they have more now; and if they have, it needs must be
Mechanick and Uningenuous in them to bring a Bill of charges for learning
of those Liberal Arts and Sciences, which they have learned (if they have

But they will say, we had betaken us to some other Trade
or Profession, had we not expected to find a better Livelihood by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.
This is that which I looked for, to discover them openly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true Lovers of Learning, and so very guilty of it, nor true Ministers
of the Gospel. So long agoe out of date is that old true saying, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1.
<hi>If a man desires a Bishoprick, he desires a good work:</hi> for now commonly he
who desires to be a Minister, looks not at the work but at the wages; and
by that Lute or Lowbel may be told from Parish to Parish all the Town

over. But what can be plainer Simonie, than thus to be at charges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, to no other end than to make Ministry double or trebly Benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al?
to whom it might be said as justly as to that <hi>Simon, thy mony perish with
thee; because thou hast thought the Gift of God may be purchas'd with mony: thou hast
neither part nor lot in this matter.</hi> Next, it is a fond Error though too much
believed among us, to think that the Universitie makes a Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
what it may conduce to other Arts and Sciences, I dispute not now: But
that which makes fit a Minister, the Scripture can best inform us to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from above; whence also we are bid to seek them, <hi>Mat. 9. 38. Pray ye

sent? by the Universitie, or the Magistrate, or their Belly? no surely; but
sent from God only, and that God who is not their Belly. And whether
he be sent from God, or from <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the inward sense of his Calling
and Spiritual Ability will sufficiently tell him; and that strong Obligation
felt within him, which was felt by the Apostle, will often express from
him the same words, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 16 Necessitie is laid upon me; yea, woe is me
if I preach not the Gospel.</hi> Not a beggarly necessity, and the <hi>woe</hi> fear'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
of perpetual want, but such a necessity as made him willing to preach
the Gospel <hi>gratis,</hi> and to embrace povertie rather than as a woe to fear it,
1 <hi>Cor. 12 28. God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 4. 11.
<hi>&amp;c. He gave some Apostles, &amp;c. For the perfecting of the Saints, for the
work of the Ministrie, for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come to the
unitie of the Faith,</hi> as he hath made them at the first, so he makes them still,
and to the worlds end. 2. <hi>Cor. 3. 6. Who hath also made us fit or able Ministers of
the New Testament.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 14. <hi>The Gift that is in thee, which was given
thee by prophesie and the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie.</hi> These are all
the means which we read of required in Scripture to the making of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.
All this is granted, you will say: but yet, that it is also requisite he
should be train'd in other Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which can be no where better had than
at Universities. I answer, that what Learning, either Human or Divine,
can be necessary to a Minister, may as easily and less chargeably be had in
any private House. How deficient else and to how little purpose, are all those
Piles of Sermons, Notes and Comments on all parts of the Bible, Bodies
and Marrow of Divinitie, besides all other Sciences in our <hi>English</hi> Tongue;
many of the same Books, which in Latine they read at the Universitie? And
the small necessity of going thither to learn Divinitie, I prove first from
the most part of themselves, who seldom continue there till they have well
got through Logick, their first Rudiments; though to say truth, Logick
also may much better be wanting in Disputes of Divinitie, than in the subtle
Debates of Lawyers and States-men, who yet seldom or never deal with
Syllogisms. And those Theological Disputations there held by Professors;
and Graduates, are such as tend least of all to the Edification or capacitie of
the People; but rather leaven pure Doctrine with Scholastical Trash, than
enable a Minister to the Preaching of the Gospel. Whence we may
also compute, since they come to recknings, the charges of his needful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary:
which though some shame not to value at 600<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. may be competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnished for 60. If any man for his own curiosity or delight be in
Books further expensive, that is not to be reckon'd as necessary to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial,
either Breeding or Function. But Papists and other Adversaries
cannot be confuted without Fathers and Councels, immense Volumes and of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31824:13"/>
vast charges. I will shew them therefore a shorter and a better way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation,
<hi>Tit. 1. 9. Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that
he may be able by sound Doctrine, both to exhort and to convince Gain-sayers;</hi>
who are confuted as soon as heard, bringing that which is either not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or against it. To pursue them further through the obscure and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
Word of Antiquity; Fathers and Councels fighting one against another;
is needless, endless, not requisite in a Minister, and refus'd by the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
of our Religion. And yet we may be confident, if these things are
thought needful; let the State but erect in publick, good Store of Libraries
and there will not want Men in the Church, who of their own inclinations
will become able in this kind against Papist or any other Adversarie. I have
thus at large examined the usual pretences of <hi>Hirelings,</hi> coloured over most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
with the cause of Learning and Universities; as if with Divines,
Learning stood and fell; wherein for the most part their pittance is so small<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
to speak freely, it were much better, there were not one Divine in the
Universitie; no School-Divinitie known, the Idle Sophastry of Monks, the
Canker of Religion; and that they who intended to be Ministers, were trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
up in the Church only, by the Scripture and in the Original Languages
thereof at School; without fetching the compass of other Arts and Sciences,
more than what they can well learn at Secondary Leasure and at home. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speak I this in contempt of Learning or the Ministry, but hating the
common cheats of both; hating that they who have preached out Bishops,
Prelates and Canonists, should, in what serves their own ends, retain their
false Opinions, their Pharasaical Leaven, their Avarice and closely their
Ambition, their Pluralities, their Nonresidences, their odious Fees, and
use their Legal and Popish Arguments for Tithes: that <hi>Independents</hi> should
take that Name, as they may justly from the true Freedom of Christian
Doctrine and Church Discipline, subject to no Superior Judge but God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and seek to be Dependents on the Magistrate for their maintenance,
which two things, <hi>Independence</hi> and <hi>State-Hire</hi> in Religion, can never consist
long or certainly together. For Magistrates at one time or other; not like these
at present our Patrons of Christian Liberty, will pay none but such whom by
their Committees of Examination, they find conformable to their Interest
and Opinions, and <hi>Hirelings</hi> will soon frame themselves to that Interest and
those Opinions, which they see best pleasing to their Pay-masters; and to
seem right themselves, will force others as to the truth. But most of all they
are to be revil'd and sham'd, who cry out with a distinct voice of Notorious
<hi>Hirelings,</hi> that if ye settle not our maintenance by Law, farewell the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
then which nothing can be uttered more false, more ignominious, and
I may say, more blasphemous against our Saviour; who hath promised
without this condition, both his holy Spirit, and his own presence with
his Church to the worlds end: nothing more false (unless with their own
mouths they condemn themselves for the unworthiest and most mercenary
of all other Ministers) by the experience of 300 years after Christ, and
the Churches at this day, in <hi>France, Austria Polonia,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
witnessing the contrary, under an adverse Magistrate, not a favourable,
nothing more ignominious, levelling or rather undervaluing Christ beneath
<hi>Mahomet.</hi> For if it be thus, how can any Christian object it to a Turk,
that his Religion stands by force only; and not justly fear from him this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
yours both by force and mony in the judgment of your own Preachers.
This is that which make Atheists sin in the Land; whom they so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of; not the want of maintenance or Preachers, as they alleage, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31824:14"/>
the many <hi>Hirelings,</hi> and Cheaters that have the Gospel in their hands,
hands that still crave, and are never satisfied. Likely Ministers indeed, to
proclaim the Faith, or to exhort our trust in God, when they themselves
will not trust him to provide for them in the message whereon, they say,
he sent them, but threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en for want of temporal means to desert it; call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that want of means, which is nothing else but the want of their own
faith: and would force us to pay the hire of building our faith to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuous
incredulity. Doubtless, if God only be he who gives Ministers to
his Church till the worlds end, and through the whole Gospel never sent
us for Ministers to the Schools of Philosophy, but rather bids us beware
of such <hi>vain deceit Col.</hi> 2. 8. (which the Primitive Church, after two or
three Ages not remembring, brought her self quickly to confusion) if all
the Faithful be now 4 <hi>Holy and Royal Priesthood, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5, 9. not excluded
from the Dispensation of things Holiest, after free Election of the Church
and imposition of hands, there will not want Ministers, elected out of all
sorts and orders of men, for the Gospel makes no difference from the
Magistrate himself to the meanest Artificer, if God evidently favour him
with Spiritual Gifts, as he can easily and oft hath done; while those Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor
Divines, and Doctors of the Tippet have been pass'd by: Heretofore
in the first Evangelick times (it were happy for Christendom if it were
so again) Ministers of the Gospel were by nothing else distinguished f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om
other Christians but by their Knowledge and Sanctitie of Life; for which
the Church elected them to be her Teachers and Overseers, though not
thereby to seperate them from what ever calling she then found them follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
besides, as the example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, and the first time of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
When once they affected to be called a Clergy, and became as it
were a peculiar Tribe of <hi>Levites,</hi> a Party, a dictinct order in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
bred up for Divines in babling Schools and fed at the publick cost;
good for nothing else, but what was good for nothing, they soon grew
idle; that Idleness with fulness of Bread begat pride and perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
with their Feeders, the despis'd Laitie, through all Ages ever since; to
the perverting of Religion, and the disturbance of all Christendom. And
we may considently conclude, it never will be otherwise, while they are
thus upheld undepending on the Church, on which alone they anciently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
and are by they Magistrate publickly maintain'd a numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of indigent Persons, crept for the most part out of extream want and
bad nature, claiming by divine Right and Freehold the tenth of our Estates,
to monopolize the Ministry as their peculiar, which is free and open to all
able Christians, elected by any Church. Under this pretence exempt from
all other imployment, and enriching themselves from the publick, they
last of all prove common Incendiaries, and exalt their horns against the
Magistrate himself that maintains them; as the Priest or <hi>Rome</hi> did soon after
against his Benefactor the Emperor, and the late Presbyters in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
Of which <hi>Hireling-</hi> Crew, together with all the Mischiefs, Dissentions, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Wars meerly of their kindling, Christendom might soon rid her
self and be happy, if Christians would but know their own Dignitie, their
Libertie, their Adoption; and let it not be wondred, if I say their Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Priesthood, whereby they have all equally access to any Ministerial
Function whenever call'd by their own abilities and the Church; though
they never came near Commencement or Universitie. But while Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
to avoid the due Labour of undertaking their own Religion, are
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tent to lodge it in the Breast, or rather in the Books of a Clergy-man,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31824:14"/>
and to take it thence by Scraps and Mammocks, as he dispences it in his
Sundays <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dole; they will be always learning and never knowing, always
Infants, always either his Vassals, as Lay-Papists are to their Priests, or at odds
with him. Reformed Principles give them some light to be not wholly
conformable, whence infinite disturbances in the State, as they do, must
needs follow. Thus much I had to say, and I suppose, what may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to them who are not ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

means to remove <hi>Hirelings</hi> out of the Church, than which nothing
can more conduce to truth, to peace and all happiness both in Church and
State. If I be not heard nor believed, the event will bear me witness to
have spoken truth: and I in the mean while have born my witness not out
