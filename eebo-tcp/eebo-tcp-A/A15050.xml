            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, amongst the many discouragements that haue attended this glorious businesse of the Virginian plantation: none hath been so frequent, and so forcible, as the calumnies and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, raised vpon our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the Countrey it selfe. These being deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Diuell, and set abroach by idle and base companions, are blowen abroad by Papists, Players and such like, till they haue filled the vulgar eares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hauing once entred, then they run (like wilde fire) from man to man: for as wilde fire, hardly findes a house which is not matter combustible; so these idle tales hardly meete a man who giues not (passage at the least, if not) credit to them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Diuell and his associates (of all sorts) hold
<pb facs="tcp:22749:3"/>
and practise this rule,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calumniare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacter, aliquid <unclear>haeret</unclear>.</hi>
               </note> as a sure Maxime, speake any thing, some will beleeue it; be it neuer so false, some will entertaine it, Truth and Innocencie shall neuer so wipe it off, but some thing will stick behind. Our onely comfort is (next to the assurance of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the worke) that men of honourable minds, and ingenuous dispositions, and all that are godly-wise, will check and controule these idle and slanderous surmises, as they meet with them: and for their better assistance, encouragement and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in so doing, our Counsell and Gouernours hold it needfull to make knowne to the world, such relations and informations as wee receiue from thence, from men of iudgement and experience, and of approued faithfulnesse and integritie. And therefore though this ensuing Treatise (written by Master <hi>Whitaker,</hi> one of our Ministers in <hi>Virginia</hi>) was spoken there, and sent hither rather for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vse and encouragement of such, whose purses heere, or persons there were ing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ged in the action, then with any intent to make it publike: yet for the reasons aforesaid, it was held fit after mature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to diuulge it, that so the naked and plaine truth may giue a iust affront to the cunning and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured falshoods deuised by the enemies of this Plantation.</p>
            <p>And because the man was once so well knowne to me (as he is still, and euer shall be beloued of me) I was desired by them, that may command mee to peruse the Originall it selfe, and for that I had (as they probably thought) some knowledge of his hand, to consider whether truly or suspiciously it
<pb facs="tcp:22749:3"/>
bore his name. And if I found cause of the least suspicion, to reiect it: but if, by true and infallible tokens, to be his hand, then to giue some testimony to the world of a truth so euident?</p>
            <p>Two points therefore I perceiue needfull to bee made knowne,<note place="margin">The f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rst point: who Master <hi>Whitaker</hi> is that wrote this Treatise.</note> which I desire all men to take notice of, from mee, who haue peculiar reason to know them both, so well, as few or no other can: first, who the Author is; and then, whether this come vndoubtedly from him or no.</p>
            <p>The Author is Master <hi>Alexander Whitaker,</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to the Colonie at <hi>Henrico,</hi> vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the valorous and worthy Knight Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Dale,</hi> with whom also he went: hee was sonne to that reuerend renowned, Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi>: a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Arts of fiue or sixe yeares standing in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge: was seated in the North countrey, where he was well approued by the greatest, and beloued of his people, and had competent allowance to his good liking, and was in as good possibility of better liuing, as any of his time: he had also some meanes of his owne left him by his parents: all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, he mee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely of himselfe, for ought I know, entertained a purpose of going to <hi>Virginia,</hi> to assist that Christian plantation in the function of a Preacher of the Gospell. And hauing after many distractions and combates with himselfe (as he told me) setled his resolution, that God called him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore he would goe: He accordingly made it good, notwithstanding the earnest diswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many his nearest friends, and the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements which he daily heard of, touching
<pb facs="tcp:22749:4"/>
the businesse and Countrey it selfe: and arriued there with Sir <hi>Thomas Dale,</hi> by a very speedy and safe passage (scarce of eight weekes long) in May 1611. from whence he hath since then written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comfortable letters, both to the Counsell and Committies, and his priuate friends: and of late (after he had beene there a yeare and more) hath sent vs this little Treatise, which as I know assuredly to come from him, and to be a great part of it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and all of it subscribed with his owne hand.<note place="margin">The second point That it is assuredly <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his owne hand.</note> So I dare say, if he had thought wee would haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it, he would otherwise haue adorned it: for I know (and so doe others that know him) hee is able to haue written it in Latine or in Greeke, and so to haue decked it both for phrase and stile, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ornaments of learning and language, as might shew him no vnworthy sonne of so worthy a father: And I dare say, if he liue, (be it in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi>) he will in due time manifest to the world by true and good euidence, that God hath made him heire, as of diuers of the holy vertues, so of a good part of the learning of his renowned father. And the more liberall am I in giuing him his due, the further he is off from mee, and by that meanes can be the lesse sensible of it.</p>
            <p>Nor speake I this so much for his sake (though I loue him aboue many, and know it aboue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) whose owne deeds will sufficiently approue him. As for the truth which is so much suppressed, and that Christian plantation so much disparaged in this base world: for are they not so impudent as to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who go thither but base and banke-rupt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb facs="tcp:22749:4"/>
and who haue no meanes of their owne? or else such as are perswaded and wrought vpon to go? And when they come there, are they not star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and do they not die like dogges? But how false this is in respect of the Countrey, the narration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced in this discourse from him that liues there, will declare: and how slanderous the other is to the persons, I shall in some sort make it appeare.</p>
            <p>I therefore hereby let all men know (and malice it selfe shall neuer disproue it) that a Scholler, a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate, a Preacher, well borne, and friended in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, not in debt nor disgrace, but competently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, and liked, and beloued where he liued, not in want, but (for a scholler, and as these dayes be) rich in possession, and more in possibilitie, of himselfe without any perswasion (but Gods, and his owne heart) did voluntarily leaue his warme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest, and to the wonder of his kindred, and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that knew him, vndertooke this hard, but in my iudgement, heroicall resolution to go to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and helpe <hi>to beare the name of God vnto the Gentiles.</hi> Men may muse at it; some may laugh, and others wonder at it. But will you know the reason? God will be glorified in his owne workes, and what he hath determined to do, hee will find meanes to bring to passe, for the perfecting therefore of this blessed worke; he hath stirred vp able and worthie men to vndertake the manning and managing of it: Magistracie and Ministery are the strength and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes; nay the very life and being of a Christian body politique. Therefore seeing without these all emptying of purses heere, and ventering of persons
<pb facs="tcp:22749:5"/>
thither, is to no purpose. God in his wisdome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and in his mercie prouoked, godly and able men to furnish both these functions: and such as might at home haue liued in places of honour and command, or in fashion competent and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their conditions.</p>
            <p>And this, Right Honorable, is one of the foure Arguments, and as it were plaine demonstrations, that haue conuinced mee to beleeue that assuredly God himselfe is the founder, and fauourer of this Plantation. And I will craue leaue of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to put them downe, because I am of minde, that the want either of knowledge, or considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, hath beene, and is the cause of the error and misprision of the world, touching this busines; and doe thinke that if men did ruminate, and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly consider of these particulars, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue themselues for their former thoughts, and say plainly, <hi>Digitus Dei est hic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The maruellous and indeed miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of our worthy Gouernours, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> Liefetenant generall, and Sir <hi>George Somers,</hi> Admirall, with all their company, of some hundred and fiftie persons, vpon the feared and abhorred Ilands of the <hi>Barmudaes,</hi> without losse of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when the same houre nothing was before their eyes, but imminent and ineuitable death; as neuer ship came there that perished not, so neuer was it heard of, that any ship wrackt there, but with the death of all or most of the people, saue onely this of ours. Oh how the world should haue rung of it ere this, if a farre lesse deliuerance had happened to
<pb facs="tcp:22749:5"/>
any of the Iesuiticall plantations: and surely the Counsell of <hi>Virginia</hi> doe wrong themselues and the businesse: nay they must giue me leaue to tell them they obscure the glorie of God, if they take not order, that a full compleate and plaine narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that whole action, both danger and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be published to the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The full discouerie (by meanes of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deliuerance) of those <hi>Barmuda</hi> Ilands, which hitherto haue been held in the world, as inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, so not habitable, but so fearefull, hideous and hatefull, as it seemed a place abandoned of God and Man, and giuen vp to the diuels power and possession, and to bee of all knowne places in the world, a very hell vpon earth, rather then a place for men to dwell in. But those honorable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being by the heauenly Pylot preserued vpon them, where all men else perished, liuing there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a yeare (till they had made themselues two little ships of Cedar) found it so goodly, so ritch, so plentifull, so healthie, and so temperate a Countrey, as in so long a time, scarce three died of 150. In so much as hardly could they get their men away, when they departed: these Ilands being then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and since possessed and planted by vs, are found a habitation of such safetie and securitie (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no enemie within nor any to be feared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, because the entrance is so difficult:) and of such plentie of all things for life; and of so good temper for health; and fraught with so many rich commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for satisfaction of the Aduenturers, as for the present they bee euen as a new life and a seminarie
<pb facs="tcp:22749:6"/>
to <hi>Virginia:</hi> and for the future times, it is likely will prooue a matter of greater consequence, then most men thinke of, and of more worth, then any Ilands or continent discouered in our age.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The speciall and most fatherly prouidence of God ouer this action, in vpholding it when man had forsaken it, and giuing it life againe when man had left it for dead: for had not Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> and Sir <hi>George Somers</hi> come into <hi>Virginia</hi> from the <hi>

               </hi> euen when they did, the poore Colonie (which during that yeare of their absence, by endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the miserie of misgouernement, had fallen into all extremitie of distresse) had been gone away, and our Plantation possessed by the Sauages: and (which was much more miraculous) when they being come in, and in all about 240. persons, and in such extreame miserie and famine, as the Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commander was euen forced to yeeld to that which others moued (but himselfe had rather haue died then done) namely to put themselues to the Sea to come for <hi>England,</hi> and quit the Countrey: and when this (full sore against his heart) was put in execution, and euery man aboord, their Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Armour buried, and not an English soule left in <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, and giuing by their peale of shot, their last and wofull farewell to that pleasant land, were now with sorrowfull hearts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the Riuer: Behold the hand of heauen from aboue, at the very instant, sent in the Right Honorable <hi>La war</hi> to meet them euen at the riuers mouth, with prouision and comforts of all kind: who if hee had staied but two Tydes longer had
<pb facs="tcp:22749:6"/>
come into <hi>Virginia,</hi> and not found one English man: whereupon they all with as much ioy retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as with sorrow they had come away, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as it were a new entrie and possession, tooke vp their Ordnance and their Armour, and the next day receiued their Honorable Lord Generall, with all ioy and applause, and from that day by Gods blessing they neuer wanting gouernment, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanted bread, for him that would take paines and do his dutie. If euer the hand of God appeared in action of man, it was heere most euident: for when man had forsaken this businesse, God tooke it in hand; and when men said, now hath all the earth cast off the care of this Plantation, the hand of heauen hath taken hold of it: God therefore bee glorified in his owne worke.</p>
            <p>But it will be heere said by such as are strangers or enemies to this businesse: if this Countrey be so rich and plentifull, and your Commanders so wise and prouident, as you pretend; how could it be that they being there, and not hindered by warre nor inuasions, should fall into such extremities of want, as to be faine to quit the Countrey, and come for England, or else there to starue for want of food.</p>
            <p>Indeed (Right Honorable) this Obiection is of such moment, as though I am vnwilling to be large, yet must I needs spend some lines in giuing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; which shall be such, I hope, as shall giue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the indifferent, and stop the mouthes of the malignant.</p>
            <p>Let therefore the Christian and courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be pleased to know, that when the two forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:22749:7"/>
Commanders, in the great shippe (called the Sea-Venture) were lost, and yet saued vpon the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudaes,</hi> their Fleet consisting of sixe or seuen ships more, and fraught with almost foure hundred men landed (after a long and terrible tempest) in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where so many men wanting their Gouernors, and being too many to be commanded by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony they found there before them, fell first into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and at last into plaine distractions: and so one yeare of misgouernment ouerthrew that body, which till then had prospered, and by good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was brought to so good a state, as at their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they had corne sufficient in store, a haruest in the ground, good store of liuing cattell, and had the Sauages in good correspondencie: but this one, yea our want of gouernment) the mos<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> disasterous accident that euer befell that businesse) brought all to nothing, for it hindered the building of houses, and planting of corne, nay it burnt vp the houses, and consumed the prouisions; so that of good store of poultrie, it left not one aliue, and of six hundred liuing Swine, not three: and which was worse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed our men, and which was worst of all, it lost vs the Sauages, which since hath cost many a man his blood, and to this day is not recouered.</p>
            <p>All this while were the Commanders, and their company in the <hi>Barmudaes,</hi> where no man drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, but all the world held them dea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> men; and being there where none could heare from them, nor they from any others: after almost a years absence, they go out of the rockes, in the two ships themselues there made, and going for <hi>Virginia,</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:22749:7"/>
landed there in the beginning of May; where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to find a full and well planted Colony, of six or seuen hundred men, well stored with corne and cattell: (in assurance whereof, they had carried no liue Hogges with them from the <hi>Barmudaes,</hi> nor other prouisions, more then for a monthes voyage, which they might haue done in as great abundance as they could haue carried) they contrariwise found a poore Colony, of not an hundred men, who had endured all miseries, and more then euer we heard of; all the liue-cattell, corne, and other prouisions spent, and the Sauages their deadly enemies. At which meeting, though there was ioy to see them, who had beene held so long in the bottome of the sea; yet their sweete congratulation was sharpely sauced, when it was knowne they had no prouision of their owne, the Sauages sought their liues, the earth could yeeld none, where none had been plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if it had, yet in May the old being spent, the new is not readie. All which considered, it soone appeared there was no humane help left on earth, but with all speed to hasten for England for new prouisions: which motion, though so harsh to the honourable Commander, as hee had rather there haue starued, yet being carried by voices, he would not ouer-rule: and so hauing buried their Armour and Ordnance, they went away as wee heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>All this to be true, I know well, and if any man aske how I know it, for their satisfaction I answere; I haue it from the faithful relation of that religious, valoutous and prudent Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas
<pb facs="tcp:22749:8"/>
Gates,</hi> then and yet our Liefetenant generall, who being himselfe in his owne person a doer of much, a sufferer of more, and an eye-witnes of the whole, hath since related this and much more vnto mee, face to face: and all that know him, know him for such a man, as well deserues to be beleeued.</p>
            <p>All which then being true (as is also well knowne to many my betters) then let any reasonable man <unclear>iudge</unclear> (especially if hee bee experienced in such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) if there were not a necessary cause of their comming away, and yet neither fault in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, nor want in the Countrey.</p>
            <p>My fourth and last Argument is, the stirring vp of so many Honorable and worthy persons of all conditions, to disburse so freely and so willingly, such faire summes of money, and some of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a good part of their estate, and that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine or apparant hope of speedie profit. This to do willingly and voluntarily, and without assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of gaine, cannot be, but the working of God to some higher end then ordinary. And if it be said, there be some, that wish their money in their purses; it may be so, but for one so base-thoughted man, I dare say we haue many, that wish a great deale more out of their purses, conditionally this happy busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may take good effect. And this, though it be much, yet in my iudgement is but little, to this that followeth: that God should vouchsafe to stirre vp such able and worthy men, for the functions both of Magistracie and Ministerie, who vpon very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine hope of profit, and most certaine danger of life it selfe, should put themselues into this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:22749:8"/>
and voluntarily vndergoe the danger of sea, and all the miseries and difficulties that necessarily and vndoubtedly attend a new Plantation. To haue done this vpon pressure, or by calling of Superiours or command of a State, had bin little; to haue done it vpon safe and faire tearmes, and without danger, had been no great matter; to haue done it vpon expectation, and assurance of high rewards and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent profit, had been nothing: but to do it volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, vpon sight of danger present and certaine, but of gaine future and contingent; seeing it is contrary to the course of reason, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not proceed from folly or madnes (they being wise men) nor from humor and rashnes (being stayed men) nor from malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednes (being men that liued in good respect at home) nor in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of meriting (being not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, but of sound religion): It must therfore needs proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extraordinary motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods Spirit. For if any out of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or malice do obiect, they had nothing to do at home; it is false and friuolous; false, for they were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imployed; friuolous, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more had lesse to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, yet would not go.</p>
            <p>As for those that thinke they wanted in England, do they not see how in disgracing the persons, they honor the Countrey? for if they went from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to <hi>Virginia,</hi> because they were in want, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily stay there still; then it followes that <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> is able to supply the wants of England. But how idle and slanderous that imputation is, may easily appeare, if wee take a view of the persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And to beginne with the Magistrates and Commanders, what Noble man is there in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?
<pb facs="tcp:22749:9"/>
what Coronall or Captaine in the Low-countries, but knowes, and will acknowledge, that the Right Honorable, the Lord <hi>La war,</hi> and the Right worthie Knights, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Dale,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Somers,</hi> bee persons of honor, estimation, and good respect, and had both meanes and imployment at home of their owne: but to speake of them and other religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Captains, who voluntarily left their easie, pleasant, and wealthy liues in England, and betook themselues to this voyage; I will leaue it to some who are better able to doe it, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and worth: I will containe my selfe within my element, and speake of them of my owne function: and amongst them, of those two especially, Master <hi>Glouer,</hi> and Master <hi>Whitaker,</hi> because they went by my knowledge, but not by my procurement; for I testifie it for truth, they moued me that they might go; not I them, that they would go. Master <hi>Glouer</hi> an ancient Master of Arts in Cambridge, an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Preacher in Bedford and Huntington-shire, reuerenced and respected, and neuer wanting a competent stipend, yet of himselfe (I know not how, nor why) made knowne his desire to goe to <hi>Virginia,</hi>

            <p>Master <hi>Whitaker,</hi> a man borne, brought vp, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litied, and qualified, setled and prouided for, as you heard before (of whom I haue spoken the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was of long time so well knowne to mee) though he liued as well, and in as good case and credit, as most yong men in our Church: yet volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and not suddenly; but after serious delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ouercomming (as himselfe said) many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temptations, and outward discouragements and disswasions; remooued himselfe from a good stipend of valew and certaintie,<note place="margin">About fortie pound a yeare in a cheape Country.</note> and put himselfe into this dangerous voiage, where now he diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preacheth, and Catechizeth: and thereby, and by other Ministeriall duties, publike and priuate (and otherwise also, for he is otherwaies qualitied) he performes daily and diligent Seruice, acceptable to God, &amp; comfortable to our people; ouer whom hee is Pastor: and from whence, as a token of his loue and duetie to the Counsell and Aduenturers, and as a testimonie of the good liking he conceiues of the Countrey (by these almost two yeares expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) hee hath sent vs this plaine, but pithie and godly exhortation, interlaced with narrations of many particulars touching the Countrey, climate,

            <p>There is but one thing more, that an indifferent Reader may probably stumble at, which I wil brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and easily remoue. It may bee very well, (will some say) that these Honourable persons, godly Preachers, and valourous Gentlemen out of their good minds, or desire to see forren countries, might put themselues for once into this worke, but doe they hold on, or are they there still? and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, hauing once bin there, will go againe? or being there, would they not full gladly bee at home again, if they could? Indeed, such base words are giuen out by some, but they be either ignorant, or malicious; and how can Ignorance or Malice speake the truth? Ignorance cannot, though it would, and Malice will not, though it can: but will your Lordship, and all men know the truth?

For the Diuell knowing that where Christ wins, he loseth, doth with all his might and policie hinder the publishing, and propagation of the Gospell. Such was his practise to discourage the Israelites from the conquest of Canaan, raising vp ten of their owne Princes, that weakened the hands of their brethren.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E bould my Hearers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne riches, and frame your selues to walke worthie of God; for none other be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of God, but those that lightly esteeme of riches. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse is the riches of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; vertue is the only thing that makes vs rich and honourable in the eyes of wise men. Pouertie is a thing which most men feare, and couetous men cannot endure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: yet pouertie with a contented mind is great riches: hee truely is the onely poore man, not that hath little, but which continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth more. Riches (as they are esteemed) haue no limits, but still crie, <hi>plus vltra,</hi> still more. Neither is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:22749:16"/>
any man absolutely rich, but in comparison of a poorer man, of one (I meane) that hath lesse then he: for if he make diligent enquirie, he may finde diuers richer then himselfe: if riches of gold and the like, had bin such as the world doth esteeme them, it is not likely that Iesus Christ would haue taken so poore a state vpon him: when we esteeme them at the best, they are but an heauy burthen to some, an Idoll to others, and profitable to few.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>Salomon</hi> hauing before explained the maruellous vanitie of riches, and how they are wont to be abused, as well of couetous, as of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall men: in the first six verses of this Chapter tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs how we may vse them well, and God may make the vse of them blessed vnto vs. In the second Chapter, he hath said, <hi>I haue gathered vnto me siluer and gold, and the chiefe treasures of Kings &amp; Prouinces: And I was great, and encreased aboue all that were before me in Ierusalem: Then I looked, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of the spirit.</hi> In the Fifth Chapter, <hi>Hee that loueth siluer, shall not be satisfied with siluer; and he that loueth riches, shall be without the fruit of it. And what good commeth to the owners thereof, but the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof with their eyes.</hi> And he addeth, <hi>The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie of the rich will not suffer him to sleepe.</hi> Againe, <hi>There is an euill sicknes that I haue seene vnder the Sun, Riches reserued to the owners therof, for their euill.</hi> Now in the beginning of this chapter, he hath set downe a remedie to both these euils, whereby our riches may be made constant vnto vs: we may take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and profit by them, and our posterity through many descents may enioy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after vs. <hi>Cast thy bread</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:22749:16"/>
(saith he) <hi>vpon the waters</hi>: why? <hi>for after many daies thou shalt find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sentence is Rhetoricall, full of figures, and needs some explaining. <hi>Bread</hi> in Scripture is vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken for all kind of meat and drinke, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.5. and in diuers other places: but here (I take it) it is more generally put for all kind of <hi>Almes,</hi> of what nature soeuer: not onely for meate and drinke, money, apparell, or the like, but also for any kind of thing, whereby we may releeue the necessitie of our neighbour. <hi>Waters</hi> also are heere metaphorically put for all those men, who stand in need of the almes of our liberalitie, whether they be such as cannot, but gladly would requite vs, or else such as being able, forget to be thankefull.</p>
            <p>So that the plaine meaning of the words is this. Giue liberally thine almes to all sorts of men, that may stand in need of thy helpe: hide not thine eies at the miserable state of the afflicted; neither stop thine eares at the crie of the poore, though they be not able to recompence thy wel-doing: reproach not thine enemie, when he is punished, but rather ouercome his euill deeds with thy goodnesse; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer any to returne empty handed from thee, whom God shall offer to thy liberality. For though thou canst not presently expect a plentifull reward of thy well-doing, though the persons, to whom thou hast cast thine almes, bee not able to requite thee, or forgetfull of good turnes, yet be assured of it, that God beholdeth thy charitie, and will at his appointed time requite thee, euen in this world, if it be good for thee, thou shalt taste of his bountie; but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22749:17"/>
in the world to come hee hath reserued for thee a most glorious crowne of blessed immortalitie. This is the soule and substance of this short sentence.</p>
            <p>The words naturally diuide themselues into two principall parts. A Commandement to be <hi>Liberall</hi> and <hi>Charitable</hi>: and a promise of reward, which hereafter we shall find. The Commandement also containeth in it fiue points, touching the doctrine of <hi>Liberalitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1 The dutie to be performed, <hi>Cast thy bread</hi>: be liberall to all.</item>
               <item>2 The manner of bestowing our almes, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting it away.</item>
               <item>3 What is to be giuen, <hi>Bread</hi>; all things needfull, yea, and of the best kind.</item>
               <item>4 Who may be liberall: euen those that haue it: <hi>Thy bread,</hi> it must be thine owne.</item>
               <item>5 To whom we must be liberall; to all, yea, to the <hi>VVaters.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First, we wil briefly speake of these fiue points of this Commandement as they lie in order; and then directly come vnto the promise more particularly. The enioyned dutie is <hi>Liberalitie,</hi> which sometimes is termed <hi>Almes</hi>: sometimes more largely is vsed for all kind of good workes, and very often is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the names of <hi>Charitie</hi> and <hi>Brotherly loue:</hi> all which being in sense and signification one, shall in the naming of them, be vsed all as one. <hi>Liberality</hi> is the true practise of Christian <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courtesie,</hi> one towards another. A vertue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God, and commended by the examples of the best; which makes vs accepted of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22749:17"/>
of men. <hi>Faith</hi> giues comfort to my soule, and ministers peace to my conscience: <hi>Hope</hi> teacheth me not to be hastie, but to waite patiently the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time of God; but the practise of <hi>Loue</hi> maintaines my <hi>Hope,</hi> and assures me that my faith is effectuall; and moreouer is beneficiall vnto others, yea, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>Now abideth Faith, Hope and Loue, euen these three</hi>; but the greatest of these is <hi>Loue.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God made men great, and filled their cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers with his treasures, but that they should as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full stewards of Gods store, liberally prouide for the necessitie of his Saints? The richest man in the world, hath no right by nature to the things hee doth possesse; for naked hee came into the world, and he must returne naked out of the same againe. Why then hath God made thee rich, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that to thy liberalitie which was not thine owne; but that thou shouldest bee bountifull to those whom he hath made poore?</p>
            <p>What goodnesse or excellencie did God see in thee, more then in the poorest reasonable creature, before thou yet wast, that hee should make thee rich, and him poore? doth it not befall to thee, as to the foole? yea verily, <hi>the condition of men</hi> in this case,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.19.</note> and <hi>the condition of beasts is all one: As one dieth, so dieth the other; all go to one place, and all was of the dust; and all shall returne to the dust.</hi> But that which Nature hath not distinguished, the wisedome and bountie of God hath by a property of calling alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and lending his treasures to the rich men of the world, hath shewed to them an example of his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie,</hi> to this end, that they might be open-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22749:18"/>
to others, distributing as faithfull stewards of his gifts, according to the necessitie of the Saints. Wherefore our Sauiour Christ proclaimeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.45.</note> 
               <hi>Who is a faithfull seruant and wise, whom his master hath made ruler ouer his houshold, to giue them meat in season. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is that seruant, whom his master when hee commeth shall finde so doing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth vs to doe good to all, but specially to the houshold of faith: and writeth to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.</note> to <hi>charge them that be rich in this world, that they do good, and be rich in good workes, ready to distribute and communicate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Titus</hi> 2.</note> He sheweth <hi>Titus</hi> also, that the end of our <hi>Redemption is, that we might be zealous of good workes:</hi> and therefore willeth him to affirme,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That they which haue beleeued in God, might be carefull to shew forth good workes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas, the practise of this age is farre otherwise. For those that haue wealth, either abuse them to the satisfying of their prodigall lusts, in Whoring, Dicing, or Drinking, till all or the most be spent; or else (as others) vse them only to looke vpon them, or that it might be said they haue them: few or none there be, that vse them aright to the glory of God, and reliefe of his children. God gaue commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that there should not be a begger in Israel: but how many idle persons haue we in the streetes of our Cities, in the High-wayes, and corners of our pathes, which day and night call vpon the passers by, and yet remaine vnprouided for? How many hungry, naked, fatherlesse, widowes, poore men and oppressed, perish for want of that which God hath lent to these rich theeues? (for no better then theeues are they, keeping vp that which God gaue

            <p>I might say much more in the commendation of <hi>Liberalitie:</hi> but the time requiring lesse, I come now with haste vnto the second point of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The second manner how.</note>
               <hi>Cast thy bread,</hi> &amp;c. What? hath God giuen vs goods to cast them away?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.6.</note> yea verily, for <hi>Salomon</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:22749:19"/>
saith, <hi>There is a time to seeke, and a time to lose; a time to keepe, and a time to cast away.</hi> Which time of losing and casting away the Scripture, heere noteth. But by this word of casting away, is meant no violent reiecting, or negligent losing of some things that we hate or doe not greatly esteeme: but a liberall giuing away of such things as we do possesse: which may appeare by these reasons.</p>
            <p>First by the nature of the originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which most vsually signifieth to send out, <hi>Mittere &amp; emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere</hi>: and so it is vsed by <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 7.7. where hee saith, that <hi>Noah</hi> sent out the Rauen, and afterward the Doue twice, hee vseth this word continually, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>&amp; emisit:</hi> and so hath both <hi>Pagninus</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerus</hi> expounded it. Secondly, it may appeare by the agreement of the Text, with the verses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for the Doctrine handled is touching <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,</hi> allegorically compared to the seede of bread (for so bread may be heere vnderstood) which hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen cast not away, but sow as well in moist, as in drier grounds: and so <hi>Tremelius</hi> doth interpret them. Now as husbandmen do not cast away their seede, which they fling into the ground, for hatred or neglect, but vnder hope of Gods blessing: euen so <hi>liberall men</hi> exercising the <hi>workes</hi> of charitie, doe not cast away their almes, as one that casteth a bone to a dogge, or flingeth dead flowers from him, &amp;c. but freely bestow the almes of God without pride, vaine-glory, or disdaine, yea, without hope of any restitution, or any other recompence, besides the acceptance of God, and the reward which God shall giue vnto him in this life, but especially in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22749:20"/>
great day of his haruest. And with this doth agree that saying of <hi>Salomon, There is that <unclear>scattereth</unclear> and is more increased.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.24.</note> So that the spirit of God teacheth vs by this word of casting, how we may scatter our good deeds and bestow our almes, as that they may be accepted of God and profitable vnto vs. As, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>aske and receiue not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames.</hi> 4.</note> because they aske amisse: so the most that cast away finde not, because they bee illiberall in <hi>their liberalitie,</hi> or because they giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse.</p>
            <p>Let vs then learne from hence to cast away <hi>our bread freely: freely we haue receiued</hi> our goods from God, let vs freely giue: so shall wee become follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of God and our <hi>liberalitie</hi> draw toward the perfection required of vs. The commandement of Christ is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48.</note> that we should <hi>be perfect as our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is perfect.</hi> Now then Gods liberalitie being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, let vs also be perfect in our good deeds: this is a poynt very needfull for vs all to consider; for God requireth <hi>liberalitie from vs all</hi>; and very few among the diuers multitudes of giuers giue aright, it shall bee counted a high point of wisdome in vs: first, to informe our selues thoroughly, by what meanes our charitie may become perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of God, before we reach out our hands to giue. Our great Master Christ, the mouth of God to man, handling the doctrine of <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie</hi> in his Sermon on the mount,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1.</note> hath taught vs many rules touching the right manner of giuing almes, which wee may referre to these fiue poynts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that we giue in <hi>faith,</hi> for without <hi>faith</hi> it is vnpossible to please God;<note place="margin">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22749:20"/>
almes cannot please God: the summe of which <hi>faith</hi> is this: first, that God will accept of vs and our almes for his sonne Iesus Christs sake; for no worke of any man can please God, before the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe bee approued of him, and then all our good deeds shall be accepted of him. Secondly, that wee be not hastie in expecting a present recompence of reward, but to waite patiently vpon God by <hi>faith</hi> for the good successe of our almes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames</hi> 5 7.</note> So husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that cast their seed into the ground, stay vntill the time of haruest, depending vpon God for the fruitfull increase of their labors.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> So <hi>Paul</hi> doth plant and <hi>Apollos</hi> doth water, but euen both these doe waite vpon God for the blessing of their Ministery: This is the cause why heretofore much of our almes bestowed vpon the affaires of <hi>Virginia</hi> haue been so cast away, that they could neuer be found againe hitherto: for many of vs haue not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, nor approued of him. Some of our Aduenturers in <hi>London</hi> haue been most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable couetous men, sold ouer to Vsurie, Extortion and Oppression. Many of the men sent hither haue bin Murtherers, Theeues, Adulterers, idle persons, and what not besides, all which persons God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euen from his very soule: how then could their almes or any thing else which they doe, be pleasing vnto God? Such mens prayers are abominable in the sight of God, how much more their Almes?</p>
            <p>The second rule in giuing is, that wee giue in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Loue, which whosoeuer lacketh cannot giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

The sum of which loue is, that out of mere pittie, compassion and fellow-feeling of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wants, <hi>we cast our bread to him</hi>; not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of law, and custome of parishioners, neither for any sinister respect of praise or vaine-glorie. Wherefore the same <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom</hi> 12.8.</note> 
               <hi>He that distributeth, let him doe it with simplicitie:</hi> and our Sauiour Christ commandeth,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we must giue our almes <hi>bountifully and with a cheerefull minde:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> but as euery one wisheth in his heart, so let him giue, not <hi>grudging or of necessitie, for God loueth a cheerefull giuer: He that soweth sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall reape also sparingly; and he that soweth liberally shall reape also liberally.</hi> Yet notwithstanding this bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifulnes hath two proper limits, beyond which it is not to passe. First, wee must bee bountifull onely according to <hi>abilitie</hi>; for if we giue all at one time, we may leaue our selues naked, and be disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled for giuing any more hereafter:<note place="margin">

The second limite of our bountie is, that we giue more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or lesse according to the necessitie of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, Rom. 12.18.</p>
            <p>The fourth rule of right giuing, ariseth from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22749:22"/>
hence, which is, that we giue our almes with <hi>discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> First, that we communicate such things as the neede of our neighbour requireth; the thirstie man must haue drinke, the hungrie and naked, meate and apparrell, the imprisoned for debt, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and the like.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> Secondly, we must not defer the time of our reliefe, lest that wee giue too late, when the case of our neighbour is past helpe: <hi>Bis dat qui cito dat:</hi> The Physition comes too late when the patient is dead.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.11.</note> But a word spoken in season is like apples of gold and pictures of siluer: whilest thou may, then doe good, thou knowest not then what may befall afterward.<note place="margin">

Surely if there were euer any opportunitie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of setting forward this Plantation, the season is now most fit. Strike then whilest the iron is hot, do this good worke whilest you may, before it bee too late. Thirdly, we must chuse such a place as may be void of vaine-glorie and hipocrisie. Our left hand may not know what our right hand doth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Honores palam dandi sunt, elcemosinae clam:</hi> Honors may bee openly giuen for the incouragement of others; but almes deeds must bee giuen in secret: then thy Father that seeth in secret shall reward thee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly.</p>
            <p>The last rule of giuing is, that we giue in Iustice; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which is, that we cut not large thongs out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans lether; that wee giue not other mens goods, but such as bee our owne, and those truely gotten, the text saith, that the bread must be thine,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22749:23"/>
euen thine owne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.7.</note> not another mans. <hi>The true fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is to breake thine owne bread to the hungrie, to bring the poore that wander into thine house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Thirdly, what is to be giuen.</note>The next point to be handled is, wherein we are to bee liberall, what wee are to giue: <hi>Salomon</hi> hath shut vp all vnder the name of <hi>Bread,</hi> whereby (as I said before) is meant all things wherein we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the necessities of our neighbours: for if a man shall cast his drinke, apparell, golde, and the like vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters, he shall after many daies find them: but <hi>Salomon</hi> included al these almes vnder the name of <hi>bread,</hi> because hee would enforce this doctrine vnder one Allegorie of sowing, and therefore doth suite his phrase with words of most significancie. Againe, bread is the staffe of good nourishment, and the most vsuall kinde of almes which we giue. This article then of this Commandement is, that if our neighbours doe stand in need of our helpe in any thing wherein we may helpe them; we are not to with-hold our hand from them, but to cast our almes liberally vnto them.</p>
            <p>And this must needs be the meaning of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.13.</note> for <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs to <hi>distribute according to the necessitie of the Saints:</hi> but the Saints neede ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things very often beside bread, yea besides food and rayment, wherefore our almes must needes bee cast out, according to the seueral necessities of those that want.</p>
            <p>The wants of men bee diuers; some are of the mind, some of the bodie, and some be of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goods: and thus haue the Diuines deuided them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:22749:23"/>The distresses of the mind are most grieuous and needs the best reliefe; but of them all, ignorance of spirituall matters is most common, most dangerous. The bread that must relieue this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou.</hi> 10</note> is the mouth of wisdome, which is liberall in instruction, which is as finest siluer, which shall be fruitfull in vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which doth know what is acceptable, which is a tree of life and which feedeth many. This was the almes which <hi>Paul</hi> went to cast away in <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and liberally distributed in <hi>Mars</hi> his streete in <hi>Athens.</hi> And this is the almes which may bee most profitable vnto this barbarous Countrey of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where the name of God hath beene yet scarce heard of. The wants of the bodie be many, but not so dangerous: and those bee principally hunger, thirst, sicknesse, and wounds: according to which cases our almes must be bestowed. The sentence of the great Iudge shall bee according to the tenor of this:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</note> When I was an hungry you fed mee, when I was a thirst you gaue mee drinke, when I was sicke you visited mee. As for the helping of wounded men, our Sauiour Christ hath giuen vs a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and incouragement to bee mercifull toward them, in the case of the wounded Iew, whom when neither the Priest nor the Leuite that passed by would relieue,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.30</note> a Samaritan most liberally prouided for; euen so let vs doe. The wants of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours outward state are most and euery where common. First, wee must freely giue to the poore, as clothes to the naked, liberall gleanings to the stranger, fatherlesse and widow; Iustice in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the oppressed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:22749:24"/>Secondly, we must freely lend whereby we may be oftentimes as beneficiall to our neighbour as by giuing.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.41.</note> Concerning which our Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>From him that would borrow of thee, turne not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy face.</hi> And the commandement of God is, <hi>Thou shalt open thy hands to thy poore brother, and lend him suffiicient for his neede which he hath.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdlie, we must freelie forgiue and remit the due debt which our neighbour doth owe vnto vs, if it so fall out that God bring him into decay and extreame pouertie.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26.</note> So the pledge or pawne which our neighbour leaueth with vs, if it belong to his necessarie vse, as his raiment or the like, wee are to restore it to him againe, before the Sun goe downe. And this is the exhortation of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to the hard harted rulers of the Iewes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.11.</note> that oppressed their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with Vsurie and the like. And thus manie waies may we cast away our bread, and for all these kinds of Almes, bread is heere to be taken.</p>
            <p>Wherefore seeing there bee so manie waies to exercise our liberalitie, let vs not think it sufficient to be bountifull in one kinde of good workes, and hard hearted in others, but that our liberalitie may be profitable to vs, let vs giue in all, as the present need requireth. Some men will giue almes at their gate, of the scraps of their table, but will not part with one pennie of monie to anie charitable deed. Others will bee ready to spend their voice in the instruction and reproofe of their neighbour: or it may bee to speake a good word for him, but will part with none of their owne goods to helpe them. And some men will be onely liberall in building of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22749:24"/>
Churches, Hospitalls and the like, which indeede be good works, yet are they neither meritorious, nor the most principall, for manie times the gift of a peece of bread, or a cup of colde water is more needfull, <hi>Salomon</hi> putteth bread the cheefest almes, and Christ at the day of iudgement, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne men for want of buildings, but of other more needfull almes, and lesse chargeable. But if the Church of Rome will maintaine the merit of their Abbies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</note> Nunneries, Temples, let them heare a great schoole man of their owne, <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> who reckoned vp the seuerall works of charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the body,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> 2.2. <hi>quae.</hi> 32. <hi>ar.</hi> 2.</note> hath either forgotten or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected such buildings: hee hath shut them vp all in this one verse <hi>visito, poto, cibo, redimo, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>go, colligo, condo,</hi> the meaning whereof is that true liberality consisteth in visiting the sicke, giuing drinke to the thirsty, meat to the hungry, in redeeming the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and imprisoned, in couering the naked, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering or calling home poore trauelling strangers to his house, and in buriall of the dead, but in all these he hath made no mention of those buildings. Wherefore let vs learne not onely to spend Gods almes, but to be such prouident Stewards or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiders for the seruants of God, as that wee may bee liberall in all kinde to giue them meat, drinke and other of Gods goods in necessity according to the seuerall necessities of them.</p>
            <p>The fourth point in order to bee considered is,<note n="4" place="margin">Who.</note> who may properlie giue almes which may easilie be determined, if we consider the diuers kinds of good works which wee haue now lately rehearsed.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:22749:25"/>
For hee that is not able to bee liberall in one kinde, may bee fit for another, which may be noted in the almes of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> entring into the Temple,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1.</note> when they restored the lame cripple to his health, to whom they said in this manner, <hi>Siluer and Gould haue I none, but such as I haue, that giue I thee.</hi> Whence wee may conclude that <hi>Euery one may bee a giuer of almes.</hi> For he that hath not the riches of wealth and cannot giue much, let him giue a little according to the measure of his abilitie. Wherefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ commendeth the liberality of the poor widdow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.41.</note> which cast into the treasury but two mites, which was all that she had.</p>
            <p>Those also that haue not money and goods to helpe their neighbour, let them lend the helpe of their bodily labour, of their callings, or the vertues of their soule and body vnto them, and this was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Almes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these whom pouerty, age or subiection (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hard gouernment of others) hath made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for these two: let them exercise their <hi>Liberality,</hi> in praying for the reliefe of those that want, which is the proper calling of <hi>Almes-men, and Hospitall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>; yea it is the dutie of vs all.</p>
            <p>This is the doctrine, and I beseech God to stirre vp your minds to the practise of liberalitie in all things towards all men. And remember the poore estate of the ignorant inhabitants of <hi>Virginia.</hi> Cast forth your almes (my brethren of England) and extend your liberality on these charitable workes, which God hath called you to performe. Let not the seruants of superstition, that thinke to merit
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:22749:25"/>
by their good works (as they terme them) goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond vs in well doing; neither let them be able to open their mouths against vs, and to condemne the religion of our Protestation, for want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable deeds.</p>
            <p>It may bee some men will say the worke is great, I am not able to relieue it, I answer the work is such and such order is now taken, that those that cannot giue much, may be liberal in a little. Those that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not helpe in monies by reason of their pouerty, may venture their persons hither, &amp; heere not only serue God, but helpe also these poore Indians, and build a sure foundation for themselues, but if you can do neither of these, then send your earnest prayers to God for the prosperity of this worke.</p>
            <p>The first point in order, &amp; last Article of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement remaineth now to be handled: which is concerning the persons to whom we are to bee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall,<note n="5" place="margin">To whom</note> that is to all men in generall, who stand in need of our releefe and helpe. For if corne be cast vpon the waters, or very watry grounds, it cannot prosper or bring forth increase: So if good works be bestowed on vnthankfull or vnable persons; wee are not to expect a recompence of reward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. From whence wee may gather an argument from the lesse to the greater: that if wee are to be liberall to such as cannot or will not requite vs, or to such as will not deserue our kindnesse, how much more to them, that may deserue our good will, or will make conscience (if they can) to be thankfull vnto vs in the best manner? So then if we must be liberal both to good men and bad; to thankfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22749:26"/>
to our enemies and friends, it followeth that we must be <hi>Charitable</hi> to all men.</p>

                  <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.10.</note>And this is the rule of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> do good to all, but specially to the houshold of Faith. Though the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God bee chiefely to be respected: yet are we not to withhold our almes from any one, if they need our helpe. The rule of Christ is answerable: <hi>Giue him that asketh,</hi>

            <p>From hence we may take iust occasion to blame the vncharitable disposition of hard hearted rich men, and wealthy Parishes, which suffer multitudes of poore men and women to perish in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for want of their reliefe. The commandement of God is, that there should be no beggers in Israel. But looke into the streets of our Cities, and passe from them into all the quarters of England, and you shall find neither Court nor Countrey, Citie, or Village, without the importunate crauings of those that crie <hi>Giue, Giue.</hi> From hence it is that so many base theeues, and pettie robbers, lurke in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner, vntill the common trees of execution hang them vp. From hence it is that so many poore mens children, wanting the charitie of others, to see them brought vp in learning and some honest vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, were better if they had neuer been borne,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22749:26"/>
then to liue in such misorder, as most of them doe. Repent therefore betimes, you able misers, lest the woe of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> fall vpon you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iames</hi> 5.1.</note> lest God heare the cries and curses of the poore, and heape miseries, without measure, vpon such miserable men. And now let me turne your eyes, my brethren of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to behold the waters of <hi>Virginia</hi>: where you may behold a fit subiect for the exercise of your <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie,</hi> persons enough on whom you may cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your <hi>Bread,</hi> and yet not without hope, after many daies to finde it. Yea, I will not feare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vnto you, that those men whom God hath made able any way to be helpefull to this Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made knowne vnto them the necessities of our wants, are bound in conscience by vertue of this precept, to lay their helping hands to it, either with their purse, persons, or prayers, so farre forth as God hath made them fit for it. For it is euident that our wise God hath bestowed no gift vpon any man, for their priuate vse, but for the good of other men, whom God shall offer to their <hi>Liberalitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, since God hath opened the doore of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to our countrey of England, wee are to thinke that God hath, as it were, by word of mouth called vs in, to bestow our seuerall <hi>Charity</hi> on them. And that this may the better appeare, we haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasons to encourage vs to bee <hi>Liberall</hi> minded and open-handed toward them.</p>
            <p>First, if we consider the almost miraculous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and continuance of this plantation, we must needs confesse that God hath opened this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage vnto vs, and led vs by the hand vnto this work.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22749:27"/>
For the Marriners that were sent hither first to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer this Bay of <hi>Chaesapeac,</hi> found it onely by the meere directions of Gods prouidence: for I heard one of them confesse, that euen then, when they were entred within the mouth of the Bay, they dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the place they sought for to haue beene many degrees further. The finding was not so strange, but the continuance and vpholding of it hath bin most wonderfull. I may fitly compare it to the growth of an Infant, which hath been afflicted from his birth with some grieuous sicknes, that many times no hope of life hath remained, and yet it liueth still. Againe, if there were nothing else to encourage vs, yet this one thing may stirre vs vp to go on cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with it: that the Diuell is a capitall enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and continually seeketh which way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prosperitie and good proceedings of it. Yea, hath heretofore so farre preuailed, by his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the couetous hearts of many back sliding Aduenturers at home, and also by his seruants here: some striuing for superioritie, others by murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, mutinies, &amp; plaine treasons; &amp; others by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, prophanenes, idlenes, and such monstrous sinnes; that he had almost thrust vs out of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and had indeed quitted this Land of vs, if God had not then (as one awaked out of sleepe) stood vp and sent vs meanes of great helpe, when we needed most, and expected least reliefe. The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of those two honorable Knights, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> and Sir <hi>George Somers,</hi> with Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> and the rest of the Aduenturers in the Sea Venture, as also their happy deliuerance out of those vnhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22749:27"/>
and vnfrequented (because feared) Ilands of the <hi>Barmudaes,</hi> could proceed from none other, but the singular prouidence of God. If this worthie Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> had bin hindred but one weeke longer, it might be feared that the famine, which had by that time deuoured the most of our countrimen heere, would haue consumed the rest. And when hee considering that his weake meanes was not able to restore, or sustaine the burthen of such wofull distresses, had shipped the few remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for England, and had forsaken with <hi>Hannibals sighes,</hi> the first builded <hi>Iames</hi>-Towne: vpon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den newes met him, of the comming in of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Lord <hi>La war,</hi> with a fresh supplie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he presently returned to the Towne he had so lately forsaken. Since, when this English Colony hath taken better root; and as a spreading herbe, whose top hath bin often cropped off, renewes her growth, and spreads her selfe more gloriously, then before. So this Plantation, which the diuell hath so often troden downe, is by the miraculous blessing of God reuiued, and daily groweth to more happy and more hopefull successe. I haue shut vp many things in few words, and haue alleadged this onely to proue vnto vs, that the finger of God hath been the onely true worker heere; that God first shewed vs the place, God first called vs hither, and here God by his speciall prouidence hath maintained vs. Wherefore, by him let vs be encouraged to lay our helping hands to this good work, (yea Gods work) with all the strength of our abilitie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let the miserable condition of these
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22749:28"/>
naked slaues of the diuell moue you to compassion toward them. They acknowledge that there is a great good God, but know him not, hauing the eyes of their vnderstanding as yet blinded: wherefore they serue the diuell for feare, after a most base manner, sacrificing sometimes (as I haue heere heard) their owne Children to him. I haue sent one Image of their god to the Counsell in <hi>England,</hi> which is painted vpon one side of a toad-stoole, much like vnto a deformed monster. Their Priests (whom the call <hi>Quiokosoughs</hi>) are no other but such as our English Witches are. They liue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in bodie, as if their shame of their sinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued no couering: Their names are as naked as their bodie: they esteeme it a vertue to lie, deceiue and steale as their master the diuell teacheth them. Much more might be said of their miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but I refer the particular narration of these things to some other season. If this bee their life, what thinke you shall become of them after death? but to be partakers with the diuell and his angels in hell for euermore. Wherefore my brethren, put on the bowels of compassion, and let the lamentable estate of these miserable people enter in your consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: One God created vs, they haue reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soules and intellectuall faculties as well as wee; we all haue <hi>Adam</hi> for our common parent: yea, by nature the condition of vs both is all one, the seruants of sinne and slaues of the diuell. Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (I beseech you) what was the state of <hi>England</hi> before the Gospell was preached in our Countrey? How much better were we then, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22749:28"/>
concerning our soules health, then these now are? Let the word of the Lord sound out that it may be heard in these parts; and let your faith which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God spread it selfe abroad, and shew forth the charitable fruits of it in these barren parts of the world: <hi>And let him know that he which hath conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a sinner from going a stray out of his way, shall saue a soule from death, and hide a multitude of sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of vs should misdoubt that this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people is vncapable of such heauenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, let such men know that they are farre mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the nature of these men, for besides the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God, which is without respect of persons, made as well to vnwise men after the flesh, as to the wise, &amp;c. let <unclear>vs</unclear> not thinke that these men are so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as some haue supposed them: for they are of bodie lustie, strong, and very nimble: they are a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnderstanding generation, quicke of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, suddaine in their dispatches, subtile in their dealings, exquisite in their inuentions, and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their labour. I suppose the world hath no better <unclear>marke-men</unclear> with their bow and arrowes then they be; they will kill birds flying, fishes swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and beasts running: they shoote also with meruailous strength, they shot one of our men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnarmed quite through the bodie, and nailed both his armes to his bodie with one arrow: one of their Children also, about the age of 12. or 13. yeares, killed a bird with his arrow in my sight. The seruice of their God is answerable to their life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed with great feare and attention, and many strange dumb shewes vsed in the same, stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:22749:29"/>
forth their limbes and straining their bodie, much like to the counterfeit women in <hi>England</hi> who faine themselues bewitched, or possessed of some euill spirit.</p>
            <p>They stand in great awe of their <hi>Quiokosoughs</hi> or Priests, which are a generation of vipers euen of Sathans owne brood. The manner of their life is much like to the popish Hermits of our age; for they liue alone in the woods, in houses <unclear>sequestred</unclear> from the common course of men, neither may any man bee suffered to come into their house or to speake with them, but when this Priest doth call him. He taketh no care for his victuals, for all such kinde of things both bread and water, &amp;c. are brought vnto a place neere vnto his cottage and there are left, which hee fetcheth for his proper neede. If they would haue raine, or haue lost any thing, they haue their recourse to him, who coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for them, and many times preuaileth. If they be sicke, he is their Physition, if they bee wounded he sucketh them. At his command they make warre and peace, neither doe they any thing of moment without him. I will not bee teadious in these strange Narrations, when I haue more perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into their secrets, you shall know all. Finally, there is a ciuill gouernement amongst them which they strictly obserue, and shew thereby that the law of Nature dwelleth in them: for they haue a rude kinde of Common-wealth, and rough gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein they both honour and obey their Kings, Parents, and Gouernours, both greater and lesse, they obserue the limits of their owne
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22749:29"/>
possessions, and incroach not vpon their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours dwellings. Murther is a capitall crime scarce heard of among them: adultery is most seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished, and so are their other offences. These vnnurtured grounds of reason in them, may serue to incourage vs: to instruct them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, the rewarder of all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, not doubting but that he that was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to saue vs by his word, when we were nothing, wil be mercifull also to these sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> in his appointed time, in whom there bee remaining so many footsteps of Gods image. Wherefore you wealthy men of this world, whose bellies God hath filled with his hidden Treasure: trust not in vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riches, neither cast your eyes vpon them; for riches taketh her to her wings as an Eagle, and fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into Heauen.<note place="margin">

The Prodigall men of our land make hast to fling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Gods treasures, as a greeuous burthen which they desire to be eased of. Some make no scruple at it, to spend yearely an hundred pounds, two, three, fiue hundred, and much more about dogs, haukes and hounds and such sports; which will not giue fiue hundred pence to the releefe of Gods poore members. Others will not care to lose two or three thousand pound in a night, at Cards and Dice, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:22749:30"/>
yet suffer poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> to perish in their streets for want of their <hi>Charitable Almes.</hi> Yea diuers will hyer gardens at great rents, and build stately houses for their whoores, which haue no compassion on the Fatherlesse and widdowes. How much better were it for these men to remember the afflictions of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> to extend the bowels of their compassion to the poore, the fatherles, afflicted and the like, then to mispend that which they must giue a straite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of at the day of iudgement? Are not these miserable people heere better then hawks, hounds, whores and the like? O you that spend so much on them, thinke it no dishonour to your persons, no impouerishing to your state, to bestow somewhat to the raising vp of Christs kingdome, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of so holy and heauenly an action as this is, God of his goodnesse that hath giuen you abilitie to performe it, make you willing to help it forward with the best of your power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For after many daies thou shalt find it.</hi> Hitherto haue we spoken of the commandement and the seuerall branches of the same: Now follows the reason of this Commandement which the Holy Ghost v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth heere to stir vs vp vnto liberality, which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the reward which wee shall haue of our well-doing, <hi>for after many daies thou shalt find it,</hi> the some of which reason is, that though God doe not presently reward our well doing, but doe defer the requitall of it for many daies, yet thy good works shall not perish, but God at the appointed time, shall abundantly recompence thy liberality. Out of this reason wee may gather two notable conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:22749:30"/>
touching the reward of liberality. First wee may conclude from hence, that God doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies giue a present reward to the good works; he doth for the most part defer his rewards manie daies, sometimes many yeares, yea sometimes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen till death it selfe, when hee will neuer cease to reward vs according to our works, with vnspeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ioyes of blessed immortality. And the wisdome of God doth thus defer his rewards for most singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reasons. For if God should presently reward good works, who then would not be a prodigall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, who then would bee a faithfull giuer? For when a man is certaine of present gaine he will not spare to giue abundantly, because he seeth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding profit ready to be put into his hands for so doing: and this would stirre vp the most couetous wretch in the world to be liberall, gaping out of meere couetousnesse, after an ouer-plus of reward. Wherefore God hath made the time and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his rewards doubtfull, that we might not bee couetous of the benefit: but that he might exercise our faith, and teach vs with patience of hope to expect the appointed time of his reward. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall point of perfect charity is, that wee giue in faith, whose true nature is to depend vpon God for the good successe of our almes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</note> 
               <hi>for Faith is the ground of things that are hoped for, &amp; the euidence of things that are not seene:</hi> now if we should haue the reward of good works in the view of our eies, and ready as it were to be put into our hands, what place would then be left for practise of faith whose obiect is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, whose hopes bee of afterwards? Wherefore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:22749:31"/>
               <hi>S. Paul</hi> aduiseth <hi>Timothy</hi> to charge them that bee rich in this world to be rich in good works,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.</note> not for any present reward which they were to haue, but onely for the benefits to come, <hi>laying vp (saith he) in store for themselues a good foundation, against the time to come, that they may obtaine eternall life.</hi> The message which God sent to <hi>Cornelius</hi> by his Angell is worthy to be noted of vs.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4.</note> 
               <hi>Thy prayers</hi> (saith the Angell to him) <hi>and thine almes are come vp into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before God. Cornelius</hi> was a man that had giuen much almes to the poore, which God did not presently reward, for hee did seeme rather to haue forgotten his liberality, wherefore now hee saith that his almes are come vp into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the meaning whereof must needs bee, that though God did seeme to neglect his liberality, yet he had not forgotten his almes, but now meant to reward them.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 4.10.</note> The Shunamite woman that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided a chamber, table, stoole, and candlesticke for <hi>Elisha.</hi>

But marke the ende, God forgat not to requite them, euen in this world, for the Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite had her sonne restored to her aliue by the prayer of <hi>Elisha</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Dorcas</hi> by the ministery of <hi>S. Peter</hi> was raised againe to life. By this that hath bin said, it may easily appeare, that God dooth out of his infinit wisdome defer the time, &amp; prolong (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies for the most part) the reward of our almes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22749:31"/>
and liberality; from whence we may learne, that it is the propertie of true charity to neglect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent reward.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> For Loue the mother of liberality is not couetous, but is bountifull, it beleeueth all things, it hopeth all things: and Faith the grounde and first pedegree of right giuing, doth not make hast,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.16.</note> but reposeth it selfe vpon the expectation of hope. Wherefore in communicating our goods, and distributing our almes, let vs haue no couetous eye, ayming at the present profit: but let vs depend with faith vpon the future blessing which shall come in due season. For if wee would thoroughly consider the thing as it is, wee shall finde that all the reward of our well doing comes not from any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or desert of ours, but onely from the meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. What man can say that the goods which he possesseth be his owne? Or what haue wee that we haue not receiued? When wee haue made the most and best of our selues, we are but the stewards of Gods goods, and the Almners of his purse. Why then should wee looke to be payed extraordinarily for the giuing of that which is not our owne, but which wee are commaunded by our Master to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow?

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 17.20</note> It follows then that all the good which we doe receiue, comes not from our deserts, but onely from the riches of Gods bountie, which rewardeth vs according to our works done, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of ours whatsoeuer. Wherefore the eyes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22749:32"/>
do not looke after the reward of the worke, but they search how to do the worke, how to giue the almes, so as that they may bee pleasing to God, and of him accepted, and by him (if hee see it good) rewarded.</p>
            <p>Let then your liberall minds (you honorable and charitable Aduenturers of <hi>Virginia</hi>) be stirred vp to cast your almes on the waters of <hi>Virginia,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of present profit. The base affections of the Vsurer will not looke for the ouerplus of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, vntill the couenanted time of his loane be expired. The husbandman casting his seed into the earth, waiteth vpon God vntil Haruest for a fruitful crop: verily he that beleeueth doth not make haste. Be not ouer hastie with God: God will not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, that he may make you more famous in the world, that the world may see your zeale, and beare witnesse to the patience of your faith, not to greedie haste of couetous desires. The worke is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and now more then euer, sustained by most honorable men. O let vs not then be weary of well-doing: fortie yeares were expired, before <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> could plant in Canaan, and yet God had called them by the word of his mouth, had led them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by an high hand. Yet may you boldly looke for a shorter time of reward. The returnes which you haue from the East Indies, though they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich, yet is the aduenture doubtfull, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence chargeable, and the expectation of returne, of three yeares continuance.</p>
            <p>Let me aduise you to be as liberall in aduenture hither, and I dare affirme, that by Gods assistance,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:22749:32"/>
your profitable returnes shall be of more certainty, and much shorter expectation. Remember, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, how many liues were lost, how many yeares were spent, what discouragements, what great losses the Aduenturers of Spaine and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale suffered and vnder-went, before they could be setled in the West Indies, or receiue any profitable returne from thence: and now behold what rich loads, what profitable returnes are yearely shipped from thence. Shall our Nation, hitherto famous for noble attempts, and the honorable finishing of what they haue vndertaken, be now taxed for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie, and blamed by the enemies of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, for vncharitablenesse? Yea, shall we be a scorne among Princes, and a laughing stocke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our neighbour Nations, for basely leauing what we honorably began; yea, for beginning a Discouerie, whose riches other men shall gather, so soone as wee haue forsaken it? Awake you true hearted English men, you seruants of Iesus Christ, remember that the Plantation is Gods, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your Countries. Wherefore, aime not at your present priuat gaine, but let the glory of God, whose Kingdome you now plant, &amp; good of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whose wealth you seeke, so farre preuaile with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you respect not a present returne of gaine for this yeare or two: but that you would more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally supplie for a little space, this your Christian worke, which you so charitably began. As for those spirits of slander, whom the Diuell hath stirred vp to speak euill of this good Land, and to weaken the hands of our brethren, lest they should go forward,

We do willingly lend to a good Creditor, especially if we haue his bond, with his hand and seale to pay vs. What, shall we trust man, and distrust God?

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Giue almes of those things which you haue, and behold all things shall bee cleane vnto you</hi>: which is as much, as if he should say,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22749:34"/>
giue almes, be liberall; for in so doing, your goods shall be sanctified vnto you, and you shall attaine to an holy and pure vse of your goods. The Scripture is plaine in this point.</p>
            <p>I will now come therefore to giue you a view in briefe, of those commodities and rewards that we shall find heere, after not many, but a few dayes.</p>
            <p>First, our <hi>Liberalitie</hi> grounded on faith, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in loue, will be a meanes to helpe our soules forward in their passage to heauen; for they are the high-way and trodden path, wherein wee must walke to euerlasting life. Therefore, the more any man abounds in good workes, the more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shall be his passage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they are such necessarie fruits of faith, that faith cannot goe without them: for where no good workes are, there is no faith; and where true sauing saith is, there will be shewed good workes; yea, we cannot hold true faith from doing good: reade for the proofe of this, the Epistle of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and the first Epistle of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> besides the places which we haue heretofore alleaged.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Liberalitie</hi> is a notable meanes against couetousnesse: for where true Charitie dwels, there is no roome left for Couetousnesse to harbour in: two contraries cannot be both at once in one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; God and the Diuell will not dwell together, neither can Couetousnes and Liberalitie be linked together in one breast.</p>
            <p>Thus shall the Lord abundantly reward our soules for our liberalitie, and many waies more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides if we bee truly charitable. But the bountie of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22749:34"/>
God would haue vs to tast of some temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings besides, and after a few daies, if we be cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full giuers, returne a plentifull reward home vnto vs. Wherefore that I might content the longing minds of euery man, I thought it fit in the last place to recite a few commodities which in short time we may finde here in <hi>Virginia,</hi> for the charitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in this Plantation. The whole Continent of <hi>Virginia</hi> situate within the degrees of 34. and 47. is a place beautified by God, with all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature, and enriched with his earthly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: that part of it, which we already possesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the Bay of <hi>Chaesapheac,</hi> and stretching it selfe in Northerly latitude to the degrees of 39. and 40. is interlined with seuen most goodly Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, the least whereof is equall to our Riuer of Thames: and all these Riuers are so neerely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">As 14. or 16. miles.</note> as that there is not very much distance of drie ground betweene either of them, and those seuerall maine lands are euery where watered with many veines or creekes of water, which sundrie waies doe ouerthwart the land, and make it almost nauigable from one Riuer to the other. The commoditie whereof to those that shall inhabite this land is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in respect of the speedie and easie transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of goods from one Riuer to the other. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better manifest it vnto you, but in aduising you to consider whither the water or land hath beene more beneficiall to the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> but here we shall haue the commoditie both of water and land more readie with lesse charge and labour then hath been bestowed by them in turning land into water.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:22749:35"/>
The Riuer which wee inhabit (commonly called <hi>Powhatans</hi> Riuer) ebbeth and floweth 140. miles into the maine; at the mouth whereof are the two Forts of <hi>Henrico</hi> and <hi>Charles:</hi> 42. miles vpward is the fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st and mother Christian towne seated, called <hi>Iames-Towne,</hi> and 70. miles beyond that vpward, is the new towne of <hi>Henrico</hi> built, and so named in the memorie of the Noble Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of lasting and blessed memorie: tenne miles-beyond this Towne is a place called the <hi>Fals,</hi> because the Riuer hath there a great descent falling downe betweene many minerall Rocks which bee there: twelue miles farther beyond this place is there a Christall Rocke wherewith the Indians doe head many of their arrowes: three dayes iourney from thence is there a rocke or stonie hill found, which is in the top couered all ouer with a perfect and most rich siluer oare. Our men that went to discouer those parts had but two iron pickaxes with them, and those so ill tempered that the points of them turned againe and bowed at euery stroake, so that wee could not search the entrailes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place, yet some triall was made of that oare with good successe, and argument of much horpe. Sixe daies iourney beyond this Mine a great ridge of high hils doe runne along the maine land, not farre from whom the Indians report a great Sea doth runne, which we commonly call a <hi>South Sea,</hi> but in respect of our habitation is a <hi>West Sea,</hi> for there the Sunne setteth from vs. The higher ground is much like vnto the molde of <hi>France,</hi> clay and sand being proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably mixed together at the top; but if we digge
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22749:35"/>
any depth (as wee haue done for our bricks) wee finde it to bee redde clay, full of glistering spangles. There bee many rockie places in all quarters; and more then probable likeliehoods of rich Mines of all sorts: though I knew all, yet it were not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient at this time that I should vtter all, neither haue we had <unclear>meanes</unclear> to search for any thing as wee ought, thorough present want of men, and former wants of prouision for the belly. As for Iron, Steele, Antimonium, and <hi>Terra sigillata,</hi> they haue rather offered themselues to our eyes and hands, then bin sought for of vs. The aire of the Countrey (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about <hi>Henrico</hi> and vpward) is very temperate and agreeth well with our bodies. The extremitie of Sommer is not so hoat as <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor the colde of Winter so sharpe as the frosts of <hi>England.</hi> The Spring and Haruest are the two longest seasons and most pleasant, the Summer and Winter are both but short: The Winter is for the most part drie and faire, but the Summer watered often with many great and suddaine shewers of raine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the cold of Winter is warmed, and the heate of Summer cooled. Many haue died with vs hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thorough their owne filthinesse and want of bodilie comforts for sicke men; but now very few are sicke among vs: not aboue three persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the inhabitants of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nrico</hi>; I would to God our soules were no sicker then our bodies, and that other of Gods blessings were as generall and common as the bodilie health. I haue seene it by experience, and dare boldly affirme it, that sicknesse doth more rage in <hi>England</hi> quarterly, then heere
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22749:36"/>
yearely. I doubt that hereafter when our Hospitall or Guest-house is built vp, you heare of many more cut off by the sword of Iustice (vnlesse the better people be sent ouer) then perished by the diseases of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>The naturall people of the Land are generallie such as you heard of before. A <unclear>people</unclear> to be feared of those that come vpon them without defensiue Armour, but otherwise faint-hearted (if they see their Arrowes cannot pearce) and easie to bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. Shirts of Male, or quilted cotten coates are the best defence against them. There is but one or two of their pettie Kings, that for feare of vs haue desired our friendship; and those keepe good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with vs being very pleasant amongst vs, and (if occasion be) seruiceable vnto vs. Our eldest friends bee <hi>Pipsco</hi> and <hi>Choapoke,</hi> who are our ouertwhart neighbours at <hi>Iames-Towne,</hi> and haue been friendly to vs in our great want. The other is the <hi>Werewance</hi> of <hi>Chescheak,</hi> who but lately traded with vs peaceab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we were once the masters of their Countrey, and they stoode in feare of vs (which might with few hands imployed about nothing else, be in short time brought to passe) it were an easie matter to make them willingly to forsake the diuell, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the faith of Iesus Christ, and to be baptized. Besides, you cannot easilie iudge how much they would be auaileable to vs in our discoueries of the Countrey, in our buildings and plantings, and quiet prouision for our selues, when wee may peaceably passe from place to place without neede of armes or guarde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:22749:36"/>The meanes for our people to liue and subsist here of themselues are many and most certaine both for Beasts, Birds, Fish, and Hearbes. The beasts of the Countrey are for the most part wilde: as Lions, Beares, Wolues and Deare: Foxes blacke and read, Rakowns, Beuers, Possowns, Squerrels, Wilde-Cats, whose skinnes are of great price, and Muske-Rats which yeelde Muske as the Muske-Cats doe. There be two kindes of beasts amongst these most strange: one of them is the female Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sown, which will let forth her young out of her bellie, and take them vp into her bellie againe at her pleasure without hurt to her selfe, neither think this to be a Trauellers tale, but the very truth; for nature hath framed her fit for that seruice, my eyes haue been witnes vnto it, and we haue sent of them and their young ones into <hi>England.</hi> The other strange conditioned creature is the flying Squirrell, which thorough the helpe of certaine broad flaps of skin growing on each side of her forelegs, will flie from tree to tree 20. or 30. paces at one flight and more, if she haue the benefit of a small breath of winde. Besides these, since our comming hither, wee haue brought both Kine, Goates, and Hogges, which prosper well, and would multiplie exceedingly if they might bee prouided for. This Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides is replenished with birds of al sorts which haue bin the best sustenance of flesh, which our men haue had since they came; also Eagels and Haukes of all sorts, amongst whom are Ausprech, fishing Hauke, and the Cormorant. The woods be euery whereful of wilde Turkies which abound, and will runne as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:22749:37"/>
swift as a Grey-hound. In winter our fields be full of Cranes, Herons, Pigeons, Partridges and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds: the riuers and creekes bee ouer spread euery where with water foule of the greatest and least sort, as Swans, flocks of Geese &amp; Brants, Duck and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, Sheldrakes, Dyuers, &amp;c. besides many other kinds of rare and delectable birds, whose names and natures I cannot yet recite, but we want the means to take them. The Riuers abound with Fish both small and great: the sea fish come into our Riuers in March, and continue vntill the end of September: great sculles of Herings come in first: Shads of a great bignesse, and Rock-fish follow them. Trouts, Base, Flounders, and other daintie fish come in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other bee gone: then come multitudes of great Sturgeons, wherof we catch many, and should do more, but that we want good nets answerable to the breadth and deapth of our Riuers: besides our channels are so foule in the bottome with great logs and trees, that we often break our nets vpon them: I cannot reckon nor giue proper names to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs kinds of fresh fish in our riuers; I haue caught with mine angle, Pike, Carpe, Eele, Perches of sixe seuerall kindes, Crea-fish and the Torope or little Turtle, besides many smaller kinds. Wherfore, since God hath filled the elements of earth, aire, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with his creatures, good for our food and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, let not the feare of staruing hereafter, or of any great want, dishearten your valiant minds from comming to a place of so great plentie: if the Countrey were ours, and meanes for the taking of them (which shortly I hope shall bee brought to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:22749:37"/>
passe,) then all these should be ours: we haue them now, but we are fain to fight for them, then should we haue them without that trouble. Feare not then to want food, but onely prouide meanes to get it here. We haue store of wild-foule in <hi>England,</hi> but what are they better for them that cannot come by them, wanting meanes to catch them, euen such is and hath been our case heretofore.</p>
            <p>But these are not all the commodities which we may finde heere: for the earth will yeelde much more fruite to our industrious labours, as hath been proued by the Corne and other things which wee haue planted this last yeare. I haue made proofe of it with the helpe of three more, being a stranger to that business and hauing not a bodie inured to such labour, and set so much corne, <hi>horis succisiuis vnius septimanae,</hi> in the idle howres of one weeke, as will suffice me for bread one quarter of a yeare: and one commoditie is besides in this corne, that from the time of setting, vnto the time of gathering, fiue moneths will abundantly suffice: for we set corne from the beginning of March, vntil the end of May, and reape or gather in Iulie, August &amp; September. Our English seeds thriue very well heere, as Pease, Onions, Turnips, Cabbages, Coleflowers, Carrets, Time, Parseley, Hysop, Marioram, and many other whereof I haue tasted and eaten.</p>
            <p>What should I name vnto you the diuers sorts of Trees, sweete woods and Physicall plants: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kinds of Oakes and Walnut-trees. The Pines, Pitch-trees, Soape-ashes trees, Sassafras, Cedar, Ash, Maple, Cyprus, and many more which I dailie see,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:22749:38"/>
and admire at the beautie and riches which God hath bestowed vpon this people, that yet know not how to vse them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore you (right wise and noble Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers of <hi>Virginia</hi>) whose hearts God hath stirred vp to build him a Temple, to make him an house, to conquer a Kingdome for him here: be not discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with those many lamentable assaults that the diuell hath made against vs: he now rageth most, because he knoweth his kingdome is to haue a short end. Goe forward boldly, and remember that you fight vnder the banner of Iesus Christ, that you plant his Kingdome, who hath already broken the Serpents head: God may deferre his temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for a season, but be assured that in the end you shall find riches and honour in this world, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed immortality in the world to come. And you my brethren my fellow labourers, send vp your earnest prayers to God for his Church in <hi>Virginia,</hi> that since his haruest heere is great, but the labourers few, hee would thrust forth labourers into his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest; and pray also for mee that the ministration of his Go<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
