            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

them already, yet because I am loth to carry mine any longer
about me, who giues me most, shall take it, and the diuell giue
him good on't: this point is cut out of villanous Sheepeskin
parchment in a Scriueners Shop, tagg'd with the gold of a
Ring, which the Pillory robb'd him of, when it borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his eares; if he doe but fasten this to the new Doublet of a

foureteene of them goe to our Bakers dozen.</p>
               <p>The definition of him may be this: a point of Knauery, is
an occult quality tyed on a riding knot, the better to play fast

with the sope of good gouernment.</p>

                  <l>Who has not these, shall euer passe</l>
                  <l>For a great Acromaticall Asse:</l>
                  <l>Buy then this boxe of braines, who buyes not it,</l>
                  <l>Shall neuer surfet on too much wit.</l>
               </lg>
               <stage>Then the Pedler brought forth a
Whetstone.</stage>
               <p>But leauing my braines, I come to a more profitable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity:
for considering how dull halfe the wits of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
be, I thought it not the worst traffique to sell Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones.</p>
               <p>This Whetstone will set such an edge vpon your inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that it will make your rusty iron braines, purer mettle,
then your brazen faces. Whet but the knife of your Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
on this Whetstone, and you may presume to dine at the
Muses Ordinary, or suppe at the Oracle of <hi>Apollo.</hi> If this be
not true, I sweare by the Doxies Petricoates, that I'le neuer
hereafter presume of a better vocation, then to liue and dye
the miserable factor of Conny-skins.</p>
               <stage>Then the Pedler brought out
Gloues.</stage>
               <p>I haue also Gloues of seuerall qualities: the first is a paire
of Gloues made for a Lawyer, made of an intire Loadstone,
that has the vertue to draw gold vnto it; they were perfumed
with the conscience of an Vsurer, and will keepe scent till
wrangling haue left <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall; they are seamed with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26172:22"/>
Indenture, by the needleworke of Mortgage, and fringed
with a <hi>Nouerint Vniuersi.</hi> I would shew you more, but it is
against the Statute, because a <hi>Latitat</hi> hath beene serued lately
vpon them. And few of you need any Gloues, for you weare
Cordouant hands.</p>
               <stage>Night-Caps.</stage>
               <p>My next Commodities, are seuerall Night-caps, but they
dare not come abroad by Candlelight. The first is lined with
Foxe furre, which I hope to sell to some of the Sophisters;
it hath an admirable faculty for curing the Crapula, aboue
the vertue of Iuie, or bitter Almonds; nay, the porredge pot's
not comparable vnto it.</p>
               <p>I haue another, fit for an Alderman, which <hi>Acteon</hi> by his
last Will and Testament bequeathed to the City as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Charter, it was of <hi>Dianas's</hi> owne making; <hi>Albumazers
Otacousticon</hi> was but a Chamberpot in comparison.</p>
               <p>I could fit all heads with Night-caps, except your grane
ouerwise Metaphysical heads: Marry, they are so transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that they will not bee comprehended within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant
of a Night-cap.</p>
               <stage>Ruffes.</stage>
               <p>I haue also seuerall Ruffes; first, a Ruffe of pure Holland for
a Dutch drunkard, a Ruffe of Cobweb-lawne for the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
statutes: I haue a Ruffe for the Colledge too: but by this
badge of our Colledge (my reuerend Lambskins) our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
say, our Colledge Ruffes are quite out of stocke; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> haue
no more Ruffes but one, and that is a Ruffe of strong hempe,
you may haue them who will, at the Royall Exchange of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:26172:22"/>
As for plaine Bands, if you finde any in a Scriueners shop,
there is good hope honesty will come in fashion againe.</p>
               <p>But you will not bestow your money on such trifles:
why? I haue greater wares.</p>
               <p>Will you buy any Parsonages, Vicarages, Deanaries, or
Prebendaries?</p>
               <p>The price of one is his Lordships crackt Chamber-Maid,
the other is the reseruing of his Worships tythes; or you
may buy the Knights horse three hundred pound too deare,
who to make you amends in the bargaine, will draw you on
fairely to a Vicaridge.</p>
               <p>There be many tricks, but the downe-right way is three
yeeres purchase. Come bring in your Coyne; Liuings are
<hi>Maioriinpretio</hi> now, then in the daies of Doomesday booke,
you must giue presents for your presentations: there may be
seuerall meanes for your institution, but this is the only way
to induction that euer I knew: but I see you are not minded
to meddle with any my honest Leuiticall Farmers.</p>
               <stage>Then the Pedler tooke out a Wench made of
Alablaster.</stage>
               <p>But now expect the treasures of the World, the treasures
of the earth digg'd from the mynes of my more then Indian
paunch. Wipe your eyes, that no enuious clouds of musty
humours may barre your sight of the happinesse of so rare an

               <p>Me thinks this peerelesse Paragon of complection should
