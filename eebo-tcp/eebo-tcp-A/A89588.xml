            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nation, a wofull darke night of affliction of ſeverall hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of yeers was now beginning, and ſuch calamities were threatned, as the Lord profeſſed that many men amongſt them, when they look'd up to heaven, and ſaw nothing but darkneſſe there, nothing but confuſion upon earth, they ſhould rave and be mad, they ſhould curſe their God that would not helpe them, curſe their King that could not helpe them, ſhould bee driven into utter darkneſſe; but yet notwithſtanding in the beginning of this Chapter the Lord ſaith, that unto thoſe that feared him, to his own people, the darkneſſe and uncomfortable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, ſhould not bee ſo great, as they had formerly met with in ſome leſſer afflictions; for God did (as i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were) create a new Star, that ſhould ſhine unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all that long and darke night, that is, a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſalvation by him, which is laid downe in the ſeven firſt verſes of this Chapter, and there are ſeverall degrees, or breakings out of the light of this comfort, I'le but name them ſo farre as may leade me to the Text. Firſt,</p>
            <p>The Lord tells them <hi>whence</hi> this comfort ſhould come, <hi>there ſhould a glorious light</hi> ſhine to them, in the ſecond <note place="margin">1.</note> verſe; the people that walked in darkneſſe ſhould ſee a great light, they that dwelt in the land of the ſhadow of death, upon them hath the light ſhined, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Jeſus Chriſt ſetting up his Goſpel amongſt them, as it is expreſly interpreted in the fourth of <hi>Matthem.</hi> This Text ſeemes to bee a propheticall deſcription of <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 15, 16.</note> where Chriſt firſt ſet up his Miniſtery ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of yeers before it was built, which ſtood in the land of <hi>Galile</hi> by the Sea ſide in the way leading to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Secondly,</p>
            <p>The next degree is, what the comfort is, that they <note place="margin">2.</note>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116684:4"/>
ſhould have from this light, in the third verſe, they ſhould have great joy by it, the Lord had formerly more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied their nation, but never gave them more joy then now they ſhould have, though they ſhould bee in a very afflicted condition, yet they ſhould have as much joy in the Goſpel of Chriſt, as ever that nation injoyed in the dayes of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon;</hi> though now they ſhould live after a precarious manner, and ſhould be tributaries to all the foure great Monarchies of the world in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, firſt to the Aſſyrian, then to the Perſian, then to the Grecian, and then to the Roman, and all this time, a ſpace of ſome 700. yeers, they ſhould bee a deſpiſed, contemned people, yet from the Lord Chriſt and the promiſe of the Goſpel, ſhould they have as much joy as ever they had when their Nation was moſt enlarged, yea ſuch joy that it ſhould bee like the joy of harveſt, or the joy that Souldiers have when they divide the ſpoile, that is the ſecond degree; now my text is the third degree or breaking out of this glorious comfort, and that tels you,</p>
            <p>What the mercy ſhall bee that ſhall bee the cauſe of ſo <note place="margin">3.</note> much joy; what it is that ſhould fill them with ſo much joy, why hee would breake every yoke of their burden, every ſtaffe that lay upon their ſhoulders, every rod of their oppreſſors, that whipped them, hee would break all as hee did once doe it in the day of <hi>Midian,</hi> he will burn up their enemies with fewell of fire, hee would free them from them all, and tread them under their feet; then the laſt branch of all, and the height of their comfort is,</p>
            <p>That Chriſt will not only break other yokes, but would <note place="margin">4.</note> put the yoke of his own ſweet and eaſie government upon them, <hi>himſelfe</hi> will bee their King; <hi>To us a Son is given,</hi> to us a child is borne, upon whoſe ſhoulder the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116684:5"/>
ſhall bee, his name is Wonderfull, Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace; and in theſe things ſhould the hearts of Gods people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in their moſt afflicted times. Thus ſtands the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my Text, ſo that theſe two verſes that I have read, containe the cauſe of all the joy that the people of God ſhould finde in Chriſt in their afflicted times; and <note place="margin">Scope and parts of the Text.</note> there are two branches of the Text to bee handled. Firſt,</p>
            <p>Here is the bleſſing that ſhould bee conferred upon them, in theſe words, <hi>thou haſt broken the yoke of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Which are A great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Church.</note> 
               <hi>the ſtaffe of his ſhoulder, the rod of his oppreſſors:</hi> that is the mercy they ſhould receive. Secondly, <note place="margin">2 The manner how i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> muſt be wrought.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the manner how this ſhould bee done; and that is laid downe, Firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ſhould bee as in the day of Midian;</hi> that is, as in the day when in <hi>Gideons</hi> time with 300. men with lamps and <note place="margin">1. Judges 7.</note> pitchers the Lord deſtroyed an innumerable multitude of <hi>Midianites;</hi> ſo would the Lord Chriſt now worke this great deliverance, that he promiſes to his people. Then, Secondly,</p>
            <p>The manner of it is yet more clearely and fully laid downe in the 5. verſe, by ſhewing that the way of Gods <note place="margin">2.</note> working of this, ſhall bee diverſe from the manner of other deliverances: <hi>Every battell of the Warriour is with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood, but this ſhall bee with burning and fewell of fire;</hi> the meaning whereof in a few words is this, This victory that God would give his people, ſhould not bee in the way of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane helpe to doe it, as Nations get victories one over another by bringing one a greater Army then the other, or better diſciplined or trained men then the other, or with pollicy and valour, with ſhouting and making the others lie wallowing in their blood, and ſo mans Arme to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116684:5"/>
bee the inſtrument of it; no, this ſhould bee with fewell or burning of fire, that is, it ſhould be done by Gods own hand; for what the Lord doth immediatly himſelfe, that is ordinarily ſaid to bee done by fire, or fewell of fire, it hath been the ordinary way of Gods manifeſting himſelf by devouring fire, when he threatens to ſhew himſelfe hee will come in devouring fire, ſeldome hath hee appeared, but it hath been either in ſmoak or fire; ſo then this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſignifies it ſhould not bee done by mans helpe, <note place="margin">Interpretation of the Text.</note> but the Lord alone would come and doe it by his owne immediate hand.</p>
            <p>Let us now firſt inquire into the matter, what it is that <note place="margin">1.</note> they ſhould injoy; the Lord would break <hi>the yoke of their burden, the ſtaffe of their ſhoulder, the rod of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor:</hi> And here we muſt conſider, Firſt,</p>
            <p>What this ſignifies, what doth God intend in this? <note place="margin">1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For the Grammaticall meaning <hi>the yoke of his burden,</hi> this is an Hebrewiſme, and ſignifies <hi>his burdenſome yoke,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> hee will breake his burdenſome yoke, that is, the heavy yoke that was put upon his ſhoulders, by thoſe that had enſlaved him; <hi>the ſtaffe of his ſhoulder,</hi> that is, the ſtaffe wherewith his ſhoulders uſed to be beaten; <hi>the rod of his oppreſſor,</hi> that is, either the Scepter of thoſe Tyrants that kept them under often expreſſed by a rod; or otherwiſe the rod of correction, wherewith the enemies that kept them under did uſe to diſcipline them: and by all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of words, theſe ſeverall expreſſions of yokes, and burdenſome yokes, and rods and ſtaves, the Lord doth ſignifie the greatneſſe of that miſery and bondage, that his people ſhould lie under at that time, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come to deliver them. What are thoſe yokes, and ſtaves, and rods that are here meant? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it will appeare cleer unto every one that markes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116684:6"/>
the Text, that here are two things intended.</p>
            <p>Breaking of the temporall yokes, the yokes that they <note place="margin">1.</note> ſhould lie under from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and ſo the ſucceſſive Kingdomes and Empires, that ſhould keepe them under ſubjection and bondage; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally here is meant,</p>
            <p>The ſpirituall yokes of ſinne, and death, and wrath, and curſe; and that both theſe are meant is cleare in the Text; <note place="margin">2.</note> that the outward yokes are literally meant is obvious to every ones eye that doth but compare this with the two former chapters, and all the chapters that follow, for five or ſix of them together: in the eighth chapter the Lord threatned hee would bring the Empire of <hi>Aſsyria</hi> upon them, and the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> ſhould carry them into captivitie, and fill their land with waters up to the necke; and for a great many chapters together from the ſeventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I thinke there is not one but there is ſomewhat of the <hi>Aſsyrian</hi> Empire that ſhould lie heavie upon the backe of Gods people; that is the literall, but another thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is, the myſticall, the ſpirituall <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> yoke, the devill and ſinne, and death and hell; Jeſus Chriſt will breake all theſe yokes from off the neck of his people. And that the ſpirituall is intended as well and more then the temporall, is cleer both by what goes before, the preaching of the Goſpel ſhould doe it, and by all that followes, <hi>for unto a us Child is borne, to us a Sonne is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> both theſe ſorts of yokes would Chriſt beake by his owne hand; if you would have it yet a little more cleer, I conceive the deliverance moſt immediatly intended in the letter was the deſtruction of that great Army of <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 32. 2 Kings 18. 19.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116684:6"/>
was intended as a Type, to ſhew how God will breake all other the yokes of thoſe that lie heavie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his inheritance. This then for the meaning of it, That whatſoever enemies ſhould riſe up againſt the Church or people of God, however they may keepe them under for a while, Chriſt hath a purpoſe, and will in his owne due time break them, and their yokes in peeces, and he will doe it in a ſtrange way, by his own hand, in a way that ſhall bee very eaſie to him to worke, but very hard for them; either to reſiſt or to beare. This is the plaine ſcope of the Text; Now I proceed to ſome matter of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and firſt, if you looke upon theſe words, as they ſtand in their connexion or dependence with the former verſe, <hi>they joy before thee as the joy in harveſt, and as men rejoyce when they divide the ſpoile, for thou haſt broken every yoke, the yoke of his burden, the rod of his oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;</hi> becauſe God deſtroyed his enemies that would have deſtroyed him, therefore they ſhall joy like the joy in harveſt; learn one leſſon from it, very ſutable to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of our meeting; namely,</p>
            <p>That the Lord doth expect that his people ſhould <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of theſe words with the former, Gods people ſhould rejoyce when God breakes their enemies &amp; their yokes in ſunder, Pſal. 126.</note> greatly rejoyce when he doth break the yoke of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the ſtaffe and rod wherewith they whip Gods people when God uſes to defeat the plots, and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of wicked men againſt his ſervants, hee expects that the hearts of his people ſhould bee fill'd with joy, and their tongues overrun with his praiſes. There is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of evidence for this in the Scripture, in the 126. <hi>Pſalme</hi> you ſhall finde the Church exulting, her mouth was fill'd with laughter, and her tongue with joy; every one that look'd in the face of Gods people ſaw them have a merry countenance; why? becauſe God had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the captivitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hee had brought back the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116684:7"/>
captivity of his people, and broken in peeces the enemies that kept them under, ſo likewiſe did <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> when they ſaw the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſinke like a ſtone into the depth of the Sea, in the 15. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and all his Chariots drown'd in the red Sea, they all lift up their voyce, and ſung to God praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving in the higheſt, <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, for hee hath triumphed gloriouſly, the horſe and his rider hath hee throwne into the Sea:</hi> So did <hi>Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> in the fifth of <hi>Iudges,</hi> when <hi>Siſera</hi> and his hoſt was broken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Judges 5.</note> the ſervants of God, they rejoyced, and prayed God it might ever bee ſo, that all Gods enemies might ſo periſh, and all his people might ſo rejoyce; thus you ſhall finde it propheſied in the New Teſtament, in the <note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> 19. of <hi>Revelations,</hi> you ſhall reade in the latter end of the 18. chapter of the deſtruction of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> party, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Popiſh party, the Antichriſtian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Malignant Church that is riſen up againſt the Church of Chriſt, there I ſay you ſhall reade the ruine of it, and the meanes of it, the Saints helpe to doe it, and you ſhall there ſee all the Kings of the earth weeping and howling, and all that were friends to the harlot were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling one with another for that great loſſe; but in the 19. chap. in heaven, that is, in the Church of Chriſt, there was nothing but <hi>Hallelujah, praiſe yee the Lord,</hi> for the Lord hath avenged himſelfe, <hi>and when her ſmoke aroſe up for evermore, againe they ſay Hallelujah</hi> to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> burning, and the inſtruments that would have oppreſſed Gods people deſtroyed, and troden under foot; it was <note place="margin">

            <p>That the Lord doth ſometimes leave his owne people <note place="margin">Two doctrines from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Text.</note> to lie under heavy yokes, to have the ſtaves and rods of oppreſſors lie upon their backs and ſhoulders: Secondly, and principally,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:116684:8"/>
That Jeſus Chriſt will in his due time breake in ſunder all the yokes that lie upon his peoples neck, all the ſtaves that beate their ſhoulders, all the rods that whip their backes, Chriſt hath a time wherein he will break them all, both yokes and oppreſſors together, and ſet his people free from them; this ſecond I moſt intend; a word or two of the firſt.</p>
            <p>That the Lord doth ſometimes leave his owne people to bee under the tyranny of them that hate them: I ſay <note place="margin">1 <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leaves his own people under grievous yokes. Eſay 8. 8.</note> his own people (for this was <hi>Emanuels</hi> land, you'l read it called by the very name of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> in the eighth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the <hi>Aſſyrian ſhall come and fill the breadth of thy land O Emmanuel;</hi> they were <hi>Emmanuels</hi> people that ſhould have theſe terrible yokes put upon them: to underſtand this leſſon, bee pleaſed to premiſe thus much; That it is of all judgements one of the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and uncomfortable that ever a people can be expoſed to, to have thoſe that hate them to tyrannize over them, that was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, I <hi>have done juſtice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

good Magiſtrates &amp; rulers, to give ſuch to a people as may defend every one in his own right, protect the fatherleſſe and widow, and ſee that every one have juſtice and judgement, that there may be no complaining in the ſtreets of a people; but that they may live and ſerve God in godlineſſe and honeſty, in peace, to bee preſerved in ſecurity and tranquillity, <hi>O happy are the people tbat are in ſuch a caſe,</hi> faith the Spirit of God in the 144. <hi>Pſalme;</hi>

               <hi>Shiſhak</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> came againſt them, though <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> had been in a league, articles of peace betwixt them, <hi>Shiſhak</hi> comes againſt them, and brings a mighty Army, and <hi>Rehoboams</hi> ſubjects knew not what to doe, they cryed to God, they prayed the Lord to deliver them, no (ſaith God) I will not give you whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to a ſpoile, but you ſhall bee the ſervants of the Kings of <hi>Egypt;</hi> why? <hi>becauſe they ſhall know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:116684:9"/>
               <hi>of my ſervice, and the ſervice of the other Nations;</hi> they ſhall ſee whether they had not been better to have let mee bee their King, then to bring thoſe to rule over them, who I am now reſolved ſhall bee over them for a while; There is another terrible inſtance in the 11. of <hi>Zachariah;</hi> you ſhall ſee the purpoſe of that <note place="margin">Zach. 11. ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Chapter is to ſignifie theſe two things: Firſt, that Jeſus Chriſt would come to bee a Prince and a Ruler over his people, as a faithfull and good ſhepheard, they would none of him, they ſold him for 30. peeces of Silver, which as it is noted, was but the price that a ſlave uſed to bee ſold at; Chriſt the Lord himſelfe came from heaven, offer'd himſelfe to them to bee their ſhepheard, and they ſold him for 30. peeces of Silver; A gooly price that I was ſold at, ſaith the Lord! Well, but what becomes of this? the reſt of that chapter tells you, that hee will give them other ſhepheards that ſhall teare them to purpoſe; in the 6. verſe, <hi>I will give them up every man into the hand of his neighbour, I will give them up into the hand of their King;</hi> who was that? it is plaine that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was their King at that time, becauſe Chriſt came at that time when the Roman was over them, now when Jeſus Chriſt would have been their King, and they ſay nay, <hi>we have no King but Caeſar,</hi> God therefore gives them up into the Romans hands, and then they ſhall have Shepheards that ſhall teare them to purpoſe; becauſe they would have none of the Lord Chriſt, the Lord would give them up into ſuch hands as ſhould diſcipline them after another manner; that is one cauſe, when God <note place="margin">2.</note> offers himſelfe to bee their ruler, and they will not have <note place="margin">When his people are unthankfull for good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, hee gives them up into the hands of oppreſſors.</note> him to bee their ruler, then God puts other yokes upon them. Againe ſecondly, another cauſe I finde is this,</p>
            <p>When the Lord hath raiſed up to a people good Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Magiſtrates, that under them (though poſſibly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116684:10"/>
with many humane frailties) they might bee ruled in godlineſſe and honeſty according to Gods wayes, and the people have been ungratefull for them; the Lord then gives them up to the hands of others, that they ſhall not bee able to ſhake off, when they will; ſo you find it in the example of <hi>Gideon;</hi> when <hi>Gideon</hi> had delivered the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> they came to him, and ſay be our King; not I (ſaith hee) God muſt bee your King, (which by the way, let me interpret it to you, he meant, he would not change that forme of government, that God had ſet up in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which was this, that every Tribe had their owne Ariſtocraticall government, that is, the chief men of their Tribe did rule all, as it might be the Maior, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, Common-Councell men in every Tribe, and when a time of ſpeciall danger came, that an enemy inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, God from heaven uſed extraordinarily to raiſe up ſome Judge, &amp; that danger being over the government of the Commonwealth went in the old channell) they would have had <hi>Gideon</hi> to be their King, No (ſaith hee) not I, nor my ſonnes, but you ſhall have God to bee over you; well, but when <hi>Gideon</hi> died they forgot <hi>Gideon</hi> and they would have a King, and tooke <hi>Abimelech,</hi> who proved a cruell tyrant to them, whereupon <hi>Iotham</hi> in the 9. of <hi>Iudges,</hi> (when all the people were together) tells <note place="margin">Judges 9, 7, &amp;c.</note> them a tale; The trees (ſaith he) would have a King, and they went to the Olive, and the Vine, and the fruitful trees to rule over them; No (ſay they) we muſt keep every one our own ranke, I cannot leave my fatneſſe nor my ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. But a King the trees will have, and their King proves a Bramble, ſo (as his ſpeech intimates) will it prove unto you for your ingratitude to God for <hi>Gideon</hi> and unto <hi>Gideons</hi> family, it will come to paſſe that this bramble your King ſhall firſt rend and teare you, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

you and your King conſume one another, and this curſe or propheſie came upon them, and for that very cauſe. Another like inſtance wee have 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. God had raiſed up <hi>Samuel</hi> in a time of much trouble, to be a Judge and Saviour to the Jewes, they took occaſion upon ſome <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.</note> miſcariages of <hi>Samuels</hi> ſonnes to caſt him off, and they would have a King after the manner of the Nations round about them, and therefore God in his wrath gave them <note place="margin">Ho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Saul,</hi> who proved a Tyrant: Ingratitude for good gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours is one cauſe why God gives people up to ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors. And then thirdly, I finde,</p>

I ſhall not ſtay upon the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this, I onely ſay of it, as Chriſt of the Cup he <note place="margin">Application.</note>

was to drink, <hi>Father, if it bee poſsible let this cup paſſe from me;</hi> Lord let this Cup paſſe from us, let not our God give us up to ſpoyle, to confuſion, to oppreſſion; for I am too well aſſured that in all theſe things I have ſpoken, wee have deſerved to drinke this cup, and our ſinnes cry loud in the eares of God for it; and whatſoever you may ſay of the two latter, I am confident you'l all beare mee witneſſe wee have highly deſerved it in the firſt of theſe; the Lord hath offer'd to <hi>England</hi> the government of his own Scepter, the government of his Goſpel, &amp; he is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the way how he will rule us in Eccleſiaſticall things, but alas, there is not a thing under heaven more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to the people of this Land, then to think that they ſhould have ſuch a yoke put upon them, though the aime and end of it bee onely to make them holy; but we will have none of it, the thing we will have, is, to live as we liſt, wee will not have this man rule over us; the Lord grant wee bee not broken with other yokes; And as for ingratitude for our other Magiſtrates and Rulers, and for our biting and devouring one another, the Lord knowes it is to bee found in every corner of the Land; I onely mention theſe things that in this day of rejoycing for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies received, you may all joyne in prayer that the Lord bring not this evill upon us. Thus briefly for the firſt; the ſecond leſſon which I mainely aime at is,</p>
            <p>That howſoever the Lord ſometimes lets his people lie under heavy and terrible yokes, yokes upon their lives, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt will in due time break all the yokes which lie upon his peoples necks.</note> names, eſtates, liberties, conſciences, (call them by what names you will) yet Jeſus Chriſt hath a time, when hee will break them all; <hi>Thou haſt broken,</hi> it was not broken yet, but God uſes to ſpeak of his mercies intended for the Church, in the preterperfect tenſe, as things already done, becauſe they were ſo ſure; the Lord Chriſt will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116684:11"/>
breake the yoke of their burden, the ſtaffe of their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the rod of their oppreſſor; when the Lord doth at any time leave his people in this ſad condition which I have ſpoken of, hee never puts them out of his own hand, though hee may deliver them into the hands of others, hee alwayes keeps the line in his owne hand, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary cannot doe what they liſt, they are bounded by him, and it is not for want of love or of power, that the Lord lets any ſuch yoke ever come upon the neck of his people, but onely from his owne will, and from his own wiſedome, the Lord orders it ſo, that the heavieſt thing that betides them, ſhall never hurt a haire of their heads, as Chriſt hath it in <hi>Luke;</hi> though ſome of them be put <note place="margin">Luke 21. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſhould ſtarve or die in his bondage, and therefore makes haſt out of it; but Gods people ſhall not need to make ſuch haſt, their ſeaſonable deliverance is ſure enough; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Scriptures ſpeak this truth as plainely; But that which I chiefly aime at for cleering this doctrine, is, the diſcuſſing of two queſtions, the one is,</p>
            <p>1. When the Lord uſes to doe this; 2. How hee doth it. For the firſt, that hee will deliver his people from all their oppreſſors, is not to be doubted, but when the Lord will doe it, that is the time that every ſad ſoule <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. When Chriſt uſeth to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his people.</note> cries after, How long Lord, holy and true, doeſt thou not avenge us? or when Lord ſhall it bee? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p>Though it bee not for us to ſearch curiouſly into the times and ſeaſons that the Father keeps in his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, <note place="margin">Anſwer to the firſt.</note> as you have it in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7. yet the Lord hath left very comfortable prognoſticks in his Word, whereby wee may gueſſe when the time of the deliverance of Gods <note place="margin">He alwayes doth it in the beſt time.</note> people from their bondage is even at hand; certainly it will come in the beſt time, in the fitteſt time, but when that time doth appropinquate, drawes nigh, you ſhall find it cleer in the Word by theſe three things; the <note place="margin">And that time may be known to approach.</note> one is,</p>
            <p>The Lord ordinarily makes that the time of his brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">When the rage of his and their enemies is higheſt.</note> the power of the enemies of his Church, when they are fill'd moſt with rage and fury againſt the Church, when they breath out nothing but ſlaughter, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt them, blaſpheme not onely them, but their God, and their profeſſion, and their way, when they are riſen up to that height that their ſinnes are full againſt God, and their rage againſt Gods people, that is the time when the Lord ſuddenly uſes to break out and cruſh his enemies; I might give you many examples of this in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116684:13"/>
book of God, take that expreſſion in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 30. 17. <note place="margin">Jer. 30. 17.</note> for one, the Lord would ſpeedily come to deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but why? even <hi>becauſe they ſaid, This is Zion, whom no man cries for; Zion</hi> was then a ſcorned company, I will therefore (ſaith hee) reſtore healing to them; therefore would hee come, becauſe the enemy ſaid, this is <hi>Zion</hi> that no body cares for, every one can tread it under foot; So likewiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. 3. becauſe the <hi>Ammonites</hi> ſaid Aha againſt his Sanctuary, againſt the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and againſt the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> when they went into captivitie, Behold I will therefore deliver them, &amp;c. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 67. becauſe the King of <hi>Tyrus</hi> had ſet his heart as the heart of God, therefore God would bring enemies upon him. What need I multiply examples? you ſhall find it was thus to all the people that ever had Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under them, goe from <hi>Egypt,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Syria, Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> you ſhall find in them all, that when their rage was moſt furious againſt Gods people, then was the time neer that God uſed to breake them, and deliver his people from them. Secondly, another time is,</p>
            <p>When the Lord by the threſhings of their enemies <note place="margin">2.</note> hath purged the chaffe out of his people; when the Lord <note place="margin">When Gods people are humbled and ſeek his face and favour.</note> hath by delivering his people up into the hands of wicked men wrought in their hearts a ſpirit of repentance, a ſpirit of humiliation, a ſpirit of Prayer, a ſpirit of looking unto God, the Lord never ſtayes long before he doth deliver them; I beſeech you ſearch the Scriptures, and you will find that the morning ſtarre is not a more infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the day, of the Sunnes approach or riſing, then a ſpirit of humiliation and prayer powered upon Gods people, is an argument of their deliverance at hand: The <hi>burden of Hadrach,</hi> and <hi>Damaſous, Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> ruine <note place="margin">Zath. 9. 1. &amp;c.</note>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:116684:13"/>
to them is propheſied of in the 9. of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> but when ſhould it bee? <hi>When the eyes of the Tribes are towards the Lord,</hi> when God puts it into the hearts of his people to looke to God, to humble themſelves and ſeek his favour, the Lord is then at hand, to ruine their enemies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them: So alſo in the 102. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> Verſ. 13. <hi>Thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 102. 13.</note> 
               <hi>ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Zion,</hi> marke the phraſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe,</hi> it is ſomewhat akin to that place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where the Lord ſaith, Aske me of things to come, and concerning my <hi>ſonnes and daughters command yee mee;</hi> ſo the people of God come in, Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy, why? what makes them ſo confident? the <hi>ſet time is come,</hi> the time of deliverance of <hi>Zion</hi> is come, even the ſet time is come; how can they tell that? <hi>thy ſervants mourne over the duſt of it,</hi> thy ſervants are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, they pitie, they poure out their ſoules, and mourne to God, and out of this; the Church could ſet downe the concluſion, the ſet time is come for it, when the Lord hath prepared his people, and humbled them: And then thirdly,</p>
            <p>When hee hath broke all other meanes of deliverance, ſo that they ſee no hope or meanes of helpe in any other, <note place="margin">3.</note> the heart of man cannot thinke how prone even Gods <note place="margin">And when all hope of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance by any other meanes is cut off.</note> ſervants are to relie upon other Crutches beſides God, and to catch as ſinking men at every twig, and every Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh, but when the Lord hath broke all their probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and expectations elſewhere, that there is none ſhut up, nor none left, then doth the Lord uſe to come himſelf &amp; reſcue his people, and break thoſe that thought to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up; of this you may pleaſe to take two notable inſtances; the one is a Propheſie in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 32. 36. <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 35.</note> the Lord had ſaid how hee would ſcatter his people, but (ſaith hee) <hi>when hee ſaw, that their ſtrength was all gone,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:116684:14"/>
               <hi>that there was none ſhut up, nor none left,</hi> that is, none to bee a helpe, there were enow of Gods people left, but not any one that could worke any deliverance for them, what then? <hi>then did the Lord repent concerning his ſervants,</hi> and his owne Arme delivered them; you have it yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more cleerly in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59. 16. the words are theſe, <hi>The Lord looked, and there was no man, and wondred that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſay 59. 16.</note> 
               <hi>there was no interceſſor,</hi> the Lord could finde none that could ſpeake for them, none that could act for them, when God ſaw that, <hi>then his owne arme will doe it,</hi> hee then put on his mercy and goodneſſe, <hi>and arrayed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his zeale like a robe, and his owne Arme did it; that they might feare the name of God from the riſing of the Sunne to the ſetting of it:</hi> and that is the reaſon why the Lord uſes to come in at ſuch a time, becauſe hee hath the more glory. This for the time, when God uſes to break the yokes of his people that lie upon them, <hi>when the enemies are at higheſt, when he hath humbled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his people, and when all other helpes doe faile them,</hi> then the Lord doth it: But then in the next place,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How doth he doe it? after what manner doth he uſe to deliver them?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. How, and after what manner doth God uſe to deliver his people.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt in generall:</p>
            <p>Which way ſoever the Lord doth it, all wayes are alike eaſie to him; alike eaſie for him to contrive; alike eaſie for him to uſe his infinite wiſdome, and his infinite <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. All wayes are alike eaſie to him.</note> power knows no degrees of eaſe or ſtrength in any way, all are alike to him; It is all one to him to ſave by many or to ſave by few. Secondly, I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That when the Lord comes to deliver his people, he ſeldome doth it that way that his people expect, ſeldome <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 2. He ſeldome delivers in that way his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expect it.</note> walks in the paths that we have cauſeyed for him, or by the line that we have chalked out for his direction;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116684:14"/>
ſeldome or never doth God take that way: We are prone to deal with God as <hi>Naaman</hi> did, when the Prophet had ſent for him to cure, that he and his maſter might know there was a God in Iſrael who knew how to cure him of his Leproſie; <hi>Naaman</hi> believed it, but he had fancied by the way how it ſhould be done: Now (ſaith he) I ſhall finde a Cure; and he will ſurely come out to me, and ſtrike his hand over the place, and ſtand and call on the name of God, and ſo I ſhall ſee a miraculous work wrought upon me; the Prophet went clean another way; and becauſe the Prophet did not come out, and take that way he thought of, he went away in a rage, and thought there was no cure for him: So verily moſt people deal with God; we think this is the way how our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance muſt come, by ſuch a Parliament, by ſuch an Army, by ſuch a deſigne, by ſuch an aſſociation, by ſuch and the other way, here it muſt come, if this way fail, we think all is loſt, and God ſeldome goes the way we have chalked out; ſtudy you the Scriptures and you will finde it: But yet if poſitively you'll know what way he doth it; I anſwer more particularly:</p>
            <p>Very frequently by his own immediate hand, without <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 3. Eſay 63. 4 He uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane help.</note> the help of any other; he alone trode out the winepreſs of the wrath of God, and there was none of the people with him to help him, but doth all himſelf, ſo my Text ſaith in the next verſe, <hi>The battail of the Warriours, &amp;c.</hi> if other Nations conquer, they doe it by garments rolled in blood, and by confuſed noiſe, but this ſhall be by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and by fuell of fire by Gods own hand; Or which is all one,</p>
            <p>He ordinarily doth it by moſt unlikely and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 4. Or which is all one, by unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes and inſtruments,</note> meanes, he will not alwayes work Miracles, that is to doe a thing without any meanes at all; but in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116684:15"/>
of his Church, he alwayes works <hi>miranda,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous things, by doing it by ſuch meanes as are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improbable and unſuitable to the great things that are to be done by him. This inſtance of my Text is a moſt notable proof, He will break every yoke of the oppreſſor, <hi>as in the day of Midian;</hi> how was that? you may read the Story in the 17 of <hi>Iudges:</hi> the way was this, there was ſuch a numerous and mighty Army of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> that the text ſaith, they lay like graſhoppers, and cover'd over all the Countrey; the Lord meant to deſtroy them and <hi>Gideon</hi> muſt goe with 300 men, and theſe 300 men muſt every one carry a pitcher, and a lamp therein in one hand, and a trumpet in another hand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs in this mighty Company, every one at his poſt, and blow with the trumpet, and not ſtrike a ſtroke, but cry, The ſword of the Lord and <hi>Gideon;</hi> and this routs and deſtroys an invincible Army. As in the day of <hi>Midian,</hi> ſaith the Lord, ſo will Jeſus Chriſt, that is, by ſome unlikely meanes: And give me leave to ſay confidently, That whoſoever reads the book of God from one end to the other, will finde that moſt of all the deliverances which the Lord hath given his Church, have been by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have been moſt unlike to doe their buſineſſe; A ſhepheard ſhall bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> Rams hornes ſhall blow down the Walls of <hi>Iericho:</hi> A Shepheards boy with a ſling and a ſtone in it, ſhall overthrow <hi>Goliah;</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> like two little flocks of Kids ſhall overthrow the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that fill all the Countrey, thus hath the Lord uſed to doe it: If you'l know the reaſon of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding as well as of the time when he doth it, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe in this way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares moſt like himſelfe.</note> it is,</p>
            <p>Becauſe then hee appeares like himſelfe; the truth is, let God doe it by never ſuch probable meanes, it is God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116684:15"/>
that workes all; God did no more when hee deſtroyed the <hi>Midianites</hi> by <hi>Gideons</hi> 300. then hee did when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <note place="margin">2 Chron. 13. 13.</note> the Army of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> with 400000. of the Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> God did no more in the one then in the other, for it is God who workes all in all, but God doth not ſo much <hi>appeare,</hi> for wee that are thick ſighted can ſee what the creature doth, but wee cannot ſee that this creature is in Gods hand, and that it is God that doth all; but now when the Lord uſes meanes which are altogether unlike to attaine it, and are wholly unfit for the worke then to doe it, all ſay this was <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> this was the Lords doing; now the Lord ſaith, when there was none to ſpeak, then his owne arme did it, that Gods name might have the praiſe from the riſing of the Sunne to the ſetting of it: theſe things I might have proſecuted further; give me leave to wind it all up with an Application, and I ſhall diſmiſſe you; and there are but two Vſes, which I intend of this Leſſon, the one is, Firſt,</p>

them, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt being the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day, and for ever, knowes his own beſt time, and his own beſt way, and we ſhould fix our eyes upon him, when all other things goe croſſe, and ſtudie onely to walke ſo as wee may bee under the power of this doctrine, that wee may bee under the reach, and cover and wings of it, and when wee have done that, wee have done all wee ſhould doe; and therefore to this end, give me leave in this cloſe of the Sermon, to give a threefold advice to Gods people, what they ſhould now do in regard of the preſent ſtraights <note place="margin">Directions how this may bee done.</note> and dangers that wee are caſt in, that ſo wee may the more comfortably expect deliverance from Chriſt: the one is,</p>
            <p>Let us all (in the firſt place) take the counſell of the <note place="margin">1.</note> Prophet in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 8. 14. when the Lord was giving up <note place="margin">Firſt, bee humbled and aſhamed for our unworthy walking in the middeſt of ſo many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. Jen. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note> his people to moſt wofull ſpoiles, the Prophet ſpeakes to them after this manner, <hi>Why doe you ſit ſtill? aſſemble your ſelves, and let us enter into the defenced Cities, and let us be ſilent there, for the Lord our God hath put us to ſilence and given you the water of gall and wormeword to drinke; for wee have ſinned againſt God;</hi> ſo I would ſay to all, O that the voyce of God in this could reach his ſervants in the Parliament, in the Court of Aldermen, in the Common-Councell, in the Citie, and throughout <hi>England,</hi> that it might prevaile with all that have been unfainedly devoted to this work, to get into their cloſets, to lay their hand upon their mouth, and weep before God, and ſay, This cup of gall and bitterneſſe is given us to drinke becauſe wee have ſinn'd againſt God, my meaning plainly is this, I thinke the ſervants of God in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Goſpel came into <hi>England,</hi> have never miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, nor diſhonoured the Goſpel ſo, as we have done ſince God hath wrought theſe enlargements for us; ſurely wee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116684:17"/>
walked 100. times better in the dayes of perſecution, then wee have in the middeſt of our inlargement; O to what abundance of looſeneſſe even good people are come, what pride in many of their hearts, what ſcandalous walking in the eyes of thoſe that are enemies to Religion, what bitter diviſions one againſt another, undermining one another, oppoſing one another, when one ſide gets power ſtriving to beate downe the other, if the other get the ball, they kick as unmercifully againſt the other, even to the ſcorne of Religion: truely wee have even loſt our ſelves; our fooliſh walking hath took off the awe that the profeſſion of Religion laid upon the hearts of wicked men, who heretofore though they did not love goodneſſe, yet they ſaw ſuch a converſation in thoſe that were good, that it laid a bridle upon them, but now they ſee that many godly, or who at leaſt pretend to bee godly, appeare ſo ſelfiſh, ſo bitter, ſo worldly, not onely to bee of differing minds, but of differing affections, falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to horrible rents, and abominable opinions, this I ſay, hath tooke off the awe that lay upon mens conſciences, and therefore is there ſo much rage let out againſt us; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire therefore that we all that profeſſe our ſelves to bee Chriſts ſervants may get our ſelves into our Cloſets, and bee ſilent, lay our hands upon our mouths, and ſay, It is moſt juſt with God wee ſhould bee given up, wee had a little power and wee have abuſed it, wee have diſhonor'd the Goſpel, and now the Lord hath given us the water of Gall and Wormewood to drinke, becauſe our finnes have called for it. Beloved, our adverſaries can ſpeak of theſe things, and it is good for you to heare of it from the Miniſters mouth, for when wee lye low and ſubmit, and ſay, God hath walked contrary to us, becauſe wee have walked contrary to him, then the Lord will quickly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116684:18"/>
turne things about, and bee gratious to us: that is one; let the ſervants of God wherein they have miſcarried bee ſenſible of it, humbled and abaſed for it in Gods ſight; And ſecondly,</p>
            <p>Let our converſation for the time to come, bee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">2.</note> to the principles and wayes that wee walked in the <note place="margin">To walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our firſt good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and wayes.</note> beginning of this worke, when wee were firſt ingaged in it; In the beginning of our work, what were our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? what were the things wee aimed at then? Did we not then aime at the reformation of Religion, execution of juſtice, enjoyment of libertie, &amp;c. were not theſe the hinges that carried us? and the wayes wherein we walked then, what were they? Were they not the wayes of Prayer, and the wayes of Chriſtian love, and a ſpirit of zeale? Was there not a ſpirit of prayer mightily poured out in every corner of the Land, ſo that you could come no where, where there were any that feared God, but frequently in publique and private there was knocking at heaven gate, and wreſtling with God? and was there not a ſpirit of Love amongſt Gods people then? Wee know not the diviſions and animoſities that are come in ſince, every one helped together; and was there not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ſpirit of Activity? Were they not all vigorous and active laying out all their ſtrength and all their talents, when the enemy was not ſo active as now? which dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence many have given over, and the enemy hath taken up; now let us indeavour that the ſame ſpirit may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived amongſt Gods people for the time to come, let us remember our engagements, and what the things were wee vowed, when wee lifted up our hands to the moſt high God, and doe our firſt workes; O that wee could ſee a reſtoring of theſe things, O that wee could ſee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the Spirit of prayer againe among the godly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116684:18"/>
people of <hi>England,</hi> and a Spirit of love to unite one with another, (I am ſure wee ſee all our enemies unite againſt us) O that they would now unite one with another, though they cannot bee all of one minde, yet of one heart, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one anothers infirmities, indeavoring to heale all that is ſinfull in each other; O that the ſpirit of zeale to promote the cauſe wee are ingaged in, might once more bee found amongſt us, that wee might with <hi>Abiſhai</hi> and <hi>Ioab play the men</hi> and beſtirre our ſelves, and let God doe what is good in his own eyes: let that be our ſecond care, remember our firſt principles, and our firſt wayes; And then thirdly, and laſtly,</p>
            <p>With lamenting and bemoaning our failings, and with <note place="margin">3.</note> our recovering our firſt love, and our firſt wayes, let us <note place="margin">With confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence expect a good iſſue from God.</note> quietly leave it to God, to doe what hee will; O that God would once bring his ſervants to this paſſe, never to look for any great good from man, nor never to feare any great evill from man, neither good from the beſt of men, nor evill from the worſt of men, but to reſolve that the Lord can and will himſelfe doe his own worke, and were there not left in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in all three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes any one of power to ſtand for the cauſe of God, were all ſwallowed up, yet let us conclude the fire of God will burne up all the briars and thornes that are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen up againſt the Lords vineyard; were our Armies all loſt, were our friends all gone (as indeed wee are come to a very low ebbe) yet is our deliverance never the further off, therefore hold up your confidence; indeed if wee were engaged in an ill cauſe wee ought to give it over to repent of it openly, and take ſhame to our ſelves; if wee have done ill, to ſtand for reformation, contend for our liberties, to contend to bee a free people, if this were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full let us bee humbled, and tell all the world of it, but if it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116684:19"/>
be right, it's not the falling away of this man or that man, or the revolting of this or t'other Ship, or Caſtle, or this partie or that partie, all this is nothing, if God turne but his face againſt them they are all gone; Brethren, let me ſpeak truly of it, it is thus in <hi>Scotland</hi> at this day, the godly party, they that are for the Covenant and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though they are overborne with an Army, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate party riſen up againſt them, who threaten to ſwallow up all, and have plundred and waſted the eſtates and goods of them who will not joyne with them in this ſinfull and wicked ingagement, yet they hold one and cleave to their old rules and principles, and confidently expect deliverance; the Lord teach us to doe the like, that as wee meet this day to praiſe God for his mercies and deliverances lately received, a whole catalogue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were now read unto you, ſo to reſolve it for the time to come to ſeeke him in his own way, wee to doe what wee can, and with faith leave him to doe what he will.</p>
