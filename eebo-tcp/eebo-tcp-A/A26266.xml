            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dearly Beloved in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING been converſant amongſt you for Forty years paſt, I cannot be ſuppoſed ignorant of your Practiſes in Matters of Worſhip; and am well aſſured (notwithſtanding ſome Differences in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of leſſer moment) you have maintained the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Salvation, and Church Communion, to your great commendation. But of late, there hath ariſen amongſt you certain Perſons who have troubled the Peace of the Churches, and have occaſioned Diviſions, to the Grief of many, by innovating a Form of Worſhip never practiſed (as I find in all Hiſtories) by any of your Brethren before you: Nor indeed in the World by any other, till about the time of <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the laſt Century. And that is, to ſing in Rhyme by a ſet Form, and that by all the People together; whether Saints or Sinners, Members or no Members, whether they are Young or Old, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or not underſtand what is ſung.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:30316:3"/>For the Reverend <hi>Ri. Watſon</hi> Doctor of Divinity, in his Book printed at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1684. about this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. ſaith thus, <hi>The Original of this Device,</hi> (viz. <hi>of turning the Pſalms of</hi> David <hi>into Rhime and Metre) was not in</hi> England, <hi>but first taken up by one</hi> Clement Marrot, <hi>a Groom of the Bed-chamber to the French King</hi> Francis <hi>the Firſt, and having told us how he made Songs for the King to ſing.</hi> He adds Pag. 20. <hi>That he was prevailed with by</hi> Fr. Vetablus, <hi>to relinquiſh his trifling Doggerel, and to turn</hi> David<hi>'s Pſalms into French Metre, and he did the firſt</hi> 30. <hi>and that the King ſung them as he had done his former Ballads.</hi> And as he afterwards tells us, <hi>He went to</hi> Geneva, <hi>and was incouraged by</hi> Beza <hi>and</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, <hi>and that afterwards he turned</hi> 20 <hi>more into Rhyme, by their means and procurement; and that the</hi> Papiſts <hi>were strangers to, and Enemies againſt this Novel Practice,</hi> is plain: For that the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> complained of it to the King, and procured an Edict againſt the uſe thereof. But he went to <hi>Geneva</hi> and there it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. Now to know about what time this was, we may gueſs by an Eminent Paſſage in Hiſtory. That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance given to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> by thoſe who ſung <hi>Marots</hi> Pſalms, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. and for that <hi>Marot</hi> was with <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi>; and the other is noted, as hapning quickly after they began to put theſe Rhymes of his into Practice: It muſt have its Original from or about that time.</p>
            <p>Therefore we may infer from thence, as we uſually do on another Subject. We ſay, that ſeeing our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries cannot prove from Scripture or any Authentick Hiſtory, that any Infant was Baptized in the firſt two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30316:3"/>
Centuries, it was becauſe the ſame was not command<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, nor taught by his Apoſtles. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe will hold good here alſo, ſeeing that 1500 years paſt, ſince our Saviours time, and no inſtance to be given of any Church of Chriſt that ever ſung in Rhyme.</p>
            <p>Now were there no other Objection againſt it than only the form of its performance, it is not a matter ſo ſlightly to be paſſed over; becauſe your ſelves deny Sprinkling to be Baptiſm, purely from a wrong Form uſed in the manner of applying the Water to the Perſon that is to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Learned among you know, That it could not be the Practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church to ſing in Rhyme; becauſe neither the Song of <hi>Moſes, Deborah,</hi> nor the Book of Pſalms, as they are in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> are any of them in Rhyme, but all in Proſe: And yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they muſt acknowledge the <hi>Jews</hi> had as great an Obligation upon them to perform it in that mode as any now, in caſe it had been an eſſential part of Singing. Moreover the <hi>Jews</hi> amongſt us at this day, do believe they ſing, and in the ſame manner their Fore-fathers did; and yet all they do is in Proſe, not in Rhyme.</p>
            <p>And I am as certain, there is no ſuch Form of Singing expreſſed in the New Teſtament to be practiſed by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, or the Primitive Churches; Nor as yet have I met with any of our Brethren of a contrary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, who have aſſerted it, altho their Practice indeed is otherwiſe; for they all ſing in Rhyme: And when it hath been demanded of them, why they ſung in a Form different from the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, and alſo from that of the Primitive Chriſtians? They have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30316:4"/>
becauſe they knew not how to ſing otherwiſe. I might make ſome Reflections upon this, which might not be very pleaſing; but I deſign Truth and not Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and therefore ſhall forbear. As to the other parts which belong to this Controverſy, I find the Aſſertors of it are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among themſelves; ſome having pleaded for it as a Duty ſimply Moral, and ſo no need of a Goſpel Precept. Others, they have pleaded for it in both ſenſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think themſelves at liberty to argue either. And others, in the latter only as a Goſpel Inſtitution; and ſome as partly Legal, and partly Evangelical, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſinging it ſelf in the latter, but the Form of doing it, and the Perſons performing it, they take from the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law. And therefore, till they are better agreed in the State of the Controverſy, I ſhall refer the whole matter to the Anſwer which ſhall be given to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paper, which (in my Opinion) comprehends the true ſtate of the Caſe. And if our Brethren will pleaſe to anſwer theſe <hi>Queries,</hi> it may be great ſatisfaction to the Doubting. Whereas if they muſt go without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and due Anſwer, they will ſerve to keep me and others in our preſent and antient Practice; and we ought not to be blamed by our Brethren, for refuſing to admit any thing into the Church as an Ordinance which we have not a ſufficient Authority for, from the New Teſtament; becauſe ſome of them cannot but know, that all thoſe Corruptions that are found in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not brought in at once, but by degrees. Yea, even the <hi>Maſs</hi> it ſelf was brought in by divers Popes, at more than 12 ſeveral times; as for inſtance, one he appointed the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> another the <hi>Introitus,</hi> another the <hi>Kyrie Eleyſon,</hi> another the <hi>Gloria in Excelſis,</hi> another
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30316:4"/>
the <hi>Gradual,</hi> another the <hi>Offertorium,</hi> another the <hi>Canon,</hi> another the <hi>Memento,</hi> another the <hi>Te igitur,</hi> another the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>; with other things too tedious to relate, which has made it ſo monſtrous a piece of Worſhip as it is now found to be. And altho' I do allow, that what our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern have done in bringing in this of Singing into the Church, is not in it ſelf a matter of the greateſt moment; yet if by the ſame Rule we ſhould have Forms of Prayer introduc'd next, and after that other things, which might alſo by degrees upon the ſame Foundation be innovated; it might tend to the utter ruine of Primitive Chriſtianity, which they know fell out in the firſt Grand Apoſtacy. But hoping our Brethren deſign no ſuch thing, and that God will always ſtir up ſome of his faithful Servants to oppoſe it, if attempted. I ſhall ſay no more, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the <hi>Queries</hi> themſelves, which I judge may be fit to be publiſhed for the benefit of thoſe concerned, ſo far as appears to me upon the reading of them: For I aſſure you, I am not the Author thereof, and therefore will not aſſume that to my ſelf which is the Product of the Labour and Study of one, much better skilled in this Controverſy.</p>
            <p>But upon the requeſt of the Publiſher, have thought fit to write this Introduction.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:30316:5"/>8. Whether or no if Chriſt and all the Apoſtles ſung the Hymn together, that the Hymn that they thus ſung did not belong to the Paſſover, and ceaſed with the Paſſover?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whether or no as there was a Hymn belonging to the Paſſover, there was not a neceſſity they ſhould ſing the Hymn as belonging to the Paſſover; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how could it be ſaid they kept the Paſſover?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whether or no they ſung two Hymns, the one belonging to the Paſſover, and ceaſed with it; and the other belonging to the Lord's Supper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining?</p>
               <p n="11">11. Whether or no if it be as 'tis ſaid, that they ſung together, and went out ſinging, that they returned back to conclude with Prayer, as now you generally do; but where is your Preſident for it?</p>
               <p n="12">12. Whether (notwithſtanding all that you have ſaid) there is either Precept or Preſident for your ſinging ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Lord's Supper, or before, or after your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons? If you have, you are deſired to produce it; for that will end the Controverſy about it: but nothing ſhort of that will.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing ſome of the Singers ſtick not to this, but fly to the Law for their Refuge: As thoſe ſeventeen Gentlemen, whoſe hands are put to a Pamphlet, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A Sober Reply, &amp;c.</hi> do aſſert in their third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>If ſinging Gods Praiſes were under the Law with Voices lift up together, and the Saints are in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament required to ſing, and no other way it preſcribed or laid down how they ſhould ſing: Then the Saints in the New Teſtament ought to ſing as they ſang under the Old.

               <p n="13">13. Whether or no the <hi>Jews</hi> when they ſung in the Temple, or elſe-where, what they ſung was not in Proſe?</p>
               <p n="14">14. Whether or no any ſung in the Temple Worſhip, but the Singers only?</p>
               <p n="15">15. Whether ſinging was not an Office inſtituted of God for his Worſhip in the Temple, and performed by the <hi>Levites</hi> only?</p>
               <p n="16">16. Whether all the <hi>Levites</hi> ſung together, or only <hi>Aſaph, Heman</hi> and <hi>Jeduthan,</hi> and their Sons and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren?</p>
               <p n="17">17. Whether they had not a chief Chanter, to give Inſtructions in the Song to the Singers?</p>
               <p n="18">18. Whether or no the Singers were not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be clothed in White Linnen?</p>
               <p n="19">19. Whether or no they were not commanded to ſing with Muſick, <hi>viz.</hi> with Cymbals, Pſalteries and Harps?</p>
               <p n="20">20. Whether the Prieſts themſelves were not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Trumpets, to join with the Singers in their ſinging?</p>
               <p n="21">21. Whether or no all the Congregation which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together, ever ſung with the <hi>Levites?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Whether the <hi>Jews</hi> ever ſung in their Synagogue Worſhip?</p>
               <p n="23">23. Whether or no ſinging in our Cathedrals (if we muſt take our Rules from Legal Practices) be not a more agreeable Practice than yours? for they Sing in Proſe, and have Muſick, and are clothed in White Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30316:6"/>
and have Choriſters, with a Chaunter to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: but you have none of theſe.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Yet whether or no theſe Practices are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all judicious Chriſtians, as ſuperſtitious; and ſeeing you plead for your Singing from the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, what can yours be leſs?</p>
               <p n="25">25. Whether it be not a ſtrange Doctrine, that there is no Direction how to ſing in all the Goſpel?</p>
               <p n="26">26. If this be true, (as 'tis ſaid) then whether it is not more ſtrange that we having no Direction, ſhould be neceſſitated to ſing as they ſung under the Law?</p>
               <p n="27">27. Whether it be not moſt ſtrange, that inſtead of following thoſe Directions they have given, they ſhould ſet up a way of Singing, in direct oppoſition to that as pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed under the Law?</p>
               <p n="28">28. Whether or no 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He will ſing with the Spirit, and with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alſo,</hi> was not only Direction to the Church, but a Preſident alſo, whatever they have ſaid to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Whether or no what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18, 19. if it be a Precept; that be not the Precept, <hi>Not to be drunk with Wine; but be filled with the Spirit:</hi> implying, that if they were not filled with the Spirit, they could not ſpeak to themſelves in Pſalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs: And in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>That the Word of Chriſt muſt dwell richly in them, in all Wiſdom</hi>; implying, that otherwiſe they could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh one another in Pſalms and Hymns, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Songs, nor ſing with grace in their Hearts; and ſurely, this is moſt agreeable to the Apoſtles Doctrine and Practices whatever is, or can be ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?</p>
               <p n="30">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:30316:7"/>30. Whether or no it were not better to pluck off the Mask, and give over your Singularity, and join with the other Auxiliaries, and reſt in what you practiſe, even in the Pſalms as Tranſlated into Engliſh Metre, with the Tunes as printed and allowed to be ſung by all people together, before and after Sermons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after their Prayers? For, is it not a clear caſe, that if they were then Tranſlated in Engliſh Metre, they were never Tranſlated before? and if they were then allowed and appointed to be ſung, they were not allowed nor appointed before. And never talk of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Breach; for if there ever was a Breach, it was then repaired, or it is not yet repaired.</p>
               <p>But ceaſing at preſent, hoping ſome of the great Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will Anſwer theſe Queries; it is alſo deſired they would Anſwer this one Argument; for 'tis not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned but it is of more weight than thoſe Three that have been levyed againſt it, tho' uſhered into the world with the Authority of ſeventeen Hands.</p>
               <p>That which Chriſt our great Law-giver never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor his Apoſtles in his Name never taught, nor practiſed, cannot be a Goſpel Duty.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt never commanded, nor his Apoſtles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught nor practiſed in his Name, that ever a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Congregation, when Congregated together, ſhould ſing Pſalms or Hymns promiſcuouſly, or all together, both Men and Women, Young and Old, Boys and Girls, Profeſſors and Prophane.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſuch a ſinging of Pſalms or Hymns by a Chriſtian Congregation, when congregated together, is not a Duty.</p>
