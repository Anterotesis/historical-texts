            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THis Morning by an Expreſs from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> came Letters from the Fleet, with this following Account; That on the 19th Their Majeſtles and the Dutch Fleet, being about 6 Leagues from Cape <hi>Barfleur,</hi> got ſight of the French Fleet, who came down upon us with the Wind at <hi>S.</hi> W. and about 11 they were engaged, which contlnued till about 3 in the Afternoon, when the French bore away; It was Calm greateſt part of the day, but a freſh Gale ſpringing up about 6, the Blue Squadron renewed the Fight, and continued it till Ten at Night; During the Engagement we heard 3 Ships blow up, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be French; ſince we did not miſs one on our ſide; All Night 'twas very Calm, and Foggy the next Morning; about 8 a Clock it began to clear up, the Wind at E. N. E. when we ſaw the French Fleet about 2 Leagues to the Leeward of us, being much leſſened in their number ſince the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for they were now but 36 Men of War; we endeavoured all we could to get up with them, and they to retire from us; About Ten it grew Calm again, and about Three both Fleets came to an Anchor, the Dutch, who had the Van, being within a League of the Enemy, the Wind then Weſterly. At 11 at Night we weighed, and Anchored about 6 the next Morning. The 21ſt about 9 in the morning we ſet Sail again, as did likewiſe the Enemy, Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> took his Courſe towards <hi>Barfleur,</hi> having got ſight of ſeveral French Ships under the Shoar, and Admiral <hi>Allemonde,</hi> and the Admiral of the Blue, Sailed to the Weſtward; the firſt endeavoured to get up with 16 French Ships, which he diſcovered, and ſnppoſed were coming from <hi>France</hi> to join their Fleet; and Sir <hi>John Aſhby</hi> purſued the reſt of the Enemies Fleet, who endeavoured in great Confuſion to get into the Raſe of <hi>Ornay.</hi> Admiral <hi>Allemonde</hi> loſt ſight of the ſaid 16 French Ships in the Night, they having<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he believed, got in among the Rocks, and becauſe it was not adviſeable to follow them there, he ſailed Eaſtward again to rejoyn Admiral <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 22d in the Forenoon, Vice-Admiral <hi>Delavai</hi> burnt under Cape <hi>de Wyke</hi> near the Shore, the <hi>Royal Sun,</hi> being the Ship of the Count <hi>de Tourville,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the French Fleet, carrying 104 Guns, as alſo the <hi>Admirable,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his ſecond Monſieur <hi>Beaujen</hi> of 102 Guns; and the Fort of 80 Guns, with two Frigats, and three of leſſer Rank, and Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was in cloſe purſuit of 9 more. The Priſoners of the ſaid Burnt Ships declared, That during the Battle 4 or 5 their biggeſt Ships were Deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Rear Admiral <hi>Carter,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Anthony Haſtings</hi> Commander of the <hi>Sandwich,</hi> were killed in the Battle.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Portſmouth</hi> we have an account, That 4 French Ships, of 3 Decks, lay on the back of the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> very much diſabled; and that two Engiiſh Men of War, who were refitted, with two Dutch Frigats, and a Fireſhip, were going out to take or deſtroy them.</p>
