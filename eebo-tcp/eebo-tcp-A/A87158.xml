         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MAN goeth forth to his Work, and to his Labour, until the Evening;</hi> ſaith the Royal Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.23. The day of his Life is ſpent in a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and weary Travel, 'till the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, 'till his declining Sun be fully ſet, and he fitted to lie down in Peace, and enjoy the happy Reſt of a long enſuing night. But that Man, in this his day, might not diſquiet himſelf in vain; that he might not bear the heat and burthen of the day, and yet miſs of this Reſt at night; the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (and in them to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) begins his fourth Chapter, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154187:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Exhortation to <hi>Fear, leſt a Promiſe being left them of entering into God's Reſt, any of them ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> Wherein he layes down the Ground and Motive of Hope, plainly implied in the ſame words; <hi>A promiſe being left them of entring into his Reſt;</hi> concluding the whole Chapter, with a moſt cogent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing invitation, <hi>to come boldly to the Throne of Grace, to obtain Mercy, and to find Grace to help in time of need;</hi> That ſo he that went on his way weeping, and bearing forth good ſeed, might doubtleſs come again with joy, and bring his ſheaves with him; That he that went ſighing and groaning, under the weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his heavy load, might have no cauſe to faint, or deſpond in the way, nor ſtart aſide through the ſad affrightments of hopeleſs <hi>fear. Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> (well temper'd together) are the two preſervatives of our Safety or Spiritual Life; they are that, which keep our Faith and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154187:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Love, from deſpair on the one ſide, and from preſumption on the other; from ſlothful ſecurity on this hand, and tormenting diſtruſtful anxiety on the other. <hi>Fear,</hi> as the Rudder of the Ship, diverts our Souls, in their ſailings to Heaven, the Haven of their eternal Reſt, from the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and Rocks that are in the way; while <hi>Hope,</hi> as the Sails, filled with the breathings of God's Spirit, his faithful promiſes, carries us forward, againſt the tide or ſtream of the World, our earthly deſires, and carnal inclinations: Wherefore the wiſe Apoſtle, here, as every where elſe, throughout this, and his other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſeeks to temper and mix theſe two, in the Souls of Chriſtians: And having exemplified the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, both of attaining, and alſo of loſing God's Reſt, in the ancient <hi>Iſraelites, ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 7. to the end; now repeats, and preſſeth the motives of Fear and Hope, upon the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in them on all Chriſtians. <hi>Let
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154187:11"/>
us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entering into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> Were the promiſe of Reſt unconditional and abſolute unto ſome, and not at all propounded to others, with any feazibleneſs of attaining it, by a true poſſibility of performing its conditions; the former ſhould have no reaſon to fear, nor the latter to hope: But the promiſe being condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and general, excluding none from God's Reſt, that will prepare themſelves for it, by faith, hope, and love unfeigned; ſincere impartial perſevering obedience and patience; giving them full aſſurance of it, upon the evidence of their integrity in theſe things; incluſive of none, but ſuch as entirely, humbly, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, believe and accept it on theſe terms: They that as yet neglect theſe terms, or are in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from their former dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in obſerving them, had need to fear, leſt they miſs of it; and in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154187:11"/>
that fear, work out their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, give all diligence to make their calling and election ſure; which as it ſeems by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is not ſo, unleſs by <hi>adding to Faith Courage, to Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Knowledge, Godlineſs, Charity, Temperance, Patience, more and more.</hi> Having theſe promiſes, dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.

would perſwade themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the promiſes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are particular and abſolute, confin'd to ſome few, and to thoſe howſoever they be qualified; when as the whole tenor and current of Chriſtian Doctrine proclaims directly the quite contrary, that they are general and conditional; a Picture that looks every Man in the face, that comes into the room, but cannot be imagined to eye any Man elſe; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained to all, provided they perform the condition, and an <gap reason="foreign">

takers of God's Reſt, that the promiſe thereof belongs to them, though they live as thoſe that ſet up their Reſt in the luſts of the fleſh, thoſe luſts of the Eye, that pride of life which is directly contrary to it, and the love of the Father; we have but too great reaſon to fear, that unleſs they repent and reform ſpeedily and effectually, they will prove ſuch as no Reſt belongs to.</p>
            <p>And if we look on the ſlothful negligence in good works, yea the wilful backſliding to wicked works, to falſe Doctrines, to lewd practiſes, which are to be found too viſibly and frequently even in thoſe, who once were ſincere Believers, ſuch as had for a time obeyed both in heart and life the Goſpel of Chriſt, received his precepts into their practice, as well as promiſes into their Creed; we ſhall have too great reaſon to fear, that they alſo may fall away finally from thoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without the renewed preſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154187:14"/>
performance of which, there is no reſt of Gods to be had. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both in reſpect of the former faithleſs Profeſſors, and of the latter backſliding Profeſſors, let us fear, as the Apoſtle exhorts us, fear in wiſdom towards our ſelves, and fear in charity towards others; fear and watch over our ſelves and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, watch and pray, labour and ſtrive, <hi>leſt a promiſe being left us of entering Gods reſt, any of us ſeem to fall ſhort of it,</hi> for want of attending to its conditions, which is not onely an outward profeſſion but a lively faith working by love, and that not onely begun or continued for a while, but perſevering to the end. Deſpiſe not then the motive of Fear, leſt you deſpiſe your own Souls. To fear any mortal viſible enemy, any earthly temporal danger, in an holy righteous cauſe, is cowardiſe and ſervile baſeneſs: to fear the labour of ſtudy and diligence, is ſloth and idleneſs: but to fear God and his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154187:15"/>
righteous threats, eſpecially that of loſing his reſt, of incurring his endleſs intolerable diſpleaſure, this is a wiſe and gracious fear; not only the beginning of Wiſdom and Grace, but its ſafety and preſervation, its watchful Monitor, Exciter, and Furtherer all along; for it makes us examine and prove our ſelves, whether we are as yet in the faith, well ſettled and grounded, ſuch a faith as works by love and ſincere obedience, not a groundleſs or fruitleſs credulity, perſwaſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of all being well, on a bare profeſſion; and when we have found that we are ſincere in faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, love, obedience, it awakes our care to continue ſo, by growing in grace, and perſevering againſt whatever allurements or terrors, leſt we fall from our own ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, and hold not faſt the ground of our confidence to the end. It works on our memory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives our humility for ſins paſt; it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154187:15"/>
works on our reaſon, and ſtirs up our care againſt ſin for the future. The fear of miſſing or falling ſhort of Gods reſt, of incurring intolerable eternal trouble, anguiſh, and pain, reſtrains us from running on in the ways of deſtruction. In the reſtraint ſome hope of pardon ſhews it ſelf; in this hope we ſee the mercy and love of God, and then at laſt perceive the horrour and uglineſs of ſin, not onely in its puniſhment, but in it ſelf. This laſt hath more of love than fear in it, and the fear is now become filial; for a good Son will fear the anger of his Father ſo much the more, becauſe he knows the greatneſs and ſweetneſs of his love, and by that fear preſerves and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes his filial obedience. Our Saviour commands his Apoſtles themſelves, who ſure were Sons, and had the Spirit of Adoption, to <hi>fear him that can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell fire,</hi> that they might not fear, but chooſe to ſuffer all that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154187:16"/>
Man could inflict on their bodies, rather than hazard the loſs of his favour; for what's the fire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to that of Gods wrath? or the pains of a Rack for an hour or two, to the torments of hell for evermore? The Fathers call this fear, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the bridle of luſts or diſorderly appetites, and not onely the entrance to Piety, but the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of all Virtue.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154187:16"/>
the whole Chapter with theſe words, <hi>Wherefore let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> I know that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Aug.</hi> is true, <hi>Brevis differentia legis &amp; Evangelij, Timor &amp; Amor.</hi> But 'tis the fear of temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is proper to the Law, wherewith, as alſo with hope of temporal promiſes, they were in that Nonage allured or terrified, firſt to outward, then to inward ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obedience. We ſhould indeed for the great kindneſs and enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring amiableneſs of our Redeemer and Redemption, be all on fire with thankful love; but we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not onely what's the height of our duty we owe to our Lord, but what's that which at firſt entrance into his School we can perform, and what afterwards through the remainders of corruption we ſtill need, and what he will be pleaſed to accept. Thus to be frighted and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154187:17"/>
chaſed to happineſs is an Argument indeed of our imperfection; but ſince our ſtate is as yet imperfect, 'tis our Wiſdom to uſe all ſuch helps as our Lord allows of. And yet even in the ſtate of innocency our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents needed this motive, and had not fell if they had uſed it: they fell with this thought, that they ſhould not fall. They who in this lapſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect eſtate, require ſuch Chriſtians onely as are made up of all love, do but <hi>Votum accomodare, non Hiſtoriam, nec qualis eſt, ſed qualis eſſe deberet deſcribunt.</hi> They tell us what their wiſh is, and our duty; but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the real Hiſtory of what is, and what is likely to be effected. Thus <hi>Tully</hi> ſays of <hi>Cato,</hi> that <hi>optimo animo &amp; ſummâ fide utens, nocet, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Reipublicae,</hi> with an honeſt and good meaning he did ſometimes much hurt to the Commonwealth, by impoſing that ſtrictneſs of Laws and Manners, which 'twas not able to reach or keep. <hi>Tanquam in Platonis

Republicâ non tanquam in faece Romuli;</hi> fitting his ſentence rather to <hi>Plato</hi>'s phanſied <hi>Utopian</hi> Commonwealth, than to the real ſtate of <hi>Rome.</hi> So I may ſay of theſe Perfectioniſts, they do not remember that they have to do with Men, in whom ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the old Man will ſtill be luſting againſt the Spirit; and thoſe luſtings muſt be check'd, and chil'd and ſuppreſt ſometimes, with this fear of falling ſhort of God's Reſt, and falling into intolerable Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And yet ſuppoſe they were as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and feared Sin more than Hell, yet the height of ſome Mens grace is no ground for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctrine; nor becauſe Love is the beſt of all, therefore may Fear be made unlawful; as if that were a Sin, which God propounds to keep us from Sin. Hell I am ſure is a part of our Creed as well as Heaven, and God hath propounded both a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and a Mercy-ſeat, and if we may ſerve God as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154187:18"/>
an eye of hope to the recompence of reward, why not with an eye of fear towards him, who though a Father, will-judge every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works. Our Saviour indeed, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. bids his flock, how little ſoever, <hi>not fear, becauſe it is their Fathers pleaſure to give them the kingdom;</hi> but the fear he forbids, is the fear of diſtruſtfulneſs in him, or his promiſes, or aſſiſtances; as if he would not or could not defend his obedient Children againſt the numerous Herd of the wicked; not the fear of incurring his holy and juſt diſpleaſure, in caſe they ſhould do what muſt diſpleaſe him. We do not fear as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, preſent puniſhment to reſtrain us from that luſt, which otherwiſe we love and would willingly follow. Our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt motives of obedience are not from that ſpirit of bondage, which looks chiefly on temporal things, and thinks it ſelf rejected for ever if chaſtiſed here, or tried with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154187:18"/>
for the Goſpel directs us to things inviſible and eternal, much more clearly than the Law, and makes afflictions patiently endured, the ſign of Gods favour rather than hatred; nor is it contrary to the Spirit of Adoption, to fear offending him that adopted us, leſt thereby he diſinherit us. Though we are received into the family of Gods children, and muſt love God above all as our Father, love our Redeemer ſo much more than all Relations, than life it ſelf and its deareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, as to forſake and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them for ever, rather than him: Yet we are ſtill exhorted and enjoyned to paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear, not to fear what Man, but God can do unto us. To love him as a Father, and fear to loſe his love by offending him; to love the Son, and kiſs him with reverence leſt he be angry; to love the Holy Spirit of God, and fear to grieve, reſiſt, and quench him,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154187:19"/>
leſt we turn his grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and make him withdraw his gracious preſence, that would enable us in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſerve him, without fear of any evil that can befall us ſo doing, or of any enemy that can hurt us; and yet to fear him whom we ſerve as our Lord and King. A good Son may fear to incur his Father's wrath by ceaſing to be ſo, and yet cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> interprets that of Saint <hi>John, Perfect love caſts out fear,</hi> of <hi>lazy fear,</hi> that will not go on in the way of grace, for fear of a Lion in the way, ſome hazard, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties likely to meet him; not the fear of Gods wrath poſſible to be incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſin and backſliding, but of temporal dangers and perſecutions. If our love be perfect, though with the perfection of ſincerity, that is, habitually prevailing over all other loves, 'twill caſt out ſuch fear, and make us lay down our lives for the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154187:19"/>
Brethren, to glorifie God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others by the evidence of our faith, content to adventure any thing for Chriſts ſake, even death it ſelf; but ſure not the diſpleaſing of God, and the torments of Hell, that were too prodigal an alms, too wild a valour, directly contrary to the love as well as fear of God in Chriſt. Charity again caſteth out all fear, but by degrees; as that increaſeth, ſo fear abateth. If our Sanctification were as perfect for degrees, as univerſal for its parts; were our obedience like that of Angels, which cannot fail, we ſhould need neither hope to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our love, nor fear to guard it; but while it is only in part, the beſt Chriſtians in this ſtate of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, may have uſe of a Deaths Head, and make Gods threats as well as promiſes, ſubordinate means to concur with the principal; But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes to keep the Building from ſwerving, while the foundation of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154187:20"/>
Faith and Love keeps it from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Fides &amp; ſpes tuta ſi cauta, ſecura ſi ſollicita.</hi> Tert. Fear makes our love reverent, our hope wary, our faith diſcreet. If the Sails be too full, they may endanger us as much as a Rock; for Fear as a Rudder guides and ſteers our Faith and Hope, between the gulph or ſands of Deſpair; and the rock of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or proud Security. Serve we the Lord then in love, but in fear too, and rejoyce unto him with trembling, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks; fear him as Lord; love and rejoyce in him as Jeſus; yea, and fear him as Jeſus too; fear to offend ſo gracious a Saviour, to vilifie and hazard ſuch precious Salvation, <hi>ſit timor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiae Cuſtos,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Cyp. ut Deus qui in mentes noſtras clementer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxit, in animi hoſpitio juſtâ operatione teneatur.</hi>

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we look on the love and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy of God, in offering, purchaſing, inviting, drawing us to this Reſt at ſuch a price, by ſuch powerful obliging variety of means or motives; or on the deceitfulneſs of mans heart, willing to think the conditions of it, fewer and eaſier than they are; and to ſatisfie it ſelf in the hopes of it on an outward profeſſion, a ſpeculative faith, or a partial obedience. Or laſtly, whether we conſider the poſſibility of falling away through ſloth or impatience, from the ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith, love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which was begun.

               </gap>, or intimation, of ſo well at leaſt, and much better; for to us the Goſpel is preach'd, without intervention of Types and Propheſies, in its clear, full, actual exhibition, unveiling thoſe Types, fulfilling thoſe Propheſies, revealing the whole Myſtery of Godlineſs, and Counſel of God much plainer, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing the Light and Grace of Gods Spirit more generally and plentifully: So that the Argument runs thus; If they that had Gods Reſt promiſed to them more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, and in a lower degree and meaſure, yet fell ſhort of it for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:154187:24"/>
want of being ſound, and conſtant in Faith and Obedience; how much more ſhall they do ſo, who having the Goſpel preach'd unto them in its cleareſt fulleſt degree of light and power, yet do not receive, believe, and obey it, with faithful ſincerity and perſeverance?</p>
            <p>Now by faith, for want of which the Word preach'd did not profit them, is meant ſuch a firm well-grounded perſuaſion of Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable all ſufficient Wiſdom and Truth, as to adhere and cleave thereto, againſt whatever appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring difficulties or temptations. For the ancient <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they had moſt of them once believed <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they ſlew the Paſſover, and ſprinkled their Doors with the bloud thereof, went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ready to purſue them, and went through the Red Sea into the Wilderneſs towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> following the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Cloud and Pillar of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154187:25"/>
Fire; but when there aroſe any new difficulty or temptation, <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence for 40 days, want of Water, Bread for a while, nay want of Fleſh, the Allurements of Women, though Heatheniſh Idolaters, the news of Gyants and high Walls, they ſtrangely forget the former evidences of Gods Faithfulneſs, Power, Goodneſs, and Truth; queſtion and tempt him, repine and murmur, and turn back in their hearts to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore 'twas want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ſerious attentive frequent minding what they had formerly known and believed, which continually expoſed them to fall away to unbelief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: Such are the grounds and motives of Faith propounded in Scripture, that they who attend impartially and ſeriouſly, cannot with any true reaſon, deny their aſſent and approbation of that Doctrine, which they prove and

and blind the heart, that final impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency; and infidelity is the iſſue in too too many. Let no man then deceive himſelf with preſumptious Hopes, of entring Gods Reſt, on bare profeſſion of his Goſpel (for that may be counterfeit; and void of any well grounded faith; ſure to fail in time of Trial.)</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the word and means of grace, though never ſo wiſely and powerfully diſpenced, may prove very generally ineffectual, for want of being mixt with faith in the partakers: And that they who enjoy the means of grace, and yet are not wrought upon by them, to faith and obedience, ſincere, and durable, their call and profeſſion, of being the People of God, does them not onely no good; but haſtens and aggravates their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; is it not time then for thoſe who live in the light of the Goſpel (as never I think any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did, for Hundreds of Years,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154187:26"/>
if this hath not) to look to their hearts and lives impartially; and thence diſcover what grounds and ſtability of faith; there is in the one, what fruits and good effects in the other; and if they find themſelves at a loſs, to take the blame intirely and wholly to themſelves, not to the want of means and motives, Paſtors or Teachers, skillful and faithful, but to the want of their own attention and conſideration; their taking up their profeſſion of Chriſtianity on no better or ſurer grounds; than that which a Pagan, or Mahometan relies on, for their wicked errors. Or if they have taken it up on better, and know what, and why, they believe; then they are clearlier convinced, and condemned by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for not perſevering, and increaſing that faith by living ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely according to it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting their very faith, as well as profeſſion, untill the cuſtom of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154187:26"/>
ſin hath darkned, if not extinguiſht their former evidences; is it not high time then for any that finde it thus with them, to caſt away all longer delays of ſelf abhorrence and repentance, to return to God and their own hearts with ſhame and grief for their former backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and for ever, from henceforth to be the more humble for what is paſt, watchful and zealous for the future in reviewing their faith, and living by it in Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Purity and Peaceableneſs, Obedience and Patience, leſt that faith which hath been deadned, and contradicted ſo long and often; turn to a total and final apoſtacy in the end.</p>
            <p>There's nothing more clear in Holy Scripture than that they whom God vouchſafes to call by his loudeſt voice; and powerfulleſt means, to Repentance and Faith, and Obedience; are rendred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſo much the more hainouſly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154187:27"/>
guilty of willful ingratitude, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and diſobedience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore liable to ſo much the ſorer Condemnation; unleſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, believe, and obey according to that light and grace which was afforded them: <hi>You have I known of all Nations, therefore you will I puniſh the ſooner</hi> and more ſeverely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the World, and ye have loved darkneſs rather than light. Woe unto thee</hi> Corazin, <hi>woe unto thee</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>for if the mighty works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they had repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. How ſhall we of all others eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed a great favour and mercy of God to ſend us his Goſpel, to prevent us with all the means of grace, but favours and mercies abuſed and perverted; increaſe the guilt of thoſe that receive them, but would not uſe them to God's glory and their own Salvation: And yet what more common and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154187:27"/>
general for Men and Women of all ſorts, to ſuppoſe themſelves ſafe enough, and entituled ſufficiently to God's Reſt, becauſe they are of the viſible Church, profeſſing that Truth which ſhould purify and ſanctify them, but doth not, becauſe it is not aright conſidered and laid to heart, in its grounds and reaſons, terms, and conditions, as well as its promiſes.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the <hi>Jews</hi> you ſee, though brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with many Miracles, made the peculiar People of God, the lively Oracles committed to them, and what not that could be deſired to make them holy or happy, yet for want of conſidering and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God, forfeited and loſt their Title to <hi>Canaan.</hi> And the greateſt part I fear of Chriſtians; yea of the pureſt profeſſors of Chriſtianity, will forfeit and loſe their Title to Heaven; unleſs they conſider, believe, and obey the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154187:28"/>
Goſpel of Chriſt more ſincerely, impartially, conſtantly than hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they ſeem to have done. And if they miſs of Gods Reſt, for want of conſidering and performing its conditions, their anguiſh and pain will be ſo much the heavier to all eternity: They that have the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Paſtors and Teachers gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, and yet are never the better, and holier, are ſo much worſe; becauſe they diſgrace, and bring a reproach on the greateſt and weightieſt Truth in the World, as if it had no evidence or power in it. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> once were like <hi>Gideons</hi> Fleece, full of heavenly Dew in a drought; endued with thoſe high and happy priviledges, of which we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. But yet becauſe they lived not anſwerably to their vocation, but made their privileges occaſions of Pride, and vain preſumption of Gods favour; till at laſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154187:28"/>
their very <hi>Meſſias,</hi> of whom they boaſted as their peculiar, they are at this day like the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa</hi> barren and dry, while the Dew of Heaven hath fallen abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly upon the Nations. The favours ſhewn to the Chriſtian Church are greater than theirs, becauſe the Truth is clearlier revealed, the means of grace more powerfull and leſs burthenſom. But yet theſe favours, if truſted to, and yet neglected; will prove aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's diſpleaſure. To be ſurrounded with ſuch helps of God from above, of Men below; ready to further us towards Heaven, of precepts to guide, promiſes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us, and yet to fall ſhort of Gods Reſt, is a double and treble ſhame and ſorrow: Wherefore if not in gratitude to God, for all his mercies, yet for fear leſt theſe mercies prove by our own willful neglect and contempt of them, the aggravations of our miſery, let us
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154187:29"/>
while it is called to day; excite our ſelves, and exhort one another to repentance and faith, holineſs, and righteouſneſs, obedience and patience, againſt whatever tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ariſe. We have a promiſe infallibly ſure, incomparably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, of entring Gods Reſt, his word to quicken us; his Sacraments to confirm us; his Grace to prevent aſſiſt and follow us; If we hearken to his word, and reſiſt not his grace, neither Prophane nor Idolize his Sacraments, but receive them with faith and reverence; as they were inſtituted in love: If we hear the Church, and watch over our ſelves and one another, Sin ſhall have no dominion over us, we ſhall be built up from one degree of faith and holineſs to another, until we enter Gods Reſt; without any fear or poſſibility of falling from it: But if we neglect the conditions of it, and truſt to the promiſe as if it were abſolute; to the means of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154187:29"/>
grace, as if they were even grace it ſelf; our ſloth and confidence will end in deſpair; and find for ever ſo much the greater trouble and anguiſh; for having miſſed of God's Reſt, offered unto us on ſuch conditions. Let us awake then, and excite our ſelves and one another; by all the arguments of hope and fear, love and gratitude, that ſo God may have the honour of all his favours beſtowed upon us, and we the everlaſting comfort, of being thankful, and hearing that beatifical voice: <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant; enter thy Maſters Joy and Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Reſt of Gods, is not the Reſt of the <hi>Sabboth</hi> or <hi>Canaan</hi> in this life, but that eternal Reſt with God in Heaven, implied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and preparation made for it by the <hi>Sabboth;</hi> Typified by <hi>Canaan,</hi> begun here by believers to be injoy'd in its firſt fruits, through faith and hope, but not to be had in its full
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154187:30"/>
harveſt; its perfect peace and joy in God, 'till we come to Heaven: We which have believed, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> do enter into Reſt, that is, ſhall if we perſevere in faith and holineſs, enter into it perfectly; without poſſibility of forfeiting or loſing it; do enter into it now by faith and hope in God's promiſes; by love and obedience of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which gives us a real Title to it; yea a true, though initial imperfect defeaſible admiſſion into it, by that Reſt from the guilt of Sin, which faith and the merits and interceſſion of Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and imbraces with peace and joy, by that Reſt from the power, diſorder and tyranny of Sin, which faith procuring Gods Spirit, and looking upon the certainty and weight of his promiſes and threats, the beauty and excellency of his precepts, together with the great obligation of God's mercy in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Son to die for our ſins,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:154187:30"/>
and riſe again for our juſtification, effects and enjoys. Thus believers, if ſuch believers as rely on the promiſes of God's Reſt, with faithful reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and endeavours to perform its conditions; do enter into it initially; and ſhall enter into it eternally. But how proves the Apoſtle this? the proof of it is in theſe words. <hi>He ſaid I have ſworn in my wrath that they ſhall not enter my Reſt, who ſhew themſelves obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately unbelieving and diſobedient:</hi> The Argument is taken <hi>à contrario,</hi> from the nature of contrary things; If infidelity and diſobedience, be that alone which excludes from the promiſe of God's Reſt; then faith and obedience, or ſuch a faith as produceth obedience, is that which entitles us to enter into it, for God's promiſe cannot be ſatisfied; nor wholly norutterly diſappointed, or made to become of none effect: And therefore though they who would not believe it; nor keep its
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154187:31"/>
conditions, fell ſhort of it, yet they who believe and perform its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditions muſt enter into it: Yea his very wrath and oath againſt the one for their unbelief and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, implies and inferrs his complacency, and love towards the other, his undefeaſible decree and oath, that they perſevering in faith and obedience ſhall enter, and fully enjoy his Reſt; And this Reſt, was not the Reſt of <hi>Canaan:</hi> For if <hi>Joſhua</hi> or <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun,</hi> had given them Reſt, then would not <hi>David</hi> afterwards have ſpoken of another Reſt; from whence the Apoſtle inferrs, what he began with; <hi>there Remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Reſt to the People of God;</hi> another manner of Reſt than that of <hi>Canaan;</hi> eternal and perfect with God in Heaven, to which the true <hi>Joſhua</hi> or <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of God; muſt give us entrance by faith in him; of whom <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun,</hi> was but an imperfect
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154187:31"/>
tranſitory Type, as that Reſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> was of the perfect eternal Reſt; which ſtill remains for Gods People (the whole Church of true perſevering obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent believers.) From what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath ſaid we may make this obſervation: That Man hath no true and perfect Reſt in ought but God: His Reſt is Mans Reſt, becauſe he is the Reſt and happineſs of Man; the ultimate compleate ſatisfactory object of reaſonable creatures; To Reſt in any thing but in him, as our happineſs, without dependance on him as the Author, and reference to him as the end thereof, is ſinful vanity and vexation, ſure to end in eternal trouble without repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelf was not to be the final Reſt and happineſs of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> nor muſt any thing in this World, any thing leſs than God be ours: What God hath ſaid to the <hi>Jews</hi> of old — he much more clearly hath ſaid and proved
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154187:32"/>
to us Chriſtians: <hi>Ariſe and depart, for this is not your Reſting place.</hi> The Heavenly Reſt and eternal life of ſeeing God, as he is, was but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely and imperfectly revealed to them; who lived before or under the law till Chriſt came, in whom the promiſe of it was made, when man had loſt all hope of it. It was till then, wrapt up as it were in the ſeed and bloome of Types and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, implied and intimated in the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings, attending Piety in this life rather than manifeſted, and brought to light in its cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and ſtrongeſt aſſurances, as now our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath done, who hath brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light through the Goſpel, and therefore if they were obliged only in God through Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to place their happineſs in nothing below, but to look on him through the vaile of Types, and Temporal bleſſings; how much more are we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:154187:32"/>
obliged, as well as enabled, to do ſo, to whom Chriſt hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited with all the fulneſs of Truth and grace, revealing the whole counſel of God, our Reſt in him, and the way to attain it, without obſcurity and beyond diſpute? If <hi>David</hi> foreſaw and foretold this Reſt to be remaining; when he not only enjoy'd <hi>Canaan,</hi> and its bleſſings, as the other <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did; but the very height thereof, as a proſperous King; If he could ſay, <hi>Deliver me O Lord from the Men of this World, whoſe portion is in this life; I am a ſtranger and ſojourner here as all my Fathers were;</hi> How much more are we obliged to think and ſay ſo, who have not ſuch Types and Temporal bleſſings to vaile the Object of our Reſt, and interrupt our ſight of it, to whom the Son and Lord of <hi>David,</hi> hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, exemplifying and teaching us, our only Reſt to be in God the Father, through him the Son, by his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154187:33"/>
holy Spirit, dying to purchaſe an entrance to it, riſing and aſcending and ſitting down in a Glorious Reſt at Gods Right Hand to aſſure us of it. It is no leſs than the ſin of Idolatry to place our Reſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or happineſs, in pleaſures or honours, poſſeſſions or riches, or any thing elſe that this World can gratifie us with; it is the bitter ſpring or Root of all ſins; It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the deſign of God, in giving us any Temporal bleſſings; he gave them to help us unto him, that reflecting upon him as their Author and end, we might be perſwaded to love him incomparably above all; if we fall in love with them, inſtead of raiſing our love to him, we quite pervert the intent of his favours, and turn them into hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, to his diſhonour and our own ruine. He gave them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in our journy; and ſhall we ſo miſtake his meaning, as to ſet up our dwelling in the Inn, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154187:33"/>
Travaile no farther towards our Country but forget the giver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that gift which was ſent us on purpoſe, to mind us of him? This were to bring that curſe on our ſelves which the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, rather than prayed, might fall on Gods enemies; Let their Table be made a ſnare, and that which ſhould have been for their wealth, be an occaſion of falling to them. This were indeed to provoke God, either to withdraw thoſe favours, which thus he ſees reſted in, inſtead of him, or elſe to embitter and curſe them from yeilding any content; and if he ſhould ſuffer us ſtill to reſt in them to his diſhonour, 'twould prove the greateſt, ſureſt curſe of all others, to live and die in this falſe deceitful tranſitory Reſt, which leads to, and ends in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal trouble, and ſorrow of body and ſoul. That which is Mans true Reſt, muſt be able to give him full and perpetual ſatisfaction; But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154187:34"/>
all things below do neither ſatisfie us, while we have them, nor can continue with us longer, to yield us that Reſt or Pleaſure which we fancy. We ſpend much time and care to get them, and when we have gotten them, as we think, they die in the mid'ſt of our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and leave little or nothing behind them, but ſhame and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Taedet adeptos, quod adepturos torſit,</hi> we pine for them as <hi>Ammon</hi> for <hi>Thamar,</hi> and then repine at our ſelves and them, that we were ſuch fools as to ſeek our Reſt, where 'twas not: Therefore all carnal worldly Perſons, whether the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual or voluptuous, the covetous, or ambitious, are fain to wander from one purſtui and deſign to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; till having run the whole circle, they are weary and giddy, perplext and tired, and cry out, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation, no Reſt to be had below, and how ſhall we hope for that above, who
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154187:34"/>
never ſought till 'twas too late: <hi>Ahabs</hi> Kingdom ſeem'd as nothing, unleſs he might have <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard; and having obtained it by Perjury and Murther, it preſſed him to death and Hell. <hi>Alexander</hi> had no Reſt, till he Conquered, he thought, one World, and then had as little, or rather leſs, ſuſpecting and killing his neareſt Friends, untill he drank himſelf to Death and found that Poiſon in Intemperance, which he feared to find from his Cup-bearer. Let's conſult our own experience, and hearts, hath any of us who have run through ſeveral ſtates of life, with Hopes of Reſt, when this or that were attained, found the Reſt which we hoped for, and not, either quite miſs'd what we ſought, or miſs'd of that Reſt, and ſatisfaction which we ſought and hoped to have found? Or if any of us have been ſo happy, and yet ſo miſerable, ſo happy as to obtain our deſires; and yet ſo miſerable as to deſire no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:154187:35"/>
more, no Reſt in Heaven, no Peace and Joy of life eternal with God; can any of us without ſtupifying our very Reaſon, common ſenſe, as well as faith, take Reſt in that which we know we muſt leave e're many years, and which for ought we know may leave us e're many days? Thus we ſee what an hainous ſin; indeed the Spring of all ſins is, to ſeek or deſire to Reſt in ought but God, and withall, what a folly and madneſs it is againſt our ſelves, as well as a ſin againſt God: And yet how guilty of this ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and this folly are moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if we reckon them ſo, who carry the name and profeſſion of Chriſtianity? If God ſend Men health and wealth, peace and plenty, poſſeſſions and honours; how ready are they to ſet up their Reſt on this ſide <hi>Jordan?</hi> whereas all this was given them to raiſe their gratitude, towards its Donor, and make them thereby long after him, that they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:154187:35"/>
might at length Reſt in him: But if God ſend them afflictions and troubles, to wean them and drive them from this their folly; they are troubled and grieved as if they had loſt their God and Saviour in loſing that which they had not loſt, if they would but have uſed it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and thankfully, as coming from God, and leading to him. But woe, and reſtleſs trouble, and anguiſh for ever more, muſt, and will be their portion; whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſperity can invite, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity drive to Reſt in God: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They who believe with ſuch a Faith in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> as works by Love, the Love of God above all, as their perfect eternal Reſt and happineſs, their All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſhield here, and exceeding great reward hereafter, they alone do enter God's Reſt; Here by Faith Hope and Love, hereafter by full immediate, inſeparable ſight and fruition: Here they enter God's
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154187:36"/>
Reſt <hi>inchoitivè,</hi> by having a Title to it, as adopted Sons and Heirs of God through Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true, though imperfect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or foreſight of it, through Faith in Gods word and the merits of Chriſt. Now this is a bleſſed Reſt to the Soul, compared with that miſerable toile and drudgery, fears and troubles, which all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and diſobedient wicked Perſons lie under, how proſperous ſoever their outward condition in this World ſeems. The Reſt of a Traveller, is far ſhort of one that is come to his Country and Home, and yet it is a true Reſt, compared with one that wanders through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, boggs and precipices into ruine.</p>
            <p>He that now knows he is in the right way to his final Reſt, his Fathers Houſe, where he ſhall be ſure of a glorious inheritance, and ſatisfactory eternal peace and joy, that through the way he goes alſo, he ſhall be directed in all turnings, protected
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154187:36"/>
from all dangers, refreſhed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved at every Stage; with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent food and comfortable Reſt; this Mans heart is calm and quiet from thoſe anxieties, which the other ſuffers; and though he muſt look to his way as he goes, be thrifty and temperate in his Inn; and Travel forward with watchful dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and painful induſtry, yet his labours and cares have the Reſt of Hope, and chearful expectance; and as he draws nearer his Country and home, ſo his Reſt and joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.</p>
            <p>This is the Reſt of holy Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers towards Heaven, their Country, their God and Father: To which Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.28. Invites the weary and heavy laden, and into which, when they come unto him, they enter by Faith; if ſuch a Faith as takes up his Yoke, and wears his burthen with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and lowlineſs, as eaſy and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Faith laies hold on the merits
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154187:37"/>
of Chriſt, and reſts on him that takes away the ſins of the World; by the propitiation of his obedience, for Pardon and Peace, as knowing nothing elſe can procure it but that. That moſt certainly and fully ſhall procure it for all that come unto God by him, for mercy and grace. God was in Chriſt, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 21. Reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes to them; for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin; that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him. He might have declared his mercy to us ſome other way, but this was the only beſt way to declare his Righteouſneſs as well as Mercy, that he might be juſt as well as gracious, in juſtifying the ſinner, and puniſhing the ſin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being juſtifyed by Faith, we enter into Gods Reſt, having Peace with God through Chriſt <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He that relies his

weary Soul on this Rock and ſure foundation, ſhall never be aſhamed of his Hope, if he rely with ſuch a Faith and Hope on it, as accepts of the Yoke, as well as the Reſt; but ſhall by degrees, as he grows in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, find the Reſt of his Soul increaſed and aſſured unto him more and more, till he attain that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that fulneſs of Peace and Joy in believing, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect, 'tis God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? 'Tis Chriſt that died, or rather is riſen again to God's right hand, and there makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us. As for afflictions that often may and do follow this Reſt of Faith for juſtification; St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews in the next words that they rather confirm and ratifie the pardon, than queſtion or leſſen it; through that experience of Gods wiſe and faithful love, in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154187:38"/>
making all things work together for good, to thoſe that love him above all: Who ſhall ſeperate us from the love of God in Chriſt? ſhall Tribulation or Diſtreſs, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution or Nakedneſs; Famin or Sword? in all theſe we are more than Conquerors through him that loved us. If weak Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt with faithful deſires; and reſolutions to weare his Yoke, and bear his Burthen, meekly and humbly, find not this Reſt of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with ſuch a degree of Peace and Joy, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth, 'tis not becauſe Chriſt giveth them not what he promiſeth; but becauſe he giveth it them gradually, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are able and fit, by their Faith to receive it; for he ſaith to every Soul now, as to them in St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.24. Be it unto you, according to your Faith, if your Faith be ſtrong, and lively; both in believing my promiſe and merit, and in undertaking that Yoke of

            <p>Bleſſed is he that ſtayeth and waiteth with humble Prayer Gods leiſure; ſince he hath promiſed who cannot fail, that he will not break the bruiſed Reed, but give in time the Garment of joy, for the Spirit of heavineſs: and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15, 16. <hi>I will dwell with the contrite humble Spirit to revive it, for I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wrath, leſt the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made.</hi> Thus you have ſeen the firſt Reſt which true believers enter into even here in this life, the Reſt of Pardon, and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their Repentance and Faith in Chriſt. The ſecond, is a Reſt from the Tyrannous reign of ſin, by thoſe Motives of Hope and Fear, Love and Gratitude; which faith propoundeth from Chriſts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154187:39"/>
Goſpel and the Spirit of grace; holineſs and comfort, which faith procureth by earneſt Prayer. Now this is ſo neceſſarily joyned with the other, the Reſt of Pardon, that 'tis its ordinary ſtanding evidence, and the means to obtain it more and more. For we may not come to Chriſt for Pardon, to give us the Reſt of juſtification from ſins guilt, and condemning power, by his Blood, unleſs we ſo value that pardon and its price, as ſincerely to hate, and be heartily willing to forſake that ſin, which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and holy juſtice of God could not, or would not remit or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but at ſuch a price as his own eternal infinite Sons humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to, and in that humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which had offended. We muſt feel as well the burthen of ſins loathſom filth and hateful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, as well as that of its guilt and puniſhment, before we are thoſe weary and laden, thoſe poor and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154187:39"/>
humble ones in Spirit, who have a Title to rely on Chriſt for Reſt from both; but to thoſe who ſo come unto him, our gracous Lord never denies what he invites to, Reſt from the ſlaviſh ſervice of ſin, as well as from its intolerable guilt and condemnation: His blood and ſpirit are never ſever'd; where-ever the one is actually imputed to juſtification, the other is always imparted alſo to ſanctification, and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſht, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God:</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2.9. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath ſet me free from the Law of ſin and death. But if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is as yet none of his,</hi> though he may be his by repentance and faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:154187:40"/>And indeed this Reſt from ſins dominion, you will eaſily ſee to be a neceſſary, and great part of the Souls happineſs in this life, if you will but conſider the burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome drudgery, that wicked Men lie under until they obtain it, and enter into it by ſuch a faith in Chriſt Jeſus, as works by obedience. For every perſon living in any courſe of impiety, unrighteouſneſs, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, is a ſelf-accuſing, ſelf-condemning, divided creature, a terror and ſhame unto himſelf.</p>
            <p>He cannot chooſe but wiſh and deſire eternal Reſt, yet is cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily drawn by his luſts and paſſions, to do that which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leads to eternal anxiety and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. His reaſon invites him to that good which is Spiritual, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, infinite, and therefore a ſatisfactory Reſt to his Soul; to the only God who made him at firſt, and who alone can make him happy. But his luſt and paſſions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:154187:40"/>
draw him away to that which is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh. Not only finite and fading, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing him, but filthy and baſe, and ſo diſtracting and vexing his Soul with foul diſorder and guilty ſhame. His Spirits and conſcience often tells him, that he ought to maintain an humble holy communion with God, by Faith and Hope and Love, Prayers and Praiſes; that ſo he may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee him in that immediate clear revelation of his glory; but his luſts and paſſions, ſo burthen and oppreſs him, that he cannot lift up his heart to God, nor draw near his holy preſence with any delight, but ſtudies to ſhun him, and live without the remembrance of his goodneſs and mercies; that he may forget his power and juſtice. To behold the Creator in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and love the giver in his gifts, to contemplate his power wiſdom and goodneſs, ſhining in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:154187:41"/>
his word and works; to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his paſt benefits, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in his preſent favour, and panting after his bleſſed preſence to all eternity; to fit himſelf for that preſence, by purifying himſelf, as he is pure; by being righteous holy and merciful, as he is; to govern himſelf and thoſe that are under him, in ſuch order as God preſcribes; this is the Reſt as well as the Labour of rational Souls in this life, a pleaſure and honour as well as a taske. But ſin is ſuch a burthenous Tyrant and oppreſſor, that it makes the ſinner imploy his reaſon, made to ſerve, know, love and enjoy God: It makes him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy this reaſon in the drudgery of covetouſneſs, in the brutiſhneſs of luſts, and ſenſuality, in the devilliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of malice, envy, revenge, pride and ambition. His reaſon was given to ſtudy God and his Will, to pleaſe and delight in him here, that he may for ever ſee and enjoy him,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:154187:41"/>
with mutual complacency; to help others to do ſo by word and deed, and who is there that hath not quite unchriſtian'd and unman'd himſelf, but in ſober retirement, thinks this a work that hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it, and Reſt as well as La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? But ſin is ſuch a weariſom Tyrant and oppreſſor, that it makes the reaſonable immortal Soul, that heavenly breath, that Image of God, a ſneaking Pandor to his luſts; a drudging purveyor to his belly and appetite; a fawning diſſembling falſe hearted flatterer, to his pride and ambition; a ſlanderous ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, detractor and whiſperer to his envy; a brawling railing reviler to his wrath or anger; a bloody aſſaſſinate to his revenge; a griping extortioner, or theeviſh cheater to his covetouſneſs; a ſeducer and tempter, that is an aſſiſtant to Satan in ruining his own and other Mens Souls: And when all this is done, ſee what weariſom, reſtleſs toyle
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154187:42"/>
remains for the ſinner. He would live for ever in this World, but ſees he muſt die and be call'd to account; and ſeeing that, he would die for ever, and turn to nothing, but that he ſees he cannot neither. He would have Gods favour, but dares not come near him. He would live in peace and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with himſelf, but a civil War and contrary deſires, luſts and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, contrary each to one another, and all to reaſon, tear and divide him from himſelf. He would live at Reſt and Peace with other Men, but his covetouſneſs and pride makes him injurious, his wrath and revenge, his malice and envy makes him impatient, and quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave him of this Peace: He would be rich, but either his ſloth will not gather, or his luſts and vain glory ſcatters as faſt as his induſtry gets. He would live in ſafety and eaſe, but his haughty ambition, makes him endure labour and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154187:42"/>
day and night. He would be in honour and high repute, but his ſordid luſts and cowardly fears, griping covetouſneſs or wrathfull revenge, makes him hateful and contemptible. His pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition would command all Men, but it makes him firſt fawn and flatter, bow and cringe to thoſe whom he ſecretly hates and ſcorns. He would be true to his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and religion, not give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the lie, by profeſſing what he doth not believe; but his love of the World, and fear of poverty or of death, doth ſo diſturb the Reſt of his Soul, that he coucheth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every load, complies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms to any profeſſion of faith or worſhip, which thoſe who prevail would have him ſubſcribe to, till he lay down his faith, hope, and conſcience, at the feet of a Man, <hi>whoſe breath is in his noſtrils,</hi> who threatens and ſtrikes, and is no more. Thus he that ſerves is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154187:43"/>
indeed, oppreſt and tired with contrary Tyrants, croſſing and thwarting one another, till they wrack and tear the Man in pieces, and drag him to everlaſting trouble, anguiſh and ſorrow. How ſweet then and highly pretious is that Reſt, which faith in God through Jeſus Chriſt enters into, when under the light and worth of that truth, which it hath received, it guides and ſubdues all its appetites, affections and paſſions from a right principle by a right rule, to a right end; which is nothing but God and his word; God as its author governour and happineſs, or perfect Reſt? For though the Reſt be yet imperfect, becauſe the World the Fleſh and the Devil do yet oppoſe it; yet Chriſt hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that no oppoſition ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, unleſs we willfully and obſtinately <hi>grieve</hi> that Spirit of truth, holineſs and comfort, which was given us as the Seal of our faith
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154187:43"/>
and peace with God, the preſerver and finiſher of this Reſt, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of our preſent adoption, and future inheritance, if we will but wiſely and thankfully value that Reſt, into which we are enter'd, humbly and watchfully pray unto Chriſt to confirm and increaſe it; all oppoſitions ſhall prove advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, all dangers, travails and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſo many evidences of Gods faithfulneſs to us, and ours to him; of his being our all ſufficient ſhield and ſupporter here, our exceeding reward and ſatisfactory Reſt for evermore. Now ſee what a bleſſed Reſt there is in faith and holineſs, and all thoſe graces which wait on them. Faith in God gives the mind a <hi>Sabboth</hi> of Reſt, from all thoſe anxious perplexing enquiries, and ſelf contradicting reſolutions, which humane reaſon left to it ſelf is vexed with; and ſettles the heart on that divine Wiſdom and truth, which can neither deceive nor be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154187:44"/>
deceived, humbling at once the underſtanding and advancing it, becauſe it is its greateſt advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be humbled under God, who never fails to honour thoſe who honour him; and makes the conſcience ariſe and rejoyce, to ſee that it hath ſubmitted it ſelf to ſuch a guide. Take faith in its meaneſt Offices, of truſting God in our temporal affairs, reſigning our ſelves to his wiſdom, power and goodneſs, as one that can and will chuſe better for us, than we our ſelves; what peace and reſt is this to our Souls, from all thoſe ſervile fears and cares, thoſe baſe ſubmiſſions, and baſer oppreſſions, which the covetous worldling, or cowardly trembling unbeliever undergoes? Though the Waters <hi>rage</hi> and the Earth <hi>ſhake,</hi> yet he whoſe heart truſts in the Lord, that <hi>all things ſhall work together for good,</hi> he is the only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a ſquar'd Man, whom no change can make a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154187:44"/>
changeling, becauſe his heart ſtands faſt, and believes in the faithful God; he is gotten above this region of meteors, clouds and winds; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord is his ſun and ſhield, which no cloud can intercept, no wind ſhake. But then in the higher Offices of faith, whereby it conſiders and embraces the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truth of God, our Redeemer and Saviour, and ſees that they are as certainly true as gloriouſly great.</p>
            <p>That former ſins confeſſed and forſaken, are blotted out for the merits of Chriſt, the Law ſatisfied by ſuch a ſurety; Satans accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſilenced by ſuch an Advocat; That afflictions and death have loſt their ſting, and are turned into benefits. That he who hath begun a good work will alſo finiſh it, and never leave us in life and death, untill he hath brought us to perfect Reſt, and full happineſs both of ſoul and body; what fruit can this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154187:45"/>
produce but peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt, cheerful conſtancy and perſeverance in doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the will of God? It reſcues us from all thoſe trembling fears, and ſorrowful agonies, which elſe muſt ſeize upon our hearts, from the weakneſs of the fleſh and the ſtrength of our enemies, from the curſe of the Law, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of conſcience, from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ſubtilty of the World and the Devil. How well then might St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay <hi>we that believe enter Gods Reſt;</hi> do already, in good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; ſhall compleatly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably, if we perſevere. <hi>Hope,</hi> the ſecond Chriſtian grace, is ſo near of kin to <hi>Faith,</hi> that 'tis lineally derived from it, and born of it; nor can that heart but find a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable bleſſed Reſt, which hopes in the fountain of all bleſſedneſs, hopes to ſee and enjoy him for ever; and in that hope purifies himſelf: All other hopes are dead or dying,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:154187:45"/>
ſure to leave him void of Reſt, full of anxiety that builds on them. This is the only <hi>lively hope</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls it; becauſe placed in the fountain of life and joy it ſelf: This is that grace which applies to our ſelves the general promiſes, the Souls Anchor, which makes it ride ſafe and triumphant in the midſt of tempeſts here below, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it enters within the vail of Heaven it ſelf, and takes poſſeſſion before hand of all its treaſures, and by its joyful expectations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes that <hi>helmet</hi> in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which guards the head againſt all blows of the World or Devil; wherefore he bids us <hi>rejoyce in hope, be patient and cheerful in tribulation, inſtant in Prayer,</hi> and tells us, <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.11. That this is that <hi>which ſtrengthens the heart with all might, to all patience, and long ſuffering with joyfulneſs.</hi> It is indeed the anticipation of Heaven on Earth, and makes the Reſt of that World, our portion in this. As
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154187:46"/>
for <hi>Charity</hi> the third grace, the Image and tranſcript of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who is goodneſs and love; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than either, or <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> is holy <hi>charity;</hi> greater than they for Reſt and joy as well as uſe, becauſe the very fruit and end, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and perfection of both. Can there be any more bleſſed Reſt, or ſatisfaction in this life, than the love of him, who is infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, whoſe glorious perfections raviſh the Angels, into an extaſy and admiration of endleſs felicity? what ever we do or can love elſe, we can neither be ſure to enjoy it long, nor if we could, would it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, but cloy or tire, and leave us empty and diſcontented: But to love God, is to Reſt in him: Nor can any thing tire or finiſh, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or diſappoint the Reſt and peace, and joy of that love which is fixed on him, who is the eternal boundleſs good: This is Godlineſs, this is Holineſs, to love God in all,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154187:46"/>
and above all what we love beſides, and 'tis our happineſs as well as holineſs, that which gives reaſon its throne, and proper dignity, above all thoſe blind, violent luſts and paſſions within, or temptations without, which keep a Man from poſſeſſing himſelf with any freedom or ſolid peace; nor can a Man be firmly united to himſelf, but by being united unto God: When once the Soul loves God ſincerely, and conſtantly above all; and hath reſign'd its will to his, it hath its Reſt; whether the world ſmile or frown, nothing can come amiſs to it, come what will it cannot deſtroy its Reſt in God. As is the Object or main end on which the Soul of Man fixes as its happineſs; ſo is the Soul for its condition, quiet or reſtleſs, conſtant or wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, diſcontented or ſatisfied: He that parſues earthly things as his main end, becomes vain, unſtable, unſatisfied and perplexed, led up
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154187:47"/>
and down by the fooliſh fire of ſence or phancy, changing as they and the World change, diſquieted with that vexation, and vanity which they find abroad, and that ſedition they find at home, 'twixt reaſon and unreaſonable luſts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and paſſions. But he that reſts and centers himſelf on God through Chriſt, on that one end, and ſovereign good, in that way which he hath appointed, which is indeed but himſelf, become a ſuitable way to that end he hath choſen; that which will unite and reconcile him, not only to himſelf in all his faculties, deſires, and actions or pretenſions; but to all the various, providential diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in this World, which ſeem ſo intricate, perplext, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fleſh and blood; wherefore they that by faith have entred into the love of God above all, muſt neceſſarily have entred into Reſt, in the ſame degree in which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:154187:47"/>
it is evident to themſelves, that they have done ſo: And then the Charity which flows from the love of God above all, on his Image or Proxy or Neighbour, our Brother, our fellow Chriſtian; is their any thing beſides that principle, from which it flows more full of Reſt, Peace and Joy, than to love and promote his virtue and happineſs, to love that nature which Chriſt aſſumed and died for; to love the Image of God in Man, which is to love God himſelf by reflection and conſequence, and ſo indeed to love our ſelves, increaſe and ſecure our own happineſs? It is the voice of all Mankind not quite degenerated to beaſt; That Friendſhip and Charity is the ſweeteſt delight of this life, next to that in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>That <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> to be hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and hating one another, is one of the greateſt, odiouſeſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, the very Image of Hell it
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154187:48"/>
ſelf, where there is nothing but hatred and curſing; whereas of Heaven we underſtand little more, than that the bleſſed inhabitants of it love God above all, and one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as themſelves; nor can their happineſs fail or abate, becauſe their Charity or Love cannot. <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> the fruits of this Charity, makes a Man Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, in doing good to thoſe that are, or may be his; in reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the Devils malice and wicked Men, by ſeaſonable relief of their Soul and Body, and is ſo pleaſant, ſo joyfull a duty, that it renders the giver more reſt and delight, than the needy receiver, and returns with uſury at the preſent into his boſom, by the comfortable evidence of his own ſincerity, and ſo of his intereſt in many promiſes; both of ſecuring his temporal welfare, and increaſing his eternal. Love towards Men, eſpecially Chriſtians, for Chriſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154187:48"/>
ſake, melting our hearts, and opening our hands, with cheerful joy to relieve their wants, free's our Souls from the chilling cold of unmerciful covetouſneſs, which gripes it ſelf as well as others; gives us reſt from the Canker of envy, and fretful malice, which makes us take delight and content in another Mans graces, welfare and happineſs, as part of our own; gives us Reſt from the rack and fire of rage and revenge, gives us the peace and honour, of conquering evil with good, and then makes us rejoyce again, that this is our plea for Gods mercy towards our ſelves: And who then would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe or neglect the Reſt of Charity? <hi>Humility</hi> is another grace, which beſides the Calm and Reſt of Soul, which Chriſt hath peculiarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to it, hath ſuch an attractive, controlling lovelineſs, that 'tis the rival of Heaven and Earth. God himſelf that inhabits eternity,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154187:49"/>
               <hi>dwells with the humble;</hi> (as the God of Peace brings Reſt and Peace wherever he dwells) and what wiſe or good Man, loves not to dwell with ſuch alſo? So true is that of <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.19. <hi>'Tis better to be of an humble Spirit, than to divide the ſpoil with the proud.</hi> How reſtleſs is pride in all its deſigns, and haughty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits? How diſcontented with God and Man if it miſs of them? And if it attain them, how full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and ſcornful diſdain, of fears and jealouſies on the one ſide, of tumors and ſwellings, of endleſs ambition on the other? But the humble perſon enjoys the Reſt of thankful contentment in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thinks himſelf <hi>leſs than the leaſt of Gods mercies,</hi> had rather by farr obey than rule; and if he receive contempt or injuries, is not diſturbed with wrath or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but ſits down in humble ſilence, as fearing he may have ſome ways deſerved it. Great is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:154187:49"/>
the Reſt which <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> brings to the Soul of Man: <hi>Meekneſs</hi> is the ornament of a quiet Spirit, very pretious in Gods ſight, and therefore ought to be ſo in ours. I appeal to the reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any Man, whether it be not reſt and eaſe, to forgive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury rather than be provoked to revenge; and to lay aſide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of other Mens malice, envy and peeviſhneſs, rather than imitate it, and ſuffer the vexing remembrance of it, to boil and ferment in our watchful minds, until it hath conquered, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd us into the ſame troubleſom evil? Is it not Peace, and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reſt to ſit ſtill, and lift up no hands, but thoſe of Charity, and Charitable prayer, rather than labour in fighting and wounding one another? To hold ones peace, than to rail and revile? Which hath more Reſt in it, to ſtudy to be quiet, and do ones own buſineſs,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:154187:50"/>
or to be prying and intermedling with other Mens office, faults or ſecrets? To ſpeak evil of no Man, or to be always finding fault, and ſpeaking the worſt we can of any, who differ from us in any reſpect? Which is the greateſt trouble and burthen, meekly to obey our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Governours, in Church and State, where God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the contrary; or be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſputing againſt a few harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs indifferent ceremonies, untill we have quarre'ld our ſelves, and others into a cauſeleſs ſcandalous, pernitious ſeparation? Then for humble contented <hi>patience,</hi> that precept of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> but wiſdom and myſtery of the <hi>New: Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> but be content <hi>patiently</hi> with thy own portion; what is it but a Reſt rather than burthen, a purchaſe or priviledge, rather than duty when once learnt? Let the Carnal or Worldly Man, with his bored tub of inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:154187:50"/>
cry as the Horſeleach; <hi>give, give</hi> and ſeek after wealth as he ſhould after God, without bounds: Yet the Heathen Philoſopher could reſolve it the only way to true Reſt, not to ſeek to <hi>raiſe</hi> our fortunes to our deſires, but to <hi>bring down</hi> our deſires to our fortunes and preſent condition: The one is not onely uncertain, becauſe not in any Mans power, but impoſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his deſires increaſe with his purchaſes, as fire with fewel; whereas the other is poſſible, and certain.

deſpiſed) find no Reſt within ſome hours: And what compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the reſt, ſafety, health and honour, of either virginal or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal chaſtity, which keeps the deſires of the fleſh, under the power of reaſon and faith, lives in the hope of ſeeing God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the bond of love in Families inviolated, and the unclean ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exceſſes of wandring luſt, which are conceived with fear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety, brought forth and finiſht with ſhame and ſorrow; begin in diſorder of Soul and Body, end in loathing; begin in trouble, end in worſe; burn at firſt and conſume at laſt the peace of the mind, if not the health of the Body alſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the confuſions, tumults, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels it breeds in Families, and all for the ſneaking brutiſh delight of a few minutes?</p>
            <p>There is indeed one grace, which ſeems to have little Reſt in it: The <hi>ſuffering perſecutions to death,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:154187:52"/>
rather than diſown the Truth, or violate duty: But God hath made ſo many promiſes to mitigate, and temper all temptations to the ſtrength, which we either now have, or ſhall receive upon our prayers, of his turning to good, whatſoever ſeems moſt evil: And of his rewarding our courage and patience with ſo much the greater weight of glory, that theſe promiſes being believed, we are enabled as well as obliged not only to be contented but joyful alſo in tribulations for truth and righteouſneſs ſake; and therefore no wonder, if ſuffering miſeries for the honour of God, and our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for the furtherance of our own ſalvation and other Mens, hath more reſt than trouble in it; without this Reſt, a flow of all other good things, which this world can give, will leave a Man but a miſerable wearied Traveller, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a heavy load and burthen of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154187:52"/>
diſcontents and ſorrows; and with this Reſt, all labour and ſorrow is inconſiſtent, and though we may not expect to have this promiſed eternal Reſt, endleſs felicity as our deſerved wages, yet we may and ought to hope for it, as our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reward. Angels — and Saints departed this life, they have it allready, the Devils and damned are paſt all Hope. Great pains and labour do the Men of this World take, but not in order to this Reſt, and therefore a Multitude of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ſinners, lay out the chief of their days and time, in purſuance of pleaſures, and honours, and profits of this World, as if Heaven and Salvation were eaſy atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if they might with a wiſh only at the laſt, come to die the <hi>death of the righteous,</hi> who had ſo notoriouſly lived the <hi>life of the wicked.</hi> 'Tis not only the doing of evil, but the not doing of good, which ſhall be puniſhed at the laſt

The way to Heaven is narrow, the Gate ſtraight, it muſt be ſtriving that gives us entrance; not only the hopes of Heaven but the eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Hell, makes it our duty to be doing of good, and by ſo doing, we expreſs our fear, <hi>leſt a promiſe of Reſt being left, any of us ſhould ſeem to fall ſhort of it.

What can the eloquence of Man add to it, or what better aſſurance can be deſired, than the gratious promiſe of ſo powerful, ſo faithful a Lord? Or what greater reward can any hope to receive, than that which the Author and diſpenſer of all good aſſures us, by letting us know what ever we do to the poor and needy, he will interpret it as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:154187:54"/>
done to himſelf and ſo reward our labour of love as to Crown it with eternal Reſt; an inheritance of that Kingdom, and all its joys, as well as honours which fade not away? But we muſt not underſtand this award of eternal life, this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inheritance, to be the reward of the righteous, for the merit of their good works, as everlaſting fire is to the wicked for their demerits; what ever the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, from thoſe words of our Saviour in the forenamed 25th of St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 
               <q>The particle <hi>for</hi> (ſay they) is as truly cauſal by way of merit and efficiency in the one as in the other; the form of Speech in both ſentences the ſame: <hi>Depart ye curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire. For I was hungry and ye gave me no meat. Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inherit the Kingdom, for I was hungry and ye fed me.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:154187:54"/>In anſwer to this, 'tis clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that though the particle, <hi>for,</hi> be granted to ſignifie cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in both ſentences, yet need it not ſignifie the ſame kind, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of cauſality in both; and if it need not, then it muſt not, unleſs they reſolve to contradict many other plain Scriptures, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than depart from their own vain, and proud conceit of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven in ſtrict juſtice: For firſt, The word or particle <hi>for,</hi> may ſignifie only the cauſe of our, or others knowledge, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is their inheritance by true title of gracious promiſe, or the Covenant of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt Jeſus, which accepts and rewards repentance, and faith, working by love, whereof theſe works of Charity, are the fruits and ſigns. For every Authentick Declaration, or Revelation of any truth, before unknown, is the true cauſe of our knowledge of it, though
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154187:55"/>
not of the real truth which is ſo known: Now among ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt and call him <hi>Lord,</hi> 'tis hidden to us, who are the true heirs of the Heavenly Kingdom, and who not, untill at the day of final judgment, when all Men ſhall be judged by their works. The firſt infallible certain knowledge which ſhall be had of this difference, is from the declarative ſentence of that infallible righteous Judge, who hath declared he will proceed, with one, and the other, according to their ſeveral works, when all muſt appear before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that <hi>every one may receive the things done in the Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. The ones performance of good works, declared and teſtified by the Judge, ſhall be the true cauſe by which Men and Angels ſhall know them to be the heirs of that Heavenly Kingdom, which here they ſought
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:154187:55"/>
and longed after, with faithful deſires, and endeavours, ſuch as prepared and fitted themſelves for it. The others omiſſion of good works, teſtified by the ſame Judge, ſhall be the true cauſe by which we ſhall know them to be utterly unworthy of Gods everlaſting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and mercy, moſt worthy of death eternal. We ſhall then truly know, that the one are Crowned (as ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) according to Gods <hi>grace,</hi> which graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of faithful ſincerity in ſtead of ſtrict legal perfection; and that the other are condemned according to <hi>juſtice,</hi> becauſe they neither ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the law, nor embraced the Goſpel, upon its gracious terms and conditions. That the ones omiſſion of good works, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of evil ones, is the true meritorious cauſe of their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And that the others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of good works, at leaſt in faithful reſolution, and that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154187:56"/>
hearty inward faith, hope, and love, which would have produced them, if time and ſpace had been granted, is the teſtimony or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that they are the Sons of God, heirs of everlaſting life, though not the meritorious cauſe of their Salvation and life eternal.</p>
            <p>We commonly come to know the cauſe by the effect: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this word, <hi>for,</hi> may, and doth often point out, not the cauſe of the thing it ſelf, but the effect, and our knowledge of the cauſe by it. <hi>That's the Major,</hi> 'tis commonly ſaid, <hi>for the Mace is borne before him:</hi> Let no Man think, that the bearing of the Mace before him, is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his being <hi>Major</hi> (his <hi>lawful Election</hi> was the cauſe of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joralty,</hi> and his Majoralty the cauſe of the Mace being carried, or borne before him) but the bearing the Mace before him, is the true cauſe of many Mens knowing him to be the Major. And this anſwer to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154187:56"/>
the queſtion, may ſerve with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter probability, than ought our adverſaries bring for themſelves. But with more clearneſs and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reaſon, agreeing with the Analogy of Faith, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Scripture, I anſwer, That the particle <hi>for</hi> implys a cauſality in both the ſentences, but in one, that of the wicked, the ſtrict meritorious ſole cauſe of their condemnation; whereas in the Godly, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Perſons, the heirs of Heaven, the <hi>for</hi> implys ſuch a cauſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence as that which they call <hi>conditio</hi> or <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> good works, or that faith working by love of God and Man, whence they ſpring, and the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, without which no Man ſhall inherit the Kingdom; yea the neceſſary qualifications, without which he hath not only no worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but no capacity, no fitneſs to prepare himſelf for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe happineſs is to ſee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:154187:57"/>
God, with mutual complacency. And no Man can ſo ſee the holy, merciful, gracious God, the God of Love, and Father of Mercies, the faithful, righteous, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fountain, of all that is pure loving or lovely, unleſs he be like him, and bear the Image of thoſe his perfections, though imperfectly as to degrees, yet impartially and ſincerely as the tranſcript and reſemblance of that Wiſdom which comes from above, firſt pure, then peaceable. Unleſs his religion be that <hi>undefiled one before God,</hi> which <hi>viſits the Fatherleſs and the Widow in affliction,</hi> and keeps himſelf <hi>vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the World.</hi> Theſe and the like graces, with their fruits (if time be granted to bring them forth) are not only deſcribed and required, clearly and frequently in holy Scripture, as the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, without which no Man ſhall, but as the neceſſary qualifications, without which no Man can ſee the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:154187:57"/>
Lord, with holy eternal love and joy. And therefore no doubt the <hi>for</hi> hath a rational inference in it, as to the acceptance, and reward of the godly, and righteous perſon. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you: for I was hungry, and ye fed me,</hi> &amp;c. For ye have perform'd the conditions, which I in my Goſpel (or gracious covenant) required of you, with promiſe to accept and reward them; for ye are qualified with thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and holy diſpoſitions, which are my own Image and likeneſs, the impreſs of my holy Spirit, which renders you capable of enjoying me and my Father with endleſs delight; which makes you (though not in ſtrict juſtice worthy of my Heavenly Kingdom) yet in my gracious mercy and bounty, and through my merits, not utterly unworthy, that is, not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to inherit it; for theſe all have confeſt, and forſaken their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154187:58"/>
evil ways, fled with penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving hearts, to that propitiation which God had ſet forth in his only Son through faith in his blood: By doing ſo they have received that holy Spirit, by whoſe direction and aſſiſtance, they have <hi>mortified the fleſh, with its luſts and affections, conquered the World with its tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, reſiſted the Devil, and quenched the fiery darts of the wicked, fought the good fight of faith, till they finiſhed their courſe;</hi> and though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſin and the fleſh, abide luſting and ſtrugling againſt the Spirit, yet no ſin hath reigned over them, and the very remainders of ſin, they have bewailed, watcht over, and reſiſted, betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſts interceſſion for their pardon; therefore they are heirs of the Kingdom through the merits of Chriſt imparted to them, whereby they are entituled to it, as the meritorious cauſe on his part, whereby they have an actual plea,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:154187:58"/>
title and intereſt in Chriſts merit, as the condition and qualification on their part. And thus the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and eternal Reſt is theirs, though not by right of juſtice or merit, but by right of gracious promiſe. And may not all this be thought ſufficient to juſtifie the truth of the <hi>for,</hi> or cauſal particle, unleſs it be granted that it ſignifie meritoriouſly in ſtrict juſtice on their part, as ſtrictly and fully as in the other, <hi>Depart ye curſed; for</hi> ye did no good works, but many ill ones, without repentance and reformation, without faith and love to me? The goodneſs, and juſtice of Gods Majeſty will not ſuffer him to ſentence any Man to any puniſhment, much leſs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal intolerable ſorrow and pain, unleſs it hath been ſtrictly and fully deſerved, or demerited. But the goodneſs and bounty and mercy of God, may without wrong to any perfection, or attribute of his,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154187:59"/>
accept and reward any Man, that is not utterly incapable of it, but in ſome ſincere degree qualified for it, with ſuch an abundant meaſure of happineſs as he thinks fit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no ways merited by him. The Lord Jeſus hath ſatisfied his Fathers juſtice and honour, in his Government, and holy Laws, and made it a righteous thing with him, to ſave the penitent ſinner, upon condition of reformation and holy obedience: They that are ſaved have performed theſe conditions; and therefore they are admitted with a <hi>for. Come ye bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. For <hi>I was hungry.</hi> If a gracious Prince, of his own free goodneſs, proclaim a general merciful pardon, to all Rebels, Traytors, and Theeves, provided they will by ſuch a day acknowledge their fault, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and reſolve to do ſo no more, and make their peace with their Neighbours, whom they have wronged: Suppoſe, all accept the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154187:59"/>
pardon in outward ſhew, but ſome of them ſecretly practice the ſame wickedneſs againſt their Sovereign, and their Neighbours, when as the others perform faithfully the conditions of their pardon: If at the General Aſſizes, the Judge upon notice of their demeanours, ſhould ſay to the one, <hi>I reſtore you to your former condition, ſtate and dignity; for</hi> (or becauſe) <hi>ſince your pardon proclaimed, ye have ſo demeaned your ſelves, as penitent, loyal, faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi> And to the other, <hi>You I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn to death and torments; for</hi> (or becauſe) <hi>ye have abuſed your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns clemency:</hi> No Man of ſober reaſon, or common ſence (I think) can deny, that either the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the one, were entirely to be aſcribed to their own willful choiſe, and vile miſdemeanours, as due in juſtice to their demerits; or that the reſtoring or ſaving the other, were to be attributed, not to the merit of their demeanour,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154187:60"/>
but to the Kings gracious mercy, and bountiful favour. Their good demeanour, could be at moſt but the neceſſary condition or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their pardon or reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which, it could not conſiſt with the wiſdom or honour of the Prince, his Laws, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo to uſe them; with which, it might well conſiſt with his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and honour ſo to do, and that with advantage to the glory of his mercy, without diſparagement to his Juſtice, eſpecially in caſe his Juſtice and honour, had been ſatisfied for their former miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, by the merits and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Prince, his Royal Son: Now juſt ſo it is in this caſe of which we now ſpeak. They whom our Lord calls here to eternal life, and that with a <hi>for: For ye have fed, clothed, lodged me;</hi> are ſo far from this proud conceit of <hi>Romiſh</hi> merit by their works, that they are ready to diſclaim them, as nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154187:60"/>
of ſuch acceptance, ready to blame their ſluggiſh backwardneſs. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>when ſaw we thee hungry, thirſty, naked, or a ſtranger, or priſoner, and relieved thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it amiſs what is obſerved and acknowledg'd by <hi>Janſenius,</hi> (though a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> and too far engaged in this error) what Saint <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> had long ſince obſerved before him; that our Saviour ſaith to thoſe on his right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> but to thoſe on his left hand, he ſaith only, <hi>depart ye curſed,</hi> but adds not, Of my Father; implying that God the Father is the Author and gracious donor of life everlaſting, but every Man that doth wickedly, and dies in his wickedneſs without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is the only Author and cauſe of his own accurſed eſtate: The one are bleſſed freely, and mercifully by God the Father, for his Son Chriſts ſake, in whom alone he is well pleaſed with all
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:154187:61"/>
that come by him, with ſuch a faith as works by love: But the other are accurſed moſt juſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought not, or refuſed when it was offer'd them, that grace and mercy which would have bleſſed them, firſt with grace to do good works, then with glory, a ſuperabundant weight of glory for doing them: And this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to that of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> the laſt: <hi>For the wages of ſin is death, but the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or <hi>gift of God, is eternal life.</hi> Again the ſame <hi>Janfenius</hi> alſo obſerves, That our Saviour in the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, doth not ſay, <hi>depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for you,</hi> but <hi>for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the ſentence of the righteous, it runs thus: <hi>Come ye bleſſed inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi> By this, ſaith he, it is implied, That the Salvation of the righteous, muſt be aſcribed to the mercy of God, who hath prepared the Kingdom,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:154187:61"/>
and the damnation of the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not to God, but to their own iniquity. How this will conſiſt with his, and his Mother <hi>Romes</hi> proud Tenent of meriting Heaven, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee; nor is it much material to ſee, ſave only that this may be ſeen thereby, That Wiſdom and Truth is often juſtified, not only by her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but by her enemies; forced by that light ſometimes to own, what by their prejudices they ſtudy and labour to deny. Such was alſo that final extorted confeſſion of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himſelf, after all his diſputes againſt the truth. <hi>Tutiſſimum eſt in ſolâ, Dei miſericordiâ totam fiduciam reponere,</hi> but that more common, and owned ſaying of all their Schools and Divines, <hi>Fundamentum meriti non cadit ſub merito, The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of merits, (or the firſt grace by which Man is firſt juſtified) cannot be merited;</hi> and although granting this, yet they earneſtly contend, that by the good uſe of this firſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154187:62"/>
grace, life eternal is properly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but they ſay it, without, and againſt Scripture and reaſon.</p>
            <p>For reaſon tells us, whatſoever any Man hath intereſt in, by mercy and grace, and gracious promiſe, it muſt be expected, ſued for, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accepted, on the ſame terms that it is granted, or elſe it is forfeited. But not only the firſt grace, but all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace whatſoever, muſt be grace, and freely beſtowed not meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The preparations of this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom for us, and us for it, are the fruits of mercy. No Man can do well, unleſs he be firſt enabled by God to do ſo, and the more he is enabled by Gods gifts and graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, the more obliged he is to God. The leaſt increaſe of grace, given after the firſt uſe of grace, exceeds the meaſure of our ſervice and thankfulneſs, and that which creates new title of debt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, cannot poſſibly be any ground or title of merit from God, to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154187:62"/>
be adopted in Chriſt Jeſus, or made the Sons of God by grace, who were by nature the Children of wrath, ſtrangers and enemies, is a bleſſing, for which we become ſo deeply indebted, Servants to God our Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; that ſhould we do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more, and better than we do, we could not make the leaſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for that he hath done for us; and yet we cannot continue, to will or do well, but by the free undeſerved continuance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of that grace, and holy Spirit which firſt prevented us: Yet who is there, that doth all that good ſo well and conſtantly, as that Spirit did or would have enabled him?</p>
            <p>The manner of the Apoſtles queſtion <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Who hath firſt given to him?</hi> includes an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal denial; no Man hath, no Man can give any thing to him, and therefore none can receive any thing from him; none to be ſure,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154187:63"/>
that are not only his meer creatures, but ſinful creatures, can receive any thing from him, by way of merit, but of free mercy and bounty. If we view and ſcan the Tenor of all Gods promiſes made in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the firſt grace, to the increaſe and perſeverance, and final accompliſhment of them in glory, we ſhall find that he promiſeth only this, to be merciful and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful unto us, and if mercy and bounty be the compleat object of all his promiſes, then may we not expect their accompliſhment, as the merit of our ſervice, but as the fruit of his mercy and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If a loving earthly Father, ſhould give his Son a liberal penſion, before he could modeſty ask, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion expect it, and promiſe him alſo, that if he employed this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent years allowance well, he would allow him more liberally the next year; in this caſe, how well ſoever the Son uſed his preſent penſion,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154187:63"/>
yet ſeeing the profit is wholly his own, not his Fathers, the more bountifully his Father uſeth him the next year, the more ſtill he is obliged and bound unto him: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this good uſe of his Fathers bountiful allowance, were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and ſome kind of motive or reaſon, why, and on which, he was treated: A gracious and ingenious Son, would not challenge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third years penſion, as due to him, by right of merit, more than the firſt, although he had his Fathers promiſe, for theſe two years, which he had not for the firſt: For his Fathers promiſe was only to be good and bountiful unto him, ſo he would be dutifully thankful for his bounty: Now to expect and challenge that by right of merit, which was promiſed out of favour and loving kindneſs; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a condition of dutiful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, and faithful diligence, eſpecially if that demeanour, or

diligence came after former miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, and be not ſuch in all reſpects, as it ſhould be neither, is an high degree of unthankful, undutiful pride, eſpecially from a Son to a Father, a Son that was once a rebel and enemy. On our Heavenly Fathers part, no debt of doing us good can be laid; It was his meer free goodneſs, to give our firſt Parents ſuch being as once they had; having loſt that goodneſs wherein we were made, 'twas more than meer goodneſs, 'twas abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mercy, to make us any promiſe at all of reſtauration, to our loſt inheritance, the eternal life of his favour; and after this promiſe made, it is the continuance and increaſe of the ſame mercy, to adopt us, and to increaſe his grace upon us daily, and laſtly to Crown all this with an exceeding great reward, which is himſelf, the endleſs viſion of him, from whom we have all we enjoy here,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154187:64"/>
or hereafter. <hi>Non fuiſti &amp; factus es, Malus fuiſti, &amp; liberatus es, quid Deo dediſti?</hi> We may deſerve the diminution or withdrawing of Gods mercy, favours, and bleſſings, but we cannot merit, or deſerve their increaſe. Merit ſuppoſeth ſuch an inducement as may not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but ſuch as muſt oblige, and tie in ſtrict Juſtice; whereas no ſuch tie, or obligation, can be laid upon the fontal, original goodneſs, much leſs upon free mercy; which yet multiplies it ſelf to all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke not its withdrawing or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Methinks Men ſhould be afraid, of this proud opinion of their own merit; becauſe 'tis ſo like that of the <hi>Phariſee</hi>'s, when even that <hi>Publican,</hi> whom he condemned, will riſe up in judgment againſt them, <hi>for he went away juſtified, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the other. Luke</hi> 18.4. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> abſteined from many groſs ſins, and wanted not many good works, to alledge for himſelf. He gave

Tythes of all he had, faſted and prayed, and ſeemed alſo more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> for ought appears, for though he thought himſelf better than the <hi>Publican,</hi> yet he acknowledged both his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from ſinful works, and his perſeverance in good ones, to be from God. <hi>God I thank thee, for this,</hi> and <hi>for that;</hi> he ſaith not as they, <hi>God I thank thee, thou haſt given me the firſt grace, only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain me from ſuch ſins, as the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can walks in, whereas my proficiency, in doing of good? is from my own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious choice,</hi> but <hi>I thank thee for one and the other.</hi> Yet becauſe he ſo glories in Gods graces, as if they had not been received from free mercy, becauſe he is not truly humbled by that grace, which in words he confeſſeth to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God alone, therefore is he leſs juſtified than the <hi>Publican,</hi> for the uſe of all the graces, which God beſtows in this life, is to teach
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154187:65"/>
us true humility, not to glory in our ſelves, but in him, to whom all grace and glory belongs: And if we make not this uſe of it, if we ſay not with <hi>Jacob, Lord, I am leſs than the leaſt of thy mercies towards me:</hi> If when we have <hi>done juſtice,</hi> and <hi>loved mercy,</hi> we <hi>walk not humbly with our God,</hi> and ſay not as our Lord hath taught us, <hi>forgive us our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> we have been but <hi>unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervants</hi> in reſpect of what we might, and ſhould have been; we turn his grace into pride, and vain glory, and are worthy to loſe the acceptance and reward, which was promiſed for Chriſts merits, not ours, though not without ſincere performance of thoſe conditions, to which his mercy, and grace ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us. Our good works are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, a ſweet Sacrifice, but ſtill it is through Jeſus Chriſt. Better is it for us, to hear one Saint from Heaven, one of thoſe Spirits made perfect, than thouſands of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154187:66"/>

For what are all the Chairs, and Schools of Men on Earth, to the ſuffrage of Heaven, where not only one, but all the Saints, and perfected Spirits, <hi>caſt down their Crowns before him, that ſits on the Throne at the feet of the Lamb. Rev.</hi> 7.5. Saying aloud, <hi>To him that hath loved us, and waſht us from our ſins in his blood, and made us Kings, and Prieſts to God, and his Father, be glory, and power, for evermore?</hi> Thus have we ſeen, that 'tis not merit that will bring us to this promiſed eternal Reſt, and yet they that will attain to it, muſt imploy their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent well, they muſt come unto Chriſt, as Chriſt came unto us, by charity and by humility. To obtain this Reſt, will coſt ſome care and pains, and therefore we muſt expect it, but this care and pains will be highly rewarded, and therefore 'twill be our wiſdom to undergo it: The Men of this world
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154187:66"/>
are apt to think Chriſtianity, and coming to Chriſt a joyleſs thing, becauſe it ſpeaks ſo much of holy living, of preſenting our bodies a living Sacrifice, of mortifying and Sacrificing its luſts and affections, as if they were no longer to enjoy themſelves, who voluntarily deny themſelves in all theſe; but they are but falſe hearted Spies, that would bring this bad report upon a good land, for the <hi>mortifying the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> the <hi>preſenting our bodies a living Sacrifice,</hi> is not the deſtruction of our joys, but the increaſe of them, and gives aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of this eternal Reſt: For let the body be never ſo backward to be preſented unto God, and offer'd up in Sacrifice to him, though it ſhrinke at the ſight of the Altar, and tremble to ſee the Sacrificing Knife, yet are we not to hearken to its fooliſh tenderneſs; no cruelty like ſuch indulgence; the life and ſafety, and Reſt of the Soul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:154187:67"/>
upon this diſciplining, this mortifying the body: For he that mortifies and kills, and ſlayes his luſts, doth but Sacrifice that which would hurt, deſtroy, and ruine himſelf, 'tis but a carnal, worldly Man that is killed at moſt, nay 'tis but a beaſt, 'tis but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable appetite that is ſlain; reaſonable Man is ſaved alive, and made more reaſonable by ſo doing, and exalted thereby to a Spiritual life. He that leaves this beaſt alive, and is led by his unruly paſſions, is hurried even in this life, to more ſorrows, cares, and vexations, than any Saint or Martyr endures in his paſſage to Heaven, when he offers himſelf up unto God, by an holy life, and patient death: Therefore who ſo deſires in good earneſt, not to fail of this promiſed eternal Reſt, muſt crucify the <hi>whole body of ſin,</hi> muſt ſubdue and bring into ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton every <hi>vnruly member</hi> thereof. The luſtful, covetous, diſdainful
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154187:67"/>
evil Eye which hath made thee blind, or ill ſighted to all that is good, muſt be cloſed up and put out, and the charitable, peaceable, contented good Eye ſet open; and then God will one day raviſh that Eye, with Objects of eternal joy and Reſt and delight in Heaven. Our Ears muſt be cloſed up and deaf to all ungodly prophane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and unſavoury communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but open to all that is harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and good, ſober and wiſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or Chriſtian: If the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanton cruel Ear, that itches after falſeſhood and wrong be cut off, and the religious believing chaſt merciful Ear remain; then thou haſt made thine Ears, the gates of Heaven and Life and Reſt, for the Spirit of truth to enter in; being thus opened thou ſhalt hear the joys of Heaven ſounding in thy Ears, ſuch joys as God hath <hi>prepared for them that love him.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:154187:68"/>The Lips alſo muſt be cloſed, and the Tongue tied up from Oaths and Curſes, prophane alluſions to holy Scripture, bitter revilings, ſtrife and clamour, open ſlanders and ſecret detractions, but they muſt be opened, and the Tongue looſed to all holy duties, of Prayers and Prayſes towards God, wholſom counſel, admonition and inſtruction, towards Men. If the prophane ſeducing, contentious, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, bitter Tongue be tied up and ſilenced, and the wiſe, pure, and peaceable and faithful Tongue, be looſened and ſet on work, thou art no loſer by this change, becauſe thou haſt exchanged folly for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhame for honour, ſtrife for peace, the diſcord of infernal Spirits, for the muſick of Angels; thou haſt exchanged the Tongue of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, for the Tongue of a Prophet, or a Saint. Next, the hand muſt be withheld from violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, from theft and ſacriledge,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:154187:68"/>
fraud and deceit, but open to all the works of Piety and Charity. If the injurious griping, bloody hand be cut off, and the innocent holy pure hand be lifted up to God in Prayer, and ſtretcht out to Man in Charity; what haſt thou loſt, but the hand of a Murtherer, a Thief, an Uſurer, or Adulterer, and haſt for it, the holy hand of a Prieſt, the Royal hand of a Benefactor: Holy and acceptable unto God, pleaſing and beneficial unto Men? The feet alſo muſt be reſtrained from wandering into the ways of wickedneſs, where we meet with temptations and vanity, ſnares and dangers; they are to carry us from the ſeducing aſſemblies of Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the bloody Conſpiraces of Rebels, the riotous aſſemblies of gluttons and drunkards; they muſt be ready and forward, to go to the place, where <hi>Gods honour dwelleth,</hi> where his word and Sacraments are diſpenſed, to the houſe where
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154187:69"/>
the Widow and Fatherleſs inhabit. If the wicked perverſe ſinful foot be cut off, and the holy charitable foot be left thee, to carry thee to thy duty towards God and Man, what haſt thou loſt, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate walk of a wilderneſs, amongſt briers and thorns, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents the path of diſmal darkneſs, and death and error, where no Reſt is to be found: For that of truth, light, and life, and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Laſt of all, we muſt be ſure to keep the heart for God; that of all the reſt he chiefly expects, without which, the putting out of the Eye, the cutting off the hand, and ſetting a watch over our Tongue, and offering up our deareſt and only <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in obedience to Chriſts Command, will be thought but an Hypocritical mockery of God, who <hi>knows the heart</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mocked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Son give me thy heart, Prov.</hi> 20.26. That he asks, and that he will

have, and ſurely no Son will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that from his Father. The heart is the Throne of the great King, where he ſits and rules the whole Man; this is the moſt holy place of the Temple, where the Spirit of truth and holineſs inhabits, and therefore he that gives him not this, gives him nothing that he will accept, or that will make for our everlaſting Reſt. If the heart be firſt preſented, the reſt will and muſt follow, a wiſe and holy Tongue, a diligent and liberal hand, a watchful and attentive Ear, a wary foot, obedient ſober chaſt fleſh, will not ſtay behind, but will all conduce to the carrying us on in peace to this deſired Reſt. Every part and member of the body looks to be at Reſt and in perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in Heaven, and therefore every part muſt look to praiſe and glorify him on Earth; 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the Tongue be holy and chaſt, if the hand be covetous, nor

that the Ear be diligent and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at holy duties, if the Tongue ſpeak not, and the hand act not according to what the Ear heard. Every member muſt do its office, the head was made to know God, the heart to love him, the Tongue to praiſe him, the feet to follow him, wherefore withhold no part from him; remember he made the whole Man, and redeemed the whole, if any thing be withheld, no Reſt, no happineſs to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; 'tis in our choice whilſt we are here, what we will do, and which we will chuſe; whether to take part with Satan, whoſe work it is to deſtroy us, or come when Chriſt calls us to him, who will aſſuredly ſave us; one of theſe we muſt do, there's no neutrality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both; either we muſt be the <hi>Members of Chriſt the Children of God,</hi> and <hi>Heirs of Heaven,</hi> or elſe we muſt be the <hi>Children of Satan,</hi> and <hi>Heirs of intolerable endleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi>

Remember the dreadful miſery of their choice, who take hell for their portion, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that a ſhort delight here unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, will coſt a laſting ſorrow hereafter.

We chuſe hell and death, and the company of infernal Spirits, before Heaven and life, and the Society of Saints and Angels. If we refuſe to come now when Chriſt

calls us, at the laſt day he will refuſe to receive us. If we appear with <hi>hearts filled with iniquity,</hi> and <hi>hands full of blood,</hi> with <hi>feet that walked in the counſel of the ungodly, and ſtood in the way of ſinners,</hi> he will not know us for his Children, having loſt his Image, in which we were made, he will ſay unto us, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, I know ye not.</hi> But if we carry with us the reſemblance of our Maker, that Image and likeneſs of him which he once ſtamped upon us; if we can preſent him with a wiſe and pure heart, if we can lift up unto him holy hands, if we can ſee him with chaſte Eyes, and if our feet have <hi>walked in his Commandements and trod his Courts,</hi> if our feet have <hi>ſtood in thy Gates O Jeruſalem,</hi> then ſhall the Gates of Heaven open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, then our Heavenly Father will take us for his obedient Sons; ſuch as heard his voice, and ſuch as ſhall hear it again, when he will

ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the begining of the World, for I was hungry and ye fed me, in Priſon and ye viſited me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All the Sons of God from the firſt born, to the laſt, are all heirs to a Kingdom, all his invitations are to a Crown, his Sons are inheritors of thoſe joys which <hi>fade not away</hi> and of that Reſt which never ſhall have end. Whereas the ſinful Perſon's immoderate deſires of the things of this World, are but his torment, till he be ſatisfied, and then his ſatisfaction is his torment, becauſe there's no Reſt, nor quiet in it, and proves ſo much leſs than his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Thus is the reſtleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner always ſick, one while of too much, another while of too little, now of loving, then of loathing, now of want, then of ſatiety, for he never ceaſeth to want, till he ceaſe to deſire; and Man is always deſiring either the preſence of ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154187:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he cannot have, or the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſomthing he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, or elſe the continuance of ſomthing he cannot keep. Hence the ſinner appears to be as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. <hi>Like the troubled Sea when it cannot Reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and durt,</hi> The Winds within him, and the Waves and Tide without him, give him no Reſt, and when his delights are at the higheſt floud, they do bring him the ſad news of an approaching ebb. Ask but the unclean Adulterer, and let him tell you, what Reſt and Peace he finds in his vice; compare but his ſhort pleaſure, with the tormenting fire of his luſts, joyn'd with the <hi>worm</hi> of his guilty <hi>conſcience:</hi> Have but patience to look upon him in his naſty diſeaſes and rotten bones, his waſted fleſh, as well as eſtate; (for that is often the event, always the hazard) and he will have little to boaſt of, but will find himſelf
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154187:72"/>
really to endure more miſery in the way to eternal death, than many a holy chaſt Chriſtian finds to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Ask the Glutton or the Drunkard, whoſe higheſt thoughts are for the cloying, not ſatisfying their diſordered appetites; Ask if they find not themſelves uneaſy, when they conſider how ſhort and low their pleaſure is, compared with the irkſom diſeaſed ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſin. See how heavily the Ambitious proud perſon walks, between his eager deſires and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectations, under his falſe hopes, and true fears, and then judge whether his weariſom days, and reſtleſs nights, can bring him any true content. Should I inſtance in the idle Gallant, whoſe time like a burthen lies upon his hands, or in the contentious wrangler, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable brawler, the ſecret whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer, or the open detractor, I ſhould tire your patience ſooner than want a proof, that ſin is a weariſom

uneaſy heavy reſtleſs burthen, and that it is neceſſary by the way of virtue to come unto Chriſt for eaſe and Reſt. The Angel in <hi>Tobit,</hi> bids <hi>Tobias take out the gall of the fiſh, to cure his blindneſs;</hi> if we rip the bowels of worldly, ſinful luſts, and pleaſures, and take out the gall of them, that is to ſay, ſeriouſly look upon the bitterneſs they bring with them, and the gall and wormwood they leave behind them, it may prove a remedy of our Spiritual blindneſs; yet ſuch is our ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightedneſs, that we think we are at eaſe under our load, and at Reſt in our ſore Travel. Sin turns all things up ſide down, it ſets Earth above, and Heaven below: Reaſon at the footſtool, and brutiſh appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite on the Throne, and having thus lookt downward for our Reſt and happineſs, we are aſhamed to look Heaven in the face, and having loſt Heaven for Earth by ſin, we look downward ſtill, as fearing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154187:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Hell, which we have ſo well deſerved; and this is it which makes Men ſuffer all ſorts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, the Gout, the Stone, Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches, and all kind of Tortures, rather than die, becauſe ill led lives leave Men under anxious fears and ſad doubtings, what ſhall be their future ſtate. When <hi>Tamberlin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all Leprous perſons to be put to death, leſt they ſhould lead a miſerable life, the poor Lepers thought his mercy cruel, and would have endured more willingly two Leproſies than one death; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any great comfort they took in their lives, but becauſe they knew not what might follow after death. To loſe this life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſurance or hopeful probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a better, is doleful and bitter, but to loſe it with aſſurance from Gods own Mouth of a far worſe, of incurring an eternal death, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and pain without mitigation, this makes death deadly indeed,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154187:74"/>
when the ſinner muſt die again, for the ſin he dies in, when the firſt death leads to a ſecond; and when all the terrors, and ſorrows, and pains, of the firſt death, are but the evidences of more, or worſe to follow; when the fire that's now begun to be kindled, <hi>will burn down to the loweſt hell, Deut.</hi> 32.22. If we believe this in good earneſt, why do we not hate ſin, worſe than death? Becauſe ſin is the cauſe of all this; the cauſe of death and all that is deadly: It makes us liable to a dreadful account at the day of Judgment, and makes our whole life reſtleſs and uneaſy. This being ſo, how dare we trifle away one day or hour more of that term, or time of Trial, upon which, though ſo ſhort, and ſo uncertain, depends ſuch a life and ſuch a death, ſuch joys and ſuch ſorrows, ſuch reſt and ſuch diſquiet, to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Methinks if Heaven cannot allure us, with all the joys and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154187:74"/>
bleſſed eternal Reſt there to be had; Hell might affright us, with its dreadful ſufferings, into our duty, and compel us to make God at leaſt, our laſt refuge, if not our firſt choice. No loſs ſo great as the loſs of God, and the Kingdom of Heaven, and that Reſt we are there invited to. No Priſon ſo loathſom, as the bottomleſs pit of horror and darkneſs: No ſight ſo ghaſtly as that of frightful fiends: No ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſo terrible as thoſe of damned Ghoſts: No ſtench ſo noiſom as that of the lake of fire and brimſton: No fire ſo hot as of the wrath of God, which puts the ſinner into chains never to be looſed, into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs never to be enlightened, and gives him <hi>gnaſhing of teeth</hi> never to be remedied, gnawing vipers never to be pulled off; and this makes up ſuch a maſs of woes, ſuch a deadly death, as exceeds all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eloquence to expreſs, much more all patience to endure. Now
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:154187:75"/>
to avoid all this St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. what we muſt do, we muſt lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and <hi>run with patience the race that is ſet before us;</hi> running the way of Gods Commandements, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls here a <hi>race,</hi> is the way to this everlaſting Reſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>let us ſo run that we may obtain it,</hi> and then our recompence is, a <hi>Crown of life;</hi> if we ſlothfully neglect it, our puniſhment is, <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh, endleſs and intolerable,</hi> the <hi>worm of conſcience that never dies,</hi> the <hi>fire of hell that never goes out.</hi> Were we left to the glimmering ſuſpicious light of natural reaſon, as moſt Nations were of old, and many are ſtill, to gueſs at the way that leads to this everlaſting Reſt, or to find it out by a painful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, through many difficulties, and impediments of a contrary erroneous Education, we were by far the more excuſable, but when
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:154187:75"/>
by the mercy of God, we have the Goſpel ſounding in our Ears, and the way to this Reſt chalkt out before our Eyes in holy Scripture, and lively Oracles, with all the powerful perſwaſive motives of hope and love, inviting us to it on the one hand, and all the cogent conſtraining motives of threats and fear, to drive us to it; hearten'd on with promiſes, aſſiſtances, and inſtructions on the other hand; what pretence of excuſe can we have, that we ſhould fall ſhort of this Reſt? But ſome are often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, what is the loweſt degree of holineſs, faith, and obedience, that is conſiſtent with the eſcaping of hell, or hope of Heaven? They would know, what is the loweſt rate that Heaven and eternal Reſt will come at? The greateſt part of thoſe that would be reſolved in this enquiry, are of a moſt diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous unworthy diſpoſition; for when God hath obliged us, by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:154187:76"/>
ſo many mercies, aſſiſtances, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and rewards, thus to beat down as low as they can, the price of all his kindneſs and bounty; 'tis a dangerous ſign that he that ſeeks heaven and happineſs ſo faintly, will not ſeek it long; for we Sail againſt Tide, in our Voyage to Heaven, and earneſt diligence is required in the paſſage thither, but if we begin to lay aſide our Sails and Oares, we ſhall by the very ſtream of our nature, (the world and the fleſh) be carried backward to perdition. The way to Heaven is upward, but the ground is falling that we tread on, and the heavineſs of our nature, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually expoſe us to relapſes. 'Tis very probable, that he that is ſo jealous and wary, of doing ought more than is neceſſary to this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt, will never attain to do ſo much: He is likely to ſhoot ſhort of his Mark, who is ſo affraid of over-ſhooting it. He that ſaid:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:154187:76"/>
               <hi>So run that you may obtain,</hi> meant, ſo diligently, ſo earneſtly, as if you were never ſure enough of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but by running as faſt as your Spirits can hold out, till you come to the Gaol, the <hi>high price of your calling in Chriſt.</hi> The ſlothful Servant that ſaid his Maſter was an <hi>Auſtere Man,</hi> did but ſlander his Maſter, to hide his own negligence, thinking all too much that he did, and that eternal Salvation, which coſt no leſs than the death of the Lord of life, the Son of God, was ſet at too high a price.</p>
            <p>Such as are thus niggardly of their pains, will find at laſt, that by not improving their Talent, they will loſe at once both Heaven and it. <hi>Take from him the Talent,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in the Parable, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.28. <hi>and caſt the unprofitable Servant into outer darkneſs.</hi> That this may not happen unto any one of us, let us follow the advice of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:154187:77"/>
which ſaith, <hi>follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the God of peace.</hi> God is not diſquieted or troubled, or angry, though for our ſakes he ſeems to be ſo, when his wronged juſtice muſt puniſh us, unleſs we repent: 'Tis our ſin not his wrath, which whets the Sword of the deſtroying Angel, and ſhall not we deſire to be like the Angels, yea like our Heavenly Father, in being at Reſt and quiet, and keeping the peace of our Spirits, in the midſt of a froward generation?

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:154187:77"/>
keep our ſelves in calmneſs, and peaceable Reſt, when the World is gone out of order, not to pull it more in pieces, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſettle it as we pleaſe? Not to enrage the fire that threatens us, by blowing up with violent words, but to quench it with ſoft anſwers, and to overcome evil with good, <hi>following peace with all Men,</hi> and fighting only againſt our luſts and paſſions, which War againſt the Soul, and diſturb and hinder its reſt and peace? <hi>From whence come Wars, and fightings amongſt you, are they not from reſtleſs luſts and deſires</hi> of all ſizes, that <hi>War and rage with in you?</hi> Theſe luſts are the ſpawn of the two great ſenſual principles, <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Anger.</hi> Sometimes pride, ſometimes coveting that which God hath not made ones lot, and then diſturbing and confounding properties, in hope of attaining it: All the unpeaceableneſs in the World, is forged, and managed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154187:78"/>
by theſe luſts: And the graces which Chriſt preſcribes, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. as <hi>Humility, Meekneſs, Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> are ſent to root them out, and to dwell with that impatience, and inſatiable reſtleſs ravening, which troubles the World: But too many there are amongſt us, who have not thus learnt Chriſt. The wrathful Malecontent, who diſturbs both Church and State, ſails through a ſtormy tempeſtuous Sea and Rocks and Sands ready to ruine him, that by the ruine of many others, in ſoul and body, eſtate and good name, he may arrive at his wiſht-for haven of riches and power: But what doth he find at the end thereof, but a miſerable Shipwrack of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as well as others, horror of conſcience, hatred from Men of all parties, perpetual jealouſies of his being bereaved of his dearly bought, unjuſt acquiſitions, and at laſt, 'tis likely, <hi>Hamans</hi> Gallows, <hi>Abſalons</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:154187:78"/>
Tree, or <hi>Joabs</hi> Sword? However an infamous name and memory, after an anxious perplext life, and that which is incomparably worſe, eternal intolerable ſorrow and pain both of Soul and Body. The like may be ſaid of the Heretick or Schiſmatick, who, when he hath prided himſelf a while, by leading a numerous party or ſect, of unſtable Souls, from the <hi>faith that was once for all delivered to the Saints,</hi> from the <hi>unity of peace,</hi> and order of obedience to lawful Governours, into deſtructive Error and Schiſme, finds himſelf wilder'd, and thoſe that followed him crumbled into ſubdiviſions, 'till one and the other end in ſhame and ſelf confuſion, bringing them either to repentance, or intolerable endleſs miſery. But on the other ſide, the peaceable, meek, obedient follower of Chriſt enjoys his Reſt, and the benefit of good Government, with cheerful thankfulneſs to God and Man;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:154187:79"/>
bears the troubleſom oppreſſions, and diſorders, of an evil one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; and if the violence of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Governours, call him to the fire and fagot, impriſonment, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſequeſtration and what not, he chuſeth rather, poverty and death, with torments for an hour or two, than the farr worſe rack of an evil conſcience, the <hi>Worm that dieth not,</hi> and the <hi>fire that is not quenched.</hi> They that go about to build a Tower up to Heaven, if they be once confounded and divided in their Language, 'twill prove but a <hi>Babel,</hi> or ſhameful <hi>Chaos</hi> at beſt: <hi>When one builds and another pulls down, what profit have they then but labour? Eccl.</hi> 34.23. <hi>A houſe divided againſt it ſelf,</hi> be it a Family, a Kingdom, or Church, it <hi>cannot ſtand</hi> to Gods glory; And it were to be wiſht, that they who have the glory of God in their Mouths, when they ſeparate from the Church (which Baptized, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:154187:79"/>
taught them their Chriſtianity) for matters of an indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no where forbidden, would take heed of diſhonouring God, and his glory, by pretending to make them the end of their groundleſs quarrels and jealouſies. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies to true Religion are Atheiſm, and Superſttion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to then ſerves all this ado, about geſtures, and veſtures, and other external rites and formalities? That for ſuch things as theſe (never impoſed but for decency and order) Men ſhould clamour againſt the times, deſert their miniſterial office, fly from their Country as out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſtand at open defiance againſt lawful authority, in Church and State, draw their Pens and Swords againſt them; whereto ſerves all this, but to give ſcandal to <hi>Atheiſt</hi> and <hi>Romaniſt?</hi> The <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> to think there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in Religion, and ſcoff at all; the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> to think that theirs
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:154187:80"/>
is the true, when their adverſaries have ſo little unity and peace with each other? <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> are the order and harmony, the beauty and ſtrength, and comfort of our own Spirits, as alſo of Families and Neighbourhoods, Cities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Church and State. <hi>Peace</hi> gives a ſeaſonable opportunity of gathering wealth, and of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enjoying it, with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, and charity to Man; it gives an advantageous leiſure for learning, and knowledge of all ſorts; eſpecially that which moſt concerns us, the <hi>Knowledge of God and Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But <hi>diviſion</hi> and <hi>ſtrife,</hi> are the ruine and miſery of ſingle Perſons, the bane of private Families, publick Societies, Church and State, and all that is profitable, or comfortable to Man. When the World is out of frame, peace eſtabliſheth the pillars of it, brings every part to its own place, the ſenſual under the rational, the fleſh
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:154187:80"/>
under the beck of the Spirit. It draws the Servant under the Maſter, the Subject under the Magiſtrate. The peace of Families and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, makes every part to dwell together in unity, it keeps every Man in his right place, the Maſter on Horſeback, the Servant on the ground; the King on the Throne, the Subject in his private ſtation; the paſtors in their place of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the people in theirs of attention and devotion: Like an intelligence, it moves the leſſer Sphere of a Family, and the greater Orb of a Commonwealth or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, compoſedly and orderly in its happineſs. Peace is ſo neceſſary in all conditions to reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that without it, ones Family is a priſon, or ſad confinement to trouble and moleſtation: Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, gives but the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of vexing and injuring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Towns and Cities, are but ſo many wilderneſſes of wild beaſts:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:154187:81"/>
The Church no Church, more like <hi>Babel,</hi> than <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or State, a diſorderly <hi>Chaos;</hi> yea an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> or <hi>field of blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By peace at home, good Laws and Orders are made and kept; Magiſtrates reſpected, Subjects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved according to their neceſſities: By peace and agreement in the Church, Gods ordinances are duly obſerved, good diſcipline executed; Paſtors and Teachers maintained and encouraged, the People edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Gods houſes preſerved and beautified: Who is there then that would not ſeek his eternal Reſt hereafter, by ſeeking peace and enſuing it here?</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Religion, that leads and conducts us to this eternal Reſt, is alſo the wiſeſt and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preſerver of peace in order to it; It commands us to ſtudy and pray for it, to follow it, with all diligence till we overtake it; we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to loſe our right for the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:154187:81"/>
ſake of peace, to part with Coat, or Cloak, or any thing tolerable, rather than it.</p>
            <p>Peace levels the hills, and raiſes the vallies, and caſts an healthful peaceable influence, on all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and qualities of Men: That as it was propheſied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6. The <hi>Wolf may dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard lie down with the Kid.</hi> And if it be not ſo with Chriſtians, it is becauſe they are ſo in word, but not in heart; have received the Goſpel of peace in their Ears, and heads perhaps, but not in the love thereof: For were they indeed the Sons of peace, in whoſe hearts the peace of God takes place, were they Members of that body of which Chriſt is the head, then every Member of ſuch a Kingdom or Church, would keep its place, with ſubordinate dependance; the rich by ſupplying the poor, the poor by bleſſing the rich, the wiſe by teaching the ignorant, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:154187:82"/>
by hearkening to the wiſe; every Man being as an Angel, or miniſtring Spirit, to another. But the reſtleſs, unpeaceable perſon, counts it his honour, to ſpeak and do what he liſt:</p>
            <p>To purſue his enemies till he take them, and beat them as ſmall as the duſt before the wind; to ſtand in the vally, and touch the Mountains till they ſmoak; reach at that which is above, and pull it down; divide that which is united; ſhake that which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, violate that which ſhould not be toucht; and are ever moving and heaving upward, to gain a name, though it be by firing a Temple, or ſetting a Kingdom or Church in combuſtion. Thus are honours valued and ſought among Men, the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> that would be yokeleſs. Honourable Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks deſcend from <hi>Jeroboam, who made Iſrael to ſin;</hi> from <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram, who roſe up againſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:154187:82"/>
Moſes and Aaron,</hi> till they periſhed in their contradiction: Honourable Hypocrites, Phariſees, and the Sons of Phariſees, whoſe name, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was, to ſeparate as more holy; though the Baptiſt and Chriſt himſelf, condemned them as more wicked.</p>
            <p>Honourable Murtherers, of their Father the Devil, who was ſo from the beginning of ſins entrance into the World; ambitious, covetous, diſcontented, revengful, humorous, unpeaceable perſons, and theſe would be accounted the Honourable grandees of the World; but in the Court, and Heraldry of Heaven, we find no ſuch Titles of Honour. An Honour it is to be at peace and reſt; <hi>ceaſe from ſtrife, Prov.</hi> 20.3. The <hi>peaceable</hi> Man, he is the <hi>Honourable</hi> Man in Scripture, and in Gods account: By peaceableneſs, and following peace, Men procure to themſelves a ſure Title to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace and reſt; knowing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154187:83"/>
that the <hi>merciful ſhall obtain mercy,</hi> the <hi>peaceable, peace,</hi> and Reſt at the laſt. But there are amongſt us, unquiet reſtleſs perſons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to inſpirations, and boaſt themſelves of the Spirit; but we are exhorted by St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Not to believe every Spirit,</hi> but <hi>to try the Spirits, whether they are of God or no,</hi> becauſe <hi>many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the World:</hi> And our Saviour's direction for the diſcovery of them we have, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits.</hi> Our Saviours meaning could not be only, nor chiefly, the fruits of their lives in their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, for falſehood is often ſet off by Hypocriſy; and a ſhew of ſanctity, goes for great purity; and pretences of Religion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſerve to delude, and miſlead unſtable Souls. This is the Wool which the Wolf wraps about him, when he means to do moſt miſchief, with leaſt ſuſpition. The
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:154187:83"/>
old Serpent is not ſo ſilly as to think, that his Miniſters (whilſt they are working the works of darkneſs) ſhould be able to draw a conſiderable party into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſhould they appear in their diſmal colours; therefore he puts them into a new dreſs, before he ſend them abroad in the World; transforming them, as if they were the Miniſters of light; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour could not mean the fruits of their lives ſo much, as the fruits of their Doctrine, that is to ſay, the neceſſary conſequences of their Doctrines. If what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and Taught by them, upon examination do plainly appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with any one branch or duty of a Chriſtian life, the words we may be ſure are not wholſom words. It can be no Heavenly Doctrine, that teacheth Men to be <hi>earthly, ſenſual,</hi> and <hi>devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> that tends to make Men <hi>unjuſt</hi> in their dealings, <hi>uncharitable</hi> in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:154187:84"/>
their cenſures, <hi>undutiful</hi> to their ſuperiours. It was not the purpoſe of God, in publiſhing the Goſpel, and thereby freeing us from the rigor and curſe of the Law, ſo to turn us looſe and lawleſs, to do (as when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) what <hi>ſeemed good in our own Eyes;</hi> follow our own crooked will, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify any corrupt luſt; but to oblige us the faſter, by theſe new benefits, and heavenly promiſes, and to bind us to our good behaviour the more ſtrictly, allowing no liberty to the fleſh, to <hi>fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> but to exact of us ſincere ſanctity and purity, both of inward affection, and outward converſation; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no true Reſt to be expected.</p>
            <p>But our pretenders to the Spirit, who call the Scriptures a <hi>dead letter,</hi> boaſt of new inſpirations, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger greatly the bringing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion amongſt Men, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances into States and Kingdoms; the Governours whereof, having
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:154187:84"/>
no other authority, than what is either founded or agreeable to the word, or will of God, it will ſtill be in the power of each pretender, to deliver Oracles out of his own breaſt, as the immediate dictates of Gods Spirit, quite contrary to the ſafety, and intereſt of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which any where is, or may be eſtabliſhed: And ſo the peace of Kingdoms, muſt be as uncertain and changeable, as the phanſies of Men, and the Laws as alterable as Teſtaments are while the Teſtator lives; every illuminate breaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to come like <hi>Moſes</hi> from God in <hi>Sinai,</hi> with new Tables of divine Commandements, which muſt aboliſh and exclude the old; but it is our great comfort, bleſſed be God, that the publick Doctrine eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is at this day ſuch, that it is not chargeable, with any one thing, contrary to any part of that duty, which a Chriſtian owes, either to God or Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:154187:85"/>Let theſe pretenders conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, let no Man pretend to the Spirit, for any other end or purpoſe, ſave for what it was given, and that was not to procure himſelf glory, not to ſeparate from his Brethren, not to pride and puff up himſelf by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing and ſcorning others, but to advance the glory of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his own and others ſalvation.</p>
            <p>If what thou haſt or pretends to have, be given, the honour is the givers, and the receiver muſt give an account how he hath uſed, what he hath received. Now in order to the procuring this eternal Reſt, there are indeed in the Church ſeveral gifts, in ſeveral men; different Offices, and divers ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which look at firſt as if they proceeded from ſeveral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and tended to diviſion; but
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154187:85"/>
as all this variety tends to unity, ſo all indeed proceeds from unity, Unity in Trinity, one and the ſame God truly diſtinguiſht into three Perſons, but always united into the ſame God-head.</p>
            <p>But what Reſt may thoſe Men expect, who dig at the foundation of our Religion, and ſtick not to deny that bleſſed Trinity, into whoſe worſhip, and in whoſe name we are Baptized: The name of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> To which three Sacred Perſons we ſo often ſay, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Theſe are the Three which ſaid to each other, when they made Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Let us make Man after our Image, in our likeneſſ.</hi> Theſe are they which manifeſted themſelves at our Lords Baptiſme; joyning again to renue that Image, in which we were made. The Father in the voice, the Son owned by that voice, the Spirit in the Dove abiding on
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:154187:86"/>
him: Theſe are that <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> to whom the Seraphims in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> under the old Teſtament, gave all glory. Theſe are they to whom the Angels and Saints in Heaven, ſing that Anthem of praiſe in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> This is the ſum of Chriſtian Religion, and that which brings Reſt and peace eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to all that well underſtand and receive it.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ordained that the <hi>Literae for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matae,</hi> or <hi>Commendatory Letters,</hi> which were the ſolemn warrants of entertainment, and hoſpitality, between Chriſtians, ſhould be ſubſcrib'd by theſe Letters <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, denoting the Trinity, and their faith who carried thoſe Letters. <hi>There are three</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>that bear record in Heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word, and the Spirit, and theſe three are one</hi> and the ſame God bleſſed for ever: One Eſſence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what our Lord hath ſaid,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154187:86"/>
               <hi>I and the Father are one.</hi> Thus to believe, highly concerns us all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of all errors, none ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, none ſo intolerable, as thoſe which concern the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whence all things flow; and the laſt end to which all things tend. Derive all from the bleſſed Trinity, aſcribe and refer the glory of all to the bleſſed Trinity, and then we ſhall come to enjoy him in bleſſed reſt and happineſs, whom we thus believe, adore and honour.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. That <hi>there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit; differencies of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord; diverſities of operations, but it is the ſame God, that worketh all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhould ſtand as a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Unity, and Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelves, Humility and Thankfulneſs to God, who hath made us partakers in ſeveral mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and degrees of theſe gifts, theſe adminiſtrations, theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154187:87"/>
that though our gifts, and places, and works are very different and unequal, yet they come all from the ſame Spirit, Lord, and God; who wiſely governs and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all things by his Council here below: The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>To one is given the word of wiſdom,</hi> [a ſpecial ability of underſtanding] <hi>To another the word of knowledge,</hi> [to interpret the myſtical ſenſes and veiled meanings of holy Scripture] <hi>To another Faith,</hi> [or a firm belief to work all miracles] <hi>To another the gift of healing,</hi> [a peculiar power to cure diſeaſes without the help of Phyſick] <hi>To another the working of Miracles,</hi> [ſuch as was the delivering <hi>Hymineus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> to be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Satan; the ſtriking <hi>Elymas</hi> blind, and <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> dead] <hi>To another diverſe kinds of Tongues,</hi> [the gift of ſpeaking ſeveral and ſtrange Languages, which he was never taught;] And <hi>all this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that one and the ſame Spirit, who
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154187:87"/>
divides his ſeveral gifts, to ſeveral Men, according to his good pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Scriptures tell us the ſame, as that of St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.15. <hi>The Maſter of the houſe gave to one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant five Talents, to another two, to another one, to every one according to his ſeveral ability:</hi> He gives ſuch, and ſo much as he ſees every Man is fit to make uſe of, to Gods glory and the Common good. Thus God will ſhew himſelf both a free donor, and a wiſe diſpoſer of all things. For if one Man ſhould have all abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and others few or none of any worth, the World might ſeem to be guided, either by blind fortune, or fatal neceſſity; but now that Men have their ſeveral Offices, and their ſeveral abilities, by which they are each fitted for anothers ſervice, and all for the beauty and benefit of the whole frame; the hand of divine providence, appears in the diſpoſing of them. God would have Men take notice of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:154187:88"/>
their gifts, and of their defects, that by the one they may learn humility, and by the other thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. For if any one had all parts, he would be too proud of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and begin to think he needed not the ſupply of Gods far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favours, who had ſo much of his own already. Again, if any Man were deſtitute of all Gods gifts, and mercies, he would want matter to bleſs God for. But now that God hath given to Men a meaſure of good things, and hath temper'd their gifts, with many defects, they may eaſily ſee, they are both indebted to God for all they have, and depending on God for all they want. And ſo this dividing Gods gifts, ſhould teach us to think humbly of our Selves, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of God, and to ſet up our Reſt in thoſe gifts and graces, which his bounty hath ſo freely conferred upon us. Not inwardly to repine and envy, nor outwardly to diſturb
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:154187:88"/>
and pervert, that order which God hath made, but to let God alone with his wiſe and gracious dealing with us, and to reſt ſatisfied with our own portion, and to prize and eſteem the gifts of others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their due worth and value where ever we find them; for if the holy Spirit of God, divide his gifts as he will, and his will is always gracious and wiſe, then either to deny, or envy, or debaſe them, is no better than to thwart God, in one eſpecial work of his wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Some Men indeed would have greater gifts, and moſt Men would have greater callings and places in the Church and State; all ſecretly grudging againſt God, and envying one another; and if it were not the mercy of God, to over rule ſuch ſecret ſwellings, they would burſt out to the overthrow of peace and order, and would prove no leſs deſtructive, to our temporal quiet
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:154187:89"/>
and Reſt here, than to our eternal Reſt hereafter. 'Twas good Counſel which <hi>Joſeph</hi> gave to his Brethren, when they were returning with their Sacks of Corn to their Father in <hi>Canaan, See ye fall not out by the way.</hi> We are all Travellers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to our Fathers houſe, the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> in which are <hi>many manſions,</hi> enough certainly for all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and God hath given to every Man, ſuch gifts and graces, ſuch guides and aſſiſtances, for their conduct, that were they not wanting to themſelves, they need not doubt their ſafe arrival. But ſuch are our fallings out by the way, ſuch our jarrings and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our lingrings, delays and backſlidings, that we may have cauſe to fear, the greater part of theſe Travellers will fall ſhort of theſe manſions, and never take up their Reſt in their Fathers houſe.</p>
            <p>It is an ancient and true ſaying, <hi>Unum quodque eſt propter operationem
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:154187:89"/>
ſuam. God hath made all that he made;</hi> ordered all things that he ordained (and there is nothing but what he made and ſet in order) for that work and operation, to which its nature, place and faculties, are fitted. The work and operation therefore, is the firſt in order of intention or deſign, though the laſt in order of execution and accompliſhment. But nothing can operate or work aright, except it be gifted, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſome faculty, or hability to that work. And that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or hability may produce its work in due order, it muſt have its due place and office, appointed by him who orders all things.</p>
            <p>Now as this is true and certain in the univerſal body of the World, and in the particular natural body of all Men; ſo it is chiefly to be obſerved, in the Spiritual body of Chriſt's Church. Firſt there are gifts to enable Men to perform the work for which God hath appointed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154187:90"/>
them. Then there are Offices <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or adminiſtrations, to authorize them, and give them Commiſſion, in their ſeveral places to exerciſe thoſe gifts, with which they are endued, and perform thoſe works, for which they are gifted and authorized. Then there are works, which muſt be performed by Men endued with thoſe gifts and thoſe Commiſſions.</p>
            <p>This is the wiſe method and order which he that hath made all things in number, meaſure and weight, hath preſcribed, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf in all his works, and preſcribed us in his word to obſerve. Gifts are firſt mentioned, becauſe they are firſt neceſſary, for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying of the Perſon both for his office and his work. What ever we have, what ever we are, by nature or grace, in our worldly condition, or in our ſpiritual, is a gift: For what are, or what have we, in any reſpect, if good it be;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154187:90"/>
that we have not received, from that God, who is the only ſelf-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, all-ſufficient fountain, and fulneſs of all being and life? For in him we live, and move, and have our being: From him, and through him, and to him are all things. He ſpake the word, <hi>Let it be thus, and thus,</hi> (by that eternal word his only Son) <hi>and it was ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Spirit moved upon the Waters,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> that he pleaſed to have done, through this word, by this Spirit <hi>were produced;</hi> for <hi>by the word of the Lord were the Heavens made,</hi> and <hi>all the hoſt of them by this Spirit,</hi> or <hi>word of his mouth.</hi> All then is his gift: <hi>Ab uniſſimo Deo manant multiformia, ab aeterno tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralia; All diverſity comes from Unity, all times and temporal things, from the eternity, of this Trinity.</hi> It is God alone that hath made and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>dull</hi> Earth and the <hi>active</hi> Sun, diſtinguiſhed the World into ſuch diverſity of Creatures, in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:154187:91"/>
order to ſerve one another, the Elements for the mixt bodies, herbs and graſs for the living unreaſonable Creatures; thoſe for Man, and Man for his own ſervice and glory.</p>
            <p>If God had made but one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that one had proved him an infinite God, as to his power, for nothing but an Almighty power, can bring forth any thing, though but an Atom, or duſt or ſand out of nothing. But now that he hath made and appointed ſo many Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in ſuch a juſt and excellent order, this makes the riches of his wiſdom and bounty, clearly appear to the Eye of reaſon, and then he demands of Man, who hath this reaſon, in all humility and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs that he adore and revere that God, who hath made ſo many divers Creatures to ſerve him, that he may learn thereby to ſerve and love his Creator, and gracious benefactor; and ſo at laſt come to enjoy him, whom he hath thus
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:154187:91"/>
ſerved and loved, in eternal joy and reſt.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhould ask, why was I made a <hi>liveleſs</hi> Element, a <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> Plant, an <hi>unreaſonable</hi> though a <hi>living</hi> Creature, but a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Man, above all theſe, able to ſee, and conſider what I ſee and know; to the honour of God? There can no account or reaſon be given, but the free bounty of his gift, who thus diſtinguiſht and ordered all things. And ſo alſo amongſt Men; why one is noble, another obſcure; one rich, another poor; one beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, witty, and ſtrong, another weak, dull, or leſs comely, what account can any one give, but that <hi>there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit,</hi> Lord, God, who thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them? And this muſt teach us contentedneſs, without envying Superiors; and Charity, without deſpiſing or neglecting inferiors.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe gifts, theſe Offices and adminiſtrations, which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:154187:92"/>
God hath placed in the World, for its Temporal Government; there are gifts ſupernatural and ſpiritual, which God hath ordain'd and placed in the Church, for the ſpiritual Government of Mens Souls, in order to Gods ſervice here, and Mans eternal Reſt and Salvation hereafter. And theſe gifts, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 12.28. reckons up to be eight in number. <hi>Firſt Apoſtles, Secondarily Prophets, Thirdly Teachers. After Miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, Governments, diverſities of Tongues:</hi> Whereof five were needful only at firſt, and ſo to continue but for a time: But thoſe that were to abide for ever, are reduced to Three, <hi>Teachers, Helps, Governments.</hi> Prieſts or Presbyters to <hi>teach,</hi> Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to <hi>help,</hi> Biſhops both to <hi>teach, help,</hi> and <hi>govern.</hi> Theſe all, the Church had from the beginning, and our Church bleſſed be God, ſtill hath them. Theſe the Synod
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154187:92"/>
of <hi>Carthage</hi> calls the <hi>Three degrees of the Clergy;</hi> and we find frequent mention of them, in all the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Records of the Church, whether Provincial Synods, or general Councels, Publick Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, or private Writers, Hiſtorians or Fathers; <hi>Canons</hi> made for their ſeveral Offices and Adminiſtrations, bounding and limiting each from other, in their proper works and operations.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> hath been leſs queſtioned; but that of <hi>Biſhops</hi> more diſputed in late times: yet who can queſtion, or doubt of their being placed in the Church, by the Apoſtles themſelves, that hath with any impartial Eye, read and conſidered, either the Scripture, or the ancient expoſiters of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Creet,</hi> have their Epiſcopal Office and duty plainly deſcribed, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in Scripture by <hi>St. Paul.</hi> The <hi>Seven Stars</hi> in Chriſts hand, <hi>Rev.</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:154187:93"/>
1.20. are the <hi>Seven Angels</hi> of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> ſaith Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And he that conſiders what theſe Churches were, of how nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Chriſtians, of what large circuit, containing ſeveral Cities and Countries, can hardly doubt of what the Ancients have ſaid: <hi>That the Angels of theſe Churches were not only Biſhops, but Metropolitan Arch-Biſhops.</hi> Sure we are, that Church Writers and Hiſtorians, ſet down the very particular names of theſe Seven Angels or Biſhops, and not only ſo, but their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors for ſeveral Ages.</p>
            <p>The firſt general Counſel of <hi>Nice,</hi> from which the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> hath its name, conſiſted of Three Hundred and Eighteen Biſhops, as many as <hi>Abraham</hi> had in his Army againſt the Kings, in the ſtory of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wittily alludes. And the firſt general Synod, calls the Government by Biſhops, Arch-Biſhops or Metropolitans <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:154187:93"/>
the <hi>antient guiſe:</hi> So ancient it was, that the ancient writers we have (and ſome we have of the next Age after the Apoſtles) mention it as univerſally ſpread over the Church, and from no other at firſt derived, than from the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Nor could it indeed have been ſo early, or ſo generally diffuſed, from any leſs authority than theirs. Theſe are they whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, giving them power of ordination and of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Preſidents. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> every where diſtinguiſheth them from Presbyters, and Deacons, as being above them, and calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Governours.</hi> So doth St. <hi>Cyprian, Origen, Euſebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and who not? attributing to them not only the chief place, but the higheſt authority and power of Government. <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf, though but a Presbyter, and a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous defender of Presbyters dignity, derives the difference of degrees
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154187:94"/>
no lower, than from the times of the Apoſtles, for ſo are his words; <hi>When they began to ſay,</hi> I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> I of <hi>Appollo,</hi> I of <hi>Cephas, then were Biſhops every where placed to prevent Schiſm.</hi> And that we may know, that theſe Apoſtolical tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are taken from the Old Teſtament; what <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and the <hi>Levites,</hi> were in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple, that <hi>Biſhops, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> were in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. And therefore if we will not make ſo learned, and ſo religious a Perſon, plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelf, he muſt be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in his other ſayings, as not to deny what he plainly affirms, <hi>That Epiſcopal Government came from the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this hath been ſo fully diſcuſſed of late years in this Nation,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Templer,</hi> 1676.</note> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by a Perſon of great worth and learning, at a <hi>Viſitation</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (to which I refer you)
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:154187:94"/>
that I ſhall no longer inſiſt upon it, only remind you, that differences there are of Adminiſtrations, that is, of Offices in the Church, as well as diverſities of gifts; and all theſe different Adminiſtrations, high and low, as well Biſhops, as Prieſts and Deacons, are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the proper term of the loweſt of the three, the <hi>Deacons;</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Adminiſtrations,</hi> but might as well be rendred <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries,</hi> or <hi>Services:</hi> But why are they ſo called? Surely to teach the higheſt of them, both diligence and humility in their Office. Every honour, hath its burthen anſwerable to it; and the higher the Office of Government, if it be truly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly diſcharged, the pain-fuller is its work and ſervice. 'Tis an old ſaying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>The Maſter in a great houſe, is the greateſt Servant;</hi> while all they ſerve him, in their ſeveral places, he is fain to ſerve them all,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:154187:95"/>
ſtudy and watch to provide for all, to govern all. In no houſe is this ſo true, as that of the Church: For whoſe cares, ſtudies, dangers, watchfulneſs are ſo great, ſo various, ſo perpetual, as theirs, if they do their duty? And whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is ſo great, if they do it not? Biſhops are Generals in this Spiritual Army, and yet faith St. <hi>Paul, fellow Souldiers;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to our <hi>Common Lord Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> not only for their <hi>own</hi> Souls, but for others too; nor is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Common Souldier, by the hundreth part, obliged to ſo many cares and pains, expoſed to ſo many dangers and troubles, as theſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. Rulers they are in Gods Houſe, but their ruling is for Gods ſervice, and Mans Salvation: And what a load of cares and pains, doth this ruling lay upon them? Fathers they are in place and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but Brethren in love and humility they muſt be. <hi>Stars</hi> and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:154187:95"/>
               <hi>Angels</hi> they are called, but how do the Stars run their courſe, day and night for the ſervice of this inferior World? How do the Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to be miniſtring Spirits to the pooreſt of Gods Family?</p>
            <p>Read but what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.27. <hi>Whoſoever will be chief amongſt you, muſt be your Servant, even as the Son of Man came to Miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</hi> Read what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. to the 30. and you will ſurely confeſs, that the higheſt Offices in Gods Church, are the moſt painful dangerous ſervices: Miniſteries truly ſo called, ſo truly, that the Ancient Biſhops entering that Office, might truly ſay, <hi>nolo Epiſcopari.</hi> But the more painful their ſervice is, the greater ought to be their honour, both of inward reſpect, and outward maintenance. All that are under theſe Miniſteries, or Adminiſtrations, ought to take heed of deſpiſing them for this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:154187:96"/>
reaſon, becauſe they are <hi>Miniſteries;</hi> but rather honour them becauſe they are <hi>over you in the Lord.</hi>

               <hi>He that deſires the Office of a Biſhop, deſires a good work,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul:</hi> Good indeed, and a work indeed. To govern and guide ſo many flocks
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:154187:96"/>
and their Paſtors, with zeal to God, and Charity to Man; with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied patience and humility; without corruption or partiality, through favour or fear, of high or low, ſmall or great, poor or rich; to govern and teach wiſely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently; to look ſo carefully to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, that all the truth, and none but the truth, be conſtantly preached, and the ſervice of God be conſtantly performed, with all reverence, free from prophaneſs, with all purity, free from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. That the Sacraments and diſcipline of the Church, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in their power and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; all this is a work indeed, as full of labour and care, as of honour: Even the lower Adminiſtrations, thoſe of Presbyters and Deacons, have not they their work too? They have ſure in their ſeveral places enough to ſpend their time, and Spirits wholly in, if they do their duty. The Presbyter hath a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:154187:97"/>
great ſhare of all. The Biſhops work is in a great part committed to him, and would the People make that uſe of Gods Miniſters, which their Eternal Reſt and Salvation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, it would quickly be found, that preaching were not half of the Miniſters work and care: And yet Preaching is no ſmall work. To inſtruct clearly in all the Myſteries of Faith, to exhort earneſtly, and affectionately, to all the duties of life and practice; to convince ſo many numerous errors, as daily ariſe; to rebuke and reprove ſo many ſins, and ſinful Perſons; without fear of the <hi>great,</hi> or the <hi>many;</hi> to comfort the feeble minded; to humble the haughty; to ſtir up the ſlothful, and temper the furious; to uphold the falling, and relieve the wavering, and reduce the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to <hi>ſtop the mouths of</hi> ſo many, and ſubtil <hi>gainſayers,</hi> from the Atheiſt to the Schiſmatick; from the Prophane to the Superſtitious;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:154187:97"/>
to clear thoſe Obſcurities, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe difficulties, remove thoſe ſcandals, which ſo many Men in weakneſs, or wilfulneſs are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, and to ſecond all this with a life unblameable; this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a work of great variety, ſtudy, and pains: and yet a work ſo neceſſary it is, that better for us, we had no gifts nor Miniſtry at all, than not to perform it: and the more it behoves the reſt of the World, not to hinder, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, not ſacrilegiouſly to rob, not to perplex us in this our work; but to ſtrive to make it as comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us, and as fruitful to your ſelves as you can, ſeeing the end of theſe Miniſteries, theſe ſervices, theſe works, the end of all our labour, is to bring you to <hi>endleſs Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All our abilities, all our gifts are from the <hi>ſame Spirit,</hi> all our works are wrought by the <hi>ſame Lord, who worketh all in all,</hi> that is well wrought; both in him that writes,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:154187:98"/>
and him that reads, both in him that ſpeaks, and him that hears, in him that is governed, and in him that governs. if this be ſo, let us baniſh all <hi>pride,</hi> If our gifts, and places, and works be never ſo high, never ſo many; <hi>Envy,</hi> if our gifts and places ſeem never ſo few and low; for what are the higheſt amongſt us, but the inſtruments and ſervants, of this ſupreme do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and mover; receiving all from him, accountable for all to him? And how can the loweſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt murmur, or object any thing againſt it, ſince they that have the loweſt and meaneſt, have it a gift, and could not challenge it as due, but have it by the wiſe diſpoſal of that Lord, whoſe wiſdom knoweth what is fitteſt for each; and whoſe goodneſs beſtows that which is moſt fit, and the meaner, or leſs gifts and places any one hath, the more eaſily is both his work, and his account?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:154187:98"/>Away then with <hi>haughty</hi> Pride, or <hi>mutinous</hi> Envy. Let not one ſay with repining regret, <hi>I am ſlow in apprehenſion, weak in memory, ſhallow in judgment, whilſt others are quick, tenacious and ſolid: I have neither wealth to buy voluminous Authors; nor arts, nor parts, as others have, to dive into thoſe difficulties, and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and gain a clear ſolution of them, as others have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let others ſay in haughty contempt of their inferiors, or meaner Brethren; <hi>how mean are ſuch and ſuch compared with me, in graces, and places? I can lead my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed Auditors, whither I will, with my eloquent Tongue; whilſt others freez in their Pulpits, and tire their Auditors into weariſomneſs and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</hi> But let the one and the other ſay, <hi>Theſe are gifts freely beſtowed, where it pleaſeth the giver, and who ſhall ſay unto him, what doeſt thou with thy own? He owes nothing to any, who can demand any thing of him as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154187:99"/>
his due? He is the ſupreme Wiſdom, who ſhall direct him in his Counſel; where and how to diſpoſe and beſtow his gifts? The ſupreme Lord, who ſhall command him, where and how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and order his Adminiſtrations? He is the only Almighty God, who ſhall accuſe his work of weakneſs or defect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the loweſt and meaneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſay, <hi>Though God hath denied me this or that which others have, yet hath he given me ſomething which others want. He hath not given me an high place, but he hath given me that retirement and ſafety, of which thoſe that are in high places, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved. He hath denied me promotion, but given me that health, which they that are preferred before me, would willingly purchaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, let thoſe that have higheſt gifts and places, ſay to themſelves, <hi>Why ſhould we boaſt of our Lords bounty, and not rather tremble to think, of aſcribing that to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:154187:99"/>
our ſelves, which is his free gift and diſpenſation; leaſt he take it away, when he ſees it abuſed; or if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it, condemn us the heavier for being unthankful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since it is thus ordered, by the wiſe diſpoſer of all things, let one, and the other remember, that all are the Spirits <hi>Almſmen</hi> in their <hi>gifts.</hi> The Lord's <hi>Miniſters</hi> in their <hi>Offices,</hi> Gods <hi>Workmen</hi> in their <hi>works,</hi> and thus when every one ſhall be contented with his Talent, each one ſhall find peace and quiet, and Reſt within him here, and be qualified for eternal Reſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The World hath many pretenders to this Reſt, and thoſe ſo contrary one to another, that their very pretences to it, ſhew this eternal Reſt to be very deſirable; but the contrariety ſhews, that this Reſt hath ſo much of difficulty in it, that all that lay claim to it, cannot juſtifie their claim: And though
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:154187:100"/>
they cry with the Mathematician <gap reason="foreign">

We muſt not be ſo fooliſh, or ſo ſlothful, as thoſe Scepticks, who queſtion, or deride the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſearching, and finding out this eternal Reſt; but with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and diligence, humbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to thoſe Rules, which are given us for its diſcovery. Some there are that lay claim to no other, nor higher felicity, than that which either natural Philoſophy, or civil Policy can help them to: And theſe, though they have gone far, diſcovered and publiſht many truths, pleaſant and profitable for the World; yet their aims are too low, to give the ſoul of Man ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or acquieſcenſe here: The light and rules they walk by, too
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:154187:100"/>
weak, and too uncertain, to reach thoſe very aims, which themſelves own; much more muſt they needs fall ſhort of Mans great eternal end, this endleſs Reſt: The purſuit whereof, is our wiſdom here; the attaining whereof, is our happineſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>There are in the World Men (and thoſe not a few) who ſeek after wealth and honour, and great power; and weary themſelves day and night, to attain their ambitious deſires, and think themſelves ſtill in the way towards this eternal Reſt: But our Saviour's appearing in the World, as he did, in much humility, demonſtrates unto us the contrary. The innocency, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, charity and holineſs of his life, were ſo conſpicuous, that the Scribes and Phariſees, nay, the Devil himſelf, could not find any true accuſation againſt him; and he that betrayed him, went and hanged himſelf, becauſe he had
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:154187:101"/>

To exemplify, as well as teach them, the grace of piety, and contentedneſs, with the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt condition here below, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their hearts on things above? How contrary had it been to ſuch a purpoſe, for our Lord to have

Aſpiring <hi>ambition</hi> overthrew the Tempter, <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelf.

This might be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, with leſs danger to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and more good to Church and State; if they ſought to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top them, more by their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per height, or true growth, in all graces and good works, than by meer advantage of ground: For <hi>when every Valley ſhall be exalted,</hi> and <hi>every Mountain made low;</hi> that is, when all worldly differences of States, ſhall be laid aſide, (as at the laſt day they will be) the fruit which hath grown in the vale of humility and contentedneſs, will appear both higher, and better far, than the ordinary off-ſpring of the Mountains or higheſt places of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. Were Men ſo wiſe in heart as to conſider, that the lower their place or condition is (ſo it be not expoſed to flouds of violence) the apter it is to ſuck in the dew of Heaven, and bring forth fruit in its ſeaſon.</p>

               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:154187:103"/>There are in the way to this eternal Reſt, great variety of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, furniſht with various and different abilities; whoſe faces dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not more than their minds and manners, and theſe though they run contrary ways, yet all pretend they are in purſuit of the ſame end, and are upon their march to this eternal Reſt, even then, when their backs are turned upon it.</p>
            <p>The bloudy reſtleſs Traytor would be thought to be in ſearch after this eternal Reſt, and Life, though he ſeek for it in the paths of death, and works like the Mole under ground, and thinks that no Man ſhall ſee him, 'till his abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wickedneſs be found out, and 'till, in the <hi>ſame Net that he laid for others, is his foot taken,</hi> and 'till his own demerits, and the juſtice of the laws, halter him into a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death, and ſwing him into another World, there to have <hi>his portion, with</hi> (the firſt and greateſt of

Another ſort of Rebels there are more noble, though not leſs bloudy than the former, of an higher and more honourable extraction; yet ſuch as move in the ſame Sphere, who hide their heads aloft in the Clouds, who alſo think that none ſhall ſee them; but he that is higher than the higheſt, laughs them to ſcorn, and lets them drop into the ſame pit, which they made for others; 'till the Sanction of the Laws, ſtrikes the Coronet from off their Heads, their Heads from their Bodies, and lays the Ax to the root of that Tree, which brought not forth good fruit, and is therefore hewn down, rieven out, as it were, and cleaved for the fire. Were Religion as much in theſe Mens hearts, as it hath been in their pretences; that Religion I mean, which is, firſt <hi>pure,</hi> then
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:154187:104"/>
               <hi>peaceable,</hi> they might have been gathered to their Fathers in peace, and not have pulled upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a ſpeedier, and a ſadder mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, than that which God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had firſt appointed for them.</p>
            <p>Next, The Zealous Schiſmatick thinks he is making ſure of this eternal Reſt, for himſelf and alſo for his followers, who runs, before he is called, and intrudes himſelf into that holy function, of which we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>No Man taketh that honour unto himſelf but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron. That is, no good, or holy Man, muſt or ought, or doth take this honour upon himſelf, but he that is truly called of God. Such as <hi>Corah,</hi> have too often, and too preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly taken it upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being called, appointed, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, by lawful authority; But how hainous a ſin it is ſo to do, may appear by the dreadful puniſhment thereof; the Earth opened and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:154187:105"/>
ſwallowed him, and his, up in a moment, <hi>Uzza</hi> may not <hi>touch</hi> the Ark, the <hi>Bethſhemites</hi> may not ſo much as <hi>gaze</hi> into it. And though now, no ſuch puniſhment be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted any more; nor ſuch a death as St. <hi>Peter</hi> inflicted on <hi>Ananias,</hi> befall Sacrilege, (for Miracles are ceaſed) and ſuch Examples at the firſt were inflicted on purpoſe, to ſignify the guilt of that ſin, and ſo to terrify from it for ever; yet God and his law is the ſame for ever, and they who prophane his holy orders, and inſtitutions, by bold obtruding themſelves upon them, will find a puniſhment meet for their ſin, here or hereafter.</p>
            <p>What more prophanes holy things, than that which makes them common to all, who have but the forehead to claim and take them? But ſince the acceptance of the office, and its work on Gods part is all in all, as that which can bring a bleſſing on Prieſt or People;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154187:105"/>
it highly concerns us, both in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to our ſelves, and in duty to God, and in Charity to others, neither to take that honourable office to our ſelves, nor give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, or countenance to thoſe that do ſo, ſince it is indeed no honour, nor office, unleſs as it is derived from him, and is more likely, if not more certain, to bring a curſe and not a bleſſing, on ſuch invaders of the Prieſthood, and their followers.</p>
            <p>If God will be Sanctified by them that draw near unto him, then ſurely moſt, by them that draw neareſt; by having the office of being <hi>his mouth</hi> unto the People, and <hi>theirs</hi> unto him. And ſure it were a great diſhonour unto Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that all great and publick things, nay every profitable Science and Art, ſhould in all ſocieties be diſtinguiſht, by their proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, Miniſters or Artiſts, and only Religion ſhould be in common,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:154187:106"/>
expoſed to be bruiſed by the hard hands of any Mechanicks, and ſullied by the rude touch of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning, undiſtinguiſht, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Perſons. In reaſon the means ſhould hold ſome proportion with their end; and therefore the end of this holy office, being divine and ſupernatural, 'tis reaſonable Perſons which enter into it, ſhould be able to ſhew their vocation, miſſion and ordination; for that the very deſign of Religion, forces us to a diſtinction of Perſons, and ſolemn call and ordination, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the office and work. And becauſe every one is not fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God in the publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of his Church; there muſt in reaſon be a ſolemn ſeparation, and ordination, made of thoſe Perſons, whoſe calling peculiarly is holy, and they thereby taught, and obliged to be ſo. That ſuch Perſons being made higher than the People, by their calling (though our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:154187:106"/>
in nature) may be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of conveying the Peoples Prayers unto God, and Gods bleſſings unto the People.</p>
            <p>Thus it was throughout the World, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time, either pretendedly or really, and if Chriſtian Religion allow otherwiſe, we muſt in effect confeſs, that we have the worſt Religion (which is blaſphemous diſhonour to Chriſtianity) and as falſe as its greateſt infernal enemy: Or that we are the worſt of Men, which is intolerable ſhame to our ſelves, and therefore to be diſowned and deteſted, in heart and deed.</p>
            <p>Let any favourer of theſe intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, name if they can, but one true and ſound Doctrine, which any one party, diſſenting from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the World, which was not before, ſufficiently and ſolidly, taught and proved, by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:154187:107"/>
lawful Paſtors: But who can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the dangerous errors, which have been multiplied and ſpread abroad by theſe diſſenters? <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> abroad and at home, have invaded the <hi>vnity, peace</hi> and <hi>proſperity,</hi> of almoſt all the reformed Churches, to the extream hazard of the Chriſtian Faith, to the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Sedition in State, Schiſme in Church, darkneſs and confuſion in both. While many pretend to ſtrive for the Truth, how do they darken their own underſtandings, as well as others, with tumult and clamor, wrath and bitterneſs, amongſt which truth is loſt on both ſides, as well as Charity? They write, and fight, as they ſay, for the Truth; but Truth and Love are ſlain in the quarrel, and preſt to death, is it were in a throng, whilſt they that ſtand by as neuters, laugh at both.</p>
            <p>What good Chriſtian can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member without ſorrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:154187:107"/>
the horrid confuſions, and diſmal effects, in Church and Kingdom, which they have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and maintained? The like whereof, if not greater, threatens us daily; if God in his mercy, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not our evil with his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>As to their ſeveral pretences to piety and holineſs; what hinder'd, or yet hinders them, from living as godlily, and as holily, with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and honour, within the Church, to its preſervation; as without it, and againſt it, they pretend to do, to its diſturbance, and deſtruction? A <hi>Surplice</hi> and <hi>Hood,</hi> a <hi>ſigning</hi> the Child with the <hi>Croſs</hi> at Baptiſme, a <hi>bowing</hi> to our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he is named, we have been often told, is what they bring, as their greateſt proof, of <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>will-worſhip;</hi> whereas the laſt, is manifeſtly no more, than to glorify with the body, or knee at ſometime, that which is lawful to do at any time;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:154187:108"/>
to whom God hath commanded us to <hi>bow our ſouls and bodies,</hi> and that <hi>to the glory of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to think that a <hi>Surplice</hi> is more ſuperſtitious, than a <hi>Gown</hi> or other garment, which God hath neither Commanded, nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, is it ſelf a great <hi>ſuperſtition:</hi> Nor can <hi>that,</hi> or the <hi>ſigning</hi> with the Croſs, be with any colour of truth or reaſon, called <hi>will-worſhip;</hi> which the Church profeſſeth, ſhe uſeth not, as any part of Gods Worſhip, but as an <hi>indifferent,</hi> yet <hi>decent</hi> ceremony; to <hi>ſignify</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> Man with, not to <hi>Worſhip</hi> God with; and what is not owned as any <hi>Worſhip,</hi> cannot ſurely be called <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when all is done, is this all, that muſt keep us at everlaſting difference and ſeparation? Can they ſtrein at ſuch Gnats, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtartle at ſuch ſhadows of Dreams in their own phanſies, yet ſwallow ſuch Camels, as <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:154187:108"/>
to lawful ſuperiors in Church and State? The hanious breach of Unity and Charity, peace and order in one and the other, expoſing both to the common enemy, firſt to deride, reproach and deſpiſe us, then to undermine and ruine us?</p>
            <p>How many <hi>Papiſts,</hi> how many <hi>Hereticks</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, yea how many <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and ſcornful <hi>deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of all Religion, have theſe our cauſeleſs, obſtinate diviſions, bred amongſt us?

Wo to them that have ſo torn the Church in pieces, that now the great things of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which God hath written, with the Pen of a Diamond, or Sun beam, are either neglected, or called in queſtion, while they contend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bowels of pity, mercy or piety;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154187:109"/>
write in gall, and fight in blood, for ſuch things as are at the beſt, but Hay and Stubble; compared with the precious foundation of our Religion. God grant both us and them, while it is time (if yet it be ſo) wiſdom and grace, to know and follow the <hi>things belonging to our peace,</hi> here and hereafter; and to take Chriſt's Yoak upon us, and <hi>learn of him,</hi> who was <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly</hi> in heart, that ſo we may find <hi>Reſt</hi> unto our <hi>Souls.</hi>
            </p>

I mean the Married Couple, who might come in, and claim their portion of this eternal Reſt; who are preſumed to aſſiſt each other, in all the great affairs of life; whoſe joys are or might be doubled, and their ſorrows abated, by a mutual bearing of each others good, or adverſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; inſomuch that when their ſcene of life is come to an end, and the Curtain drawn, they may lay them down in peace, and change the labour of a weary life, for the

joys of a bleſſed eternal Reſt: But how much otherwiſe falls it often out, even between theſe deareſt friends? What bitter complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are frequently heard in our ſtreets, from Perſons joyned in holy Wedlock, when but once diſaffected to one another? The unruly torrent of diſſentions, oft times runs ſo high, that the Man hates his own fleſh, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man man makes head againſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and theſe though ſacredly conjoyn'd and made one, become two again, ſo bitterly divided, that no wholſom words, nor ſage counſel, can ever ſweeten, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them.</p>
            <p>For prevention of this great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind miſchief, which ſo often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens amongſt us, and ſo much hinders that Reſt and quiet here, that much conduceth to a bleſſed, endleſs Reſt hereafter; Men ſhould do well wiſely to conſider, that whoſo enters the State of Marriage,

A Woman indeed ventures moſt; for ſhe hath no Sanctuary to retire to, from the ſad misfortune of an ill choice; ſhe muſt dwell upon her ſorrow, and hath no appeal from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, but that of Subjects from Tyrant Princes, Prayers and Tears, and though the Man hath more diverſions, (yet when it comes to his turn, to lie under this unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable ſadneſs) he muſt return to it again, and whilſt he is ſitting amongſt his Neighbours, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members the objection in his boſom, and ſighs deeply.</p>

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:154187:111"/>It hath been the unhappy chance of many, who enter the honourable ſtate of Marriage, upon ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable aims or other, to be bound to ſorrow and vexation for many years, by the Cords of their Conſorts peeviſh diſorder; and the worſt of the evil is, they are to thank their own follies, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no better choice: For God and goodneſs were leſs in their thoughts, and had leſs intereſt in their choice, than mony, to gratify their worldly covetouſneſs; or beauty, their inordinate luſt.</p>
            <p>Men and Women change their liberty of ſingle life, for a rich for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, prefer Gold before virtue, and ſhew themſelves to be <hi>leſs</hi> than money, by valuing it <hi>more</hi> than the wiſe content, and laſting felicity of their lives: and when they have counted their money and ſorrows well over, how willingly would they buy with the loſs of all that money, modeſty, ſweetneſs of

converſation, temperance and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in their Conſort.</p>
            <p>But they are chained with the fetters they choſe, and they are no whit the leſs chains, nor the eaſier, for being made of Gold or Silver, but ſometimes the worſe.</p>
            <p>Nor doth he honour Marriage aright, who chooſeth it only, or principally for beauty; <hi>Cui ſunt eruditi oculi, ſed ſtulta mens, Whoſe Eyes are judicious, but his ſoul and thoughts ſenſually fooliſh.</hi> A little thread of red and white, is an ill band of Conjugal affections, to tie hearts together, in all conditions till death, ſince their love is, nor can it be any better, or more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than its cauſe: and they are fond of each other, as long as phanſie and health laſts: But ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, child-bearing, care, time, and any thing almoſt that deſtroys a flower, may deſtroy that love, which at the beſt is but earthly and ſenſual.</p>

               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:154187:112"/>He that will find Reſt and quiet in his Conjugal State here, muſt begin it with God and goodneſs, with wiſe and virtuous deſigns.

            <p>To have a laſting quiet, and ſure content in the Conjugal life, it is prudent and uſeful, that all offences of each other be warily avoided, at the firſt beginnings eſpecially of their converſation: An infant bloſſom is quickly blaſted, and the love of lately Married Perſons is buſie and tender, inquiſitive and jealous, and apt to take a fright, or alarm, at every unkind word, or carriage: But after the hearts of Man and Wife are endeared to each other, by natural confidence, and experience, trifling accidents cannot diſturb their united affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but will vaniſh at the ſight, and remembrance of weightier obligements; and ſo after their having lived in peace, and love, and joy, for a while on Earth, they may meet and rejoyce together in Heaven to all eternity.</p>

A civil Perſon is never bitter againſt a ſtranger, much leſs a friend that enters his roof, and is ſecured there by the laws of Hoſpitality; and he ſurely is ſtrangely rude, who uſeth her rudely, that quits all her intereſt for him: and is beſides, as much the ſame Perſon, as another can be the ſame, having the ſame Religion, Children, and Family, and is fled for protection, as to a Sanctuary, not only to his houſe, but to his boſom and heart.</p>

               <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſaid well, that a wiſe Man will <hi>often admoniſh</hi> his Wife, <hi>reprove</hi> her <hi>ſeldom,</hi> but <hi>never</hi> lay his hands upon her. St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> tells us, that an Husband <hi>reviling</hi> or <hi>ſtriking</hi> his Wife is, as if a King ſhould <hi>uſe</hi> his Viceroy <hi>ſo,</hi> from whom moſt of that reverence and Majeſty muſt needs depart, which at firſt he put upon him, and the Subjects will pay him the leſs duty, by how much the rudelier the Prince hath treated him; the loſs redounds to the King himſelf, and the Government will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſordered and ruin'd. He that loves not his Wife and Children, feeds a Lyoneſs, and breeds nothing but fears and ſorrows to himſelf, nor can bleſſing it ſelf make him happy: All the Commandements of God, injoyning a Man to <hi>love</hi> his Wife, are but ſo many invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to him to be <hi>happy</hi> himſelf, and make her, and his Children ſo. If <hi>mutual love</hi> be once ſecured, there
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:154187:114"/>
can be no great danger from any thing elſe, becauſe ſuch love as makes the Man chaſt, keeps the Woman alſo within the ſober bounds of modeſt chaſtity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obedience</hi> is the Womans duty, which though no where expreſly enjoyned the Man to exact, yet is often commanded the Woman to pay, and the leſs it is exacted, the better and more kindly is it, when duly paid, both in the ſight of God and Man: And this proclaims her humility, and reverend eſteem of his Wiſdom, and is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the injunction impoſed by God; and though <hi>in ſorrow ſhe bring forth Children,</hi> yet with love and joy ſhe may bring them up.</p>
            <p>The Womans obedience though largely extended by St. <hi>Paul, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, <hi>as 'tis fit in the Lord, Colloſ.</hi> 3.18. The Womans duty obliges her to put on the Ornament of a meek and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154187:115"/>
quiet Spirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price: Sweetneſs of manners, humble comportment, fair interpretation of all things, that are capable of it, an induſtrious hand, a ſilent tongue, a faithful heart, to his Perſon and Bed, his Purſe and Eſtate.</p>
            <p>And that this may be done with chearfulneſs, it is one excellent height of Chriſtian Religion, above not only the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> but the <hi>Moſaical</hi> allowances; that it hath provided for Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Wife, by forbidding ſtrictly Poligamy, or the having many Wifes; and alſo hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden divorce, except in caſe of Adultery. By forbidding Poligamy, our Religion hath prevented all thoſe Domeſtick emulations, which would neceſſarily almoſt ariſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Leah</hi> and a <hi>Rachel,</hi> though in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family; a <hi>Sarah</hi> and a <hi>Hagar,</hi> though in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe: The Mans love runs in a fuller
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:154187:115"/>
ſtream, becauſe not divided into many rivolets; and the Womans love and faithfulneſs is demanded more juſtly, becauſe it hath an equal proportionable anſwer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the provocation of any Corrival. And then by forbidding divorce upon any pretence, but that of Adultery, it makes peace more neceſſary, and contention more terrible, ſeeing if they will not become a mutual comfort, they muſt always endure that mutual torment, from which they are allowed no refuge. If all this be not enough to ſettle Domeſtick peace, turn but your Eyes upon the wildeſt Creatures, let the Beaſts of the field, and the Fowls of the Air, ſhame us into it: For even the moſt unſociable hurtful Creatures, keep peace at home, in their own neſts and dens. What bloudy Tygar is there, that doth not ſoftly and tenderly demean himſelf over his Female Mate, and young Iſſue?
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:154187:116"/>
What ravenous Kite, doth not joyn with his ſhe partner, in Building his neſt, ſitting upon the Eggs, feeding his young ones? The Lyon doth not roar at home, nor tear his Lioneſs, nor devour his Whelps, but maintains peace at home, by his very enmity abroad: The prey of his foreign cruelty, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon food of his private den. Thus God from Heaven, Men on Earth, the Beaſts of the field, and Fowls of the Air, do all teach and inſtruct Man and Woman how to be happy, and to go by Couples to the Ark of their eternal Reſt.</p>
            <p>Now this eternal Reſt, muſt not be ſought, (becauſe it cannot be found) by a partial obedience, by leaving one ſin, and cleaving to another; every Man is not alike inclined to every ſin, nor can the purſuit of ſome pollutions, conſiſt with the proſecution of others; for ſins are contrary one to the other, as well as to grace: Nor is there any
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:154187:116"/>
thing more uſual, than for the violent unruly nature of raſh Man, to run out of hatred to one extream, into another oppoſite to it. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition dotes, prophaneſs is mad: And how many hating Superſtition, turn prophane? Whilſt others hating to be prophane, turn Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious? Covetouſneſs gathers all, prodigality ſcatters all; Men uſually fall into one extream, whilſt they run from another; either they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe propheſying, or think it all in all. To <hi>abhor Idols,</hi> and yet to <hi>commit Sacrilege;</hi> to worſhip the walls, or elſe to beat them down; is to drive out one Devil with another. The neceſſity of cleanſing our ſelves from theſe enormities, is plainly ſeen, by thoſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, which one ſinner gives another contrary to him. How doth the lukewarm or prophane deteſt the Schiſmatick and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious? Or how doth the furious Superſtitious, or blind Zealot, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:154187:117"/>

            <p>How doth the ſquanderer hate the niggard? And how doth the niggard hate the prodigal? <hi>Let me take my fill of luſt,</hi> ſaith the wanton, <hi>and I will trample upon wealth: Let me hug my Mammon,</hi> ſaith the Miſer, <hi>and I will bid defiance to luſt: Let me waſh my hands in the blood of mine enemy,</hi> ſaith the revengeful, <hi>and I will be content to give freely to them that have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, or injured me:</hi> Thus as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in times of darkneſs, had each of them their ſeveral Idols, which they Worſhipped, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected others, but all agreed in diſhonouring the only true God; ſo every partial falſe hearted refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, hath his boſom darling pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which if he may cheriſh, he can be content to leave the reſt; yea be forward and zealous againſt them, that he may either hide, or ſatisfie, or get an indulgence in what he affects. But all the virtue in the World, cannot ſatisfie for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:154187:117"/>
one willful, habitual pollution, indulgently cheriſh'd: Yea, that one indulged pollution, proves all the other ſeeming cleanſings to be but counterfeit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew many <hi>Amalekites,</hi> but ſparing <hi>ſome,</hi> when God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>all</hi> to the Sword, he forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Kingdom by his hypocriſy; and one of that Nation whom he ſpared, became afterwards his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner: Though it be but one known ſin you live in, the ſparing of that, ſhews your hatred againſt the reſt to be falſehearted and hypocritical: For though it be but one, it is contrary to that ſincere holineſs, which God indiſpenſably requires as his due; though it be but one, it is a reigning one; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing the purity, defacing the beauty, deſtroying the peace of an upright conſcience; yea though it be but one in actual appearance, yet in ſeminal virtue it includes many, and may in time be fruitful
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:154187:118"/>
of many: thus one ſin weakens grace, grieves Gods Spirit, prepares matter and fuel for others. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs and pride beget envy and ſtrife, that, anger; that, murther. Ambition led <hi>Abſalon</hi> to treaſonable conſpiracy againſt his Father, that, to open bloudy rebellion; that, to inceſt; any one pollution indulged unto, may introduce a whole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And though it be but one, it is a vilifying, and diſhonouring of God in all his perfections, for ſome unſatisfactory, tranſitory phanſy; and if it be habitually, unrelentingly continued in, will be puniſhed eternally with ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Gods preſence, to endleſs miſeries: And what folly is it, to loſe Gods favour, and incur his intolerable, eternal diſpleaſure, for one defiling tranſitory vanity? Thus you ſee he that will enjoy eternal Reſt, muſt cleanſe himſelf from <hi>all pollution,</hi> without deliberate habitual indulgence to any <hi>one.</hi>

of all Ages, all places (beſides the infallible Oracles of God which we have in our hands) will give us a full induction and proof of this truth. This Iſland wherein we live, hath given us not only many Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, but experimental ſenſible proofs, that from the King to the meaneſt Subject, we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing City here, nor ſetled Reſt and true happineſs.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe publick revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, viciſſitudes and changes, every Family, every private Perſon lies continually expoſed to caſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to variety of ſickneſs inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their health, variety of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations from thoſe above them, from thoſe below them, from thoſe about them, and alſo from their own follies, luſts and paſſions, from within them; in ſo much that whatſoever Men fix their hearts upon in this World, to take their greateſt contentment in, they cannot be ſure on reaſonable
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:154187:126"/>
grounds, that it ſhall continue with them one year longer.</p>
            <p>The felicity and ſatisfactory hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this City above, in which this eternal Reſt is to be found, ought to be valued ſo much the more, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath entered into the heart of Man to conceive, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe good things which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi> A grateful and pleaſant taſte of theſe good things, God affords the Souls of the faithful here in this life; how tranſcendently then, unutterable and unconceivable will be the full fruition of all that, which the Goſpel reveals to us but as in a glaſs, when enjoy'd to the height in the higheſt Heavens, through all eternity, when we ſhall ſee God as he is with everlaſting, overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction to all the faculties of the Soul? The Eye of Mart hath ſeen here admirable things in Art
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:154187:127"/>
and Nature; the Ear hath heard, and the Tongue hath taſted delicious things; and Mans heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much more than Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could ever preſent our ſenſes with. The very pleaſure of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral knowledge in the judgment of Perſons exerciſed therein, exceeds whatſoever ſenſuality, vain glory or covetouſneſs purſues or enjoys; and yet the <hi>knowledge and love of God in Chriſt,</hi> incomparably ſurpaſs, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, whatſoever the heart of the natural Man (advanced to the height) can conceive as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or delightful to it. How much more doth this City to come, and its endleſs unconceivable pleaſures, where this everlaſting Reſt is to be had, exceed even our expreſſions and conceptions when they are at the higheſt?</p>
            <p>If God hath provided ſuch good things for Mankind here below, in this World, which was not made for the place of our happineſs, but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:154187:127"/>
only to give us a tranſitory glimpſe, of his infinit wiſdom, power and goodneſs, and to draw our hearts after the Author of what we ſee; if he hath built this inferior World or City, which hath no foundations in compariſon of thoſe to come, with ſo much wiſdom, power and bounty, and made ſuch glorious Heavens as ſhine it forth to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and enamel'd it with ſuch variety of pleaſures, as even the beſt find it a matter of difficulty to part therewith; and yet God never intended when he built it, that it ſhould continue long: If there hath been ſo much coſt of accurate contrivance, and mighty bounty, laid out on that which was to laſt but for a time, what think we, muſt be the riches, beauty and glory of that City, which he intended ſhould endure to all eternity? Surely this World where we now live, is but as ſome out-houſes, to that Heavenly Palace, an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:154187:128"/>
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, a <hi>work-houſe,</hi> a place for Labour and Travel, before we come to our reſting place, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>place of rewards,</hi> as he calls Heaven. This is but a place to fit our ſelves in for the City above; a place it is wherein the greateſt part of its inhabitants, have diſhonour'd their maker, and him that made the World, by preferring its tranſitory pleaſures before him; diſorder'd themſelves, injured their brethren, and thereby fitted themſelves for that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Hell, or place of everlaſting puniſhment. And if the moſt wiſe and holy God, who made this World, and knew when he made it, that it might, and would be ſo abuſed, yet ſo beſpangled its roof with Stars, Sun and Planets, and laid its flowery foundation ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, fragrantly, fruitfully and uſefully; certainly that City which he hath erected for none but his beloved Servants to live in to all
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:154187:128"/>
eternity, muſt vaſtly ſurpaſs this in glory: And becauſe we can hardly conceive of inviſible future good things, but by ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to preſent and viſible, and Men are of ſeveral tempers, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and deſires; the Scriptures condeſcend thereto, and ſtrive to expreſs the next lifes happineſs, in all the variety of ſeveral notions which either ſenſe, phanſy or reaſon can deſire.</p>
            <p>The voluptuous ſeek for pleaſure and mirth; if they will have it, let them ſet their hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on him that made them and redeemed them, that he might ſanctify them and bring them to theſe delights they ſeek in him, they ſhall find when enter'd the City above, a feaſt of new refined Wines, a feaſt of Marrow and all delicacies, the joy of Harveſt, and of thoſe that divide the ſpoil of their enemies. They ſhall find a celeſtial Paradice or <hi>Eden</hi> of God,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:154187:129"/>
whereof that which was made for <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, continuing innocent, was but a tranſitory imperfect Map. There is the hidden Manna, hidden here but revealed there; a new Song always Sung, a Garden of Lillies and Roſes which never die, and whoſe fragrant ſcent never decays.</p>
            <p>The ambitious Mans heart is ſet on honour and glory, but if he will ſet his heart on God, and that honour which comes from him, in him he ſhall not fail to find a Kingdom of glory and immortality, a Crown of righteouſneſs, whoſe weight is exceeding and eternal, for his having preferred the God that made him, before the empty falſe hearted honours, which come to tempt him from his duty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, goodneſs and holineſs.</p>
            <p>The covetous Mans heart is ſet on riches; but if he will ſet his heart on God, in him he ſhall find everlaſting Treaſure; Manſions
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:154187:129"/>
that fail not, able to ſatisfie the utmoſt deſires of him that poſſeſſes them, either for duration or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: A City whoſe Walls and Gates are full of all manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>incorruptible and undefiled, that fades not away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. What ever we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit here is Subject to ſome, nay all of theſe; Corruption, defilement, and fading away, both we and it. The ſubſtance is embaſed and ſoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by ſome bad thing coming to it from without. All things in their beſt Eſtate, loſe their luſter, and fade away: One Mans inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance corrupts, by another Mans unthriftineſs, and is purchaſed by another, another's eſcheated or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated.</p>
            <p>We are weary here and then we Reſt, and are quickly as weary of our Reſt as of our wearineſs. The Creatures fail and tire, and diſappoint us, that we ſhould not
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:154187:130"/>
ſet up our Reſt in them, or in any inheritance here below, but be chaſed, and forced to ſeek our Reſt in God; with whom there is an inheritance laid up for us, in danger of none of all theſe; uncorrupt, that ſhall hold its being, and none can diſſeize us of it; undefiled, never embaſed by any mixture, and we our ſelves become undefiled, uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and unfading too, and what can the covetous in his largeſt thoughts deſire more.</p>
            <p>We have, or may have a natural certainty, by light of reaſon, that there is another future State, a life of Reſt and joy, after labour and ſorrow here. The Soul of Man which is a Spirit, whoſe operations are not only far above, what any body or matter is capable of, but can overrule and contradict, what ever the body moſt vehemently inclines to, embrace poverty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and death, with peace and joy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:154187:130"/>Since for certain, by light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is a God that made the World, and governs the World, and hath obliged Mankind by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions imprinted in his Soul, to piety and righteouſneſs, charity and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and yet hath left him a liberty to chuſe or refuſe; that he maybe rewarded for chuſing good, and puniſhed for the contrary: And ſince many chuſe the ways of ſin, who are not puniſhed in this World; and many chuſe the ways of virtue, who are not rewarded in this life; it follows by neceſſary conſequence of reaſon, from the juſtneſs and holineſs and goodneſs of God, that there muſt be another future life, wherein the proſperous wickedneſs of ſinners ſhall be puniſhed; the labours and ſufferings of godly, righteous, temperate, charitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, abundantly rewarded.</p>
            <p>All this the very Heathens many of them, have expreſly owned, and fairly proved, by their general
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:154187:131"/>
acknowledgemt, that 'twere bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuffer the loſs of life, and all its comforts, than to live in the practice of hainous vice, which could not be true, if there were no other life after this: And ſurely the notions of good and evil, being ſo deeply interwoven with Mens Souls, that the conſciences of thoſe who chuſe, and act that which is evil, though never ſo ſecretly, and ſo ſuccesfully, reproach them with the guilt of it, and terrify them with the apprehenſions of future puniſhment: And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of thoſe who chuſe and act that which is good, though never ſo much reproached and afflicted for ſo doing, cheers and comforts them with joyful hopes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ſome future reward. The Souls and Conſciences of Men being ſo deeply ſtamped with this, by him that made them, that no evaſions, or arts of hypocriſy, or ſubtile wickedneſs, can blot it out;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:154187:131"/>
it neceſſarily follows, as neceſſarily, and as ſurely, as that the reaſon and conſcience of Man was not made in vain, nor given him to make him the moſt abuſed, deluded, miſerable Creature in the World; even in that, which is the very dignity, and excellency of his nature; that there muſt be a life, wherein theſe notions and apprehenſions, ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſo general, muſt be verified. Thus far Reaſon by natural light may enable, and hath in effect em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred many to believe, that there is a reſting place for the virtuous, not to be found here but hereafter; <hi>Commorandi locum natura nobis, non habitandi domicillium dedit:</hi> No abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding City here, but one to come: Heaven is the proper Country for Mans Soul, which came from thence inſpir'd by God, <hi>Divina quaedam particula aurae;</hi> and thither tends.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this light is obſcure and imperfect, compared with that of Revelation; therefore the main
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:154187:132"/>
irrefragable evidence, both that there is another ſtate to come, and of its tranſcendent happineſs, bleſſed Reſt and tranquility, as to Soul and body, is to be fetcht from the <hi>holy Oracles,</hi> and there we have it indeed, as fully and as cleerly revealed, as this our Mortality is capable of; proved by all the demonſtrations of the Spirit, which attentive reaſon can deſire.</p>
            <p>For, there we have the Son of God <hi>deſcending</hi> from Heaven, to take our <hi>Nature,</hi> and in that nature to teach and exemplify, the only way that leads thither, and purchaſe our admiſſion to it, (to this Crown of life, to this reſting place, to this City to come) by his <hi>death;</hi> thereby procuring for us an <hi>inheritance</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more worthy, than all our <hi>labours</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> here can come to. This Reſt is not allotted for ſluggards, drowſy, ſlothful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſquander away their precious hours in earthly trifles, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:154187:132"/>
think not this glorious eternal City, and Reſt there, which Chriſt hath bought with his own blood, worth their ſeeking, untill they have nothing elſe to ſeek: Yea, when this eternal Reſt is offered them, by Gods preventing grace, have no heart to give him his price, when the price is only to part with that which is vain and temporal, for that which is ſatisfactory and eternal.</p>
            <p>The way to this Reſt, ſaith our Lord, is <hi>ſtreight</hi> and <hi>narrow,</hi> through temptations without, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within, and therefore cannot be found but by thoſe that ſeek it, with attentive heed. God indeed ſeeks us firſt, ſhews us this City where this happineſs and Reſt is to be found, and the way to it, invites and enables us to obtain it, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>holineſs,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> which qualify us for it. Even the things of this tranſitory life here below, its riches and honours (ſuch
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:154187:133"/>
as they are) are ſeldom attained but by diligent ſeeking; and can we think this heavenly inheritance, with all its joys, and riches, and honours, ſhould be attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſtant ſtudious diligence? And the more we labour and ſuffer here, the more ſweet and pleaſant will be our Reſt when it comes. <hi>Grata quies feſſis,</hi> Reſt we know is welcome to the weary Traveller: And now, Courteous Reader, I have by this time poſſibly wearied, and tired thee out, in a long and tedious walk; but it was, only the better to fit and prepare thee for an happy, ſeaſonable and laſting Reſt, that I have thus carried thee through a rough unbeaten path (the path of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity, Meekneſs, Patience, Temperance, Humility, Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi>) all which come, but as ſo many faithful guides, ſafely to conduct thee to the gates of Heaven; and give thee even in this life, by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:154187:133"/>
a taſt of the joys of that other, even of that place, where Saints and Angels ſhall be thy Companions, and where thou ſhalt <hi>ſee God Face to Face,</hi> who is <hi>Wiſdom, Purity, Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>all perfections.</hi> I cannot leave thee better, than where thou haſt ſo near an approach to this glorious proſpect of eternal Reſt: Only one thing I have, at parting, to remind thee of, viz. <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire,</hi> or <hi>Come ye bleſſed inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> one of theſe two muſt be thy doom, and the final ſentence of all fleſh: Let it therefore be thy Wiſdom as well as Duty, to chuſe that better part, which can never be taken from thee, to chuſe God and eternal life, before riches and honours and pleaſures, and all that this World can give: And to prefer an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal boundleſs good, before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain tranſitory vanities, ſure
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:154187:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to end in eternal ſorrow; that ſo thy toilſom weary Travel here, may have its accompliſhment in eternal Reſt hereafter. <hi>Amen, Amen, Amen.</hi>
