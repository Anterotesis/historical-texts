            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a readier way for the advancement of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rather to leſſen and abate, than to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the number of many needleſs contentions in the Church: therefore when I firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to anſwer that very worthleſs Author, <hi>The GAGGER of all Proteſtants mouthes for ever,</hi> I did it with a firmed purpoſe to leave all Private Opinions, and Particular Poſitions or Oppoſitions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, unto their owne Authors or Abbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, eyther to ſtand or fall of themſelves; and not to ſuffer the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to be charged with the maintenance of any Doctrine which was none of Her own, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely and univerſally reſolved on. For we are at a great diſadvantage with our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, to have thoſe <hi>Tenents</hi> put and preſsed evermore upon us, for the Generall Doctrine eſtabliſhed in our <hi>Church,</hi> which are but eyther the Problematic all Opinions
<pb facs="tcp:13163:3"/>
of <hi>Private Doctors,</hi> to be held or not held eyther way; or elſe the Fancies many of them of <hi>Factious men,</hi> diſclaimed and cenſured by the <hi>Church,</hi> not to be held any way, Such diſadvantages hath <hi>This Church</hi> too long endured: and out of juſt indignation againſt this <hi>Gagger</hi> and his Fellowes, I could not but ſo much the more labour to vindicate Her Freedom <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſo,</hi> and to aſſert Her (as far as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) unto Her owne proper, true, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Tenents,</hi> ſuch as be without any doubt or queſtion, legitimate and genuine, ſuch as Shee will both acknowledge and maintain for her owne.

ourſelves, to be taken and defended for the common and publicke Doctrine of the <hi>Church:</hi> but more eſpecially hath it incenſed thoſe <hi>Claſsicall Puritans,</hi> who were wont to paſse all their Strange Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, Sabbatarian Paradoxes, and Apocalypticall Frenſies, under the Name and Covert of <hi>The True Profeſſors of Proteſtant Doctrine;</hi> ſuppoſing, as it ſhould ſeeme, that in this caſe we were all lyable to the <hi>Statute,</hi> that is, bound to keepe and foſter their Conceits as our owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, becauſe they have caſt them upon Us and upon <hi>Our Church,</hi> like Baſtards upon the Pariſh where they were borne, or Vagabonds on the Towne where they laſt dwelt, or were ſuffered to paſse without due correction. Such Irchins it was neceſsary to disband, and ſend them away to ſhift for themſelves, that our Mother the <hi>Church</hi>

might no more be troubled with them. And yet for this cauſe have ſome <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> Articled againſt me, and traduced me to the World for a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and an <hi>Arminian;</hi> though the world and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves know, I flatly defied and oppoſed the One; and <hi>GOD</hi> in Heaven knoweth that I never ſo much as yet read word in the other. It was my happineſs, <hi>MOST GRATIOUS SOVERAIGNE,</hi> that ſo meane a Vaſsall as my poore ſelfe was ſufficiently knowne to be nor So nor So, unto <hi>Him,</hi> who, if ever any of the Royall ranke, was indeed <hi>ſicut Angelus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> to diſcerne, my late <hi>MOST SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRED LORD</hi> and <hi>MASTER</hi> of ever Bleſſed memory, unto whom that Information ſhould have beene repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; by whom, in his moſt able and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall judgement, I had my <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi>

It was read, approved,
<pb facs="tcp:13163:5"/>
and ſent to the Preſſe accordingly.

MOUNTAGU in his book, as they have tendred it, and no otherwiſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that all particulars ſo deſigned by Them, and ſaid to have beene delivered by Him, were <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed</hi> by warrant of <hi>Authoritie. Thirdly,</hi> that all things ſo <hi>Publiſhed,</hi> and ſo <hi>Delivered,</hi> and by Themſelves, the Informers, inſiſted on, and complained againſt, are <hi>Errors</hi> actuall in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo ſtand reſolved and accounted of in the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe three, that is to ſay, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or not, whatſoever is ſo inſiſted on, as <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> hath beene ſo <hi>Delivered</hi> and <hi>Publiſhed</hi> as is ſuggeſted, muſt hereafter bee examined in convenient Time and Place. For haply all hath not beene ſo by Him <hi>Delivered,</hi> as They have ſurmiſed and informed: at leaſt, not in that ſenſe as is conceived. They may miſtake his meaning: why not? For have they aſſiſtance of Infallibility annexed unto their conceipts; eſpecially in a preſt and ſhort ſtyle by him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and inclining to Scholaſticall Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter? Or they may wilfully miſtake his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to their owne advantage: for Faction and Affection are too frequently intereſſed in Oppoſitions. Or laſtly, they may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough bee guiltie of miſreporting his words: I dare not truſt their conſciences in that point too farre. I know their Charitic is not too tranſcendent.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Publication</hi> by <hi>Authoritie,</hi> it may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13163:15"/>
touch them neerer than they are aware of. It is not unknowne not Authoritie, that Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanicall Selfe-conceit, and Preſumption, will ſquare Law and Goſpel too according unto that untoward Lesbian rule of their owne <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit,</hi> and ſpeciall opinion: and dare challenge any Authoritie, old or new, for <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;</hi> preaching, publiſhing, maintaining <hi>Errors;</hi> viz. whatſoever doth not conſort or run with the Tide of their <hi>Private Spirits</hi> motion. And it hath beene found by experience practiſed of ſuch male-content maligners at States in being, Civill as well as Eccleſiaſticall, that they ſeldome or never talke of anie misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, miſordering, miſdemeaning, in any point or caſe, but that ever and anon, directly or upon the By, they can lend a laſh unto, or pinch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credite of <hi>Authoritie,</hi> though moſt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,</hi> that great <hi>Cordolium</hi> and Moate-in-the-eye unto popular irregularitie, and puritanicall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the Idoll of our <hi>Godly Brethren.</hi> It is more than probable, theſe Informers are of this ſtamp and making. I have bin told, and am aſſured, they are two <hi>Grandees</hi> of the faction; as great and turbulent, as moſt bee in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of <hi>Norwich</hi> (which is not improbably thought to have of that Sect mo than enow.) They hold <hi>Authoritie</hi> intereſſed (as farre at leaſt as connivency goeth) both for points of <hi>Poperie</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> if they could bee proved his againſt whom they are objected.</p>

If it had not beene their purpoſe thus to have grated upon and galled <hi>Authority;</hi> with little ado, by the addition of but one poor word, they might have amended and cleered all. Had the Information beene carried and conceived thus: <hi>and</hi> SAID <hi>to bee publiſhed by Authority;</hi> the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> if any were, muſt have laid all and every one hard upon M.

Had this beene done, M. MOUNTAGU muſt have borne all alone: and, what had it been that Hee erred? He who may erre, <hi>(For in many things wee erre all)</hi> but will be no Hereticke, eſpecially againſt the Church of <hi>England;</hi> to the doctrine whereof eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, He hath more than once ſubſcribed: and therefore diſclaimeth all aſperſion of <hi>Poperie,</hi> and is farther from it than any <hi>Puritan</hi> in the kingdome. He is indeed well acquainted with ſuch Imputations, as <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Arminian,</hi> and I know not what, the ordinary language of of our preciſe Profeſſors, againſt any man that is not, as themſelves, MORE FURIOSO <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſta.</hi> And having had this meaſure often meted unto him from their verie great <hi>Zeale,</hi>

and very <hi>no-Charitie,</hi> hee could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have contemned their malice (the rather, becauſe a Scold cannot any better way bee charmed than by contempt): but becauſe <hi>Authoritie</hi> was drawne in, to lye at the ſtake for <hi>conniving</hi> in points ſo <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> (but God knoweth how); he could not poſſeſſe his ſoule in patience, but thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in duetie and in conſcience bound to cleere thoſe points from Error which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, leſt <hi>Sacred Authoritie</hi> might come in for Maintenance and Champetry, as they would have it.

                     <hi>judgement,</hi> (it ſeemeth) as well as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> unto his chayre.

And ſuch prevailing power have they upon their Proſelites (none living but <hi>Ieſuites</hi> ſo great as they) that their Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are held uncontroleable. And hence it is, that they vouchſafe us no proofe in their ſo many falſe Imputations. Better Popery, I will abide by it, than any one propoſition in M. MOUNTAGU. For what difference betwixt their Dictates and Papall Deciſions? an abortive <hi>Embryo</hi> of the much groned-for Monarchie of our Puritanicall Parochiall, would-be Popes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kaeſars,</hi> and <hi>All that are called Gods.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Error</hi> then is ever againſt a rule. In points of Faith <hi>Error</hi> is, or ſhould bee, againſt the <hi>rule of Faith.</hi> Scripture is, they will not deny, the <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> as proceeding from Revelation divine, the true <hi>Conſtat</hi> and Canon of Faith and Manners.

I will not bee put over unto Claſſicall deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor that Idoll of ſome mens Reformation, unto any Propheticall determinations in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conventicles after Lectures. For when departed <hi>The Spirit of God</hi> from mee, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conformable Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ſpeake unto them? But becauſe the

freely through the grace of GOD in CHRIST, might fall away again from Grace <hi>Totally, finally,</hi> and become a caſt-away, as IU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAS was, for ever. For S. PETER (upon admiſſion of this Paſſage, as your ſelves have related it in your calumniatory Information) by M. MOUNTAGU'S concluſion, did not, could not fall <hi>finally;</hi> for CHRIST prayed for him, that he might not fall; and CHRIST was ever heard in that hee prayed for. So that out of your owne mouthes M. MOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGU is acquitted of <hi>Arminianiſme:</hi> for if He ſay any thing to the point, it is, that S. PETER could not fall <hi>finally</hi> from Faith, nor loſe it for ever irrecoverably. For, ſay you, Theſe are his words, <hi>Though</hi> S. PETER <hi>fell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, he fell not eternally,</hi> that is, hee recovered and perſevered unto the end. and ſo <hi>touching finall Perſeverance,</hi> at leaſt, He teacheth, in your own confeſſion, no otherwiſe than your ſelves do. Thus <hi>Pure</hi> malice and indiſcreet zeale make men many times loſe their witts they know not where.</p>

If you be Beneficed men, you have <hi>read</hi> it and <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> it, <hi>profeſſed</hi> your <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> thereto, before GOD and his CHURCH, or elſe by <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> you have <hi>forfeited your ſpirituall promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and are <hi>deprived</hi> IPSO FACTO <hi>within two moneths.</hi> If ſo; then have you ſubſcribed that <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> which you impute as an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> unto me. Haply you will be of his minde, one of your Tribe, who when he was told what hee had <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> (for, poore ignorant man, he underſtood it not) proteſted he would teare his <hi>ſubſcription</hi> if he could come by it; and ſo would have loſt his Benefice: which few of you will doe, if it be a Good one, for conſcience ſake; marry for a Poore one you will not ſtick. Haply you will quarrell the Senſe of the ARTICLES: but then you muſt remember, that the plaine words ſound to the meaning for which I have produced
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13163:28"/>
them, and that untill the CHURCH it ſelfe expound otherwiſe, it is as free for me to take it according to the letter, as for you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a figure. The ARTICLE inſiſteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men <hi>Iuſtified,</hi> ſpeaketh of them <hi>after Grace received;</hi> plainly avoucheth, <hi>They may fall away, depart from that ſtate which once they had,</hi> they <hi>may by Gods Grace riſe againe,</hi> and become new men: <hi>Poſsible,</hi> but not <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> or <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> But the meaning by you aſſigned cannot be good, being allied unto the ſtocke you are: for by your Tribe, the true meaning of the ARTICLE, and the Doctrine there <hi>Delivered</hi> and <hi>Publiſhed by Authority,</hi> ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther originall or derived, primary or ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was upon this very point challenged as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,</hi> becauſe againſt the current of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</hi> And had <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> then been a nickname, the challenge without doubt had faſtned there: but challenged it was in this Senſe as <hi>Vnſound</hi> at the <hi>Conference</hi> of <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> by thoſe that were Petitioners againſt the Doctrine and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And being ſo <hi>challenged</hi> before <hi>His ſacred Majeſty,</hi> was then and there <hi>Defended,</hi> maintained, avowed, <hi>averred</hi> for <hi>True,</hi> ancient, juſtifiable, good and <hi>Catholick,</hi> by the greateſt Biſhops, and <hi>learnedſt Divines</hi> then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in this Church, againſt that abſolute, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpective, neceſſitating and <hi>fatall Decree</hi> of your new <hi>Predeſtination;</hi> ſtiled by you, <hi>The Doctrine</hi>

                  <p>If you be acquainted with the LITURGY and publicke religious SERVICE of our Church (as to your ſhame few of you and your Divines are or will be, unleſſe it bee to oppoſe and cavill at it), there you ſhall find al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as much as <hi>Falling from grace</hi> commeth to.

                     <hi>Baptiſme</hi> we are taught (otherwiſe than your Maſters teach), that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry child which is duly baptized, being before borne in originall ſinne, and in the wrath of God, is now by that Laver of Regeneration received into the</hi>

And leſt it ſhould be left to mens CHARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY (as you uſe to tell the world), wee are there taught <hi>earnestly to</hi> BELEEVE, <hi>that</hi> CHRIST <hi>hath favourably</hi> RECEIVED <hi>theſe infants that are baptized, that he hath</hi> EMBRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CED <hi>them with the armes of his mercy, that he hath</hi> GIVEN <hi>unto them the</hi> BLESSING <hi>of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERNALL LIFE; and out of that BELIEF and PERSWASION, wee are to <hi>give thankes faithfully and devoutly for it, &amp;c.</hi> To make which doctrine the more ſure againſt all Noveliſts, it is againe repeated in the <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> to the end that children might likewiſe bee nourſed up in it, and taught, that <note n="e" place="margin">Catechiſme anſw. 2.</note>

                     <hi>it is</hi> CERTAINELY TRUE <hi>by the Word of</hi> GOD, <hi>that children being baptized have</hi> ALL <hi>things neceſſary for their ſalvation; and if they die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actuall ſinne, ſhall be</hi> UNDOUBTEDLY SAVED.

Church, that children duly baptized are put into the STATE of GRACE and SALVATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON (which you ſee you cannot, you muſt not deny), and both your and my experience will ſhew, that many ſo baptized children, when they come to age, by a wicked and leud life do <hi>fall away from God,</hi> and from that STATE of GRACE and SALVATION, wherein hee had ſet them, to a worſe STATE; wherein they ſhall never be ſaved. If you grant not this, you muſt hold, that all men that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are ſaved; which I know you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe.</p>
                  <p>To make an end then. In my judgement this is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not delivered according unto private opinions in ordinary Tracts and Lectures, but delivered publickly, poſitively, and declaratorily in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall Records.

GOD alone could not <hi>communicaie ſe, ſua,</hi> or <hi>de ſuis,</hi> but by producing an Object communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to whom or which hee might impart as, and what, he pleaſed. Which, when nothing was at all but himſelfe, muſt and doth put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another purpoſe and Act of his, to Create; which is, framing of ſomething out of meer nothing: nor can poſſibly any other Act, or reſolution and counſell, prevent this, much leſſe that of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> yet unheard of. As is the Cauſe, ſuch is the Effect; eſpecially, a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, Sufficient, Immediate Cauſe. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was then, and could not be but ſo, like the Creator, that is, good: and accordingly wee have that <hi>Elogium Creaturae,</hi> ALL <hi>things were exceeding good.</hi> But Good is, and muſt be of a double alloy; Changeably, or elſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably good. Thus good, is onely GOD; without beginning, not to have end; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change or ſhadow of change. Man thus made by GOD good, as otherwiſe than ſo he could not be, was yet made by him changeably good: in as much as, that being created, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than ſo, hee muſt not nor could bee.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13163:44"/>
Good he was, but Bad he might be: Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, out of the hands of GOD; but left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, in the hands of his owne counſell, unrighteous. That, changing ſtate of Being, if haply he ſhould change, his alteration might be his <hi>owne</hi> Act, imputable to <hi>himſelfe,</hi> not his <hi>Maker;</hi> his endowments muſt be ſuch, as, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe himſelfe would, none elſe could hurt or annoy him. And ſuch indeed they were, ſo ſufficient in themſelves, able to hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt oppoſition and aſſault, unleſſe baſely and cowardly hee would betray the Fort upon ſummons of a Foe. Thus he did: ſo he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelfe. Uſing his freedome of will not well as he ought, he loſt his freedome, undid himſelfe, and his whole race then in his loins. EVE took up ſinne from the divell upon lone: ADAM by Conſent acknowledged the band, <hi>&amp; uſura crevit Posteritas.</hi> For being the root and originall of all mankinde, hee received what he had, for himſelfe and his; and loſt what he forfeited, for them all. Falling thus from GOD, hee fell not alone: his poſterity were together with him plunged into one bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit of perdition, and maſſe of damnation, through their <hi>owne</hi> fault. Thither they fell: not there were they put. GOD made not man unto deſtruction: much leſſe did he make him to deſtroy him. As GOD'S Acts are in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. ſo were they formerly in Intention. But Creation was before Fall or Reſtoring:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13163:45"/>
therefore ſo was it alſo in GOD'S purpoſe. Thus farre we have gone, and not a word of <hi>Predeſtination:</hi> for how could it bee in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? There muſt needs firſt be a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before there can bee conceived <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Dereliction;</hi> unto which we are now comne in the maſſe of perdition, as they call it.

IRRESPECTIVE, without relation unto their Repentance.

                  <p>I Muſt and do confeſſe, I am of that mind, and thinke ſo ſtill; that the idle fellow the <hi>Gagger</hi> had done much better, had merited more at GOD and mens hands, to ſpeake in his owne language, and deſerved better of the Church, and have done better ſervice to GOD Almighty: as alſo might the <hi>major</hi> part by

much of his Side, if they would bee more ſparing in multiplying controverſies and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; and ſo in diſquieting the peace of the Church in points of that nature, which doe not ſo concerne the ſtate of mans ſoule, or his walking in the waies of GOD'S commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or <hi>knowing of Him, the onely true</hi> GOD, <hi>and whom he hath ſent,</hi> IESUS CHRIST. Now was ARMINIUS alſo of that opinion? If he were not, how am I or can I bee an ARMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIAN for this? If he were of this opinion, then hath hee been deeply wronged by you and others, that make him an Incendiary, a Bontifeu, a <hi>Flabellum</hi> of faction and ſedition, ſo much undeſervedly, in both Church and State; that charge him ſo deeply as you have done with troubling the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering that State, by moving Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Preſcience, Perſeverance, Predeſtination, univerſall Grace, Free-will, and loſſe of Faith. And ſurely M. MOUNTAGU deſerved a more moderate and leſſe empaſsioned cenſure, than to bee informed againſt for moving of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which toucheth deep, and will beare (I trowe) an ACTION <hi>of the Caſe:</hi> who hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore deteſted that humour of Innovators, that take the diſquieting of things eſtabliſhed, a ſufficient hire to ſet them on work; who for feare of offending that way, concealed both his owne opinion often, and ſometime the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, which haply he ſhould
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13163:53"/>
not have done. Is hee therefore ſeditious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he refuſed to diſpute, diſcourſe or talke <hi>de omni Ente?</hi> to conteſt for every thing, <hi>ut pro aris &amp; focis?</hi> to make a Caſe of faith or conſcience, of every ſpeculation? or becauſe hee profeſſeth his diſlike of multiplying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in thoſe kindes, which increaſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcord and troubles in Church and in State, than ſerve to edification? It is ſtrange, that for wiſhing, adviſing, and in his owne particular uſing and enſuing that moderation, thereby not to engarboile the Church, and diſturb the courſe of piety, he ſhould ſo, by you and yours, be blamed, accuſed, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for a PAPIST and an ARMINIAN; calumniated, almoſt in every Ordinary, by your means, for a dangerous driver at Popery and Sedition; being with one breath, in the ſelfe-ſame points, blamed for being ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, for ſaying no more; for not mooving, favouring, fomenting unneceſſary quarrels and diſunions, in queſtions of ſpeculation and of obſcurity; adviſing rather to reſerve them for, and referre them to the Schools (though your honeſt ſimplicity, or PURE charity, thought it fit to conceale this his moderate wiſh or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice), rather than to thunder and lighten in your Pulpits with them, <gap reason="foreign">

ſay? that men ſhould have ſuch whirle-gigs in their brains, and be ſo farre at variance with their owne wits, as to imply contradiction <hi>in adjecto?</hi> to charge M.

For in ſuch and ſo great variety of errors or opinions touching free-will, it may be, that not one of them all is true; but that more than one of them ſhould be true, it cannot be, as CICERO ſpake in another caſe.

                  <p>But haply theſe things came in upon the Bye, to make up the muſter, and fill up the accuſation of ARMINIANISME, <hi>ut quae non proſunt ſingula, multa juvent.</hi> That which moſt offendeth, and is inexpiable, followeth in the Rere; <hi>The controverted particulars are of no ſuch great moment, upon due examination.</hi> And this is ARMINIANISME in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: becauſe, forſooth, the contrary hath often paſſed the hedge of your teeth; you have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the contrary from your Pulpits, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proclaimed in your Lectures and Sermons, that in the point of <hi>Free-will</hi> the Church of

                     <hi>Rome</hi> abſolutely and wholly <hi>Pelagianizeth,</hi> are enemies profeſſed unto the Grace of CHRIST, advancing naturall Indowments above, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them before Grace: that they raze the foundation, make CHRIST none, or a partiall Mediator; Man beholding to none, but to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for his ſalvation; and that we muſt for ever, upon paine of Damnation (ſtrange Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares and <hi>Terriculamenta)</hi> diſſent from them, in this as in all things elſe, &amp; have no PEACE at all with them.

We eat, we drinke, we ſleep, wee wake, wee walk, we reſt, wee runne, wee talk, wee hold our peace, we conſent, aſſent, diſagree; freely wittingly, willingly, without any conſtraint, out of the naturall power of our <hi>Free-will.</hi> And yet further for your ſakes I adde. It were well done, and worth the while, as SCOTUS ſaid well, <hi>to cudgell him well and thriftily, that</hi>

                     <hi>ſhould deny</hi> FREE-WILL, <hi>ſo long, untill hee did confeſſe it to be in our power to goe on, to ceaſe, or hold our hands.</hi> And if he ſhould commence an action of battery, to put in this Barre; It was not I that beat him, it was FATALL NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSITY; and I was <hi>thereby compelled</hi> to doe it. I had not any FREE-WILL to reſiſt: it was not in my power to doe, or not to doe otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But concerning <hi>Freewill,</hi> the power, poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and activity of the will in the things of GOD, towards GOD, in the ſtate of grace, I have ſet downe my <hi>Errors,</hi> as you call them, in two propoſitions, tendred unto mee, and unto you alſo, of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Firſt, that <hi>Man in ſtate of naturall corruption cannot turne nor prepare himſelfe unto</hi> GOD, <hi>by or through his owne naturall and humane power and ſtrength.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>Prevented by grace, and by grace aſsiſted, hee putteth to his hand, to procure augmentation of that grace; as alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:13163:63"/>
                     <hi>unto the end in that grace.</hi> No man commeth unto GOD, but he is drawne: being drawne, hee runneth or walketh as his aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is, and his owne agility and diſpoſition, unto the end. No man beareth fruit in CHRIST IESUS the Vine, unleſſe that by the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hee bee engraffed. To engraffe, is <hi>opus Hortulani</hi> ALONE. When as the branch is engraffed, that it may proſper and beare fruit, the root muſt ſupply; the ſlip ſucke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſap ſupplied from the root. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: no more need bee curiouſly inſiſted on or diſputed of. The Church of <hi>England</hi> doth no way contradict this: it is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe doctrine of our Church, ARTIC. X. <hi>The condition of man after the Fall of</hi> ADAM, <hi>it ſuch, that he cannot turne nor prepare himſelfe by his owne naturall ſtrength and good works, to faith and calling upon</hi> GOD. <hi>Wherefore we have no power to doe good works pleaſant and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto</hi> GOD, <hi>without the grace of</hi> GOD <hi>by</hi> CHRIST <hi>preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have it.</hi> Man is heer in this paſſage, by the Church, conſidered two waies: as in Nature depraved; as in Nature againe by Grace reſtored. In Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depraved, <hi>Freewill</hi> is totally denied, unto man, for any workes of righteouſneſſe, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or pleaſing unto GOD, before converſion; or for works of actuall concurrency in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of firſt converting: but not for workes

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13163:71"/>
ARTICLES of our CREED; which only be thoſe Tenents and Points of faith, that have indeed, and ſo muſt have, Univerſality, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Conſent, Knowledge.

                  <p>It is, belike, <hi>Popery</hi> to ſay, that in them, in theſe <hi>Fundamentall Points,</hi> A true and lawfull generall Councell never erred <hi>de facto,</hi> becauſe

(forſooth) <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, that a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell cannot erre.

Verge that part of the Catholick Church which is now <hi>regnant</hi> in heaven, and free from all <hi>Error,</hi> as partaking of that bliſſe which leadeth infallibly, holdeth inſeparably in all Truth. In this ſenſe and acceptation, the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not quarrelled: <hi>The Church</hi> ſo, hath not, <hi>cannot Erre.</hi> The ſecond divided part, ſtinted from ſo large an extent, is yet enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged reſpectively, to all members, to every member in particular of the Catholick Church, living any where, at any one time. ſo that the <hi>whole</hi> aggregation of all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> profeſſors, make and compoſe this Church.

AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIC. XIX. touching the Church thus we read: <hi>The</hi> VISIBLE CHURCH <hi>of</hi> CHRIST <hi>is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of faithfull men, in the which the pure word of</hi> GOD <hi>is preached, and the Sacraments be duely miniſtred, &amp;c.</hi> Where <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> are convertible tearmes. That doctrine then, to which you ſhould, and would ſeeme to have ſubſcribed, talketh of no <hi>inviſible,</hi> but a <hi>viſible Church;</hi> tendreth no <hi>Inviſibility.</hi> And it is a Poſition drawne out from thence, and publiſhed, that there is a Church of CHRIST, not onely <hi>inviſible,</hi> but alſo <hi>viſible.</hi> Though for <hi>inviſible,</hi> it is more than that <hi>Article</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifieth; yet is it moſt true, that there is a Church alſo <hi>inviſible:</hi> which was never deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or thought upon to be denied. Secondly, it is alſo concluded thence, that the <hi>viſible</hi> Church is a Catholick Church. So the Church is <hi>viſible,</hi> and the Church is <hi>inviſible:</hi> both which I beleeve and profeſſe, diſtinctly taken,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13163:80"/>
and as it ought to bee underſtood. For theſe, though ſeeming, are not contradictory Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. The Church is <hi>inviſible</hi> in her more noble parts; the Saints, both regnant in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and militant in earth; ſuch as be <hi>ſecreti</hi> and <hi>occultè intus;</hi> ſuch as bee <gap reason="foreign">

I doe alſo beleeve and profeſſe a <hi>viſibility</hi> of the Church on earth, neceſſarily, <hi>toto ſui,</hi> though not <hi>totâ ſe:</hi> in ſome part or other at all times; though in all parts of the world, or it ſelfe, intire, at no one time. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>viſible</hi> in the ampleſt maner that can be, is <hi>ſo viſible,</hi> that there is nothing in it, or of it, but is <hi>viſible.</hi> It never was, it never ſhall be, it is wholly impoſſible to bee, that at ſome time or other there could not be found, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one part or corner of the world, not any part <hi>viſible</hi> of that Church Catholick. The Divell never did, nor ever ſhall, ſo farre and fully prevaile againſt GOD and GOD'S King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as to effect or procure ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deſolation. And ſo is it true (for of this onely reſtrainedly I ſpake), <hi>Non eſt, quod nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam videtur;</hi> not generally true, I grant, and without limitation. There ever was, and will bee ever, upon earth a <hi>viſible</hi> Church ſome where or other, with viſible cogniſances, marks and ſignes to be diſcerned by, ſuch as be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the XIX. <hi>Article;</hi> to which men may
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13163:81"/>
repaire to heare GOD'S Word; where Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are miniſtred, and may be received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation; where Prieſthood and Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is and may be had according to CHRIST'S miſſion and commiſsion. You cannot produce any time, out of any Records or Memorials, extant or remembred, in which and by which it may appeare, that theſe things were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The Churches of the Eaſt, <hi>Aſia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> were a long time <hi>viſible,</hi> eminent, and glorious. The Churches of the Weſt have held it out longer. Since there firſt was a Church in <hi>England, France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> there hath not ceaſed to bee a Church there. And if in any of theſe places, or all theſe places, the Church ſhould ceaſe or not bee <hi>viſible,</hi> yet would it be ſtill <hi>viſible</hi> otherwhere, though not ever alike, nor to like purpoſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I do call thoſe <hi>Some</hi> mens doctrines in this point, <hi>Private Opinions:</hi> and ſo well may I doe, in reſpect of the diſinvalidity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of them; being private mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and no publick propoſals or reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church. I call them not ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of paucity of propoſers: for they may bee many, a ſtrong, potent, prevailing partie that thus opine, and runne a courſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their owne <hi>Tenents,</hi> againſt or beſide publick, enacted and authorized doctrine.

pleaſing unto GOD, and commendable with men, if your ſelves and ſuch Halfers in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>omnium horarum homines</hi> for your private ends, would openly avow what covertly you conceale; and publickly profeſſe that, in which <hi>animitùs,</hi> being rotten at the Core, you are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentients indeed from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> than to be and call your ſelves at leaſt <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants</hi> for faſhion ſake in ſome few and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent points of <hi>Ceremony;</hi> and to be oppoſites in Truth both from them and moſt points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For the point in queſtion, what if I for my part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſo much? you may for your part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the contrary if you pleaſe, ſo be it you trouble not the Church with it, nor would pin my Faith unto your opinion. One thing I promiſe you; for my part I will not lightly talke of my opinion in Pulpits: will you ſay as much for your opinion? I thinke not I know nay. For your opinions muſt bee all THE LORDS HOLY TRUTH. I am not anie way offended with you for your opinion, that <hi>The Pope is Antichriſt:</hi> yet much rather might I, becauſe you preſume to determine ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily of <hi>future Contingents;</hi> which being ever uncertaine <hi>quoad nos,</hi> thoſe things cannot but raſhly be defined, or abſolutely taught as true, the event whereof may hap afterwards to prove otherwiſe.

becauſe I doe not ſubſcribe unto you? I am not tyed unto you, more than you to me.

What Parliament, Law, Proclamation, or Edict did ever command it to be profeſſed, or have impoſed penaltie upon repugnants, or non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentients unto it? Some <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines at home and abroad, I grant, have thought ſo, wrote ſo, diſputed ſo; in good zeale, no doubt, againſt that inſolent, and inſufferable, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Tyrannie and Pride of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their infinite enormities in the Church: and out of that affection have been too violently forward, out of conjectures and probabilities, to pronounce, <hi>The</hi> POPE <hi>is that</hi> MAN OF SINNE, <hi>and</hi> SONNE OF PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITION. The Synod of GAPP in <hi>France</hi> made it a point of their <hi>Beleefe,</hi> and concluded it peremptorily to be ſo. And let them and you beleeve it ſo, if you will. Their inducements doe not convince or perſwade me. I never yet ſaw proofe or argument brought, that was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive; much leſſe that was demonſtrative in the caſe. I never yet met with argument or reaſon to the point, but, at leaſt to my owne ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was able to anſwer it. If you can give
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13163:85"/>
better, I am like to yeeld. Till then, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no conviction nor compulſion <hi>in foro ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno</hi> or <hi>interiori,</hi> I would gladly know why it ſhould not be as lawfull for mee to opine, <hi>The Pope is</hi> NOT <hi>that Antichriſt;</hi> as for others to write, to preach, to publiſh, to tender unto Proceeders this Propoſition, <hi>The Pope</hi> Is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</hi> They thinke one way: I am of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minde; and ſo are infinite others with me. Why may not I <hi>ſedatè</hi> and <hi>tranquillè</hi> as well deliver my Negative, as M.

Surely, this man made it an <hi>Article</hi> of his <hi>faith;</hi> ſo will not I. And yet I will not deny, but the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>an Antichriſt.</hi> I doe not deny it: I doe beleeve it. Theſe honeſt Informers ſhould not ſo have dealt with mee, as by a <hi>knack</hi> of concealement to have done me ſo palpable a wrong, as if my meaning were, the <hi>Pope was no Antichriſt at all.</hi> So I might have walked, not onely upon the <hi>Brinks,</hi> but have come much within the <hi>Verge</hi> of flat <hi>Popery:</hi> and not injuriouſly, as now, have been ſlandered for, and ſtiled a <hi>Papist.</hi> For that imputation might more than
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13163:85"/>
grate upon an univerſall approoving of the totall doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> in as much as there were of old, are now, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way will bee, <hi>many Antichriſts:</hi> and hee that any way oppoſeth CHRIST in his Kingdom, his Word, his Church, is <hi>an Antichriſt;</hi> which, as ingenuouſly as the former, I profeſſe the <hi>Pope</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when out of my private opinion onely (for which I will not trouble the peace of the Church) I denied that the <hi>Pope</hi> was THAT <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> then yet and there I added withall, AN <hi>Antichriſt notwithſtanding I hold him or them, carrying themſelves in the Church as they doe.</hi> Which Paſſage and Propoſition had bin ſufficient, with men not partially addicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Side, and maliciouſly bent to calumniate an Oppoſite, as it is too manifeſt my Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers bee, to have diſcharged mee from guilt or tincture of <hi>Popery.</hi> For will or can any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> living ſay, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> now is an <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> But ſo have I ſaid, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and profeſſed <hi>ſo,</hi> if theſe honeſt Informers had been pleaſed to have reported it ſo. But it ſtood not with their prime purpoſe of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating: directly it gave check unto their detraction in chief, and ſo they paſſed it ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over.</p>
                  <p>But as concerning the maine, the queſtion on foot, Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> either are, or may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13163:86"/>
or is THAT <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> my irreſolution grew, as I have remembred, from the much inſufficiency of their proofes that tender it ſtoutly, ſtrongly, affectiouately, and <hi>tantum non,</hi> as a point of faith. Not any one of their arguments is, not all their arguments together are, convincing. Secondly, becauſe it is in Scripture every where tendred as a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy;</hi> and therefore a <hi>Myſtery</hi> ſealed up, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, not manifeſted, nor to bee underſtood, but by evident and plaine event, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation. <hi>How then</hi> (theſe are the very words of Biſhop MORTON in excuſe of the Fathers concerning their erring in this verie caſe of ANTICHRIST) <hi>can ignorance of thoſe things which cannot poſsibly be underſtood before the time of their accompliſhment in the laſt daies, be held prejudiciall unto the wiſedome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of former times?</hi> I may adde thereunto, Or the cautelouſnes of ſuſpenders, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward concluders in theſe times? And yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are divided in the queſtion. For all doe not determine or reſolve, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is THAT <hi>Antichriſt</hi> remembred in the Scripture: and yet none of them have hitherto at any time beene ſtiled or reputed <hi>Papiſts,</hi> no not by Puritanicall Oppoſites. The Scriptures, as is apparent, doe in this queſtion propoſe us two perſons: AN <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> one with many; THE <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> one eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all. All, and every one that oppugneth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13163:86"/>
or oppoſeth CHRIST and his Kingdome, his Word and Doctrine, is an <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> So was SIMON MAGUS, ELYMAS, MENANDER, the NICOLAITANS, and other Heretickes abroad, and riſen up in the very <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times: of whom S. IOHN himſelfe ſaid, <hi>And now are many Antichriſts.</hi> Theſe are all, more or leſſe, <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> as their oppoſition is more or leſſe unto CHRIST and his Kingdome, in points of higher nature or of lower Tenure. But beſide all theſe, more particularly and eſpecially there is deſigned out in Scripture an <hi>egregious, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> and <hi>tranſcendent</hi> ANTICHRIST, called there. THE MAN OF SINNE, THE SONNE OF PERDITION. Concerning him; not them, there is diverſity of judgements, diſcrepancie of opinion among Divines both old and new. Firſt, ſome of the antient Fathers, and moſt of the Writers in the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> underſtand the propheticall prediction of, and apply it unto one <hi>ſingular</hi> individuall man onely, and no otherwiſe; and him to bee an Hereticke in opinion, extreamly and with all vehemency oppoſing the ſaving truth of GOD; prodigiouſly impious, and beyond meaſure: who ſhall by all ſignes and wonders, with maine force and oppoſition, ſet himſelf againſt CHRIST IESUS and his Kingdome, towards the later end of the world, not long before the day of Doome. Other Divines, as namely the <hi>major</hi> part of <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers, not all,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13163:87"/>
underſtand the prophecy and prediction, not of any <hi>one</hi> man or <hi>ſingular</hi> perſon ſo much, as of any hereticall, wicked, tyrannicall <hi>State</hi> and Polity, directly oppoſing the Kingdome, State and Doctrine of CHRIST IESUS. But heer is ſome difference among them. For there are, that by <hi>Antichriſt</hi> doe underſtand MAO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MET, or the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> State and Tyranny ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt CHRIST and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> directly; and the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Papacie</hi> oppoſing the ſame indirectly and in oblique ſort; both combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one confederacy and combination: that <hi>both</hi> theſe, though oppoſite <hi>ad invicem in Temporalibus,</hi> may and doe make <hi>one</hi> conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned oppoſition unto IESUS CHRIST, and his truth in <hi>Spiritualibus.</hi> And although that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, and in regard of Civill Policy, they differ, and doe deadly hate each other, and mainly one oppoſe againſt the other; yet <hi>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil impedit</hi> but they may, as indeed they do, conſpire in oppoſing CHRIST and his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, his Kingdome differently. Other, more <hi>preciſe Proteſtant</hi> Divines, do not nor yet will in any hand extend <hi>Antichriſtianiſme</hi> beyond the <hi>Papacy;</hi> nor yet will admit or hear of any other <hi>great Antichriſt,</hi> paſt or to come, but onely the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> which is, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, the opinion, or rather faith and beliefe, of theſe Informers, together with M. POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ELL, and the Synod of GAPP; as it is of moſt, but not of all the Divines, whom theſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13163:87"/>
men think it an honor to call CALVINISTS. I ſay not of all: for ZANCHIUS, ZEGEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS, GRYNAEUS, and FAIUS of <hi>Geneva</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, are not ſo yet perſwaded. For my owne private opinion, I ſaid, and ſo I ſay ſtill, Though I cannot, nor yet will ſweare unto either, being but probable and conjecturall, yet I rather incline unto the more moderate and temperate <hi>Tenent;</hi> and rather of the two embrace that, The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> State, not ſeverall but conjoyned, and oppoſite unto CHRIST, though ſeverall waies, doe much rather, and may ſo, conſtitute THAT <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> than any <hi>one</hi> man or private perſon whatſoever, than either of the two States diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynedly: and of the <hi>two</hi> States, rather the <hi>Turke</hi> by much, than the <hi>Pope;</hi> rather the MAOMETAN iniquity, than the HILDEBRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINAN impiety; at leaſt wiſe as much every way: becauſe the Signes, and Tokens, and Marks, and Cogniſances of that <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>great Antichriſt,</hi> foretold, extant, and deſigned in Scripture, do all as much accrue unto, and fit the <hi>Turk,</hi> or rather and indeed more, Him and Them, than they doe the <hi>Popes,</hi> in their State and Government <hi>ad oppoſitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> they are both intereſſed: both are departed away; but rather the <hi>Turk</hi> than the <hi>Pope</hi> is entereſſed. For whether we take that Apoſtaſie to bee a departing away from CHRIST, and his Kingdome, and his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13163:88"/>
Doctrine, MAOMET himſelfe apoſtated, drew away his Followers and Sectaries, ſometime CHRISTIANS: and ſo they continue yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day Reprobates, Renegadoes, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes, Deniers of that faith which ſometime they did profeſſe. The Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> thoſe ſeven unto which S. IOHN ſometime wrote; thoſe which S. PAUL planted, and which APOLLOS watered; where S. PETER, S. AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREW, and the reſt preached; thoſe manie famous Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> and others, are fallen from GOD, his Kingdom, his CHRIST, the SPIRIT of his Grace, profeſsion of his Name, and received the marke and ſtampe of the Beaſt: Or whether we underſtand <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> and defection from the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, the <hi>Turke</hi> is entereſſed as much, or more than the <hi>Pope.</hi> both are growne great through the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines thereof; but rather the <hi>Turke</hi> than the <hi>Pope.</hi> Indeed, both from the Scepter of CHRIST and the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire is this Apoſtaſie: and ſo the ſignes, marks, and tokens hold on either ſide; but upon due examination, rather upon the <hi>Turke</hi> than the <hi>Pope</hi> as yet.</p>
                  <p>Then for <hi>Deceiving ſignes and wonders;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that cognizance holdeth in the <hi>Papacy</hi> and Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> we are aſſured out of Story, that MAOMET tooke that courſe to beguile the ſimple, to inſinuate into the fancies of his deceived Proſelites, and to make himſelfe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Furthermore, yet MAOMET perſonally, as a private man and a falſe Prophet, was truely and indeed a <hi>man of Sinne:</hi> not only for his morall parts in his looſe licentiouſneſſe, lewd carriage, abominable life, impietie, improbity, and impuritie every way unto the higheſt; but in his ALCORAN, that execrable Law of his damned Sect, he commendeth and tendreth unto, not only alloweth and tolerateth in, his Sectaries, all filthie carnall pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. and in reward of ſuch a life, a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable recompence alſo after death, in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of that uaure, abounding withall beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like brothelries.</p>

Religion a man is and may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>two</hi> waies, as I alſo have conſidered him, according unto a twofold ſtate: The ſtate of <hi>nature,</hi> to which hee was <hi>formed;</hi> and the ſtate of <hi>grace,</hi> to which he is <hi>reformed:</hi> as hee was in ADAM, depraved and loſt; as hee is in CHRIST IESUS, ſought out, found, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of his maladies. In his Being, Subſiſting, and Conſtitution, every man is firſt a <hi>naturall</hi> man: in that ſtate ſtanding, hee pleaſeth not GOD. <hi>He can doe nothing,</hi> ſaith CALVIN, <hi>that can pleaſe him, or be accepted of him. His very beſt works</hi> (you I hope will ſay ſo) <hi>are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto</hi> GOD. <hi>Quando naturalibus dotibus cenſendi ſunt, à vertice capitis ad plantam uſque pedis, ſcintilla boni non reperitur; niſi fortè veli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus inſimulare falſi</hi> SCRIPTURAM, <hi>dum hiſce Elogijs univerſes filios</hi> ADAE <hi>commendat, quòd pravo ſint &amp; praefracto corde; quòd omne fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum cordis corum pravum ſit à primis annis; quòd vanae ſint corum cogitationes, &amp;c. breviter, quòd caro ſint: quo nomine intelliguntur opera illá omnia quae enumerantur à</hi> PAULO, <hi>Gal.</hi> V. XIX. So CALVIN, <hi>Inſtit.</hi> III. XIV. I. The reaſon then of that ſo great a diſtaſte which GOD hath of the beſt works of meer carnall and naturall men, is that great diſproportion betwixt GOD and man, that much diſcongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity betwixt HIM and us. The Fountain is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure from whence theſe works proceed; man himſelf not accepted, that is Author of them,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13163:95"/>
Agent in them. And why not accepted? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is uncleane. GOD is of pure eyes: hee ſeeth whatſoever ſo is moſt ſecret in the boughts, and turnings, and windings of the heart; ſo pure, that he cannot behold vanity, nor look upon that which is defiled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. And as hee cannot endure vanity: ſo neither will he look upon iniquity, to approve it; or call him righteous, that is unholy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified before him. As he beholdeth the forms of things as they are: ſo hee calleth everie thing by the name it hath. Man by nature (as he is, and what he is) is wholly and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanity. The perſon with GOD muſt be made acceptable, then accepted, before any work of his become approveable or approved. This is not, cannot bee, hee continuing <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> a naturall man, unclean, defiled, as he was. For, <hi>Odio eſt ei impius &amp; impietas ejus;</hi> ſo far, ſaith CALVIN, that <hi>quae vel ſummo ſplendore conſpicua ſunt opera, in hominibus nondum verè</hi>

                     <hi>change,</hi> an <hi>alteration</hi> in him and his: he muſt become a <hi>new</hi> man, a man <hi>renewed,</hi> a man <hi>changed,</hi> a <hi>new creature,</hi> and the like, I. <hi>Cor.</hi> V.

thinke all mankinde, beſide your ſelves, will confeſſe and acknowledge with mee, out of grounds and experiments of even naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. A ſicke man, recovered, is changed in ſtate and habitude of body, diſeaſe, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; ceaſing to be what he was, becomming what hee was not. When of a ſick man hee became whole and ſound, his change was from Sickeneſſe to Health: and this his changing was Motion. the termes betwixt which, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Health. A dead man reviving (as the widows SONNE of <hi>Naim,</hi> or LAZARUS <hi>quadriduanus</hi> raiſed out of his grave) is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in ſtate, conſtitution, &amp;c. when of a dead man hee becommeth a living.

And if this was not <hi>Actio inter terminos,</hi> though wrought <hi>in inſtanti,</hi> as alſo mutation and change is, and needs muſt be, for complement of the Act, I muſt confeſſe my owne dulneſſe, I cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe underſtand or comprehend it.

Surely, if <hi>Popery</hi> be a maſſe of abſurdities, this Taxation of the Informers is rather extreme <hi>Popery,</hi> than any thing here avouched by M.

                  <p>HEER now at length wee have ſome, though very poore ſhew of a juſt and formall accuſation: the reſt are but meer calumniations. For heer is a charge of delivering <hi>Popery,</hi> and maintaining it; and withall an advancing of that charge, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſome ſeeming proofe, in a threefold branch: 1. of <hi>According fully with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of</hi> TRENT; 11. <hi>Contradicting the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> ENGLAND; 111. <hi>Diſſenting from all other reformed Churches:</hi> which is done by this one Aſſertion, <hi>A change is made in a juſtified man;</hi> the ſubſtance in briefe of all the former ſuggeſtion: ſuch an one as maketh mee beleeve, that theſe informations were not gathered by any Scholars or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, but ſubſcribed unto unadviſedly, and collected by ſome other at odds with his owne little or frantick wits: for who can conceive, that a juſt and uniuſt, a carnall and ſpirituall man ſhould be the ſame? that one regenerate, and reformed in the ſpirit of his mind, ſhould be the ſame that hee was before? that a live man ſhould bee dead? I confeſſe I cannot conceive, LAZARUS in his grave, and ſitting at table with our SAVIOUR, to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone no change nor alteration; SAUL a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter, and Saint PAUL an Apoſtle, without

change; the Thiefe upon the Croſſe, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, than when hee robbed and killed upon the high-way. Was he called, juſtified, ſaved? then ſure he was changed.

                  <p>If yet you would there make an end, and be content to enjoy <hi>your</hi> conceits unto <hi>your</hi> ſelves, and make much of them at home: but we muſt come over and conforme our Faith unto your thoughts, or wee ſhall heare of it on both our eares.

IESUS CHRIST <hi>our Saviour; and of an unjuſt perſon, is made righteous; of an enemy, is made the friend of</hi> GOD: <hi>that ſo he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heire of eternall life.</hi> Which is good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine, <hi>non Romano, ſed antiquo more;</hi> Chriſtian and juſtifiable, if S.

GOD pardoneth ſinne in man, for the death and paſſion of CHRIST his Sonne; in that very act and inſtant imputing unto him the righteouſneſſe of CHRIST, that all-ſufficient and well-pleaſing ſacrifice, for his juſtification. and doth he leave him there? his ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like remaining ſtill in being, as they were? himſelfe indeed the very man he was before? or rather (as, perfect are the workes of the mightie GOD, not done by halves, and to no purpoſe) doth hee not alſo waſh and <hi>clenſe his ſoule and conſcience from dead workes?</hi> doth he not wipe out his iniquities, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth

the band, and maketh him become an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man? doth hee not conferre upon him of his grace, for the aboliſhing of the bodie of ſinne, and enabling the ſoule againſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of ſinne?

But in the ſecond <hi>Sermon</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> I finde directly in a man that is <hi>juſtified,</hi> a <hi>change</hi> made, faith the <hi>Homily. The fourth part of Repentance is amendment of life, or a new life, in bringing forth fruits worthy of Repentance. For they that doe truely repent them of their ſinnes, muſt be cleane abtered and</hi> CHANGED: <hi>they muſt become new creatures: they must be no more the ſame they were before.</hi> Now look and compare M. MOUNTAGU'S <hi>private Popery</hi> with this <hi>publick Popery</hi> of the Church, and goe give your ſelves the check for malice and indiſcretion. And afterward, having inſtanced this doctrine in that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable example of ZACHEUS'S converſion from his evill way of covetouſnes and extortion, as a common Cuſtomer, the <hi>Homily</hi> concludeth with this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> concerning him thus: <hi>Heer we ſee, that after his repentance he was no more</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:13163:105"/>
                     <hi>the ſame man he had been before, but was clean</hi> CHANGED <hi>and altered. It was ſo farre off, that he would continue and abide ſtill in his unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble covetouſneſſe, or take ought away fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from any man, that hee was moſt ready and willing to give away his owne.</hi> Go now, and challenge M. MOUNTAGU for his <hi>Popery</hi> upon like caſe, in like tearms almoſt, delivered. <hi>In the ſtate of grace a man is just</hi> (and a juſt man I hope none is, but he that is already <hi>iuſtified) when he is changed.</hi> Which <hi>change</hi> of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two things: <hi>Privation of Being</hi> to that which was formerly in a naturall man, the body of ſinne; and <hi>A new conſtitution un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> GOD in another ſtate, namely, of holineſſe in life and converſation. I know well enough, what you are afraid of, what you would ſay, becauſe you neyther underſtand your ſelves, nor mee, that doe not make this <hi>change</hi> the ſame with <hi>Iuſtification</hi> in the <hi>act;</hi> but an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, inſtant, neceſſarie <hi>conſequent</hi> thereupon. Goe then and befoole your ſelves, for confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly oppoſing common ſenſe and reaſon, and well knowne and confeſſed Divinity on all hands.

I diſtinguiſh indeed betwixt the phraſe of S. PAUL and S. IAMES: that HEE ſpeaketh of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> in attaining it; S. IAMES, of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> attained. which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from <hi>good works,</hi> as anon is declared, and cited out of the twelfth <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Confeſsion.</hi>

                  <p>In briefe, the Information is rather an <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> upon the paſſage, than the <hi>paſſage</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as it ſhould be. It is known unto all, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Profeſſors have ever in their mouths the Text of S. IAMES, <hi>What doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite though a man ſaith he hath Faith, and hath no Works? can his Faith ſave him?</hi> Unto this allegation, amongſt other things, this is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: S. PAUL ſpeaketh of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> in the <hi>attayning</hi> it, <hi>That onely Faith doth juſtifie;</hi> and that it is the <hi>Act of Faith</hi> in regard of man. For <hi>properly,</hi> and cauſally, and originally, GOD <hi>doth onely Iuſtifie.</hi> But S. IAMES meaneth of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> had and obtained: the which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily is accompanied with <hi>good workes,</hi> and can bee no more ſeparate from <hi>good workes,</hi>

Thy deeds and workes must bee an open teſtimonie of thy faith: otherwiſe thy faith being without good workes, is but the Divels faith, the faith of the wicked, a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie</hi>

You underſtand not the ſtate and condition of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Deſcent of</hi> CHRIST <hi>into Hell.</hi> To aſſure you, I am for my opinion (dreame you what you will otherwiſe, and what you pleaſe) abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the mind of <hi>all Antiquity,</hi> that the <hi>ſoules</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Dead,</hi> ſeparated from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13163:127"/>
and <hi>Gathered</hi> (as the Scriptures ſpeake) <hi>unto their Fathers,</hi> before CHRISTS Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from Death to Life, and his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven; that departed hence in the hope and aſſurance of GODS promiſes, and in the expectation of better things to come, were not yet then in <hi>Coelo propriè di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto ſummo illo &amp; glorioſo,</hi> whereas now they are, in companie of all the holy Angels, with the glorified bodie of our SAVIOUR, farre above all things in heaven and earth. And yet for all this; I am not for him, that thereupon ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly and maliciouſly inferreth, <hi>I hold with, beleeve,</hi> or <hi>conceit</hi> anie ſuch <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath fancied unto her ſelfe, and tendred unto her Profelites, drawne and derived out of that negative opinion of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> ill underſtood, and ill applyed. As if becauſe they were not ſo in heaven, <hi>per om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> as now they are, they muſt needs be ſo in hell as they conceive them to be. the ſtate whereof is imagined this.</p>
                  <p>LIMBUS <hi>Patrum</hi> is ſo called by the Papiſts <hi>à ſubjecto contento,</hi> which they doe imagine to be the uppermoſt <hi>Fringe,</hi> as the word ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or the <hi>Verge</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> For, as if ſome of their Maſters had beene ſent thither to take a ſurvay thereof, they doe quarter out that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall Clime into <hi>foure</hi> Regions; all agreeing in the particulars, though with ſome difference about the quartering and confining. That the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13163:127"/>
Regions are <hi>foure,</hi> they all agree: <hi>Hell,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, <hi>of the Damned, Purgatory, Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus puerorum,</hi> and <hi>Limbus patrum.</hi> For the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt</hi> and <hi>lowermost,</hi> they all agree; but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about the ſite of <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Limbus pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum:</hi> they cannot reſolve which is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt of theſe two. In <hi>Hell of the Damned</hi> they imagine, and rightly, eternall loſſe of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in excluſion from GOD, as alſo moſt inſufferable eternall paine. In <hi>Purgatory,</hi> there is ſome queſtion, whether the loſſe be partiall or not: for they are conceited to have, at leaſt ſomtimes, the intervening ſociety of holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who cannot but impart unto them ſome glimmering of heavenly conſolation; and yet the pain, though not eternal, but only temporary, is ſet down to bee equall unto Hell torments. Unto the <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> they have faſtned eternall loſſe and deprivation of GOD, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſible paine: in <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie loſſe, but no paine. <hi>Limbus puerorum</hi> and <hi>Hell of the Damned,</hi> in their opinions, endure for ever. <hi>Purgatory</hi> ſhall ceaſe, and be no more, at the day of judgement: but for <hi>Limbus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> the date thereof is, and was long ſince, expired. Now there is no ſuch manſion or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of ſoules, they are reſolved: but what is become of it, or how imployed, they are not reſolved.

                  <p>Now to come to the point; The queſtion is concerning their ſoules onely: for their

bodies, it is confeſſed, in ordinarie diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doe ſleep in the duſt. It is confeſſed on both ſides, which is moſt materiall, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, That being immortall in their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part, after diſſolution and ſeparation, they ſtill have a Being, and are ſubſiſting in <hi>aliquo ubi:</hi> for though the nature of a ſoule is not to be circumſcriptively in place (as TERTUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN fancied) as M. YATES and M. WARD are when they are in their Pulpits, yet are they confined in their proper <hi>ubi,</hi> definitively and <hi>indiſtanter,</hi> as they ſpeake; that is, they have not, nor can have, an <hi>ubique-ſubſiſtence,</hi> but a determined and defined. Being heere, at that inſtant they are not there: for <hi>omnipreſence</hi> is the abſolute Peculiar of the ALMIGHTY. Truely then, and indeed, they muſt and doe ſubſiſt in <hi>place,</hi> or rather <hi>ubi;</hi> though <hi>where,</hi> and how, who can tell? For, the Scripture, content with their ſtate and beeing, is ſilent for particular touching their place. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the beſt learned of all times and places, have, if not declined <hi>quaeſtionem loci,</hi> yet not beene curious nor reſolved for it. So heere is a maine difference at the firſt betwixt the <hi>Papistry</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and M. MOUNTAGU'S <hi>Popery.</hi> They <hi>de fide</hi> reſolving the <hi>place</hi> to have been thus: He returning <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> we are not aſcertained, we cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, in that their <hi>Vbi</hi> whereſoever, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, as they had Being and Subſiſtence, ſo
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13163:129"/>
did they alſo performe actions of life and motion, congruous and convenient unto their nature and kind. And though they are ſaid to be at <hi>rest,</hi> yet is it qualified with, <hi>In</hi> what ſort; <hi>They reſt from their Labours,</hi> ſaith the SPIRIT. where the latter word, <hi>Labors,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>ſpecies</hi> unto, and determineth the former word, <hi>Reſt.</hi> For all maner reſt is not predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them; not ſuch as that <hi>reſt</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the grave.

Thus to <hi>reſt,</hi> is contrary to their nature and condition intellectuall; though it hath beene the opinion of ſome <hi>Popes,</hi> they ſay, and is of ſome <hi>Anabaptists</hi> at this day: ſuch as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom M.

Next, inaſmuch as there are, and have beene alway in this life, two ſorts amongſt the ſonnes of men; <hi>Beleevers</hi> in CHRIST, for their profeſſion; <hi>Holy</hi> in courſe, for their life and converſation: then <hi>Misbeleevers</hi> and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in regard of GOD; <hi>Wicked</hi> miſ-agents in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13163:129"/>
reſpect of living: ſo proportionably there are, and have beene ever, <hi>two</hi> ſtates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoules of men, in their ſeparation after death; ſome rewarded with happineſſe, in their being for ever with GOD; ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned unto woe and wretchedneſſe, for ever eſtranged from GOD. All men when they dye (as, ſooner or later, all do and ſhall) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that unchangeable Law of kinde, <hi>Thou ſhalt Dye the Death,</hi> are ſaid in SCRIPTURE <hi>To goe the way of all fleſh,</hi> or of <hi>All the Earth:</hi> for never man had a priviledge of abſolute or totall exemption.

But this their being, their living, their dying ſo, will not inferre that <hi>Place</hi> to have received them then, wherein now with us they bee, and where one day all GOD'S choſen ones ſhall be. For the ſame faith hath not ever the ſame meaſure, nor proportion in all, nor the ſame diſpenſation at all times. The ſame hope is more eminent in ſome than in others. The ſame perſons, inlarged in their Indowments or Atchievements, are likewiſe enhanſed and ennobled in their Accruments, Temporall or Eternall, Perſonall or Originall. Their bodies are not as yet reunited unto their ſoules, yet ſhall they be raiſed up out of the duſt, and bee made conformable in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection unto life, to the now-glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of CHRIST our Saviour.

likewiſe in <hi>Heaven</hi> STRICTLY taken for the THIRD <hi>Heaven;</hi> that receptacle of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous now, together with the glorified body of our SAVIOUR. For that place was not then, <hi>ſtantibus ut tunc,</hi> fitting or accruing to them. Such a royall habitation, the <hi>None-ſuch</hi> of GOD, did not befit their then inferiour ſtates and conditions. But then you will aske me, If neither in <hi>Heaven above,</hi> nor in <hi>Earth beneath,</hi> nor in <hi>Hell,</hi> where poſſibly could they conſiſt, or were they diſpoſed? A being they had; therefore an <hi>ubi</hi> for their ſubſiſting. To which, firſt, I anſwer, They had both: and in generall tearms the Scripture ſpeaketh, they had that ſubſiſtence in the hands of GOD, with GOD, in his <hi>holy Hill,</hi> in the <hi>Tabernacles of Peace,</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in ABRAHAM'S <hi>boſome</hi> with LAZARUS, with ABRAHAM, ISAAC, and IACOB, in <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> and of GOD. Why then they were in Heaven at leaſt. Doubtleſſe yes, in a more generall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The word is ambiguous, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt the <hi>Gagger;</hi> put forth for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> alone, <hi>place</hi> alone, or place and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together. In regard of <hi>ſtate</hi> and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were in <hi>Heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>happie</hi> and <hi>bleſſed,</hi> as then was convenient. In regard of <hi>ubi</hi> alſo, they were in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and enlarged ſenſe; in <hi>ſome part of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> where GOD diſpoſed them. You will aske in particular, Where was that? I muſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13163:134"/>
and doe anſwer negatively, I cannot tell: I dare not define: I have no warrant for reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. I anſwer poſitively, You ſhould not ask nor curiouſly enquire, but be content to be ignorant of that which GOD hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. And then farther, It is not profitable to knowe: for GOD elſe would not have concealed it. So that to enquire it preſſingly, is but curioſity; to determine it reſolvedly, is but preſumption at the beſt. Therefore M. CALVIN, and other <hi>Proteſtant Divines</hi> that I could name, content themſelves onely with the <hi>ſtate</hi> in <hi>ſpeciall</hi> of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>reſt;</hi> with the <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi</hi> in <hi>generall</hi> to be <hi>Heaven:</hi> but preſume not to deſcend unto <hi>particular where,</hi> ſeeing GOD hath not been pleaſed to diſcover it. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to knowe they were not in <hi>Hell</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> meane it: and it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they were not in <hi>Heaven</hi> as <hi>you</hi> conceit it.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, no <hi>Scripture</hi> affirmeth it expreſly, that the Reſt of thoſe Righteous was there where now it is. Secondly, it is not, that I could ever reade or underſtand, collected out of any place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> by any one <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Writer,</hi> for fifteene hundred yeeres after CHRIST. Thirdly, no <hi>Writer</hi> of any <hi>one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion</hi> hath demonſtrated it to be ſo intended in any <hi>Scripture.</hi> Fourthly, no <hi>Article</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of our <hi>Church</hi> concludeth it, or ſo tendreth it to bee conceived and embraced: and therefore whatſoever my private opinion
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13163:135"/>
otherwiſe might bee, I am tyed not to preach or publiſh it, according to the CANONS pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <note place="margin">

The will is more in them to bee edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the judgement; the conſciences and hearts of men to be wrought upon for good life and converſation, than the underſtanding and apprehenſion for any peece of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. and that alſo diſpoſed accordingly, as fitted for times, for perſons, and different occaſions, as they doe or may happen.</p>
                  <p>As the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the primitive
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13163:146"/>
times, had verie few or no Churches at all, at leaſt of note, dignitie, or of receipt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lived in times of fierce perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were ſeldome, or few of them, ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onarie, but compelled <hi>ſubindè mutare ſedes;</hi> ſo had they very few, I grant, or no pictures at all in publicke uſe amongſt them, not ſo much as for ornament ſake. And the reaſon was, becauſe they lived continually amongſt <hi>Pagans,</hi> and were themſelves, for the moſt part, ſuch as had abandoned and come over from <hi>Paganiſme</hi> unto CHRIST; that were bred in, brought up in, inured to, and faſt ſettled unto <hi>Idolatry</hi> in <hi>Image-worſhip.</hi> Therefore they ſpake againſt them with ſome tartneſſe, and inveighing ſort, leaſt happely by converſing with, or neighbouring upon <hi>Pagans,</hi> or through former uſe of being miſ-led by thoſe <hi>Pagans</hi> (which was the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the bordering <hi>Nations</hi> upon <hi>Canaan)</hi> the novell and tender ſhoots of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> might receive hurt, and learne to worſhip <hi>Idols,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Pagans</hi> did. In like ſort, peradventure, OUR <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> comming late out of <hi>Popery,</hi> living neere unto <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> times, converſing with them, having beene nuzzled and brought up amongſt them, and knowing that <hi>Images</hi> uſed to be <hi>crept</hi> unto, <hi>incenſed, worſhipped,</hi> and <hi>adored</hi> amongſt them, might, if they were ſuffered to ſtand as they did, put them in minde of their former pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13163:147"/>
induce them to doe as they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time done, at leaſt in heart to <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> them; therefore in a godly zeale, ſuch as moved EZECHIAS to deſtroy the <hi>brae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpent,</hi> they ſpake thus vehemently, and indeed <hi>hyperbolically</hi> againſt them. For the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with whom they then dealt, were by all meanes to bee preſerved from the taint and tincture of their ſuperſtitious practices. And for this cauſe I ſay (it may ſeem) the Church-Governours of thoſe times in their <hi>popular Sermons</hi> tooke that courſe which the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> did, and ſtretched their exhortations and enforcements, as alſo their dehortations, ſomewhat hard upon the Tentors. For in their dogmaticall reſolutions, and doctrinall poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are more reſerved, and goe not ſo farre. We may do well then to conſider why, wherefore, when, and to what manner men theſe <hi>popular Sermons</hi> were made, and doe ſpeake; and not preſſe everie paſſage hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver head, for advantage.

There is hope you may grow in time, upon better advice, in love and practice with ſome of M. MOUNTAGU'S <hi>Popery,</hi> with the <hi>ſigne of the</hi> CROSSE <hi>in the forehead, and elſewhere.</hi> If it be not ſuperſtitious to ſigne in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, why is it to ſigne any other part of the bodie? why more out of Baptiſme, than in Baptiſme? Is one part of the body more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13163:148"/>
and liable to ſuperſtition, than another? the breſt, or belly, or armes, than is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head? Superſtition is <hi>in Subjecto,</hi> or <hi>in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</hi> In that if you faſten ſuperſtition, you muſt give us ſome reaſon why one part is more ſubject and liable unto it, than another; and wherfore you put this difference betwixt the parts. And concerning actions: religious and pious actions are more liable to ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be committed in them, than common, civill, or ordinary actions be; nay, all ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever reflecteth upon religion. It is not but in ſuch acts as bee of themſelves, or appliedly, acts of religion and piety. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in all probability, if it bee ſuperſtitious to <hi>ſigne</hi> the forehead without Baptiſme, it is more ſuperſtitious to do it in Baptiſme. Nor can the Injunction of the Church give any priviledge of immunity unto a ſuperſtitious action of it ſelf, to bee uſed in point of piety without ſuperſtition: for, if to <hi>ſigne</hi> with the <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> be ſuperſtitious in it ſelfe, as by your opinion it ſeemeth to bee; then cannot the Church command it to bee uſed on the forehead in Baptiſme, becauſe no act of the Church can acquit and diſcharge the action of that naturall and inherent property. If it be not ſuperſtitious abſolutely, originally, and in it ſelf, eat your words of <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and <hi>elſewhere;</hi> or give us ſome reaſon why <hi>extra Baptiſmum</hi> it ſhould bee ſuperſtition to

                  <p>The <hi>ancient</hi> Church uſed it in Baptiſm as we do. TERTULLIAN ſpake of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> the words remembred; <hi>Caro ſignatur, ut anima muniatur:</hi> which he learned not of MARCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON nor MONTANUS, as ſome have fabled; but of the practice of the Church before they were born. And you ſhall finde, if you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the place againe, that I remembred the words for <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and not otherwiſe: you have chopt off the <hi>vinculum</hi> that tyed my words together, and relate them as if I cited TERTULLIAN in generall tearms for <hi>any ſigning</hi> with the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> in <hi>any place,</hi> at <hi>any time.</hi> For which action, though lawfull, I doe not alledge him. I ſay, though lawfull: for where is it forbidden? What hindereth, but that I may <hi>ſigne</hi> my ſelf with the <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in <hi>any part</hi> of my body, at <hi>any time;</hi> at night when I goe to bed, in the morning when I riſe, at my going out, at my returning home? The <hi>ancient</hi> Church ſo uſed it out of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ordinarily: and ſo may wee, for ought I knowe, without juſt ſcandall and ſuperſtition. The practice of <hi>Antiquity</hi> you will not deny: you cannot, if you knowe any thing in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

You are of THO. CARTWRIGHT'S minde, I make no queſtion, that great Apoſtle of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanicall</hi> Schiſme; <hi>That that reaſon which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Fathers to uſe, ſhould move us not to uſe the ſigne of the Croſſe. They lived with Heathens, who had the</hi> CROSSE <hi>of</hi> CHRIST <hi>in contempt; we, with ſuch as</hi> ADORE <hi>the</hi> CROSSE. Where firſt I anſwer with that incomparable HOOKER, <hi>You erre, not knowing the Fathers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> This was one; but this reaſon was not all, becauſe they lived with <hi>Pagans</hi> that did deſpite it. Secondly, wee live not ſo with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as they did with <hi>Pagans.</hi> For the State,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:13163:150"/>
and <hi>Prince</hi> in State, is for us againſt the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> ſo was it not for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> againſt <hi>Pagans.</hi> But thirdly, I come home to you indeed. The ſame reaſon that moved them, may move us to uſe it more frequently than we are enjoyned, more ordinarily than wee doe. For wee live with <hi>Puritans,</hi> and oppoſite Factioniſts, that have the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of CHRIST in as great <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>deſpight,</hi> as ever had IULIAN or any <hi>Pagan. But as the Fathers, when the</hi> CROSSE <hi>of</hi> CHRIST <hi>was in utter contempt, did not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly adore the ſame, but rather did declare that they ſo eſteemed it as was meet: In like maner, if wee finde the Croſſe to have that honour which is due to</hi> CHRIST, <hi>is it not as lawfull for us to retaine it in that estimation which it ought to have, and in that uſe which it had of old, without offence; as by taking it cleane away, to ſeeme followers of their example, who doe cure wilfully by abſciſsion, that which they might both preſerve and heale?</hi> So that worthy HOO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KER, moſt learnedly and rightly. For your reſolution; I am enjoyned to uſe it in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:</hi> and ſo are you. I doe ſo uſe it: do you? I ſcarce beleeve you doe it willingly. I am not enioyned to uſe it in other actions, places or times. But am I inhibited to uſe it ſo? Shew where, how, by whom. I ſee reaſons to my ſelfe peradventure, to uſe it ſo, or ſo; and thus doe, or may other as well as I. It is ſuperſtition you ſay: pardon me if I
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:13163:151"/>
take not your words for Goſpell. Prove it ſuperſtition, and I yeeld. The rule of your conſciences, is not the ſquare of mine; nor ſhall be, except it were more regular, perfect, and exact, than it is. Enjoy your opinions to your ſelf: let me alone with mine, in things indifferent, that are not prohibited by lawfull authoritie any way. For, ſaith the XXX. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and I embrace it, <hi>Things of themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different doe in ſome ſort alter their natures, when they are eyther commanded or forbidden by a lawfull Magiſtrate, and may not be omitted at every mans pleaſure, contrary to the law, when they bee commanded; nor ùſed when they are prohibited,</hi> Till then, at leaſt, I may uſe the <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> You ſay it is <hi>Popery;</hi> but you muſt remember, that all your words are not Goſpell, nor all <hi>Popery</hi> that diſpleaſeth a <hi>Puritan.</hi>
