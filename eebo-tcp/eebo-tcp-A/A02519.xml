            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Lord what is man that thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Text, and so my
Sermon too, is the
just character of
man; A common,
and stale theme, you will say;
but a needfull one: we are all
apt to misknow or to forget


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19176:6"/>
what we are; No blacks, nor
soule-bells, nor deaths heads
on our rings, nor funerall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
nor tombes, nor Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphes
can fixe our hearts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
upon our fraile, and
miserable condition; And if
any man have condescended
to see his face in the true loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
glasse of his wretched
frailty, so soon as his back is
turned hee forgets his shape
straight; Especially at a Court
where outward glory would
seem to shoulder out the
thoughts of poore despicable
mortality; Give mee leave
therefore, (Honourable and
beloved) to ring my owne
knell in your eares this day,
and to call home your eyes a
little, and to shew you that


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19176:6"/>
which I feare you too sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
see, your selves. Lent
and funeralls are wont still to
go both in one Livery: There
is no book so well worthy
reading as this living one;
Even now <hi>David</hi> spake as a
King of men, Of people sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
under him; now hee
speakes as an humble vassall
to God: <hi>Lord what is man that
thou takest knowledge of him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one breath is both so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
and subjection; An
absolute soveraignty over his
people; <hi>My people are subdued
under me;</hi> An humble subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the God of Kings;
<hi>Lord, what is man?</hi> Yea, in the
very same word wherein is
the profession of that sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
there is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19176:7"/>
of subjection; <hi>Thou
hast subdued my people;</hi> In that
he had people, he was a King;
that they might be his people,
a subjugation was requisite;
and that subjugation was
Gods, and not his own; <hi>Thou
hast subdued;</hi> Lo <hi>David</hi> had not
subdued his people, if God
had not subdued them for
him; Hee was a great King,
but they were a stiffe people;
The God that made them
swayed them to a due subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
The great Conquerors
of worlds, could not conquer
hearts, if hee that molded
hearts did not temper them:
<hi>By me Kings raigne</hi> saith the
Eternall wisdome; and he that
had courage enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter
a Beare, a Lion, <hi>Goliah,</hi>


               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:19176:7"/>
yet can say: <hi>Thou hast subdued
my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contrarily, in that lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
subjection of himselfe,
there is an acknowledgement
of greatnesse; though he aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
himselfe with a <hi>What is
man,</hi> yet withall, he addes, <hi>thou
takest knowledge of him, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
account of him;</hi> And this
knowledge, this account of
God, doth more exalt man,
then his own vanity can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
him.</p>
            <p>My Text then, yee see, is
<hi>Davids</hi> rapture, expressed in
an extaticall question of sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
wonder; a wonder at
God, and at man; Mans vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<hi>What is man?</hi> Gods
mercy and favour, in his
knowledge, in his estimation


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19176:8"/>
of man: Lo, there are but
two lessons that we need to
take out here, in the world,
God, and man; and here they
are both: Man in the notion
of his wretchednesse; God, in
the notion of his bounty:
Let us (if you please) take a
short view of both, and in
the one see cause of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
of our joy and
thankfulnesse in the other, &amp;
if in the former, there be a sad
Lent of mortification, there is
in the latter, a chearfull Easter
of our raising and exaltation.</p>
            <p>Many a one besides <hi>David,</hi>
wonders at himselfe, one
wonders at his own honor,
and though hee will not say
so, yet thinkes What a great
man am I? Is not this great


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19176:8"/>
Babel which I have built?
This is <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
Another wonders at his
person, and findes either a
good face, or a faire eye, or an
exquisite hand, or a well
shap't leg, or some gay fleece
to admire in himselfe: This
was <hi>Absalous</hi> wonder: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wonders at his wit, and
learning: How came I by all
this? <hi>Turba haec.</hi> This vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
that knowes not the law,
is accursed. This was the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
wonder. Another won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at his wealth, Soule, take
thine ease, as the Epicure in
the Gospell. <hi>Davids</hi> wonder
is as much above, as against
all these; hee wonders at his
vilenesse: Like as the chosen
vessell would boast of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19176:9"/>
but his infirmities: <hi>Lord
what is man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How well this hangs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
No sooner had hee
said, <hi>Thou hast subdued my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
under me,</hi> then he adds, <hi>Lord
what is man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some vaine heart would
have beene lifted up with a
conceit of his own eminence;
Who I? I am not as other
men; I have people under me;
and people of my owne;
and people subdued to mee;
This is to bee more then a
man; I know who hath said,
<hi>I said ye are Gods.</hi> Besides <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the great, how many of
the Roman <hi>Cesars</hi> have been
transported with this self-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and have challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Temples, Altars, Sacrifices.


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19176:9"/>
How have they shared the
moneths of the yeare among
them; April must be <hi>Neroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
May <hi>Claudius,</hi> Iune <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus,</hi>

What tell I you of these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Clearchus</hi> of Pontus, as

the Physitian (though

his Apothecaries boy) yet
would be <hi>Iupiter: Empedocles</hi>
the Philosopher, if it had not
been for his shoo would have
gone for Immortall. <hi>Sejanus</hi>
will be sacrificing to himself.
I could tyre you with these

how can the vaine pride of

him away to ridiculous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations?
The man after Gods
own heart is in another vain;
when he lookes downward,
he sees the people crouching
under him, and confesses his
own just predominancy, but
when hee lookes either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to God, or inward to
himselfe, he sayes, <hi>Lord what


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19176:11"/>
is man?</hi> It should not be, it is
not in the power of earthly
greatnesse to raise the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heart above it selfe, or to
make it forget the true grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
of his own humiliation. <hi>Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
quantum volet palea,</hi> as he
said: Let the light chaffe bee
hoised into the ayre, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
winde (as <hi>Psal. 1.)</hi> the
solid grain lyes close, and falls
so much the lower, by how
much it is more weighty. It
is but the smoke that mounts
up in the furnace, it is but the
drosse that swells up in the
lump, the pure metall sinkes
to the bottome, if there be any
part of the crucible lower
then other, there you shall
finde it. The proud moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
shelve off the rain, and


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19176:11"/>
are barren; the humble val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
soak it up, and are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Set this pattern before
you ye great ones whom God
hath raised to the height of
worldly honor: Oh be ye as
humble as ye are great: the
more high you are in others
eyes, be so much more lowly
in your owne, as knowing
that hee was no lesse then a
King that said, <hi>Lord what is
man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time was when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
made this wonder upon
another occasion. <hi>Psal. 8. 3, 4.
When I see the heavens, the moon
and the stars that thou hast ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Lord what is man?</hi> When
looking over that great night-piece,
and turning over the
vast volume of the world (as


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19176:12"/>
               <hi>Gerson</hi> termes it) hee saw in
that large folio, amongst
those huge capitall letters,
what a little inse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sible daghes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
man is, he breaks forth
into an amazed exclamation
<hi>Lord what is man?</hi> Indeed,
how could he doe other? To
compare such a mite, a mote,
a nothing with that goodly
and glorious vault of heaven,
and with those worlds of
light, so much bigger then so
many globes of earth, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and moving regularly in
that bright and spacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignation
of the firmament, it
must needs astonish humane
reason, and make it ashamed
of its own poorenesse: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if there could bee any
man that when hee knowes


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19176:12"/>
the frame of the world could
wonder at any thing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
save his owne nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
I should as much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at him, as at the world it
selfe.</p>
            <p>There <hi>David</hi> wondred to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare man with the world;
here he wonders too to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
man, with a world of
men, and to see that God had
done so much for him above
others in his advancement,
deliverances, victories. But
if any man had rather to take
this Psalme as a sacred Rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sody,
gathered out of the 18.
and 8. and 39. Psalmes; and
this sentence as universall; I
oppose not; Let this wonder
be generall, not so much of
<hi>David,</hi> a man selected, as of


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19176:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>David,</hi> a man. These two are
well joyned, <hi>Lord, What?</hi> For
however man when hee is
considered in himselfe, or
compared with his fellow-creatures,
may be something;
yet when he comes into men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his maker, he is lesse
then nothing. Match him
with the beast of the field, yea
of the desert; even there, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> every beast
hath some one ill quality, but
man hath all; yet, in regard of
rule, what a jolly Lord he is;
here is <hi>omnia subjecisti,</hi> thou
hast put all things in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him; Not the fiercest
Lyon, not the hugest Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
or the wildest Tyger,
but, either by force, or wile
man becomes his master; and


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19176:13"/>
though they have left that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
awe, which they bare
to him so soon as ever he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
his loyalty to his King;
yet still they doe, (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regret) acknowledge the
impressions of Majesty in
that upright face of his; Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are they but for man?
Some for his labor as the oxe;
some for his service as the
horse: some for his pleasure
as the dog, or the ape: some
for his exercise, as the beasts
of the forest, all for man: But
when we look up at his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Creator, <hi>Lord what is man?</hi>
O God, thou art an intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sphere, whose center is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, whose circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is no where but in thy
selfe: Man is a mere center


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19176:14"/>
without a circumference.
Thou, O God, <hi>in una essentia
omnia praehabes,</hi> in one essence
forecomprisest all things, as
<hi>Aquinas</hi> out of <hi>Dionysiw;</hi> man,
in a poore imperfect compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
holds nothing. Thou
art light, hast light, dwellest in
light inaccessible; Man of

could say, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It is for none but God to
want nothing: Man wants
all but evill; Shortly, thou art
all holinesse, power, justice,
wisdome, mercy, truth, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
Man is nothing but
defect, error, ignorance, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
impotence, corruption;
Lord then, what is man to


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19176:14"/>
thee but a fit subject for thy
wrath, yet let it bee rather a

Behold we are vile,

thine infinitenesse, doe thou
pitty our wretchednesse. <hi>Lord
what is man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leave wee comparisons;
Let us take man as he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
It is a rule of our olde

master of <hi>Bonaventure,</hi>
that a man should bee <hi>rigidus

as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> observes, in one
kinde, that nothing is more

Neither is it more rife for
dogs to bark at men, then
men at themselves. Alas, to
what purpose is this currish
clamour? Wee are miserable
enough though wee would
flatter our selves; To whose

but to our owne? I
come not hither to sponge

            <p>What should I fetch the

to shame us with our

posture of that
which shall be a man; There
he lyes, senselesse for some
moneths (as the heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
truly observes,) as if hee
had no soule. When hee


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19176:16"/>
comes forth into the large
womb of the world, his first
greeting of his mother is with
cryes and lamentations, (and
more hee would cry if hee
could know into what a
world he comes) recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
her painefull throwes
with continuall unquietnes;
what sprawling, what wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
what impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is here?
There lyes the poore little
Lording of the world, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

the new yeaned Lambe rises
up on the knees, and seeks for
the teates of her damme,
knowing where and how to
finde reliefe, so soone as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to bee. Alas, what can
man doe, if hee bee let alone,
but make faces, and noyses,


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19176:16"/>
and dye? <hi>Lord what is man?</hi>
This is his ingresse into the
world; his progresse, in it, is
no better. From an impotent
birth, hee goes on to a silly
childhood; if no body should
teach him to speake what
would hee doe? Historians
may talk of, <hi>Bec,</hi> that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught

he learn't it of the goates, not
of nature; I shall as soone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that <hi>Adam</hi> spake Dutch

Becanus</hi> his idle fancy, as
that the childe meant to speak

And if a mother or nurse did

feet and are wrapt in their

tend upon their dams for
their sustenance, and finde
them out amongst ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
            <p>Yea the very spider weaves
so soon as ever it comes out
of the egge: Assoone as age
and nurture can feoffe him in
any wit, hee falls to shifts; all
his ambition is to please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in those crude humours
of his yong vanity: If hee can
but elude the eyes of a nurse
or Tutor, how safe hee is?
Neither is he yet capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other care, but how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
his own good, and to be
a safe truant; It is a large time
that our Casuists give him,
that, at seven yeares, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19176:17"/>
to lye; Vpon time and
tutorage, what devises hee
hath to feed his appetite?
what fetches to live? And if,
now, many successions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
have furnisht him
with a thousand helps, yet, as

did scramble to live? they had
water and earth before them,

Plants they had, but metalls
whereby they might make
use of those plants, and redact

Is there any of you

the learned Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor

to the naturall condition
of man, yea of Satan in him.
The philosopher did well to
thanke God that hee was a
man, but, if I had beene by
him, I should have bidden
him to bewaile himselfe that
he was but a man; and, I say
to every of you, whom I
now see, and speak unto; that
if ye be but men, it had beene
better ye had never been; If
men, ye are but <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>It is out of mere ignorance
that man is so over-glad of

that the naturall man is most

Power; Surely if he had one
of these to purpose, hee could
be proud of neither, know
thy self, O man, and be proud
if thou canst. Why then doth

Now this knowledge, this

as a King, or diffused, and
communicated to him as a

what God did for him
as a King, that hee was his
tower for safety, his deliverer
from danger, his shield for
protection, his subduer of his

he addes, <hi>Lord what is man

What will follow
hence, but that they owe
more to God then other men;
since more respect calls for


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19176:35"/>
more duty; and, that we owe
unto them, those respects, and
observances, which Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation
calls for from us.
Homage, obedience, tribute,
prayers, lives, are due from us
to Gods Vicegerents; There
are nations of whom God
may say <hi>Dedi eis regem in ira:</hi>
Even such yet must have all
these duties; But when the
influences of soveraignty are
sweet and gentle, <hi>Sicut ros su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

much poure out our selves,
into gratitude to God for
them, to them under God.
Even so, O thou God of

in the Paternians of old; revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of late times, by <hi>Postellus</hi>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> that mans lower

Away with that mad misan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy:
there is no inch of
this living pile, which doth
not bewray steps of an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
and holy omnipotence.</p>
            <p>But oh the inside of this

though heathens, truly said;
That is the man, this is but
the case. Surely this reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
soule is so divine a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and the faculties of it
invention, memory, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so excellent; that it selfe
hath not power enough to
admire its owne worth,
what corner of earth, what
creek of sea, what span of
heaven is unsearcht by it?
how hath it surrounded this
globe, and calculated the
stars, and motions of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
what simple, or what
metall, or minerall can bee
hid from it? what eclipse or
conjunction, or other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of those celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
can escape its certaine
prediction? Yea, O Lord,


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19176:39"/>
it can aspire, and attaine to
know thee the God of spirits,
the wonderfull mysteries of
thy salvation; to apprehend I
meane, never (oh never) to
comprehend the wonderfull
relations of thy blessed, and
incomprehensible essence;
<hi>Divinae particula aurae.</hi> Lord
what is man that thou thus
makest account of him?</p>
            <p>I feare I shall make this
Topaze but so much the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
by polishing; but, as wee
may, shortly; Next to that the
tongue hath not skill enough
to tell the wonders of it selfe.
That little filme the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the soule how sweete
notes, how infinite varieties
of expressions can it forme;
and wel-neare utter what


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19176:39"/>
ever the mind can conceive; where
other creatures ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but bleat, or bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
or bray, or grunt, not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the rude uniformity of their
own naturall sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: By this, we can
both understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our selves, &amp; blesse
our maker; whence it is that <hi>David</hi>
justly styles his tongue, his glory.</p>
            <p>Besides his person, how hast
thou, ô God, ennobled him with
priviledges of his condition? How
hast thou made him the sole sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayor
of heaven, the Lord of the
creatures, the commander of the
earth, the charge of Angels?
<hi>Lord, what is man that thou makest
this high account of him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, what is all this, yet, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of what thou hast done
for our soules? I am now swallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
up, O God, with the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,
and astonishment of thy uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19176:40"/>
mercies. What shall I say,
that ere the world was, thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedst
man that should be; with an
everlasting love hast thou embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou madst happy,
and foresawest forlorn, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
The Angels fel, thou lettedst
them goe; Man fell; and, oh thou
blessed Son of the eternall Father,
thou wouldst rather divest thy
self of the robes of heavenly glory,
and come down, and put on these
rags of our flesh, &amp; therein indure
the miseries of a servile life, the
scorns of wretched men, the pains
of a bitter, and accursed death, the
wrath of thy blessed, and coessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Father, then men should not
be recovered; By thy stripes are we
healed, by thy blood we are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
by thy death we are quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by thy Spirit wee are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19176:40"/>
by thy merits we are saved; and
now Lord, what an account is this
thou hast made of man?</p>
            <p>What a wonderfull honor is this
to which thou hast advanced us?
By thee, O Saviour, we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconciled to God, but of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
are become serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the high
God. <hi>Acts 16. 17.</hi> Servants? yea
friends. <hi>Iames 2. 23.</hi> yea sons; the
sons of the highest. <hi>Luc. 6. 35.</hi> Sons?
yea heires, <hi>Haeredes cum re</hi> as S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose;</hi>
coheires with Christ, <hi>Rom. 8.</hi>
coinheritors of immortall glory.
<hi>1 Pet. 3. 22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, that, which all the Angels
of heaven stand stil amazed at, and
can never bee satisfied with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
thou hast caryed up this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature of ours into the inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
union with the ever glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and blessed Godhead, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19176:41"/>
of all principalities, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and thrones, and dominions
of heaven.</p>
            <p>Lo I, that even now could have
beene sory that I was a man, begin
now to be holily proud of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and know not whether I
may change the man for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
Pardon me, ye glorious Spirits;
I durst not speake thus big of my
selfe, but in the right of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
I dare, and must; <hi>non assumpsit
Angelum sed hominem;</hi> Howsoever
man is lower then you; (Alas what
should dust &amp; ashes talk of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
with spirituall &amp; heavenly
powers?) yet I am sure the Son of
man is above you; In him will I
glory: In it selfe your nature is so
much above ours, as it is more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
and nearer to your infinite
Creator: but if the Sonne of God


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19176:41"/>
hath advanced our nature above
yours in uniting it to the deity, we
cannot so much praise his mercy
as you do for us. Yea O ye blessed
Angels (whose greatnesse though
we must not adore, yet we cannot
but awfully acknowledge with
due veneration) I may boldly say,
ye hold it in no scorn to be (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,)
serviceable spirits to
the behoof of us weak and sinfull
men. <hi>Heb. 1.</hi> ult. Ye behold the face
of our heavenly father for us. <hi>Mat.
18.</hi> Ye beare us in your armes that
we dash not our feet against the
stones of offence. <hi>Ps. 91.</hi> Yee pitch
your tents about us for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
Ye rejoyce in heaven at our
conversion; Ye cary up our parting
soules into the bosome of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
As this is a wonderfull joy and
honor to us; so can it be no deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19176:42"/>
from your celestiall glory and
magnificence, since he whom yee
professe to serve with us professes
that he the Son of man came not
to be served; but to serve. Oh now
what can we want whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we have
such purveiors? What can we feare
whiles wee have such Gardians?
whiles we have such conveyance
what can let us from ascending
into our heaven?</p>
            <p>How justly doe we now exult
in the glory of man-hood, thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
thus united? But, soft, that
our rejoycing be not vain, whiles
our nature is thus glorious, our
person may be miserable enough.
Except we bee in Christ, united to
the Son of God, wee are never the
better for the uniting of this man-hood
to God: Where should am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
dwel but at a Court? Oh, be


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19176:42"/>
ye ambitious of this honor, which
will make you everlastingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
What ever become of your
earthly greatnes, strive to be found
in Christ, to be partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature, to be favourites of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It is a great word that <hi>Zozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
speakes of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that hee
never askt any thing in all his life,
of God, that he obtained not; if
we follow his rule, we shall bee
sure to bee no lesse happy. And
now being thus dignified by the
knowledge, by the accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God,
how should wee strive to walke
worthy of so high favours, both
in the duty of selfe-estimation, and
of gratitude.</p>
            <p>Selfe-estimation. For if God
make such account of us, why do
not we make high account of our
selves? I know I doe now spurre a


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19176:43"/>
free horse, when I wish every man
to think wel of one; but there is an
holy pride, that I must commend
unto you, with S. <hi>Ierom;</hi> a pride as
good, as the other is sinfull; that,
since God hath so advanced you,
you should hold your selves too
good to be the drudges of sin, the
pack-horses of the world, the vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
of satan; and thinke these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
vanities too base to cary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
your hearts; It was a brave
word of the old Iewish Courtier
<hi>Nehemiah, Should such a man as I flee?</hi>
Say yee so, yee regenerate soules.
Should such a man as I debauch
and sin? should such a man as I
play the beast? Is it for my upright
face to grovell? Is it for my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to walk on all foure? No, let
beasts be sensuall, let divels be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
let my heart bee as upright as


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19176:43"/>
my face. I will hate to shame my
pedigree; and scorn all the base and
misbecomming pleasures of sin, &amp;
will beare my self worthy of the
favourite of heaven.</p>
            <p>Gratitude. In retribution of
praise, and obedience. O God, thou
mightest have made made mee a
beast, yea the ugliest of crawling
vermin, that I run away from; I
could not have challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged thee; thy
will and thy workes are free, thy
power absolute; and lo, thou hast
made me thy darling, the quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of thy Creation, man. I will
praise thee for I am fearefully and
wonderfully made.</p>
            <p>Thou mightest have past by me
as an out-cast reprobate soule; and
so, it had bin a thousand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for me never to have been; But
thou hast bought me with a price.


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19176:44"/>
I will praise thee, for I am no lesse
wonderfully redeemed; O God,
nothing but man, &amp; man regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
of all the visible works of thy
hands, is capable to give thee the
glory of thy mighty creation, of
thy gracious redemption. The
lowest rank of creatures have not
life, the next have not sense, the
third have not reason; None but
the last hath grace to returne thee
the praise of thy blessed power, &amp;
mercy: Oh let not us be wanting
unto thee, who hast thus supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
unto us.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. Thankes is a
poore windy payment. Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
to God must be reall; <hi>Quid
retribuam?</hi> what should we render
to our God lesse then all? Yea, all is
too little for one mercy. We owe
our selves to thee, O God, as our


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19176:44"/>
Creator. What have we to give to
thee as our bounteous redeemer,
as our gracious sanctifier? Thou
that owest all, take all. Oh that
our bodies, soules, lives, actions
could bee wholly consecrated to
thee; Oh that we could really, and
constantly begin here those Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiahs,
which we shall ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
above, amids the Quire of
Saints and Angels giving all praise
and honor, and glory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
to thee O blessed Father
our Creator, to thee O blessed and

our sanctifier, one infinite God,
