         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

20. and 24. verses of that same Chapter,
leading vs vnto the creation of the other

these other creatures were created by that

yet they and man are not brought foorth
after one and the same manner by this

the light, the firmament, and so forth, be
content to say: <hi>Let there be light, Let there

creation of the other creatures vnto the
creation of man, not without speciall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

here thou must not thinke, ô my soule,
that thy powerfull God, to whom all
things are easie, brought foorth man with
any greater difficultie then he brought
forth the other creatures, or that he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

which they were resolued by the Kings
patent vnder his great seale, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
them of his loue, countenance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,

my blessed God, speaking to me by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is that onely foule thing, vnto the
which that cleane God of heauen cannot
draw neare, is that onely foule thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21098:16"/>
which cannot possibly draw neare him,
which cannot possibly abide where he is,
which cannot possibly enter where he is.
Shalt thou neuer begin grauely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with thy selfe, ô my soule, what things
blessed Iesus, clothing himselfe with the
nature of man, was heartily content to
take vpon him, and what that was which
he would no wayes vpon any condition
meddle with? A soule, with all the powers
of it, like vnto thee, ô my soule, Iesus will
take on, a bodie in all the members of it
like vnto this my bodie, he will not refuse
to put on. Yea, am I subiect vnto anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie
vnto the which he did not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
subiect himselfe? Yea, what shall I
say, did he not contentedly vndergo pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
pouertie in his birth, in the whole
course of his life, and in his death? Did he
refuse to be banished and exiled from his
natiue countrey, while he was yet in his
swadling cloathes? Did he not endure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and fearefull contempt, often wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
but neuer laughing, for any thing we
can reade? Yea, did he refuse to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied
by one who did eat in the dish with
him, to be deliuered to a strange Iudge by
those of his owne nation, whom he came
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21098:17"/>
to saue, to be accused by them, he many
a day trauelled to haue wonne to God, to
the end that through faith in him they
might haue bene excused before his
barre? And finally did he refuse to haue
his righteous soule propined with the
bitterest cup of Gods wrath, and his sacred
bodie to be scourged, crowned with
thornes, pierced with nailes, yea with the
speare, in the end yeelding vp his holy
blessed soule vpon the very cursed tree,
and that betwixt two malefactors? And
yet when all this is done and suffered by
him, ô my soule, will he be a sinner as I,
alas, am a sinner? No, no, a sinner as I am,
he will not be. He will be content to be
conceiued in the bosome of a woman, to
be borne of a woman, to liue a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, to dye as a man in the sight of
men, to the end that he may saue sinfull
man; but he will no wayes be conceiued
in sinne, be borne in sinne, liue in sinne, or
dye a sinner,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>but separate from sinners.</hi> And
therefore he is conceiued without sinne of
the holy Ghost, borne without sinne of
the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> liued so without sinne,
that none of his enemies could accuse him
of sinne; yea he dyeth so for sinners that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21098:17"/>
he who condemned him, behooued to
absolue him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 38.</note> saying, <hi>I know no fault in him,
I am innocent of the bloud of this iust man.</hi>
Must not sinne then, ô my soule, be a vile
foule thing, yea be that onely foule thing
which that cleane God of heauen abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and which should be abhorred by all
those who would proue themselues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to God; truly seeing holy, wise, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Iesus would no wayes meddle with it,
as with that which is not only worse then
any thing, but the onely euill? O when
shall Kings, Princes, great men, meane
men, yea beggers, thinke sin to be worse
then pouertie, then banishment, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
then contempt, then scourging; yea
then crucifying, and that in leud compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie?
Could this onely euill thing sinne be
seene by men, as it was seene by sweet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
sinners would be rarer, who now be
so fearefully frequent. Beside this, ô my
soule, sinne is that which cannot vpon any
condition abide where the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
abides. Tell me, tell me, must not those
Angels who sometimes possessed the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
Gods dwelling place, be cast out of
them, so soone as this onely euill thing
sinne lights vpon them? Must not <hi>Adam</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:21098:18"/>
possessing Paradise, defiling himselfe with
sinne, be put out of doores presently with
his sinne? Neither shall euer sinne, ô my
soule, be able to enter where God is; for
that Ierusalem which is aboue,<note place="margin">Reuel. 20. 27.</note> can admit
no vncleane thing. As sin is a foule thing,
ô my soule! so sinne is a defiling thing. But
what doth it defile? The soule of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the bodie of the sinner, his hall, his
chamber, his boord, his bed, his meate,
his drinke, his clothes; yea the very stones
and timber of his house, and so all which
belongeth to him. Hearest thou not the
Spirit saying vnto thee, ô my soule, <hi>Vnto
the pure are all things pure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>but vnto them
that are defiled and vnbeleeuing is nothing

                        <hi>He that coueteth an euill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousness
to his house, that he may set his

thou hast consulted shame to thine owne house
by destroying many people, and hast sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy owne soule, for the stone shall crie
out of the wall, &amp; the beame out of the timber
shall answer it.</hi> Finally, sin is a fearefully and
monstrously defiling thing, for it defileth
not onely sinfull man with all that which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21098:18"/>
belongeth vnto him, but it defileth euen
the very cleane things of God, when they
are handled by man being defiled: first
thereby making those cleane things of
God not onely to be foule, but to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination
before his Maiestie, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
hauing commanded them doth
take speciall delight in them. What cleane
thing is more cleane then prayer is in it

his eare from hearing the Law, euen his
prayer shall be abhominable.</hi> Yea, hearest
thou not <hi>Isaiah</hi> bringing in the Almighty
God speaking thus in the eares of the
Princes of Iudah, and people of Ierusalem,
<hi>What haue I to do with the multitude of your

                        <note place="margin">Isai. 1. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>saith the Lord? I am full of the burnt
offerings of rams, and of the fat of fed beasts,
and I desire not the bloud of bullocks nor of
lambes, nor of goates. When ye come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before me, who requires this at your
hands, to tread in my courts? Bring no moe
oblations in vaine: incense is an abhomination
vnto me, I cannot suffer your new Moones,
nor Sabbaths, nor solemne dayes (it is iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
nor solemne assembles. My soule hateth
your new moones, and appointed feasts, they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21098:19"/>
are a burthen vnto me, I am wearie to beare
them: and when ye shall stretch out your
hands I will hide my eyes from you, and though
ye make many prayers, I will not heare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
your hands are full of bloud.</hi> What if
this could be seene and considered by
men, ô my soule, ô with what an hatred
would sinne be hated, ô with what a care
would sinne be eschued! While I am
without the house of God, sinne defileth
me with all belongs to me, and when I
enter within the house of God, it maketh
me, alas, euen there to defile the very
cleane things of God. Thy God, ô my
soule, may abide to looke vpon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of any thing, may suffer the smell and
fauour of any thing, but the colour and
smell of sinne he may no wayes abide. And
ô would to God that man could learne
in this point to resemble his holy maker.
The basest begger cannot abide the sight
and smell of a priuie, for when he drawes
neare vnto it, he withdrawes his face from
it, and closeth vp his nosthrils: and yet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
euen the brauest courteour can abide
the sight and smell of idolatrie, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
oppression, murther, adulterie, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
&amp;c. The men of this world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21098:19"/>
ô my soule, that such and such things
haue their owne colour, their owne smell,
but when shall they learne out of that
blessed and onely worthie booke of God
(alas in this dead age drowned in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme,
scoffingly and disdainefully cast
behind backs with this prophane speech,
It is but the Bible) to know, and knowing
to perceiue, that sinne and righteousnesse
want not their owne colour, want not
their owne smell? Those who haue read
and considered that heauenly sweetest
booke of the Canticles, must know that
pietie and righteousnesse be white and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie,
and that sinne and iniquitie be
blacke and loathsome, before him who

affectus vt velit. We haue two things which
we must change, our vnderstanding and our

maketh men to commit sinne with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and what is that which moues them
first to neglect, and then to despise holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Surely nothing beside the want of
true heauenly light in their mindes, and
the want of true loue and hatred in their
hearts: for if they could see sinne to be
sinne as it is, and perceiue holinesse to be
holinesse as it is: would they not, seeing
sinne thus, hate sinne, would they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
holinesse thus, loue holinesse? And
if their heart could truly hate sinne, would
their hand attempt to commit sinne? If
their hearts could truly loue holinesse,
would their hands be stayed from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
of holinesse? The sense hereof

him out, if he be in; and keepe him out
if he be not entered within thy house.</head>
                     <p>WHen I reade holy Scripture, ô my
soule, I meet with two sentences
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21098:21"/>
touching sinne registred by his golden
pen, who can neither lie nor faine, who
no wayes can sinne, and against whom
sinne is onely committed. The sound of
the which two sentences coming to my
eares, the sense of the which two sentences
happily brought to my heart, makes sinne
to be vile in mine eyes, loathsome to my
taste and smelling, and altogether deadly
vnto my touching. And no wonder, for
by these two sentences my blessed God
trauelleth to acquaint foolish sinfull man
with the nature of sinne, and with that to
make the bold and presumptuous sinner
abstaine from medling with sinne. <hi>Cain</hi>
did cast downe his countenance vpon his
brother <hi>Abel,</hi> our God who from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
beholdeth all men, and all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men, reproouing him for this,
sayeth to him:<note place="margin">Genes. 4. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>If thou do well thou shalt be
accepted, but if thou do not well sinne lyeth at
the doore.</hi> Where thy wise God, ô my soule,
compareth sinne to an house dog, lying
before a mans doore, attending it, lest his
house be broken, to the hurt of the owner,
either in his goods, or in his person. But
here thou must know, ô my soule, that this
dog of sinne is a strange fearefull dog, of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21098:22"/>
a wonderfull, yea of a monstrous vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kind. Ordinarie dogs, which be the
handie worke of God, attending mens
houses and persons, do neither barke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
nor bite the maister, the mistresse,
the children, or seruants of that house
they attend and keepe, but do delight to
see them, to faine vpon them, and most
kindly do play with them: onely they
barke against and bite strangers, who be
vnknowne to them, and do not ordinarily
haunt their maisters house and companie.
But that dog of sinne, ô my soule, which is
from the diuell, will not barke against,
nor bite any stranger liuing without that
house where it lodgeth and is entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but barkes at, but bites, yea and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
eats vp and deuoures the maister,
the mistresse, the children, the seruants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it, with all that belongeth to
that house in the which it is bred, brought
vp and fostered.<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> If <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram</hi>

denie this?<note place="margin">Iosu. 7.</note> But what speake I of <hi>Corah,
Dathan, Abiram,</hi> and <hi>Achan?</hi> had not our
God, ô my soule, a pleasant dwelling
house in Shiloh for some yeares, and yet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21098:22"/>
was it not turned to a filthie iakes, by the
dog of sinne fostered in it? Had not our
God a house at Ierusalem, which was the
ioy of the whole earth; yea a matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and astonishment to the Princes
of it, and yet is it not first turned into
heapes of stones for seuentie yeares, and
afterwards made a spectacle of Gods
fearefull, yet iust vengeance, without any
expectation euer to be set vp againe, and
that by that fearefull dog of sinne, too
long and too louingly, alas, fostered in it,
and maintained by it? <hi>Moses</hi> being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

vnto them:<note place="margin">Numb. 32. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>But if ye will not do so, behold
ye haue sinned against the Lord, and be sure
that your sinne shall find you out.</hi> Here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
sinne to a bloud-hound, which is

which do flie and cannot be found,
till their footsteps being sented and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the dog, the seeker of them be
brought vnto the place whereunto they
betooke themselues. Now hereby <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
would teach thee, ô my soule, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
there be no eyes of man vpon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
seeing him while he sinneth, no eare
hearing him, no hand able to take him or
punish him, no foote able to ouertake
him: yet the sinner cleauing to his sinne,
and his sinne to him, shall assuredly at
length be found out, be brought in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
and be punished for his sinnes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

the Iewes are so stirred vp against him,
because for him many beleeued in Iesus,
that they hated him as they hated Iesus,
and did conclude to put him to death, as

from his torment, that he would repent
that very language spoken by him to bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Iesus, and making humble confession

teares, would crie for mercie. Sure I am,
were that thiefe, who died on our Maisters

that blessednesse is due to such who trust

that that man liues not now, who within

                     <p>SWeet Iesus, most sweet Iesus, yea Iesus
farre sweeter then the honie and the
honie combe, is that onely rich Iewell
more precious then the finest gold, fined
seuen times, which is onely worthy of thy

clearely, and perceiuest sensibly, to thy
great contentment and vnspeakable ioy.
Thou art a heauenly spirit, ô my soule,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21098:37"/>
created by that vncreated Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
by that eternall wisedome of
God thy Father, Iesus God-man, &amp; man-God,
to liue, through, before him, and

thee, ô my soule, that this sweetest honie
Iesus, that this only precious golden iewel
Iesus, (who alone being all things to thee,
is onely worthie of thy loue, desire, and
delight) is not to be found, but in a thorny
bush, and amongst pricking bryers, as it

thou must be content to be pierced to the

thou find him, for well is that bloud spent,
which is spilt in seeking after him, and in
finding of him. Yea albeit I should die
when thou hast gotten him, ceasse not
to sticke by him, ceasse not to keepe
him. For ô how honourably dieth he,
who dieth resolutely for seeking and
keeping of that blessed Iesus, who
died willingly, to the end that he might
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21098:37"/>
find him, and finding him, might saue him
from that death which onely deserueth
the stile of death? Iesus thy loue, ô my

not to be found, but in the thornie bush of
pricking tentations, and amongst the

And therefore if I, bending my eare to the

and this thou must first take in thy hand,
taste with thy mouth, and carrie on thy

full of sweet pleasures, free of all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

sweet pleasures; thou shalt find him
to be most strong also, easily able to keepe

For thou canst not find Iesus, vnlesse thou

committed in secret, albeit there was

neuer any sinne committed but in sight. It
may be that sinne be committed behind

of God, who made man, and who hath

blind powers &amp; people of this world, liue
so now, as if the God of heauen had no
eyes, or had blind eyes, either seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, or seeing nothing afarre off.
Alwayes out of Scripture I haue learned
three things touching this point, ô my
soule. First, that our God hath eyes: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that our God hath eyes of a rare
excellent nature: Thirdly, that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speciall cause our God hath taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                        <hi>Augustine</hi> is not afraid to say, <hi>Deus est

seeing behind, on this side, on that
side, aboue, and beneath him, as it were.
But of what nature are the eyes of our
God? ô my soule, Scripture resoluing this
point, telleth me that the eyes of our God
are cleare eyes, are pure eyes, cleare eyes,
vnto the which all men with all things are
open. O how many men haue eyes, and yet
how many men be hidden from the eyes
of men! how many things be hidden from
the eyes of men! But I must tell thee, ô my
soule, that there cannot so much as one
man be hidden from the eyes of God, yea
which is more, there cannot so much as
one thought of one man be hid from the
eyes of God. This is cleared by our God,
saying,<note place="margin">Ier. 16. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>My eyes are vpon all their wayes, they

                        <hi>saith the Lord? All

                        <hi>But when Iesus saw their thoughts, he
said, wherefore thinke ye euill things in your

                        <note place="margin">Reu. 1. 14.</note> And therefore I heare <hi>Iohn</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thus of Christs eyes, <hi>His eyes were as
a flame of fire.</hi> Againe Scripture telleth me
that our God hath pure eyes, and therefore
he cannot possibly behold any vncleane
man or matter, vnlesse he hate both, or
punish both. This is that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
confesseth,<note place="margin">Hab. 1. 13.</note> when speaking of our
God, he saith, <hi>Thou art of pure eyes, and
canst not see euill, thou canst not behold wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse.
Dauid</hi> saw and confessed this,
saying,<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou art not a God that loueth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
neither shall euill dwell with thee.</hi>
Thirdly, Scripture telleth me, ô my soule,
that our God hath cloathed himselfe with
eyes, yea with such eyes, to the end that
he, as that sole supreme Iudge of the
world, may thinke and speake of men, and
do vnto men, as they by their carriage,
priuate and publicke, declare themselues,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21098:56"/>
either to be obedient to him, or rebellious
against him; and therefore I heare the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
speaking thus to me of God: <hi>Thy eyes
are vpon all the wayes of the sonnes of men,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 32. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>to

the father of his flesh, yet in the sight of
God the Father of his spirit. <hi>Vriah</hi> was
slaine by <hi>Dauid,</hi> being farre from <hi>Dauid</hi>
behind the backe of all Iudah <hi>(Dauid</hi> and

the backe of all Ammon,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.</note> by whose sword

in his sight who filleth the heauens
and the earth, and from whom none can
hide himselfe in secret place, as hath bene
cleared, Ierem. 23. 24. And this I thinke
<hi>Dauid</hi> was made afterward to know and
confesse, notwithstanding all his shuffles
and policie. Who in all Israel could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
thinke that <hi>Naboth</hi> was cruelly and
vniustly put to death, and so that <hi>Achab</hi>
the King and <hi>Iezabel</hi> the Queene (who
should haue prooued his protectours and
keepers) were his fierce persecutors euen
vnto death?<note place="margin">1. King. 2.</note> seeing he was conuicted by a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21098:56"/>
formall Iurie, hauing witnesses admitted
&amp; sworne, testifying that he had blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
God and the King: and yet that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God who searcheth the heart, and
who iudgeth not according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, but righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did accuse and conuict <hi>Achab</hi> of
oppression and murther, and punish him
iustly for them. Oh, ô my soule, when
shall the blind men of this age learne to

that that sinne wherein I was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

and hurt could be perceiued, euen by vs
who call our selues Gods children, we
should be easily moued with that chosen

miserable man that I am, who shall deliuer
me from this bodie of death!</hi> Knowest thou
not, ô my soule, that thou and this my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
came ioyntly in one minute, ioyned

thou not, ô my soule, that thou and this
my body haue liued since that time of my

as husband and wife, most strictly maried
one to another, euen before God, and by
God? And yet that bitter roote of sinne,
which, alas, was conceiued, was borne, &amp;
which liueth within vs, will haue thee, ô
my soule, (in despite of all we can deuise
or do) separate from this bodie of mine,
and this my bodie separate from thee. But
doth bitter sinne stay here, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this be a sharpe stroke? No, ô my
soule, for sinne euen after this separation
is made, doth make that bodie within the
which sometime it lodged, in regard of
the vile and filthie stinke it sendeth foorth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21098:60"/>
vnto their nostrils, most odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
though sometime pleasant to the
eyes of the beholders, and fragrant vnto
the smell of such as approched neare vnto
it. In such sort, that the louing father can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suffer his tender child, being dead, to
abide in one house with him: and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
hearted mother, is contented that
the dead corps of her dearest child, euen
within some few houres, be put foorth of
her doores. But heare, ô my soule, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
thou not, that a more vile stinke
and loathsome smell floweth from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dead corps of Gods children, then
from the dead carions of other creatures,
as of fowles, fishes, and beasts? Ceasse to
wonder at this, ô my soule, and learne to
thinke vpon that loathsome spring from
whence this proceedeth. I must tell thee,
ô my soule, that the bodie of the holiest
man that euer liued on earth here (that
glorious sacred bodie of blessed Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excepted) lodgeth a more vile and
stinking guest (onely loathsome to God
and his Angels) then euer the bodies of
any fowle, fish, or beast did lodge. I must
confesse indeed, that the bodies of these
creatures do lodge corruption, yea, much
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21098:61"/>
corruption, as may be easily perceiued
while they liue, and especially when they
be dead. Alwayes that stinking loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
guest of sinne they do not lodge,
which the very bodies of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,
Iacob, Iames, Iohn, Peter, Paul,</hi> could not
but lodge. And therefore no wonder that
a more noysome stinke flow from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dead bodies of Gods Saints, then from
the carrions of these reasonlesse creatures.
But doth sinne stay here, ô my soule, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
this be a deepe stroke? No, no: for
sinne will haue that stinking dead bodie,
in the which it lodgeth, whether it be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the bowels of the earth,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> or vnder

here, albeit this would seeme to be the
dead stroke, beyond the which none can
go in the child of God? No, no, for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not historie vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of dead corpses

toades and cruell serpents. <hi>Augustine</hi> in

Dare I here forget the like strange
spectacle, (by Gods speciall prouidence I
doubt not (for my better resolution tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the veritie of the things alledged)
presented to mine owne eyes, being in the
Churchyard of Leith in the moneth of
Iune anno 1615. For being there deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to behold for a while those honest
men, who were then busied about the
building of the steeple, I espied within a
grassie bush the scull of some dead corps,
hauing in the vpmost part of it a little
voide. And hauing a purpose to cause the
Sexton put the scull vnder the earth, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on it more narrowly, I saw through
the voide part of it (to my great astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
a toade of huge bignesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I called the workemen to consider
this spectacle with me, and hauing made
a little discourse vnto them, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
vilenesse, vanitie, and pride of man,
we all began to consider how we might
haue the toade separated from the head,
but that we found altogether impossible,
till the bone was violently broken, so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
was the voide part of it, and so big
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21098:62"/>
was the toade. Let the Reader iudge
where this toade was bred and fostered.
For he who knoweth all things (blessed
be his name) knoweth that I saw it lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as said is. O my soule, what if these
things could be considered by men, and
especially by women in this our licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
foolish age: would they take such
paines and delight to fat their clay bodies
with all sorts of pleasures and pleasant
things as they do? Would they, euen with
the wracke of their estate, feed bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
dresse their heads, couer their backs
so daintily, so gloriously, which must be
brought so low, and be made a mother to
conceiue, a nurse to foster, yea a lodging
to keepe such vgly monsters? Yea if this
could be considered, ô my soule, ô with
what an hatred would the child of God
hate sinne! and with what a care would he
arme himselfe against sinne, seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beside sinne hath brought all these
euils vpon poore miserable man. <hi>Bernard</hi>
could no sooner thinke vpon this, but he
behooued, standing amazed, to crie out:
<hi>Vnde haec tanta pusillanimitas, vt egregia

cometh this so great basenesse of spirit, that
man, that notable creature, capable of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
blessednesse, and of the glorie of the great
God, by whose breath he was made, with
whose image he was marked, by whose bloud
he was redeemed, by whose spirit he hath
his adoption sealed vp, and is enriched
by faith, should not, alas, be ashamed to be
a slaue to his corporall senses, to omit all
care of his soule, and to haue a care of his
bodie, to be solist to fat and foster his rotten
carrion, which shortly afterwards is to be
made the meate of wormes.</hi> O when shall
we of this loose licentious age, onely
carefull to haue our bodies dressed, and
altogether carelesse of our soules, learne
to confesse that to be true, which <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
saw and confessed long ago.<note place="margin">August.</note> 
                        <hi>Dum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitatem

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21098:63"/>
deuorat &amp; ligna foenum &amp; stipulam ignis
comburit, ita delicata caro animan concremat
&amp; consumit. While we feare the weaknesse of
our body, we neglect the saluation of our soule:
for if the flesh be delicately fed, it slayeth the
spirit, for as the mothe destroyeth the wooll
and timber, and as the fire consumeth hay
and stubble, so a bodie giuen to pleasures
burnes vp and consumes the soule.</hi> O when
shall the Christians of this age looke
wisely vpon their soules and bodies,
and looking on them learne to discerne
betwixt them, and discerning aright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, begin to spend their time
here, as <hi>Bernard</hi> well grounded by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
aduiseth them: <hi>Tempus hoc animabus
non corporibus assignatur. Dies salutis est non
voluptatis, cum iudicium carnis ex anima
pendeat. Carni nihil potest vtilius quam salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
animae prouideri. This time is appointed for
our soules, and not for our bodies, this time is
the day of saluation, not of fleshly delectation:
considering the iudgement of the body depends
vpon the soule; and so man cannot possibly
prouide better for his bodie then by seeking
that which is able to benefit his soule.</hi>

                     <p>IN this last and worst age of the world,

after sinne, defile themselues with sinne,
yea, alas, delight themselues in sinne, and
all because few men, alas, studie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
themselues with the nature of sin.
Men, now adayes, ô my soule, miscarried
by their owne deceiuing lusts, while they
fall into sinne, seeke vnto men, yea vnto
men onely, as if sinne were committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
man, yea against man onely: and
out of this false ground, blindly, alas, laid
by them, as they thinke of the man with
whom they haue to do, so they thinke of
the sinne which they haue committed. If
that man be such a one who may grieue
and annoy them, then they are grieued for
their sinne. Alwayes not because that
great God is abused by them, but because
a man who may grieue them, is grieued
by them. If that man be such a man who
cannot grieue them, who dare not attempt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21098:64"/>
to annoy them, by reason of their grandor
and worldly credit, and his basenesse and
lacke of credit with men. Oh then, ô my
soule, they do both digest their sinnes
sweetly, and go on in their sinne peartly
and pleasantly: for can these men possibly
dreame, that any beside man hath any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to quarrell them for their sinne? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
hearken, hearken, ô my soule, would
man suffer that good word of God which
is that word of truth (which neuer decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
any man, which neuer shall deceiue
any man) to leade him, he should find that
euery sinne committed on earth beneath
here (be the committer of it Prince or
peasant) looketh not lower then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

sinne committed beneath here, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against none who liueth beneath
here, but against that supreme Maiestie,
who ruling ouer all things hath his throne
set aboue all thrones, euen in the highest
heauens. I will confesse, ô my soule, that
a subiect may offend and grieue his king,
and the king his subiect; that a father may
hurt and grieue his sonne, and a sonne his
father: but Scripture being well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
will not suffer me to confesse, that a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21098:64"/>
subiect can sinne against his king, or a
king against his subiect; that a father can
sinne against his sonne, or a sonne against
his father. Tell me, tell me, ô my soule,
what callest thou sinne? Sinne I know (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <note place="margin">1. Iob. 3. 4.</note> But of whose law I pray thee? not
of the law of any pettie king, but of the

onely supreme Law-giuer, who is able to
saue and destroy. Knowest thou not, ô my
soule, wherefore theft is sinne, and when
theft is sinne, wherefore murther is sinne,
and when murther is sinne, and so forth of
all other sinnes? Because God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
them, and when God forbiddeth
them, are they not sinnes, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?
Hast thou not heard, ô my soule,
that the Israelites spoyled the Egyptians
of all their iewels,<note place="margin">Exod. 11. 2. 3. &amp; 12. 55. 56.</note> yet, I thinke, you will
neither accuse nor conuict them for their
deed, and all because that was done of
them by the speciall command of his
mouth who can command no wrong.
Yea, hast thou not heard, ô my soule, that
<hi>Ehud</hi> killed <hi>Aeglon,</hi> yet thou must thinke
that he cannot be reputed a murtherer for
that, it being done by the secret commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

of that supreme Lord, who hath ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

sinned grosly, albeit not against <hi>Bathshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>

                        <hi>Thou shalt not commit adulterie:
Thou shalt do no murther.</hi> The sight and

bloud of Iesus, for it can wash a man, not
from one sinne, but from euery sinne, yea
from all sinnes, were they neuer so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
so presumptuous. Hast thou not, ô
my soule, considered that first Chapter of
<hi>Matthew</hi> for thine information, yea for
thy speciall consolation, touching this
point? O blessed Iesus my Sauiour, of
whom art thou come according to the
flesh, and so what fathers, what mothers,
hath thy Maiestie as thou art man? is thy
Maiestie, ô my Sauiour, onely come of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and not of <hi>Pharez</hi> also, whom <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
begot on <hi>Tamar</hi> his daughter in law?
Will thy Maiestie, ô my Sauiour, haue <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21098:75"/>
mother, and not <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot, and
<hi>Ruth</hi> the Moabitesse also? But wherefore,
ô my soule, would blessed Iesus haue such
fathers and such mothers according to the
flesh? Surely, surely, to testifie before God,
Angels, and men, that he came not to call
the righteous, but sinners to repentance,
were their sinnes neuer so many, and so
monstrous, prouiding that they by a liuely
faith could keepe that bloud which he
hath shed to wash them, and by sincere
repentance accompaning this their faith,
testifie to the world that they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

ashamed to lay that open before God,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21098:88"/>
Angels, and men, which thou canst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
to be true. Oftentimes hath my God
who cannot lie, by that holy volume of
sacred Scripture, indited by that Spirit
of truth, and read by me, presented before
me that stinking stable of that vile heart I
carrie about with me. Alwayes, neuer
was I any wayes truly sensible to my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
before God, of the nature of
this stable of my heart, till through thy
grace I was made to reade that touching
my heart, vpon the table of my heart;
which I had read before in the volume of
holy Scriptures. Oh Lord God that euer
man hearkned vnto Satan, and hearkning
vnto him, loosed thy glorious Image, to
the which he was made: for had not man
fallen from thee, such thoughts would
neuer haue fallen vpon him; yea, he
would neuer haue carried about with him
that filthiest stable, the like whereof is
not to be found in the aire among the
foules, in the seas among the fishes, nor
in the earth among the beastes, out of the
which such thoughts do flow. Let the
sight and sense of this, ô my soule, leade
thee mid-day, morning, and euening,
with <hi>Dauid</hi> towards the throne of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21098:88"/>
grace of thy God, leaning strongly vpon
the merits and mediation of thy onely
Mediator, and Sauiour Iesus, begging
with sobbes and teares, the blessed Spirit
of sanctification, by whose mortifying
power this stinking stable of my heart,
may peece and peece be emptied of that
vile matter, (alas, while I am sleeping
while I am waking,) gusheth so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
out of it, to the offence of my God
and to the continuall disquieting of my

force, this stinking stable being thus
happily emptied of this vile matter, may
be graciously turned in a cleane shining
cabinet, well decked and hung with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
tapistrie, fit to receiue, fit to retaine
through the working grace of this Spirit,
the changer and keeper of it, euen that
sweet Spirit of the Father, and of his
Sonne; to the end that holy one making
his abode and residence with me, yea,
within me: I may hereafter so carie my
selfe, that my thoughts, my lookes, my
hearing, my smelling, my tasting, my
touching, yea, my whole speeches,
workes, and wandrings, may be such as
may glorifie my Father, edifie my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21098:89"/>
and stop the mouthes of my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
and haue thee, ô my soule, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that thy God hath begunne graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to giue, and to enrich thee with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
grace; and that his Maiestie will not
cease out of that his free loue (which
changeth not) to adde grace vnto grace,
till it please him (perfecting his happily
begun and well prosecuted good worke)
turne begunne grace into perfect and
endlesse glorie. Could I see my heart, ô

aloud and say: Ye seeke not me, but mine.
Lift vp thy eares, ô my soule, and hearken.
Can the couered Hipocrites of this our

time, either loue God or his word, but as
the greedie oxe loueth his owner, and as
the filthie swine loueth his maister. Let
the owner of the oxe fill his stall, his oxe
shall then attend him carefully; let the
maister of the swine fill his trough, so shall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21098:90"/>
the swine follow him. While thy God, ô
my soule, fatteth and stuffeth men of this
world with honours, pleasures, wealth and
health, then easily can they say, <hi>Blessed be
the name of the Lord.</hi> Yea, then they can
tone with a speciall triumph, albeit from
a treacherous heart, with foule lippes, and
for a shamelesse brutish end: that 1. verse
of that most comfortable twentie third
Psame. <hi>Thou dost prepare a table before me
in the sight of my aduersaries: thou dost an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
my head with oyle, and my cup runneth
ouer.</hi> So that these who at the first, and
before triall do heare, and see them,
would take them for one of a thousand,
and so for men sincerely louing, and truly
seeking, and seruing God: albeit in the
meane time, neither God, nor Gods
word can find so much as his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
but onely when he hath his proud
backe couered, and his foule bellie filled
by him. When I reade the second of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea,
I find that the whole gold, siluer,
corne, wine, oyle, and wooll, in this
world is Gods. When I reade the 76.
Psalme, the 4. of Daniell, and the 5. of
Daniell, I find that all the kingdomes of
the earth are Gods, and that his onely
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21098:90"/>
supremest Maiestie is the onely giuer of
maiestie, glorie, and honour, and ô how
busily, alas, do men euery where seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

assure thee, ô my soule, that whosoeuer
shall find these gifts of God, and finds not
God with them, the giuer of them shall
repent one day that euer he found them,
as these alledged Scriptures may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

and what man beholding them (being

should carie vnto that holy one of God,
Iesus blessed for euermore,) would not
for this haue commended them? Alwayes
when this multitude comes where Iesus
is, and not without a speciall admiration
demands him thus: <hi>Rabbi when camest thou

seruing thy God, thou art seeking him
onely in shew, to his offence, and to thy
ouerthrow, or truly for himselfe to his
hearts contentment and glorie, and to thy
true weale and wealth, here and for euer.
Hearken, hearken, ô my soule, for now I
must tell thee, that the free honest seruant
of God, who is also his kindly child,
loues his God, loues the word of his God,
not for honour, but for heauen; not for
goods, and gaine, but for grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
and so not for his backe, and bellie,
but for his soule; yea, but for his God
whom he must loue, and whom he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
cease to loue, albeit there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heauen after this to ease him, nor
hell to grieue him for euer. And so in a
word, Gods child loues him, not for any
thing that is beneath here; but for his
Maiestie who is aboue, &amp; for these things
which do ioyne him with him, and do
conuey him vnto him. Shall <hi>Iacob</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21098:91"/>
(his God being happily with him)
to serue a verie churle for twentie one
yeares, being consumed now with heate,
now with cold, and hauing his wages
changed ten times. And can it possibly
grieue thee, ô my soule, with the best
heart I haue, to seeke and serue thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
kind true God, all the dayes of my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
here, albeit he whippe me not
with one, but with many scourges. It is
an easie thing, ô my soule, yea, a very
easie thing to a man, when his oxen are
plowing, his sheepe and asses feeding, his
corne growing, his summes of money
layd downe before him, his table richly

it like oliue plants, then to beginne, and

and with a Chapter of Gods booke
read, yea, not to want his Psalme sung
as if his priuate house were some publicke
Temple. Yet I dare not denie, ô my soule,
but it shall proue a very hard thing to

                     <p>SCripture telleth me, ô my soule, that
our God, that iust iudge of the world,
and that wise louing father of his Church,
commeth to men by iudgements, by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and by tentations. Iudgements
being most rife, afflictions, being also
common, tentations being most rare.
Iudgements, as they are approued to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and tentations being layd vpon
the wicked, Gods enimies: afflictions,
and tentations, as they be taken properly,
seasing onely vpon Gods children, and
dearest seruants. Iudgements layed by
God vpon the wicked his enemies,
proceed from that fearefull spring of
Gods hot consuming wrath; and being
accompanied with that confounding spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of bondage, are layed vpon them for
sinnes committed proudly against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
and are nothing else but forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of that euerlasting wrath, vnder the
which they shall lie in hell for euer. And
their iudgements thus inflicted vpon the
wicked, ô my soule, be neither profitable,
nor honourable for them. For, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite?
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21098:94"/>
what honour, did <hi>Cain, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
reape, by these iudgements which
ouertooke them before men, and sent
them afterwards to their owne places?
The consideration whereof suffers me
not to wonder, that when these iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
approached them they themselues
proued their owne greatest enemies.<note place="margin">Ambr. offi.</note> The

                        <hi>The wicked man

Affliction againe, being inflicted by
God vpon his owne children, debars the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with the prodigall child from his wayes;
and doth flow from the sweet wholesome
fountaine of Gods fatherly wise loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accompanied with that Spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
who is also that Spirit of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
by the which God their wise Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doth bring them to a sight and
sense of their sinnes, to a sorrowing for
their sinnes, yea, to a forsaking of them,
making them turne homewards to him
by repentance: and their afflictions be
profitable to the child of God, albeit not
honourable; for notwithstanding it was
profitable for <hi>Dauid</hi> that he (falling in
adulterie and murther) was afflicted as he<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:21098:94"/>
himselfe most freely confesse, yet it was
no wayes honourable to him. Also it
was profitable for the prodigall child, that
he was brought to extremitie after he had
forsaken his fathers house, and wasted
his goods with riotous liuing, (for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God being mercifull with him, he was
made to seeke homeward to his father.)
The sense hereof moued <hi>Bernard</hi> to say:
<hi>Si quid amaritudinis sentio in voce eius, non

If I perceiue any bitternesse in the speech of my
God, it wants not his owne sweetnesse, for
while he is angrie with me, he cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

O would to God, that euerie man could
speake and thinke, of the afflictions of
the Saints, as that famous Father <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
was moued to thinke, and speake of
them.<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 92.</note>

the one, and ouerseeth the other. The one
doth euill, and is not chastened by his father:
the other, so soone as he begins to sturre, is
cuffed by him. Now wherefore is the one ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene,
and the other beaten: is it not because
the inheritance is prepared for him, who is
corrected; and he is disinherited who is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene.</hi>

O hearest thou not my Sauiour say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thee, ô my soule, <hi>As many as I loue
I rebuke and chastise.</hi> Out of the sense
whereof <hi>Paul</hi> can charge and resolue thee
thus: <hi>My sonne despise not the chastenings
of the Lord, neither faint when thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
of him. For whom the Lord loueth he
chasteneth, and he scourgeth euerie sonne
that he loueth: if ye endure chastenings, God
offereth himselfe vnto you as vnto sonnes. For
what sonne is it whom the father chasteneth
not. If therefore ye be without correction
whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards
and not sonnes.</hi> The sense hereof moued
<hi>Augustine</hi> to say: <hi>Cum flagellat Deus filium
currat sub manu patris flagellantis, quia
quando flagellat ad haereditatem erudit, ad
tempus emendat, non in aeternum damnat.
Elige tibi temporalem vis laborem, an sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternam
poenam, temporalem felicitatem, an
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21098:95"/>
aeternam vitam. Quid minatur Deus, sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternam
poenam; quid promittit Deus, sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternam
requiem. In quo flagellat Deus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,
temporale est: In quo parcit malis, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porale
est. When God scourgeth his sonne,
let his sonne runne vnder the hand of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
scurging him, because while he scurgeth
him, he fits him for his inheritance, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
him for a while, he condemes him not
for euer. Make thy choise, whither thou wilt
vndergoe trouble for a time, or euerlasting
paine; temporarie happinesse, or euerlasting
life. Wherewith threatneth God thee ô man
with euerlasting paine. What promiseth God
vnto thee ô man? eternall rest. That wherein
God correcteth his owne good children, is
temporarie laying on them for a while; that
wherein God spareth the wicked, is also tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie,
continuing onely with them for as
short a while.</hi> Tentations againe, ó my
soule, for trials are layed by God vpon his
dearest children, and speciall painfull
faithfull seruants, euen while they through
his speciall grace, are carefully studying
to prouide for honest things, both before
God and man. And so when with <hi>Enoch,
Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are walking
before God, and amongst men holilie,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21098:96"/>
righteously, and soberly, abhorring to
consent vnto euill, delighting to do well,
and reioycing to suffer euen greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
for well doing. Now their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
do flow from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sweetest spring, of
that feruant old loue wherewith our God
loueth, and of that rarest account his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
maketh of these his dearest children
and seruants, and of these singular graces
mercifully bestowed by him, vpon them:
and their tentations be layed by God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his children, for the triall of these
graces, yea, for the clearing and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
of them, yet no wayes vnto that
God the onely giuer and keeper of them,
who is perfectly acquainted with that
measure of faith, of hope, of patience,
wherewith he hath inriched his holy
ones, but to themselues and others: to the
end that his tempted child, and with him
others who do see him, and heare tell of
him, may perceiue how farre his God
hath spiritually beautified and inriched
his soule. Thus our God tempting <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
euen while he was walking before
him vprightly, commands him to offer
vp his onely sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> whom he loued
in a burnt offring to him,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> to the end, that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21098:96"/>
first <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe, and then others
might know what a measure of faith he
had bestowed vpon <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thus our
God to trie iust <hi>Iob,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 1. 2.</note> who was a man who
feared God, and eschewed euill; bereft
him of his whole goods, children, and
health, his wife, friends, and seruants, in
the meane time, prouing miserable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters
to him, and all to the end that
with himselfe, others might know with
what a measure of faith, hope, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
his God had blessed him. Thus our
blessed wise God, tempting <hi>Dauid</hi> euen
after he had annointed him to be King of
Iudah and Israel by the hand of <hi>Samuel.</hi>
had <hi>Saul</hi> the King so turned vpon him,
that howbeit he slew <hi>Goliah,</hi> eased <hi>Saul</hi>
by his Musicke, when the euill spirit
troubled him, and married his daughter:
yet he may not keepe the court, keepe
his owne house, yea, find a cottage
in all the holy land to hide himselfe in;
but is compelled to flee to Achis King of
Gath,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 27.</note> and all to the end, that his wise, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Father might make it knowne, first,
to himselfe, and then to others, what store
of grace lodged within his soule. The
Apostles of Iesus are faithfully, aud busily
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21098:97"/>
seruing their Maister, by preaching the
Gospell sincerely,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 4. 5.</note> and freely: alwayes are
they not hated, accused, imprisoned bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
yea, put to death for this their seruice?
euer reioycing that they suffered such
things and all to the end, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
might know that it was not onely
giuen to them, to beleeue in Iesus but to
suffer for him. While spices abide whole
in the merchants pocket, they remaine
vnsauorie, but when they are put in the
morter, and beaten with the pestle, all
that be in the house do smell them. That
prouerbe holdeth most true, <hi>Apis sine acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio
non mellificat. Bees without the sting make
no honie.</hi> In the calme day of blooming
prosperitie, can the graces of the Saints
be knowne? alwayes let the pestle of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
seaze vpon them, their spices of
faith, hope, and patience, shall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.
Yea, howbeit while the child of
God is not burthened with the sting of
tentation, he appeare vnprofitable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and to himselfe: yet so soone as he
beginnes to carrie this sting layed vpon
him by his Father, he can make and bring
forth wholesome honie, for the honour of
his God, for the ioy of his owne soule
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21098:97"/>
and for the benefite of others. <hi>Augustine</hi>
saw this, and could write this most sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and truly, touching tentation. <hi>Omnes
tentatio probatio est,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug in Psal. 51.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; omnis probationis

Euerie tentation is a triall, and the worke of
euerie triall hath his owne fruite, because a
man is euen oftentimes vnknowne to himselfe
not knowne what he may endure, or what he
may not endure. Now he presumes that he
may endure that which he may not, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he despaires that he can endure that
which he may endure, in this meane time
in comes tentation as a question deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him and saying as it were what mayst
thou suffer, what mayst thou not suffer? and
hereupon the man is found out by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who knew not himselfe before, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
before that he was not vnknowne to
his maker.</hi> And againe, <hi>Perfectio nostra
per tentationem fit, nec sibi quisquam innotes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
nisi tentatus, nec potest coronari nisi vicerit,

Diligence, Thankfulnesse, and Feare,
Humilitie, considering that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

that he is not Lord of that which he
hath, but a steward onely; who one

should both find comfort vnder y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> crosse,

Thankfulnesse, and Confidence. It
breedeth iointly Humilitie, Patience, and
Repentance: for can the well reformed
child of God possibly see, that no hand
beside the hand of God his Father is lying
on him, and that not vniustly, but iustly,
euen because by sinne he hath prouoked
him to wrath, and yet that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

O religious king <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> shall not thy

thou art sharpely threatned by thy God,
speaking to thee by the mouth of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
condemne the pride, the impatiencie, and
the obstinacie of a great many, not kings
onely, but base men, in these our dayes
crossed, and threatned with the crosse.
<hi>Ezekiah</hi> hath ouerseene himselfe, in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Ambassadours of the king of
Babel all that was in his house, and in his
treasure, for this cause he must heare that
sharpe Sermon brought to his eares:
<hi>Heare the word of the Lord of hostes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa 39. 5. 6. 7</note>

which thy fathers have layed vp in store to
this day, shall be carried to Babel, nothing

which shall proceed out of thee, and which thou
shalt beget, shall they take away, and they shall
be Eunuches in the palace of the king of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>
But how is this bitter Sermon heard,
and accepted by him? Hearken, hearken, ô
my soule, vnto that brought vnto thy
eares by the eight vers. of the 39. of <hi>Isaiah,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21098:109"/>
Then said Ezekiah vnto Isaiah, the word of
the Lord is good which thou hast spoken.</hi> O
admirable humilitie, patience, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
worthy to be considered grauely,
and imitated carefully, by all kings and
subiects; who with <hi>Ezekiah</hi> would after
their labours here, rest, and reigne kings
with that King of kings for euer. Shall
<hi>Nazianzene</hi> aduise me, ô my soule, louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to reuerence and embrace the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and correction of a iust man: <hi>A viro
iusto castigari praestat, quam vngi ab impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo:
illius enim asperitas propter asperitatem
suauis est, huius autem benignitas quoque
suspecta. It is better to be chastened with
sharpe whips by a iust man, then to be annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with soft and sauourie oyle by a wicked
man: for the sharpnesse of a iust man his
strokes is pleasant, because of the benefit
which commeth by them, but euen the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and courtesie of the other is to be suspected.</hi>
And should not I, ô my soule, be content
much more to be corrected at the hand
of my God, who is iustice and goodnesse
it selfe? The sense hereof breedeth also,
and conserueth in the heart of Gods
child, that pleasant, sweet, and wholsome
herbe of heauenly thankfulnesse, making
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21098:109"/>
Gods child not onely to be humble, to be
patient, to be penitent vnder the crosse,
but also thankfull for the crosse. Yea,
yea, ô soule, Gods afflicted child, can
euen from his very heart, both with his
heart &amp; with his voyce, chearfully thanke
the Lord his God for his crosses layed on
him; and no wonder that he do so, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well acquainted with that fountaine
out of the which his afflictions flown; with
that proclamation his afflictions sounds in
his eares, and conueyes to his heart; and
with that fruite they bring forth at length
to him. The afflictions of Gods child flow
from the sweetest fountaine of God his
fatherly loue, for as our God correcteth
not where he hateth, so he forgetteth not
to correct where he loueth. And therefore
the Angell of the Church of Laodicea
must heare this spoken vnto him:<note place="margin">Reuel. 3. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>As many

                        <hi>Whom the
Lord loueth he chasteneth, and he scourgeth
euery sonne whom he receiueth.</hi> Pleasant and
profitable is that proclamation, the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the children of God soundeth
in their eares, and conueyeth to their
hearts. Considerest thou euer, ô my soule,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21098:110"/>
that golden rich oracle brought to thy
eares by the seuenth and eight verses of
the 12. to the Hebrewes. <hi>If ye induce cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening,
God offereth himselfe vnto you, as
vnto sonnes, what sonne is it whom the father
chasteneth not? if therefore ye be without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
whereof all are partakers, then are ye
bastards and not sonnes.</hi> The sense hereof
moued <hi>Bernard</hi> to say: <hi>Si Deus tecum non
adest per gratiam, adest per vindictam, sed
vae tibi si ita tecum est, imò vae tibi si ita tecum
non adest; illi namque irascitur Deus, quem
peccantem non flagellat: nam quem flagellando
non emendat in futura damnat. If God be
not with thee by his grace, he is with thee by
reuenge, but woe to thee if he be that way with
thee, yea woe to thee if he be not that way
with thee; for God is highly offended with
that man whom he scourgeth not when he
sinnes against him: for whom God amends not
here by correcting of him, that man he damnes
hereafter.</hi> While I am lying then vnder
any crosse, were it neuer so sharpe, were it
neuer so tedious, what would my God
sound by it in thy eares, ô my soule, Surely
this would he sound by it, and nothing
but this: Thou art no bastard, (who hath
no title to his fathers inheritance, and who
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21098:110"/>
it at length to be thrust out of his fathers
doores, albeit he be furnished for some
dayes with meate, drinke, and clothed
within it) but thou art my owne well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and well beloued sonne, through
my onely naturall Sonne Iesus, in whom I
am well pleased, whom I am to keepe
with my selfe for euer: yea, whom I am to
make heire of all that I haue. But, ô my
soule, what fruite at length doth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of Gods Saints bring forth? lift
vp thy eyes, and behold I pray thee that
pleasant, plentious, and most profitable
haruest, produced by them, and offered to
thy view by the 11. verse of the 12. Chap.
to the Hebrewes. No chastening for the
present seemeth to be ioyous, but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,
but afterward it bringeth the quiet
fruite of righteousnesse to those who be
therby exercised. Shall the sicke or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
patient, not onely be readie by words
to thanke, but according to his abilitie, by
deeds to reward that Physitian who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to his mouth potions which be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to his taste, and repugnant to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
appetite, prouiding that they do
cure him. And that Chirurgion who doth
launce him to the effusion of his bloud;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21098:111"/>
yea, who doth cut his flesh in peeces, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
in the meane time he be either
kept from that disease he feared, or freed
of that greater or longer paine he could
but haue layen vnder? and should not the
child of God, knowing his afflictions to
be speciall tokens of Gods loue towards
him; yea, to be those forcible meanes;
whereby he is diuourced from that stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
whoore of sin, by the which he was
snared; yea, to be very medicines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his soule is preserued, and deliuered
from the deadly sicknesse of sinne, and be
brought home to his blessed Father, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling
afterwards to haue himselfe made
holy as God his Father is holy. The sense
hereof moued <hi>Dauid</hi> to make that nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
confession:<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> 
                        <hi>It is good for me that I haue
bene afflicted, that I may learne thy statutes.</hi>
This moued the Apostle thus to informe
vs: <hi>We haue had the fathers of our bodie
which corrected vs and we gaue them reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
should we not much more be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
to the Father of spirits that we

chastened vs after their owne pleasures,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>but
he chasteneth vs for our profit, that we may
be partakers of his holinesse.</hi> Finally the sense
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21098:111"/>
hereof breeds and conserues in the heart
of Gods child Confidence; neither suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him with the Israelites to murmure
against his God, as if there were some
wrong done to him; neither with <hi>Saul</hi> to
despaire as one altogether cast off from
God: but making him leasurely awaiting
vpon his God, to possesse his soule in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
being assured that his God will find
out a time, in the which, and meanes, by
the which, he shall be deliuered. And
therefore as God his afflicted child, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
himselfe willingly vnder the hand
of God his Father correcting him, can cry
with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 11. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold my sonne which came
out of my owne bellie seeketh my life, then how
much more may this sonne of Iemini, suffer
him to curse, for the Lord hath bidden him.</hi>
So not despairing, but putting his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his God, when his hand is lying
heauie vpon him, and striking him sore, he
can crie with this same <hi>Dauid, It may be
the Lord will looke vpon my affliction, and do
me good for his cursing this day.</hi> I am afflicted
then, ô my soule, let me beware of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
impatience, of cruell raging, and
furious reuenge, and of destroying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortlesse
despaire. Yea, let me bring forth
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21098:112"/>
humilitie, patience, repentance, thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and confidence; seeing not onely
prosperitie commeth from my God, but
aduersitie also: yea, seeing my God is not
onely my friend and Father, when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
and crowneth, but also when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
and crosseth. The sense hereof moued
<hi>Augustine</hi> to crie out with ioy:<note place="margin">August.</note> 
                        <hi>Quid non

Attempt not to challenge that Almighty,

and weaknesse, or of vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and rigour, but see that thou accuse
thy selfe, conuict thy selfe for sinne and

And so I must haue thee, ô my soule, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thy selfe to be resolued, that that long
and strong hand of God is neither put vp
in his bosome, and so stayed from helping
of thee in the day of thy need, nor put

murther, before either Gods mouth was

these of the first world, who perished by

confesse this to be true. If these inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Ierusalem who fel vnder the king

they could not denie this. Alwayes here,
ô my soule, I will pray thee grauely to
consider one point; wouldst thou haue thy
God comming to thee, or darest thou
thinke that he will come vnto thee when
thou thinkest that he should come to
thee, and as thou dreamest that he may
come to thee? No, no, thou must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,

mayest thinke, ô my soule, that God will
come vnto thee when any thing troubles
thee, to pitie, to comfort, yea, to deliuer
thee; albeit thou in the meane time stay
from him, going on in thy former and
present sinnes, yea adding new sinnes to
old sinnes, and grosse sinnes to lesse sins.
Alwayes thou must know, ô my soule,
that it cannot be so, that it ought not be
so. Hearest thou not thy God speaking
thus to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

wherfore out of this sense of sinne lament
I, that euer man was infected with it, and

taken by our God concerning Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
Exodus 3. 8. and that he takes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

and the other, then there is betwixt that
noyse our God hearkening vnto Israel

heard. In the 3. of Exodus our God
looking vpon Israel, sees their oppression
and trouble. In the 32. of Exodus our God
looking on him sees a molten calfe made
by them, worshipped by them, sacrificed
vnto, by them. In the third of Exodus our
God hearkning to Israel, heares the tune
and sound of their bitter cries and
groanes, because of their fierce task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
but in the 32. of Exodus he heares
his Israel blasphemously crying touching
the calfe. <hi>These be the Gods ô Israel that
brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Yea,
he heares the noise of the Israelites licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
and wantonly pyping and dancing
before their calfe. In the 3. of Exodus it is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21098:119"/>
no wonder that the God of pitie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and power, seeing the trouble, and
hearing the groanes of his distressed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

cannot be thought a wonder that our
God who is truth, iustice, and strength it
selfe, in the 32. of Exodus seeing the calfe
set vp by them, and hearing the pyping
about it, resolued to come downe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
these he concluded before to saue.
Would to God herefore, ô my soule, that
all these who dwell beneath here vnder
the peofession of the Gospell, could in
time learne to make conscience of that
which they make their great God from
the heauens to see, from the heauens to
heare: for as they make his Maiestie to
heare and to see; so shall his Maiestie
make them to heare, to see, and to find
afterwards. Againe, when I reade the 28.
verse of the 1. of Genesis, I see and heare
our God reioycing in man, and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him aboue all the workes of his
hands saying: <hi>Bring forth fruite and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie
and fill the earth and subdue it, and
rule ouer the fish of the sea, and ouer the foules
of the heauen, and ouer euerie beast that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:21098:119"/>
6. verse of the 6. of Genesis, I heare <hi>Moses</hi>
warranted by God, speaking thus touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man: <hi>It repented the Lord that he had
made man vpon the earth, and he was sorie
in his heart.</hi> But wherof came this so great
an alteration? When our God looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
man in the 1. of Genesis he was
cloathed with his image, and therefore
with him all the workes of his hands are
verie good in his eyes, when he saw him
and them. But when he looked on him as
<hi>Moses</hi> speakes of man in the 6. of Exodus,
he was depriued of Gods image within,
all the imaginations of the thoughts of
his heart were onely euill continually; and
without he was fearefully and foully co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with that red coate of crueltie, and
blacke coate of lecherie; and therefore no
wonder that the God of pietie, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
repented that he had made him.

                     <head>10. There be foure sorts of loue, two
most corrupt, and too common, alas, too
many: two most pure and heauenly, few,
alas, be inriched with it.</head>
                     <p>VVHen shalt thou beginne, ô my
soule, to loue thy God truly, who
hath loued thee dearely, with that sincere
loue his Maiestie will accept of, as of that
loue which commeth from him, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thee backe to him againe? Beleeue
me, ô my soule, albeit there be some, yet
there are not many, who be beautified and
gifted with this sort of loue, for thou must
know, ô my soule, that the heart of man
hath bene, and is clogged and clothed
with a fourefold loue, which would be
considered by our Gospellers, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that they know, and loue that Christ
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21098:128"/>
who hath dearely loued them, if they had
hearts to perceiue his loue toward them.
The first sort of loue is most corrupt in
the corrupt heart of corrupt man: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
man loueth himselfe, and beside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
nothing, hunting after nothing while
he liueth, but that which may pleasure
and profit himselfe; yea, not regarding,
suppose the whole world were destroyed
with Sodome, after that his eyes were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by death. The second sort of loue, is
corrupt also, in the corrupt heart of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
man, whereby man seeing and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that he is not of himselfe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
able, either to procure vnto himselfe
such things as he accounteth to be good,
or ro defend or deliuer himselfe from such
things he holdeth to be euill, he is moued
not onely to loue himselfe, but to loue his
God also; and yet while he loueth God
thus, he loueth not God for Gods cause,
but God for his owne cause: and so as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
loued <hi>Diana,</hi> who liued by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

<hi>Augustine</hi> to say: <hi>Quod non propter se

for the selfe, without any by-respect, is not said
to be loued.</hi> The third sort of loue, is holy
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21098:128"/>
and renewed in the sanctified, softened
heart of the regenerate child of God,
whereby he hauing happily (through the

to loue God, euen for Gods cause,
and that with a more reuerent loue then
he loueth father, mother, wife, or child, or
any other whatsoeuer. The fourth sort of
loue is altogether spirituall and heauenly,
transporting (euen with exceeding ioy
and alacritie) the soule of man from all
things here beneath, towards the third
heauens, whereby the child of God is not

O distressed Israel, hearest thou not <hi>Moses</hi>

For 1. knowest thou what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

liue they who be the children of God

                        <hi>What man is he amongst you, who if

I esteeme it to be fish; which he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to be a scorpion, albeit I thinke it to
be an egge? Hearken, hearken vnto me
and grant me that. Thou seekest the
bread of honour from God, and he
knoweth that if thou haddest honour,
that thy honour would proue a stone to
make thee dishonour him first; and in the
end to slay thy selfe. And therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
to giue it vnto thee. Thou crauest
the fish of health, and wealth from God,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21098:155"/>
but he knoweth that health, and wealth
would proue a serpent to bite thy soule to
death. Thou wouldest be at the white
egges of sweet pleasures, but he knoweth
that they will proue a byting scorpion to
hurt thee: therefore he denieth health,
wealth, and pleasures to thee. Againe,
thou abhorrest ignominie and shame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

knoweth that it will be food, and bread

imprisonment, banishment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
tentations, and outward crosses,
yea, cruell death it selfe: as biting serpents
and deuouring scorpions able to slay

thee, and therefore he propines thee with

right to the hearing eare, to the pitifull

that thou art euen then heard of him, piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

must thinke that he heareth thee not at

thou the smallest measure of griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou canst not desire to continue in

thou canst not pray vnto him as thou

thee, is with thee, yea he is within thee by

me, ô my soule, if thou canst. If thy
God heard thee no way, pittied thee
no way, and were neuer to helpe thee,
couldst thou desire to be heard of him, to
be pitied by him, to be helped by him?
yea, if thy God longed not as it were to
do thee good, couldst thou either long or
lament that thou longest not for good at
his hands. For as he who neuer saw the
Sunne cannot misse the sight of the Sun,
so he who neuer saw God cannot misse
God. Thus it is not nature which misseth

from my heart that man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Christian,<note place="margin">Act. 26. 29.</note> and with <hi>Paul</hi> earnestly
wishing, that all men were Christians.
Hearken, hearken, ô my soule, to the most
comfortable words of thy loue Iesus, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto thee by the pen of <hi>Matthew:
Whersoeuer a dead carkasse is,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>thither will the
eagles resort.</hi> Here compareth he himselfe
to a dead carkasse, and a true Christian to
an eagle resorting to this carkasse to feed
vpon it. But what moueth thy Sauiour, ô
my soule, to compare the true Christian to
an eagle, because there is not a naturall
propertie assigned by the naturalists, to
the naturall eagle, wherewith God thy
louing Father in his dearest Sonne Iesus
Christ, by his holy Spirit hath not most
ioyfully, most richly endued, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
adorned the true Christian soule,
that onely spirituall eagle, which is to be
found in this world. And so the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is happily for his information, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
consolation, and confirmation,
compared by his wise Lord and Maister
(who onely makes him and knowes him)
vnto an eagle, because of his estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:21098:158"/>
of his sight, because of his smell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his flight, because of his resting
place, where he can onely stay, and staying
refresh and feed himselfe. As for the estate
and condition of a true Christian, I must
tell thee, ô my soule, that the Christian is
not a slaue, is no base bodie, is no vassall,
but euen a most honourable one, a most
mightie one, yea, the onely king amongst
men, and aboue all men dwelling on earth
here as the eagle is the king ouer these
foules which do flie in the aire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stiled by the Ethnikes, <hi>Iouis ales,</hi> as
we who be Christians may be called Iesus
foules. Alwayes thou must know, ô my
soule, that a Christian is not a king by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but by grace; by generation, but by
regeneration: and so not as he is from that
first sinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> but as he is in that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
righteous <hi>Adam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> who was made
sinne for him, to make him righteous. But
here, ô my soule, I must pray thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what sort of king is this kingly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
set aboue all men by that King of
kings, and Lord of Lords Iesus, euen this
Christian. A Christian, I must tell thee, ô
my soule, is a king commanded, is a king
commanding, is a king ruled, is a king ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21098:159"/>
commanded onely by his Father, his
Sauiour, his sanctifier, and ruled onely by
that straight and shining line of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
word of God, contained in holy
Scripture; his mind, his heart, his will, his
affections, and euery member of his body
being so gouerned by that line, and led by
that Spirit whose word it is, that he can
out of knowledge and with ioy approue
that which is agreeable to it, condemne
that which is repugnant to it, eschew that
it forbids and condemnes, embrace that it
commands and commends. Yea, the true
Christian is so farre commanded by that
King who made him a king, and by that
his word acquainting him with the nature
of that kingdome prepared for him, that
if any king or subiect liuing attempt with
the counsell of Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 19.</note> command him
either to do that his great king hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
him to do, or ceasse from doing of
that his Maiestie hath appointed to be
done by him, he can answer with courage
whether it be righter in the sight of God
to obey you rather then God, iudge ye:
yea, he is so farre addicted vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of this his great King, that
before he disobey it he will heartily with

A Christian is a king of quicke sight who
can see clearly with the owle in the darke
night, and so in the day of tentation and
tribulation, making him to say with <hi>Iob:
The Lord hath giuen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord hath taken,
blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Who can
see with the eagle vpon the bright shining
day, able to cast his eyes directly towards
the strongest, cleare, piercing beames of
that hote shining sun of blooming pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie,
no wayes turning away either his
heart or his eyes from his great King and
blessed Maister, for all the honour, all the
wealth, all the pleasures, can be offered to
him, can be taken from him, for all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
can be deuised, can be executed
against him, in this (triumphantly like a

him beside God) trading the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sauing pathes of <hi>Ioseph, Moses, Dauid,
Ezrah, Nehemiah, Daniel,</hi> and a verie
world of heauenly Kings, by that Christ
of God made Christs to God. As a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is a king of quicke sight, so is he a
king of most sharpe smelling, with the
eagle, not smelling things neare hand, but

things afarre off, in such sort, that he can
finde nothing to be sauorie to him, beside
that blessed glorious King, who made him
a king, and blessed him with this spirituall
sharpe smelling. Yea, I must tell thee, ô
my soule, that the smelling of a Christian
is so spiritually delicate, that he can rest
vpon the sauour of no Angell, of no man,
of no woman, either soiourning here, or
glorified in heauen, much lesse the sauour
of honour, wealth, or pleasure, or whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this earth can possesse. Shall old <hi>Isaac</hi>
smelling the garment of his blessed sonne
<hi>Iacob</hi> crie out, not without a speciall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
ioy: <hi>Behold the smell of my sonne,
is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath
blessed.</hi> And shalt not thou, ô my soule,
made a sharpe smelling eagle by thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Iesus, easily to smell euen things far
remoued from thee, smell this, thy Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
as onely profitably, honorably, and
pleasantly sauorie to thee, and for thee.
The sense hereof moued the Church
Christs spouse, directing her language to
Christ, her onely loue and husband, to
crie out:<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>All thy garments smell of myrrhe,

                        <pb n="303" facs="tcp:21098:161"/>

speake to her husband thus: <hi>The mandra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

kingly eagle seeing quickly, and smelling
sharply, so he is a kingly eagle of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
flight: for the Christian mans
soule flies not onely swiftly, but also sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limely,
and so both farre and high, and
that in one instant. Can the Christian be
content with the crow, or with the rauen,
to dwell here beneath with men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, flying and building their
nests only a little aboue the heads of men?
No, no, he must necessarily flie farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the clouds and firmament. But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

her home is not beneath here, but is

soule knoweth that her husband will
come againe, albeit she know not when
he will come, and therefore the Christian
dare not suffer idolatrie, incest, murther,
adulterie,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 13.</note> fornication, oppression, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
couetousnesse, falshood, deceit,
and such abhominations, as also many
long and heauie deluges to hang after
him, lest first they hinder him to take him
to his wings, and then hinder him in his
flight after that he hath taken himselfe to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21098:162"/>
them. As the true Christian is that kingly
eagle which seeth quickly, smelleth
sharpely, flieth swiftly, and on high, so
he is that kingly eagle, which cannot stay
his flight, till he come where that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
dead, blessed, and sweet smelling car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,
but now gloriously liuing Lord of
life and light, Iesus is. Let a Christian man
meete with a thousand Angels, he will
behaue himselfe as <hi>Gehazi</hi> the seruant of
<hi>Elizaeus</hi> did,<note place="margin">2. King. 4. 29.</note> being sent by his maister with
his staffe towards the dead sonne of the
Shunamitish Ladie, not daring so much
as to salute one of them by the way, till he
come where Iesus is. And in this the wise
Christian resembleth that diseased wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who thronging through the whole
preasse, could not be stayed till she tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
his garment with her finger, who had
touched her heart before with his Spirit,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 20. 21.</note>
and made her by faith to touch him spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
before by her hand she touched
him bodily.</p>

glorie: secondly, what is that I
should endeuour my selfe to resemble, in
respect of this more then high dignitie
whereunto I am hereby aduanced. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
ô my soule, to the Spirit, so shalt thou
meet with that condition, whereupon my
God will be content that I be an house to
him, for be not these the Apostles words.
<hi>For Christ is as the Sunne ouer his owne

                        <hi>whose house we are if we hold fast the
confidence and the reioycing of the hope vnto
the end.</hi> And so I must tell thee, ô my soule,
if thou wouldst be an house to that onely
glorious King of kings Iesus; thou must
alwayes be decked &amp; trimmed with such
tapistrie and furniture, as onely is able to
make such a Maiestie desire, yea, delight
to come to thee, yea to dwell with thee,
and in thee, that is with effectuall faith,
patient hope, laborious loue, and neuer
wearying perseuerance and constancie.
But how mayest thou know, ô my soule,
that thou art thus deckt in any kinde of

this, if I would haue my selfe to be an

Now what is the nature of that holy house
of thy God, ô my soule, the Spirit clearing

of Gods children as of monsters, when

for as these men know not the child of

know not by what gate his children enter
into his house, much lesse haue they anie
kind of knowledge or sense, of these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,

to wonder (vnlesse it be to thy consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:21098:167"/>
and giuen himselfe for him, who hath no
home beside the home of heauen, where
this his loue is sitting in his owne nature
preparing a place for him) filled on his
death-bed with a greater sea of ioy, then
euer it was before, euen there while death
is drawing neare vnto his bodie, and his
bodie is drawing neare vnto the graue,
aduancing more holy the excellencie of
that loue wherewith the Father, Sonne,
and holy Ghost do loue him, proclayming
more largely, the vanitie, of all things
earthly, euer hard, seene, smelled, tasted,
touched, possessed by him, or any other
to his seeing, or hearing; praising more
aboundantly the incomparible value of
these vnspeakeable good things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vnto him by his father, purchased vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by his Sauiour, whereof he hath
alreadie receiued the earnest, looking as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
after death, for the full payment.
Shall the child of God, ô my soule, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
heare with pricking thornes, reioyce
in tribulation, and shall he be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
when he drawes neare vnto death,
whereby all these things which possibly
can trouble him are finished, and by the
which he is sent vnto heauen, there to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:21098:167"/>
triumph for euer. Shall <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> cast
in the inner prison at Philippi, and hauing
their feete fastened in the stockes, sing a
Psalme at mid-night? And shall I not sing
much more continually, when that death
shall draw neare me, which shall not open
a doore to set me free from any outward
prison, to the end I may enter the gates
of any worldly Citie, to liue among and
reioyce with men for a while: but which
shall open that doore to me (by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his death, who by dying ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
death) whereby I may enter
within the gates of that high and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

the owner, and leader, director,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr God hauing brought
the Israelites (after manie
wonders wrought by him,
in the land of Egypt, vpon
<hi>Pharoah,</hi> vpon his people

and set them in their iourney through the

And will his Maiestie, alwayes mindfull

without a light to guide our pathes
through this darke wildernesse of this

not so, not so, ô my soule. But
what is that light by the which he will
haue our pathes thus directed, not anie
light deuised beneath here, kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
here by the darke braine of liuing,
deceiuing, and deceiued man? but that
light, which hath that blessed Father of

Now this light is that written word of
God contained in holy Scripture:<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 19.</note> which
is seene,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13.</note> not mortall, but immortall seed,

children fainting and falling in a swound
as it were, and dying within them because
of their furious persecutors, and manie

                     <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 92.</note> This

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:21098:181"/>

all the sicknesse, and sores of Gods

which is that onely lanterne, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectes
the steps of Gods child, yea that

The onely Way of God,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> wherein he will
haue vs to walke, if we would walke

The onely Precept of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he informeth vs concerning these
things he would haue vs his children to
do.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Yea, this lanterne, is the Statures of
God, whereby our God prescribeth vnto
his people the Iewes, vnder the pedigree
of the Law, these outward Ceremonies
which they behoued to obserue in the
worshipping of him, not onely to the end
that by them they might be furthered in
the inward and onely true worship of his
name, but discerned from the rest of the
world aud knowne for his people.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> It is the
Commandement of God, whereby his
Maiestie commands these things his
children should embrace, and forbiddes
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:21098:182"/>
these things they should eschew. It is the
Iudgement of God,<note place="margin">Ibib.</note> acquainting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with these punishments, God their
Father hath appointed for such, who dare
(abusing this lanterne of his word, and
refusing to be led by it) attempt to walke
in the broad way of wickednesse. Yea,
this lanterne is stiled by the verie stile of
the feare of the Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 9.</note> because it is out of
this booke alone, and by this booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
of the written word of God; God
the maister, and teacher of his owne,
teacheth them the same lesson of his
sauing feare, whereby they are made
to eschew euill, and to do good. Yea this
lanterne,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> which is also. <hi>The Law, the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
the Way, the Precept, the Statute,
the Commandement, and the feare of the
Lord: is so excellently excellent, that it is
Perfect, conuerting the soule; that it is pure,
giuing wisedome vnto the simple; that it is
right, reioycing the heart, that it is pure, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
light to the eyes; that it is cleane, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for euer; that it is true and righteous
altogether: and therefore more to be desired
then gold, yea, then most fine gold; sweeter
also then the honie, and the honie combe; by
the which the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God is made circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:21098:182"/>
and in keeping whereof there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
Further I must tell thee, ô my soule,
that this lanterne of the written word, set
by God before his babes, for leading of
them towards him; is so profitable for
them, that it is able to redresse, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the way of a very yong man,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 9.</note> raging
in the feauer of his furious lusts: if he can
be content to take heede to it, and to be
led by it. That it is able so to strengthen
the babe of God, that he cannot sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his God, prouiding he keepe this
lanterne in the estate of his heart.<note place="margin">Ibid. 10. 11.</note> And no
wonder, for where this Lanterne is loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vnto, and followed; it proues a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
to all such as followes it, making
them wise to eschew euill and to do good.
And in a word,<note place="margin">Ibid. 24.</note> this Lanterne is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comfort, delight, and meditation, yea,
the verie ioy of the hearts,<note place="margin">Ibid. 50. 92</note> and heritage
of the children of God; making them
stand vnder,<note place="margin">97. 111. 148. 162.</note> and against all troubles; and
therfore they shaking off all drowsinesse,
securitie can preuent the night wiches to
meditate therein, reioycing more in it
then that man doth who hath found a
spoile. From my heart I wish, that the
Preachers, and professors of this time
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21098:183"/>
could beginne to thinke of this lanterne
of the word, directing Gods babes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heauen,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> as <hi>Augustine</hi> thought, and
write of it long ago: <hi>Doctrina Apostolica
tamsalubris est, atque vtilis; vt pro capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
vtentium neminem sui exhortem relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quat
quia siue paruuli siue magni, siue infirmi
siue fortes, habent in ea vnde alantur, vnde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientur.
The doctrine of the Apostles, is so
wholesome and profitable, that according to
the capacitie of these who vse it, it leaues no
man without profiting by it; because in it, be
men yong, be they old, be they weake, be they
strong, they haue whereupon they may feede,
and with the which they may be filled.</hi> Oh,
Lord God, when shall the loose Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of this last age be enlightened, and
quickened in soule by thy Maiestie, in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
looking on their dead soules, in the
face of thy well beloued Sonne, begin to
account of that heauenly, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
poole of thy sacred, and sauing
word (now through the force of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
mercies towards vs) running plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
through euerie Citie, euerie vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
euerie cottage? so that all persons
of all rankes (blessed be thy Maiestie for
thy kindnesse) may fully without feare
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21098:183"/>
(in season, and out of season) resort hnto it
as these old Iewes accountd of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
poole of Bethsesda? which was
not to be found but in the holy land, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in it euerie where but in the tribe of
Iudah; and that at Ieausalem onely. I must
confesse, ô my soule, that that Iewish
dead poole of Bethsesda, in foure things
resembled our Christian liuely poole of
the blessed word of God, and yet, I dare
affirme before God, Angels, and men,
that our blessed poole of the word sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
that of Bethsesda, so farre in one
thing, that if men could take it to heart;
where one Iew esteemed of this poole,
and resorted vnto it, hundreth thousands
should esteeme of this poole of Gods
word; not onely carefully resorting
vnto it, but induring all their life
here, ioyfully delighting to dwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
it. First, whatsoeuer disease bodily a
man was subiect vnto, that Iewish poole
was able to cure: euen so, this our poole
of the word of God is able to cure the
sinner, of whatsoeuer spirituall sicknesse
can ouertake his soule, by reason of anie
sinne he can fall into. Secondly, as none
could be cured in bodie by that Iewish
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:21098:184"/>
poole, but such as stepped into it, and were
wet there with; so impossible is it that any
sinner can be freed from his sinnes by the
meane of Gods word, till his soule be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
with it, and so till he be moued
and perswaded to heare, beleeue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
it. Thirdly as that Iewish poole could
not possibly cure so much as one mans
bodie, till the Angell came downe and
troubled the water of it; so this poole of
the word cannot cure the soule of any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 6. 7.</note>
till that blessed vncreated Angell,
euen the Spirit of the Father, and of his
dearest Son come downe as it were to his
soule, ioyning his inward vertue with his
outward word, and that way striking the
heart by his owne finger, as he striketh
the eare by his truth. Fourthly, as among
the Iewes no man knew when the Angell
would come downe &amp; trouble the water
for curing of their diseased bodies,
which moued the sicke persons, looking
and longing for health, resorting to that
poole, constantly to lye still at it, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
for many dayes, weekes, moneths,
yea yeares, as is manifest by the practise
of that man who lay there 38. yeares. So
amongst vs Christians, there is neither
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21098:184"/>
Preacher nor hearer, king nor subiect, man
nor woman, old nor yong, can possibly
know what day, what houre, what minute
that blessed Spirit of God will ioyne his
force &amp; vertue with that his word which
is heard, making it effectuall to quicken
the dead, to enlighten the blind, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
such as haue gone astray, to comfort
the broken hearted, and to confirme those
who stand. I would therefore aduise thee,
ô my soule, if thou be sensible of thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
wants, and if thou long to haue
them supplied, to resort thither where
thou mayest heare his word, crying to thy
God with <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>One thing haue I desired
of the Lord, that I will require, euen that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the
dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the
Lord, and to visit his temple.</hi> Yea, it were
good, ô my soule, in this respect that thou
resolued with <hi>Anna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 36. 37.</note> that religious old
widow neuer to go out of his Temple, but
to serue him there with fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
night and day. But, ô my soule, lift vp
thy selfe on high, and hearken euen with
greedinesse, I pray thee, to the end thou
mayest heare, and consider that one thing,
yea, that incomparable, profitable one
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:21098:185"/>
thing, wherein this heauenly poole of
Gods word, accompanied by his Spirit,
excelleth, yea, surmounteth that visible
Iewish poole of Bethesda. Could that
Iewish poole, ô my soule, euen being
troubled by the Angell, possibly cure moe
at once, or one onely? one onely, for no
moe at one time were cured by it, beside
that person who first stepped in after the
troubling of it, as the Scripture testifieth.
But as for our poole of the Word (blessed
be that God who hath inriched and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
thee, ô my soule, with it) it can
cure and make whole at one time scores,
hundreths, thousands, diseased in soule,
what euer sinnes they haue committed. O
<hi>Peter,</hi> the healing streames of this curing
poole did flow so abundantly out of thy
mouth, that Spirit of Iesus thy Maister
(who came downe vpon thee in the day of
Pentecost) ioyning his vertue with them,
that not one soule onely, nor ten, nor
twentie, nor an hundreth, nor a thousand,
but euen three thousand diseased, yea,
dead soules were that day added vnto the
Church.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 41.</note> Could this be considered, ô my
soule, ô how frequently, ô how busily, ô
how ioyfully would men of all rankes and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21098:185"/>
conditions resort to this blessed poole of
the word of God! O how carefully and
attentiuely would men, resorting to it
with <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10. 33.</note> hearken to it! yea, ô how
earnestly would they in their chambers
(awayting for the Spirit of God with the
Apostles) pray for the spirit, to the end
that his vertues being ioyned with that
word, they resolue to heare in the publike
congregation, they might haue their dead
diseased soules cured and quickned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by!
Woe is me, woe is me, ô my soule, that
so many enioying great peace, hauing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forraine nor intestine enemies inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them, should so grosly neglect this
Lanterne of the good word of God set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
among them, and shining so clearely
before them, should refuse to eate with
pleasure that nourishing quickening
bread, and to drinke with delight in this
their great peace, that refreshing streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
wine offered to them by this
Lanterne; wherewith besides this their
peace, they are inriched and blessed by
that great God, who is the sole giuer and
continuer of spirituall and temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings?
When I begin to compare the 3.
verse of the 8. of Deuteronomie with the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21098:186"/>
54. 55. 56. &amp; 57. verses of the 28. of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie,

the 6. of the 2. of the Kings; with the 10.
verse of the 4. of the Lamentations of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi>
and with the 11. and 12. verses of
the 8. of <hi>Amos;</hi> I must deplore the deafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the eares of men, refusing to
heare, and the hardnesse of the hearts of
men refusing to beleeue; and the leudnesse
of the liues of men refusing to obey, that
onely louing true God, trauelling by the
lanterne of his word to winne them from
sinne to himselfe. <hi>Man liueth not by bread
onely,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>but by euerie word which proceedeth
out of the mouth of the Lord.</hi> Alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
man cannot be content willingly
to embrace this bread of the word, to eate
this bread of the word, and by faith ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
not without a speciall sense and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
to digest it. Alas, alas, that sweetest
God of rarest mercies who delightes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to benefit his owne, and cannot
from his heart punish them, is compelled
at length to make the tender and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
daintie husband,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 33.</note> brother, father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
content when peace shall be farre
from them, yea, when they shall be vnder
bloudie warres, to eate euen with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:21098:186"/>
the very flesh of their wiues, their
brethren, and their children. Oh, ô my
soule, when shall the eares of those who
in this our great peace neglects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes,
and in a vowed manner mockes,
that wholsome and healing bread, that
comforting wine of the good word of
God; lend with a hearing eare, an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
heart, to perceiue that which I
finde written beside <hi>Ieremiah?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 4. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>The hands

when shall that complaint made by that
woman vnto the king of Israel vpon her
sister, while Samaria was besiedged hardly
by the king of Aram, be hearkened vnto,
be regarded by our contemners and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of that word of God? <hi>This woman

so we sod my sonne, and did eate him: and

thee, for he whom thy God hath once, out
of vndeserued loue and mercie, possessed
with that bread and wine of his blessed
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:21098:187"/>

of it, shall with griefe of heart, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
teares, and laborious paines, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

ô my soule, against the abuses of
that food of the word by thy God: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

                     <hi>saith the Lord, that
I will send a famine in the land, not a famine
for bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing
the word of the Lord, and they shall wander
from sea to sea, and from the North euen to

the word of the Lord, and shall not finde it.</hi>
These of the first world refuse in most
stubborne manner, in the day of their
peace, to drink in these sweetest waters of
the cleansing and cooling word of God,
distilling from the soft lippes of faithfull
<hi>Noah,</hi> that painfull Preacher of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But alas, are they not compelled
when their long abused peace is ended,
and iustly turned in fearefull warre, not
onely to swallow in, but to be drowned in
these deuouring waters of that fearefull
deludge,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 7. 8.</note> which they by their contempt of
that sweetest Lanterne &amp; bread of Gods
word (louingly for the space of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
and twentie yeares with manie
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:21098:187"/>
grones and teares offered vnto them)
from the heauens brought vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues?
Those yong men who should haue
married <hi>Lots</hi> daughter, refuse tauntingly
to admit that purging fire of Gods word,
brought to their eares from God by the
mouth of <hi>Lot,</hi> which had proued suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
able to haue saued them, if they had
hearkened to him: and therefore consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
fire must come from the Lord (who
cannot suffer his word and seruants to be
mocked) to destroy them. Ierusalem hath
that two edged sword drawne vnto her
by our sweetest Maister, and his painfull
Apostles; first, to wound and lance her for
her many grosse sinnes, and thereafter to
cure her if she could haue beleeued and
repented. But, alas, is not Ierusalem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
within a few yeares afterward to
see that strange sharpest bloudie sword of
the Romane Emperour drawne against
her ancients, her counsellers, her priests,
her people, her infants, to her finall and
most fearefull destruction, as by-gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
these sixteene hundred yeares hath
seene, and as we presently may heare? I
tremble, I tremble, when I thinke vpon
this, ô my soule, and shake when looking
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21098:188"/>
vnto God, I remember how gratiously,
how mercifully, and how miraculously
our God hath inriched this kingdome
with that shining lanterne, that wholsome
bread, and purest wine of his word, and
that in despight of the subtiltie of the
power, and of the diligence of hellish and
earthly powers; so that no kingdome, no
Prouince, nor Citie, in this earth had that
Lanterne of Gods word more clearely,
more purely shining among them, then
Scotland had; and yet how grosly, and in a
vowed vnnaturall maner, as if that Booke
of God had neuer bene seene, or hard by
vs, do men giue ouer themselues to the
committing of those sinnes which were
neuer committed by the very Gentiles,
who had no such Lanterne to direct them
but were left to the direction of blind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
altogether? And therefore I must
thinke, that not onely shall we be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of this Lanterne, but beside it, of that
peace we haue enioyed with it; hauing
our rulers, our people, men, women, old,
yong, cruelly cut in peeces with the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
sword of some mercilesse stranger
dwelling abroad, or of some cruell bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
lodging amongst our selues; because
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21098:188"/>
we will not suffer our sinnes to be slaine
by that sharpe shearing, and yet happily
sauing sword of that good word of God
our mercifull Father.</p>

is the Minister of God: vnder the

the Seer, the Watchman.</head>
                  <p>THat blessed Spirit of God, by whom
that Lanterne of the word is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for enioying the babes of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that Inne of heauen; knowing that
this Lanterne cannot possibly profit them
vnto saluation, vnlesse it be put in the
hands of some guide, by whom it may be
so holden forth vnto them, that they may
see the light of it, and by seeing the light
of it, may be moued to know that holy
one, to beleeue in that holy one, who gaue
himselfe for them, and by beleeuing in
him may be led to saluation: hath happily
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:21098:189"/>
and mercifully found out a bearer to carry
this Lanterne before them, &amp; to discouer
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that shining, sauing, light which
is offered by it. But hath this blessed wise
Spirit appointed this lanterne to be carried
before the babes of God, by any celestiall
spirit or Angell? not so, not so, ô my soule,
but by one who is like to those babes of
God (before whom this Lanterne is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried)
in all things. And here I must pray
thee, ô my soule, to stay a little, to the end
before I speake any more touching this
point, thou mayest be moued to aduance
the great wisedome of Gods vnspeakable
mercie and compassion towards misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man, whom he doth out of vndeserued
loue, transport from this sinfull earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his holy heauens. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
ô my soule, that these heauenly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
be ministring spirits,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> sent forth to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
for their sakes which shall be heires
of saluation, as thou shalt here; but with
this I know that no man liuing were able
to abide the presence of these spirits, if our
God should imploy them to be Carriers
of this Lanterne of his word, &amp; to instruct
vs in the knowledge of it. Did the face of
<hi>Moses</hi> shine so gloriously when he came
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:21098:189"/>
downe from the mount, where he was
with God but for the space of 40. dayes;
that the Israelites were afraid to come
neare him, till he put a vaile vpon his face?
and shall sinfull man be able to abide the
presence of these Angels, who alwayes
stand before God, and who be altogether
free of sinne? I know that an Angell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Manoah</hi> the father of <hi>Samson,</hi>
but with this I know, that <hi>Manoah</hi> was so
rauished with the glorie of this Angell,
that he was readie to haue offered a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
vnto him. I know that that sublime
booke of the Reuelation was put in the
hands of the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iud. 13.</note> by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of an Angell: but tels not Scripture
me, that euen this <hi>Iohn</hi> was moued so
with the presence and sight of the Angell,
that ouer and ouer againe he fell downe
at his feete to worship him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our blessed God (onely perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the weaknesse and vilenes
of man) pitying sinfull man, will haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a sinfull man like vnto man himselfe,
whose presence he may easily abide,
whose voice without any dashing feare,
or confounding astonishment he may
heare, to be the Carrier of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lanterne, by
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:21098:190"/>
the which his babes must be led from this
wildernesse to his Canaan. And so this
Coachman of this heauenly Chariot is a
poore Minister, separated by God from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, to carrie the Lanterne of the
word before his children, who so soone
as he is separate to this end, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
denie himselfe, his parents, his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and all belongeth vnto him, or can
alledge any kinde of interest with him;
hauing no father, mother, wife, brethren,
sisters, friend, or alliance, beside that God
who hath separate him from them for
himselfe:<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 8. 9.</note> readie with <hi>Leui</hi> to say to his
father and his mother,<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>I haue not seene him:</hi>
yea, not knowing his brethren, nor his
owne children, but with this same <hi>Leui</hi>
putting his sword by his side to slay his
brother, his companion, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
that so he may resemble that holy
one who hath separate him for himselfe:
who hearing this said to him: <hi>Behold thy
mother and thy brethren stand without,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 47. 48. 49. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to speake with thee:</hi> did answer him who
told him that, thus: <hi>Who is my mother, and
who are my brethren? And stretching forth
his hands towards his disciples, did say: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
my mother, and my brethren, for whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:21098:190"/>
shall do my Fathers will which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the same is my brother, my mother, and
my sister.</hi> This Minister and Coachman is
so strictly tyed by that spirit the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister,
who calles and imployes them,
vnto the Lanterne of the written word of
God, put in his hand for ordering the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God in their spirituall iourney,
that he doth see nothing to be good, and
embrace it, but that this Lanterne proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be good, and vnderstandeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be euill, and refuseth it, but that
this Lanterne proclaimeth to be euill; and
therefore he will not obey any, but these
the Spirit his Maister by this Lanterne put
in his hand, directs him to obey; and dare
disobey all, the spirit his maister by this
Lanterne directs him to disobey. And so,
when king or subiect of any estate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,<note place="margin">1. King. 22. 13. 14.</note>
doth say vnto him: <hi>Behold now the
words of the Prophets declare good vnto the
King with one accord, let thy word therefore
I pray thee be like the word of one of them,
and speake thou good:</hi> he answereth them
couragiously with <hi>Michaiah: As the
Lord liueth, whatsoeuer the Lord saith vnto
me, that I will speake.</hi> The consideration of
this point moued the Spirit speaking of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:21098:191"/>
those ministers, Carriers of this Lanterne
before the babes of God, for their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
benefit to stile them.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 15</note> These sundrie
fathers, who in Christ beget; sonnes and

forth, in some thirtie, in some sixtie,
in some a hundredth fold.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 39.</note> The spirituall

liuely stones, are layed vpon that true and

vp in a spirituall building to God. These
secundarie Sauiours,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> who faithfully and
painefully holding forth this Lanterne
before Gods babes, and taking heed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselues, do become Sauiours both
to saue themselues and them that heare
them: yea they be sundrie Mediators who
in the day of the Lords wrath,<note place="margin">Num. 6. 16. 47. 48.</note> be bound
with <hi>Aaron</hi> to offer vp their prayers to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:21098:191"/>
God leading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the mediation of that
great mediator Iesus, to the end that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
plagues may be auerted from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and these, which are alreadie,
stayed. But what is that, ô my soule,
vnto the which this Coachman, the
Carrier of this Lanterne of the word
must take heed vnto; to the end
he may proue indeed a father, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a steward, a gardiner, a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a mason, a Sauiour, a Mediator, for
the aduancement of the saluation of Gods
babes, and of his owne? Out of Scripture
I haue learned, that he must necessarily
obiect two points; fearing alwayes to
ouersee himselfe in either of them: to wit,
vnto his doctrine, marking narrowly
what, and how he teacheth; vnto his life,
watching carefully ouer his words, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and carriage. It were good that the
ministers of this our time, Carriers of the
Lanterne of Gods word, keepe a good
eye vpon that Lace, wherewith our wise
God would haue the skirts of <hi>Aarons</hi>
robe decked, to wit, with a Pomegranat
of blew silke, purple, and scarlot; and
with golden bells: so that round about
the skirts of his robes there was to be
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:21098:192"/>
seene, a golden bell, and pomgranate.
The bell making a sound when it was
heard, the pomgranate sauoring delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
when it was smelled. So that the
Carriers of the word must sound well
through that doctrine they teach, must
smell well through their holy life, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to this doctrine. Thou hearest thy
Sauiour, ô my soule, directing his Apostles
thus:<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Go therefore and teach all nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them in the name of the Father, the
Sonne, and the holy Ghost; teaching them to
obserue all things whatsoeuer I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you.</hi> But hearest thou him not also
thus informing them: <hi>yea are the salt of the
earth, but if the salt lose his sauour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
shall the earth be salted;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 13. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>it is then good
for nothing, but to be cast out &amp; to be trodden
vnder foote of men: yea are the light of the
world; a citie that is set on a hill cannot be hid?</hi>
Hearest thou not <hi>Paul</hi> thus directing <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 13.</note>
                     <hi>Till I come giue attendance to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
to exhortation, and to doctrine?</hi> But
hearest thou him not in that same place
charging him also:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Let no man despise thy
youth, but be vnto them that beleeue, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample,
in word, in conuersation, in loue, in
spirit, infaith, and in purenesse.</hi> Hearest thou
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21098:192"/>
not <hi>Paul</hi> againe thus directing his <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 15.</note>
                     <hi>Studie to shew thy selfe approued vnto

diuiding the word of God aright.</hi> But
with this hearest thou him not saying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him? <hi>Flee also from the lusts of youth, and
follow after righteousnesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">22.</note> 
                     <hi>faith, loue, and
peace; with them that call on the Lord with
pure hearts.</hi> As for that doctrine the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of this Lanterne must teach the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, it must no wayes be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him; albeit in season, and out of
season, it must be vented by him. Shall
<hi>Balaam</hi> answer King <hi>Balac</hi> thus: <hi>If Balac
would giue me his house full of siluer, and
gold,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 22. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord
my God to do lesse or more?</hi> And shall anie
who would proue faithfull to him, who
hath called him, speake that in Gods
name with his mouth, which God by his
spirit, and word, hath not put in his mouth?
That spoken by our God to <hi>Ezechiel</hi>
would be thought vpon.<note place="margin">Ezec. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Sonne of man I
haue made thee a watchman in the house of
Israel, therefore heare the word at my
mouth, and giue them warning from me.</hi>
This moued <hi>Peter</hi> thus to direct the
handlers of Gods word.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>If anie man speake,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:21098:193"/>
let him speake as the word of God.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the man of God taking heede to his
doctrine, must not attempt to bring any
thing to the eares of Gods people, his
hearers, but that which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from the mouth of God their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his maister, speaking vnto him
out of holy Scripture, for our God that
wise Father of his Church, will haue his
children to be fed vpon no meate besides
his owne. Herefore while <hi>Moses</hi> is raised
vp of God, to gouerne his people Israel,
he did receiue that law from God by, the
which he must gouerne them. Albeit the
Prophets were stirred vp of God to
speake to his people, yet did they begin
and end their Sermons thus.<note place="margin">Amos. 1. 13. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Thus saith the
Lord: For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esay 1. 20.</note> This moued the Apostle not onely to
say; <hi>Be ye followers of me euen as I am of
Christ, but also though we, or an Angel
from heauen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor 11. 1</note> 
                     <hi>preach vnto you otherwayes
then that which we haue preached vnto you
let him be accursed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> subscribing to

                     <hi>Tunc ea, quae dicimus, &amp; nobis, &amp;
vobis vtilia sunt sia Deo sunt; quae autem ab

things which we speake, be profitable vnto vs
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:21098:193"/>
and you when they are of God, but these
things which be of men be lies.</hi> The sense
hereof moued <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vincent.</note> thus
to direct the preachers of the Gospell:<note place="margin">Lirnien.</note>
                     <hi>Quod tibi ceditum, non quod a te inuentum;
non author esse debes sed custos; non institutor,
sed sectator; non ducens, sed sequens: vt cum
dixeris noue, non tamen noua. Preach that
which is committed to thee, not that which
is inuented by thee: thou should stnot be an
Author, but a keeper; not a beginner, but a
follower, not leading, but following; so that
while thou speakest after a new manner, thou
speake no new thing.</hi> O would to God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all
Carriers of this Lanterne could hearken
vnto that deliuered long ago, touching
the ministers of the Gospell, by that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Father <hi>Augustine:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. de postore cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Nos quos Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
in isto loco de quo periculosa ratio reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
secundum dignationem suam, non secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
meritum nostrum constituit, habemus,
duo quaedam: Vnum quod Christiani sumus,
propter nos est; quod autem praepo sti sumus,
propter vos est. In eo quod Christiani sumus,
attenditur vtilit as nostra: in eo quod praepositi
sumus, non nisi vestra. Sunt multi Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani,
&amp; non praepositi, qui perueniunt ad Deum
facileore fortasse itinere, &amp; tanto expeditius
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:21098:194"/>
ambulantes, quanto minorem sarcinam por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;
nos autem excepto quod christiani su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
vnde rationem reddemus deo de vita
nostra, sumus etiam praepositi vnde rationem
reddemus deo de dispensatione nostra. We
whom God hath set in this place (whereof
there is a dangerous account to be giuen) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his free loue, and not according to
our merit, haue some two things: one that we
are Christians, another that we are Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
That that we are Christians, is for
our selues; but that we are preachers, is for
you. In that we are Christians our profite is
respected; in that that we are Preachers
yours. There be manie Christians, and not
Preachers who perhaps come to God by a
easier iourney, walking so much the more
quickly in so farre as they carrie a lighter
burthen. But we besides this that we are
Christians, for the which we shall giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
vnto God of our life; we are also Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
for the which we shall giue an account
of our dispensation and stewardship.</hi> Now
while this Carrier of the Gospell, hath
with his doctrine his life to order and
dresse; he must know that it were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for him in a manner, first to take
heed to his life, and therefore to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:21098:194"/>
for he who is not a good Christian
liuing as becomes the child of God to
liue, shall neuer be a good Preacher,
handling the word of God as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
Gods steward to handle it. The
sense hereof moued <hi>Chysostome</hi> thus to
speake:<note place="margin">Chrysost. hom. 30. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Perquam facile est Philosophari

<hi>It is a verie easie thing to discourse in words;

hath thought good to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
both good and bad Ministers to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the Lanterne of his word; and seeing
it falleth oftentimes forth, that God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his word in the mouth of a faithfull
sanctified Minister, the sauour of death
vnto death, and that same word in the
mouth of a hyreling, void of grace and
holinesse, the sauour of life vnto life, to
the end, that Gods wise holy people
should learne not to depend vpon men,
but vpon God who employes them, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
vnto his Maiestie the whole praise
of their conuersation, and saluation, and
not to the instrument. Let no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
be perswaded by Satans subtiltie,
to thinke euill of the cleane and sauing
word of God, because of the corruption
and wickednesse of him that carrieth it;

                     <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees sit in

                     <hi>Chrysostome</hi> writing vpon these

eorum ipsorum est, ordinatio autem eorum
vestra; si bene vixerint eorum est lucrum, si
bene docuerint vestrum est. Accipite ergo
quod vestrum est, &amp; nolite discutere quod
alienum est: frequenter &amp; de homine malo
bona doctrina procedit. The nature of the
Preachers is their owne, their ordination is
yours: if they liue well that is their profite; if
they teach well that is your profite: take that
which is yours, and meddle not with that
which is anothers: yea, oftentimes good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
comes from an euill man.</hi> And againe,
<hi>Ecce vilis terra pretiosum aurum producit,
numquid propter terram vilem pretiosum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
contemnitur? Non, sed sicut aurum eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur
&amp; terra relinquitur, sic &amp; vos doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam

apibus herbae necessariae non sunt, sed flores
herbarum; flores enim illae colligunt, herbas
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:21098:196"/>
vero relinquunt; sic vos flores doctrinae eligite
&amp; conuersationem relinquite, vt quasi inutilis
herba arescat. Behold doth not barren ground
bring forth pretious gold: now is the pretious
gold, contemned for the vile ground? not, but
as the gold is chosen, the ground left; so take
your selues to the doctrine, and leaue his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
for as herbes are not necessarie vnto bees
but the floures of the herbes; for they gather
the floures and not the herbes. So gather ye
the floures of the Preachers doctrine, but
leaue his life that it may wither as an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
herbe.</hi> Alwayes let such Ministers
know that they shall not escape a heauie
wrath; for he who was avenged long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
vpon <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi>

and take his couenant in his
mouth, seeing they hated to be reformed
thereby. O! if these Ministers whose
words be faire, whose workes be foule;
whose doctrine sauoures of God, and
whose doings be alway sinfull, smelling
of that euill one; could hearken vnto that

docendo, &amp; male viuendo, Deum instruis quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo
te debeat condemnare. By liuing well, and
teaching well, thou instructs the people of God
how they should liue, but by teaching well, and
liuing wickedly, thou teachest God how he
should condemne thee.</hi> Wo is me, wo is me, ô
my soule, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> so many baptized in the name
of Iesus, should thinke and speake of that
good word of Iesus, which is the onely
word of life, as that reprobate <hi>Pharoah</hi>

God sounded by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 5. 9.</note> vnto
the Israelites, and vnto him selfe; directing
his taskmasters thus to speake to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<hi>Let them not regard vaine words.</hi> When
we Christians consider this, ô my soule, we
all condemne <hi>Pharoah:</hi> But (alas) how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be there among vs, who say not onely
in their hearts, but with their lippes, yea
by their works: <hi>The words of God be vaine
words.</hi> O Idolaters, blasphemers, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and other grosse sinners; if that at
any time ye resort to the house of God,
what whisper yea one to another? and
when ye go forth from his house, what
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:21098:197"/>
be your speeches? <hi>Let yonder blast go,
yonder winde shaketh no corne.</hi> Hearken for
Gods cause, ô my soule, our God hath
not mens cornes in such account, neither
counteth he so basely of his word that he
will daine to shake their cornes with it
for he hath a baser wind, of the which he
counteth not so much; whereby he is
able to shake all the cornes in the world.
Besides this I must tell thee, ô my soule,
albeit that word which the men of God
preach, shaketh not mens cornes, yet it
can shake Kings, and Queenes and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of all estates. That same <hi>Pharoah,</hi>
who durst open his blasphemous mouth
gainst Gods word found this to be true
by a dolefull experience: for shakes not
him that word of God spoken by <hi>Moses</hi>
out of his royall Chariot, when he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

as that word of God spoken by Iesus
and his Apostles vnto our fathers, hath
scattered you and your predecessors these
fifteene hundred yeares by one. We reade
that a blast or two of this wind of the
word of God, did shake a king so that it
changed his countenance, it loosed his
loynes, and made his knees the one to
smite against the other, sitting at his owne
table at a banquet royall,<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 5. 6.</note> accompanied
with his Queene and his counsellers. We
reade likewise in Scripture, that a blast
of this wind blowne by a man of God,
standing at a barre to be accused, made
his iudge to shake and tremble: for while
<hi>Paul</hi> is disputing of righteousnesse, and
temperance, and of the iudgement to
come, <hi>Felix</hi> the iudge trembled so, that he
might abide <hi>Pauls</hi> presence no longer:<note place="margin">Act. 24. 26.</note>

Were the desolate houses and old liuings

of God <hi>Vanitie or wind.</hi> If thou loue thy
selfe herefore, ô my soule, abhorre to
thinke or speak of the word of God with
<hi>Pharoah,</hi> and learne to thinke and to speak
of it as thy God hath directed thee; and so
thinke thou, and speake you of it, as of that
milke the new borne babes of God are
nourished by; as of that bread wherewith
Gods children are fed; as of that wine
whereby they are refreshed and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 1.</note>
as of that fire whereby the remnant

                     <hi>Ego vnum

sed colligantur singula, etiam ipsa

words of saluation being so oft heard, become
of no estimation in our account, as words stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

not leafes; and if they be leafes, yet they are
golden leafes, and therefore not to be lightened
and passed by, but to be gathered vp euen eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
crumme of them.</hi> O Lord God, when
shall men begin to haue the preaching of
the sacred word (though sounded by
heard-men, by fishers, and so by the very
of-scourings of the earth) in any kind of
reuerence? for what heard by mans eare in
this our dead time is so neglected, is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
by mans heart, as thy Maiesties
word preached is? Alas, alas, ô Lord God,
that blind man should suffer himselfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to be deceiued by that great decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Satan; so farre as to despise that speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
which thy wise Maiestie hath highly
aduanced? Tell me, tell me, ô my soule,
whereby is it that thy mercifull wise God
hath appointed that sauing grace of his to
be conueyed to thee on earth here, which
is onely able to bring thee to that perfect
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:21098:199"/>
glorie which is aboue? It is not, ô my
soule, by the touching of thine hand, or
any other member of thy bodie, nor by
the smelling of thy nosthrils, nor by the
sight of thine eyes, that God will grant
vnto thee that grace on earth in time,
which must crowne thee with glorie
when time shall ceasse: but it is by the
hearing of thine eare that thy God will do
this. Let others neglect this, let others
mocke this: alwayes, ô my soule, when
thou hearest this, I charge thee that thou
reioyce; I charge thee that thou leape for
ioy within me: for by this would not thy
blessed powerful God, whose wayes passe
finding out, not onely ouerthrow, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
mocke the malice and craft of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
to his Maiesties great glory, to Satans
sensible shame, and to thy euerlasting
comfort? O malitious subtle serpent, who
did cunningly conuey by <hi>Euahes</hi> eares,
that fearefull poyson towards her soule,
which was able to slay her, her husband,
and their posteritie. But is not my good
God both mercifull and powerfull, able
to conuey to my soule, euen by my eare,
that wholsome salue whereby thy poyson
is not onley made ineffectuall, but I am
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:21098:200"/>
made to liue for euer? Thou feest, thou
smellest, thou touchest, thou trustest, yea,
thou readest (ô man) many things. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
vnderstand, it is not by thy sight, by
thy smelling, by thy touching, by thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
yea, it is not by thy reading (if thou
attempt to despise hearing, and so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the word preached) that thou canst
be saued. O when shall that golden chaine
of saluation presented to vs by <hi>Paul,</hi> first
be reuerenced, and then be embraced and
kept by vs?<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 13. 14. 15. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Whosoeuer shall call vpon the

they call on him in whom they haue not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?
&amp; how shall they beleeue in him, of whom
they haue not heard? and how shall they heare
without a Preacher? and how shall they preach
except they be sent? then faith is by hearing,
and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Out of this
sense <hi>Bernard</hi> said most truly:<note place="margin">Bern. ser. 28 in Cant.</note> 
                     <hi>Aur is prima

                  <p>Woe is me, woe is me, ô my soule, that
so many in this our time should know
where this Lanterne of the word shineth,
and by whom it is carried, and that so few
should resort towards it: yea, that so few
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:21098:200"/>
euen of these who resort vnto it, should
profit to saluation by it. Were I deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

infected in soule with that spirituall
leprosie of sinne, presenting themselues
before the carriers of Gods word, within
Gods house, to be cleansed by that cleane
and cleansing water of his word, scarce
one go backe cleansed and washed in
soule from their sinnes: I durst answer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
before that blessed God the searcher
of my heart, that this commeth to passe,
because scarce one of an hundred drawes
neare Gods house, drawes neare Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
handling his word in his house,
with due premeditation, and holy consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
weighing as the child, as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticke,
and as the scholler of God
should do; what a God he is before whom
they appeare, what a word that is which
is to be heard there, and what manner of
persons they themselues be, who do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselues there. They appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that God who lookes not on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 7.</note> but who beholdeth the
heart, and who will be sanctified in them
that come neare him.<note place="margin">Leuit. 10. 3.</note> That house in which
they appeare is Gods chamber of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:21098:201"/>
within the which he manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
clearely, and amiable to his owne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
ones, who with broken hearts do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him, and who approaching do
seeke vnto him for meate and medicine.
The sense hereof moued religious <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.</note>
first to be so carefull to haue Gods Arke,
the Sacrament of his presence, dwelling
in one Citie with him, and thereafter to
haue a fit habitation made for it. The
word of God handled there,<note place="margin">Psal. 132. 2. 3. 4. 5.</note> is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
seed, whereby sonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
be begotten to God, of these who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(because of sinne) were the children
of wrath. Is that pure milke, whereby
these Gods sons and daughters are made
to grow in that grace, which is able to
make them withstand all tentations and
aduersaries here, to their ioy among men,
and to stand hereafter before the Sonne of
man to their euerlasting glorie.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 23. &amp; 2. 2.</note> They

of God, layed open to them in their

when they appeare before that God
who made Scripture, to the end that they
may profit to saluation by Scripture? Our

who knowes not onely the wanderings of

but all the imaginations of your hearts,
able after I haue slaine the bodies of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels

for twelue monethes to prepare your

you presented your selues onely before me
as the diuell did in the dayes of <hi>Iob,</hi> go

what speake I, ô my soule, of <hi>Esther,</hi> shall

them;<note place="margin">Psal. 24. 7.</note> is that companie of heauenly
spirits and celestiall Angels, pitching
their tents round about those who be
Gods, and feare his name.</head>
                  <p>THat same sweetest Spirit of God, who
is a very deepe sea of loue, mercie,
wisedome, and prouidence; hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
the babes of God, kept and led by
him, of a shining Lanterne; for the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of them in their iourney towards
their heauenly home: hauing found out
also a fit Carrier to beare this Lanterne
before them, and to discouer to them that
light inclosed within it, to the end that
thereby they might be happily helped
homewards: hath also out of his loue,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:21098:204"/>
mercie, wisedome, and prouidence found
out a most fit strong Guard, aboue and
beneath, before and behind, on this side,
and on that side; to attend these babes of
God while they soiourne here, not onely
absent in bodie from their Father and
friends, but who besides this, do liue as in
the lists amongst many monstrous and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable
foes; to the end that no euill
come vnto them,<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 10.</note> or any plague approach
their tabernacle. Now this Guard happily
appointed by this vncreated Spirit, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
those babes of God, be not troupes
of footmen, or companies of horsemen,
nor kings and Princes of the earth, who
do greatly brag and boast of their power;
nor chariots wherein those Kings and
Princes with their great men be carried,
but the very chariots of God, for so are
they styled by the Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psal. 68. 17.</note> yea the verie
fierie chariots of God: for so they are sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by that onely glorious and vncreated
Spirit,<note place="margin">2. King. 6. 17.</note> who made them and sends them.
Now the chariots, yea fierie chariots of
God guiding that Chariot wherein the
babes of God be carried towards their
Father, are those heauenly and holy spirits.
Scripture for our confirmation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:21098:204"/>
honors specially with three glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
titles: first, with the title of Angels;
hereby acquainting vs, as with that end
wherefore God hath appointed them, so
with that office whereunto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
They are appointed to be Legats
and Ambassadours, sent foorth by that
great King who hath made them, and
their office is to carrie and discharge such
commission and message, as shall please
his Maiestie to imploy them about. But
because that these euill spirits, who be the
auowed and irreconcilable aduersaries of
Gods babes, haue this stile of Angels, and
so of messengers giuen to them also; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is, that these Angels who be sent
out from God to attend and guard his
babes, are honoured by that blessed Spirit
who directs them with some glorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithites
and stiles, not onely to the end
that they may be discerned from those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
Angels, but specially that the babes of
God guarded by them, may for their
greatest consolation be informed tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that rare and inexpressible aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which they do reape by their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of them. And so the Angels atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Gods children be called, <hi>The Angels
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:21098:205"/>
of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10. 3. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>the Angels of the Lord, the holy
Angels;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 5. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>the Angels of light; the elect Angels,
the Angels of the power of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 14.</note> This moued
<hi>Augustine</hi> writing on the 104. Psalme thus
to speake of them:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 21</note> 
                     <hi>Quaeris nomen huius na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae?</hi>

                     <hi>Angelus est.
If thou aske after the name of this nature? it
is a spirit: if thou inquire after the office of it?
it is an Angell.</hi> Secondly, they be called
<hi>Watchmen</hi> &amp; <hi>Keepers:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 10.</note> for they be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God to watch ouer and keepe his
children, who liuing here, be not onely
subiect to securitie and carelesnesse, but
also to innumerable bloudie deuouring
enemies, who would vndoubtedly euerie
minute ouerthrow them, if they were not
kept by his Guard, who keeping Israel
doth neither sleepe nor slumber; albeit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
his Israel doth sleepe and slumber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.
Thirdly, they be called <hi>Seruants,</hi>
according to that,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>He maketh the spirits his
messengers, and a flaming fire his ministers.</hi>
And againe,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Are they not all ministring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
sent out to minister for their sakes which
shall be heires of saluation?</hi> whereof it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that these Angels be stiled <hi>Seruants</hi>
and <hi>Ministers,</hi> not onely in respect of God
their Soueraigne Lord and Maister, by
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:21098:205"/>
whom they are imployed, but in respect
of Gods children whom they do serue, in
guarding them and watching ouer them,
lest they should be suppressed by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
and depriued of that saluation
whereunto they are called. But here, ô my
soule, I must haue thee to vnderstand, that
thy blessed, all-sufficient, and Almightie
God doth not any wayes vse the seruice
and ministerie of these heauenly and holy
Angels, either because of necessitie on his
part, or of any worthinesse on theirs; for as
the Psalmist speaking of that great worke
of Creation, and magnifying the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
power of that great Creator,
doth say:<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 6. 9</note> 
                     <hi>By the word of the Lord were the
heauens made, and all the host of them by the
breath of his mouth. He spake and it was done,
he commanded and it stood.</hi> So the Apostles
speaking of that no lesse great worke of
preseruation, &amp; conseruation of all things
thus created, magnifying with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
the power of the great Gouernour &amp;
preseruer doth say:<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>He beareth vp all things
by his mightie word.</hi> But this he doth of his
own vndeserued fauour, &amp; free grace on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that for 3. most weightie reasons,
which I wil pray thee, ô my soule, grauely
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:21098:206"/>
to consider: first, this is done by our God
for the speciall glory of his owne glorious
&amp; blessed name, which all powers in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and on earth should adore and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to that:<note place="margin">Prou. 16. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>God made all things for his
own selfe.</hi> This moued the Psalmist aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the glorie of his God to crie out:<note place="margin">Psal. 68. 17.</note>
                     <hi>The Chariots of God are twentie thousand
thousand Angels, and the Lord is among
them as in the Sanctuarie of Sinai.</hi> This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Daniel</hi> giuing vs a view of the glorie
of our God to say:<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 4. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>I beheld till the
thrones were sit vp, and the ancient of dayes
did sit, whose garment was white as snow,
and the haires of his head like the pure wooll.
His throne was like the fierie flames, and his
wheeles a burning fire; A fierce streame issued
and came forth before him: Thousand, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
ministred vnto him, and ten thousand
thousands stood before him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reuel. 5. 11</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> happily
saw this when he said: <hi>Then I beheld,
and I heard the voice of manie Angels round
about the Throne, and about the beasts, and
the Elders, and they were thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.</hi>
Whereof it is manifest, ô my soule,
that the first and principall office of the
elect Angels is, to magnifie and praise
the glorie, the grandor, the power, and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:21098:206"/>
the wisedome of God, their glorious and
gracious maker. Therefore what wonder
that <hi>Dauid</hi> (knowing this to be true)
directs his language vnto these Angels
thus:<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 20. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Praise the Lord ye his Angels that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in strength, that do his commandement in
obeying the voice of his word: Praise the Lord
all ye his hostes, yea his seruants that do his
pleasure.</hi> Againe, it pleased our louing
wise Father, thus to honour these Angels
for their owne speciall honour, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
Who among men can denie, that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

he imployes to be his ambassadour to
carrie his will to his neighbour Princes,
and not onely at home to attend him in
his royall Palace? And must not these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
thinke and confesse themselues to be
both happie and honourable, whom that
onely soueraigne King of kings hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
not onely alwayes to attend the
throne of his glorious Maiestie, there to
behold him, but also receiuing from him
directions as do please him, are sent forth
of him to do his will vpon earth here. O
how farre was that Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
when being acquainted with the
blessed time of that glorious incarnation
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:21098:207"/>
of that sweetest Sauiour of the world
(long hid vp from the knowledge of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

                     <hi>Feare not Marie,

Throne of his Father Dauid, and he shall
reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of
his kingdome shall be no end?</hi> O how farre
was this Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> honoured of God,
when he was sent vnto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to whom
this <hi>Marie</hi> was affianced not onely to
shew him that that which was conceiued
in <hi>Maries</hi> bosome, was conceiued by
the holy Ghost, but with this to bring
vnto <hi>Ioseph</hi> the name wherewith they
should name the child when he should be
borne, and the reason wherefore he
should be named so, saying to him in a
dreame,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 10. 21. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioseph the sonne of Dauid feare
not to take Marie for thy wife, for that which
is conceiued in her is of the holy Ghost and she
shall bring forth a sonne, and thou shalt call
his name Iesus, for he shall saue his people
from their sinnes?</hi> O how farre were these
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21098:207"/>
heauenly Spirits honoured of God, when
first one of them being acquainted with
the happie birth of this blessed Iesus, was
directed towards the shepheards keeping
watch by night, because of their flocke
about the place where blessed Iesus was
borne, to intimate vnto them with the
blessed birth of that holy one, the onely
honourable and profitable end wherefore
he was borne,<note place="margin">Luc. 2. 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> saying vnto them: <hi>Be not
affraid, for behold I bring you glad tidings of
great ioy that shall be to all the people: that is
that vnto you is borne this day in the Citie of
Dauid a Sauiour, which is Christ our Lord?</hi>
And when after this, there was with this
Angell a multitude of heauenly souldiers
directed from the Throne of God, to
praise the vnsearchable higth, and depth,
length, and breadth of his loue, passing
all finding out, manifested towards men
in making his onely Sonne, sole solace,
and dearest fellow, content to become
man, for the safetie of man: saying, <hi>Glorie
be vnto God in the high heauens, and peace in
earth, and towards men good will?</hi> O how
farre was that Angel honoured of God
who was directed to attend this blessed
meeke Lambe, drawing neere the place
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:21098:208"/>
of expectation, and not onely carrying in
his hand,<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 42. 43. 44.</note> but conueying to his head that
bitterest cup of the Lords wrath (so that
his sweat was like drops of bloud trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

him in this his agonie? O how farre
were these two Angels honoured of God,
who were directed not onely to attend

Iesus of Nazareth which hath bene crucified,
he is risen, he is not heare, behold the place
where they haue put him?</hi> O how farre were
these two Angels honoured of God, who
were sent not onely to attend the glorious
ascension of this mightie God, the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the world, but with that to preach
and proclaime his comming againe from
the heauens to iudgement, saying to his
disciples where they were looking sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
towards heauen, after that a cloud
had taken their most louing kind Maister
out of their sight:<note place="margin">Act. 1. 11.</note>

stand ye gazing, this Iesus which is taken vp
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:21098:208"/>

done that hereby our God perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the miseries and distresses
of his owne secret ones, lying vnder a

of tentations, might haue a verie sea of
speciall consolation conueyed to them.
Must thou not confesse, ô my soule, that
this must necessarily be a verie infallible
ground of inexpressable ioy to the child
of God, when not onely he knowes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught of Scripture) that the Lord
his God hath such a care of him,<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 15.</note> that not
so much as a haire can fall from his head
without his prouidence; that he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
his eares open to heare, and his
eyes bended towards him. But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
this he hath not onely created and
furnished most plentiously the aire, the
seaes, and the earth for him, but that he
hath made these verie celestiall spirits for
his preseruation while he liueth here, as
is manifested vnto him by that golden
sentence:<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>For he shall giue his Angels charge
ouer thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes, they
shall beare thee in their hands that thou hurt
not thy foote against a stone.</hi> Where the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:21098:209"/>
would directly (knowing the nature
and office of these Angels the gaurd of
Gods babes) compare them to a nurse
to whom the children of some great King
and Prince, are committed to be fostred,
after that they are borne: and besides this
vnto pedagogues, to whom children after
they are come to some few yeares are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited,
to the end they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
in and out by them, to and from
some schoole, there to be instructed, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and brought vp in the knowledge
of good letters and honest meanes. Now,
ô my soule, I must tell thee, that these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels of God, set ouer Gods babes
as their nurses, and pedagogues; discharge
three most notable, and profitable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
vnto them. For first, so soone as we
are come into this world, they take vs as
it were by the hand, euer keeping, and
defending vs against the diuell, and all
other aduersaries, so that nothing can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
vs without the speciall prouidence of
our God, &amp; as is expedient for his glorie,
and our good. This moued our Maister
thus to direct vs:<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>See that ye despise not one
of these little ones, for I say vnto you that in
heauen, their Angels alwayes behold the face
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:21098:209"/>
of my Father which is in heauen.</hi> This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Dauid</hi> to say:<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>The Angel of the Lord

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Lot</hi> had a speciall proofe of this,
hauing an Angel directed from heauen to
send him away from Sodome before the
ouerthrow of Sodome. <hi>Hagar</hi> had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
proofe of this, when flying from her
mistresse <hi>Sarah,</hi> and hauing her child <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
brought vnto deaths doore through

                     <hi>What ayleth thee Hagar?
feare not, God hath heard the voyce of the
child where he is, arise take vp the child and

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> had proofe of
this, when being sore affraid because of
his brother <hi>Esau;</hi> he tooke himselfe no
sooner to his iourney, then the Angels of
God did meete him, which made <hi>Iacob,</hi>
when he saw them, to say: <hi>This is Gods
host. Elias</hi> had a rare speciall proofe of
this when the King of Aram sent horses
and chariots and a mightie host to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
where he was by night to compasse
it, to the end, the poore man of God
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:21098:210"/>
might no wayes escape; his God from
the heauens sent horses and fierie chariots,
filling the mountaines round about <hi>Elisha,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. King. 6. 14. 15. 16. 17.</note>
so that there was moe with him then
there was with his enemies.<note place="margin">Act. 5. 16.</note> The Apostles
found this, when being imprisoned for
preaching in the name of Iesus, they had
the Angel of the Lord by night readie to
open the prison doore, and to bring them
forth. Secondly when death shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the child of God by sea, by land,
in companie, and alone, in the hands of
friends, in the hands of foes; albeit the
husband be absent from his wife, and the
wife from the husband: the child from the
parent, or the parent from the child, and
so forth: yet the poorest distressed loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<hi>Lazarus</hi> being Gods child,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 22.</note> shall
haue these blessed Angels to attend him,
who shall not be wearie night and day
to stand by his bed till his soule leaue his
body, to the effect by them it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
to his fathers house. Thirdly, in the
end of the world these blessed spirits, shall
not refuse to gather the verie dead bones
of the dead bodies of Gods children to
the end that their bodies being ioyned
with their soules; they may in bodie and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:21098:210"/>
soule raigne and rest with these Angels
before God for euermore; according to
that, sweetly sounded by our Maister:
<hi>The sonne of man shall come in the cloudes of
heauen with power and great glorie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 30. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>and he
shall send his Angels with a great sound of a

end of the heauen to the other.</hi> Oh, ô my

thoughts, and meditate a little vpon these
things? Surely, surely, couldst thou, ô my

And first, thou wilt see that great care the
Lord thy God hath of thee, out of that
great loue wherewith he loued thee,
which moued him to make and appoint
so heauenly a hoast to attend thee, for the
gaurding and keeping of thee. Secondly,
this would stirre thee vp iointly to feare

him or his children in any sort. Knowest

hereof make vs ashamed to speake that,
to do that, either priuately out of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
or publickely before others, which is
repugnant to the good will of God, and
which thou wilt be ashamed to speake
before any religious honest man: seeing
thy words, speake them where thou canst;
thy deedes, do them where thou wilt; are
heard or seene by those Angels who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
attends thee. It were good that
both men and women did hearken to that
watch-word vsed by the Apostle.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Angels, being beholders and markers of

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:21098:211"/>
and incouraged as it were by our good
behauiour; so are they greeued by our
leud life, and prophane carriage. Finally
and lastly, this would comfort thee, ô my
soule, vnder, and against all our troubles,
considering that our Father, redeemer,
and comforter; hath appointed these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
spirits his messengers, to be our
painfull nurses, and faithfull pedagogues,
whatsoeuer our estate be here to the
iudgement of blind men; but specially
this should strengthen vs against that
fearefull day of death, in the which this
dustie tabernacle must be layed downe,
making thee, ô my soule, thus triumphing
ouer death, to speake to thy selfe; let me
not be cast downe, because death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth

such things (in that palace to the which
I am going) see such things, feele, and
possesse such things; which in sweetnesse
and excellence, shall farre surmount all
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:21098:212"/>
heretofore seene, felt, and possessed by me;
yea, let it not trouble me, that this my
clay bodie, which lieth here vnder sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
pined sore in euerie member of it,
destitute of father, mother, husband, wife,
brother, sister, or any liuing whatsoeuer,
to care for it; seeing that blessed Spirit
the comforter of Gods elect lodgeth
within me, assuring me that God is mine,
and I am his; and considering these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

pained bodie which they shall not
forsake, till breath forsake it; for
howbeit these spirits my attendants, be
nor seene by these my corporall dimme

assuredly granted by them, acorrding to
that charge they haue receiued of that
great Angel of the couenant who
gaue himselfe for me, and who
hath ordained to attend me,
till they bring me
where he is.</p>

                        </note> Secondly,
that the Bishop giuing libertie, they take
aduice and counsel of their ordinarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.
Thirdly, that the Bishops suffer
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:21098:221"/>
them not to reade indifferently all vulgar
translations, but those onely which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Romanes haue set forth. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that libertie be not granted to all men
to reade those, but to such as by the
iudgement of their confessor will receiue
no hurt by them, that is, to be plaine with
the cunning Seminarie, but to such whom
they hold as obstinate Papists, bond slaues
to the Pope, and auowed aduersaries to
the sauing truth of God, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
be. Now of these foure grounds
layed by the Tridentine councellers, two
things do follow: first, that these blind
leaders of the Romish Synagogue admit
verie few to reade the vulgar translations
of the holy Scripture. Secondly, that those
whom they admit to reade them, are none
beside their owne sworne men, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to heare the voice of that true shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
Iesus, haue sold themselues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

in the verie matter of their saluation. O

Now (which thou canst not but iustly
admire) ô my soule, the Popish Seminarie
hath so farre preuailed in this point also,
with the <hi>Euahes</hi> of this time, with the
<hi>Sampsons</hi> of this time, that as they will
not looke, vpon any condition almost, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Bible translated in their mother
tongue, so they will euen with greedinesse
lend both their eares vnto the found tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Popish Seminaries, albeit
they be the corrupt birth of his owne

this our time, hearkening vnto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
but not to the Sauiour. Pitie ô God

wonder not while he is not teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ô my soule, which possesseth the Pope,
which possesseth his agents, yea, which
possesseth those who do follow him and
them, that he with them hath taken vpon
them to perfect holy Scripture as if in it
selfe it were maimed, and not onely to
darken it as if it were not cleare, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this that they haue found credit in
these points with the <hi>Euahes</hi> and <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
of this world. The written word of

not heare in my mother tongue. And yet
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:21098:230"/>
the vnwritten inuentions of man I my
reade, I must reade in any tongue I can
vnderstand. That Scripture which leades
men thus, ô my soule, cannot possibly be
the spirit of the Father, the spirit of the
Sonne who is from aboue, but must be
some spirit who is from beneath, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men from the true Father and Sauiour
of their soules, to some bastard father and
Sauiour, who in the end will proue an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
<hi>Saul,</hi> seeking the life of his owne
<hi>Ionathan,</hi> and a cruell <hi>Herod</hi> murthering
those infants he should haue maintained.
Scripture condemnes, and all ages since

<hi>Ieroboam</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> for attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
(contrarie to the will of God) to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
an altar at Bethel, and another at Dan,
lest the people resorting to Ierusalem
(where God had appointed sacrifice one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be offered) should haue fallen away
from him to the house of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and shall
not God condemne, and should not all
men sensible of God abhorre these peart
Popish Seminaries who haue taken vpon
them to set vp in euery corner where they
can be heard, the calfes of their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
drawing away men thereby from
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:21098:230"/>
the true oracles of Gods written word,
lest that they ceassing to dote after these
calfes, and hearkening to Gods oracles,
should giue themselues to seeke and serue
the liuing God, according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?
Now to the effect that the
Seminarie may make the calfes of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to shine the more brightly, and to
smile the more sweetly on such towards
whom they are drawne, they haue not
bene afraid to lay a most fearefull imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vpon our blessed God, and his sacred
truth; most lyingly (and yet most boldly)
affirming that all things requisite for
mans saluation be not contained in holy
Scripture. What, ô my soule, if the eyes of
men were enlightened with the eyes of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> to see the wonders of the Law of
God, and seeing these wonders to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
not that little drop, but that huge
quantitie of sweetest honie, the hungrie
child of God hath presented to his soule
by the Spirit, speaking vnto him by that 4.
verse of the 15. Chapter of that Epistle
written to the Romans, and by the 15. and
16. verses of the 3. Chapter of that second
Epistle written to <hi>Timothie?</hi> Beleeue me,
ô my soule, couldst thou weigh and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

they walke) shortly (yet most substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
acquainting thee so with the whole
vses of that blessed written word of God,
that thou shouldst be able to find that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
requisite to mans saluation is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in it,<note place="margin">Scripture containes all things requisite for mans saluation.</note> that all things needfull to mans
saluation be fully &amp; clearly contained in
it. Wilt thou not confesse, ô my soule, that
whatsomeeuer can concerne mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
possibly, must either looke to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or to manners, or to comfort. If it
looke to doctrine, that doctrine is either
true which the child of God must seeke
after, and embrace, as he would seeke after
that meate which is onely able to feede
him, and after that medicine which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to cure him; or false, which the
child of God must flie from, as he would
flie from poyson, slaying not his bodie
onely, but his soule also. If the doctrine be
true, that is abundantly and clearly taught
by holy Scripture, and therefore it is said
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:21098:231"/>
to be profitable to <hi>Teach.</hi> If the doctrine
be false, that holy Scripture discouers
clearly and ouerthrowes fully, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is said to be profitable to <hi>Improue.</hi>
If it looke to manners, these manners be
either good, commanded and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of God: or euill, forbidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by him. If they be good manners,
Scripture instructs them abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them: and therefore it is said to
be profitable to <hi>Instruct in righteousnesse.</hi>
If the manners be euill, this Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues
and condemnes, and therefore it
is said to be profitable to <hi>Correct.</hi> And
lastly, if thou, ô my soule, shalt finde thy
selfe cast downe at any time, or weakened
by the force of any tentation or crosse ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on thee, or approaching neare thee,
shalt thou not find holy Scripture suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
able to furnish thee with Patience,<note place="margin">Rom. 25. 4.</note>
with Comfort, and with Hope, as <hi>Paul</hi>

Papist begin to lend his eare vnto holy
Scripture, which is that onely old and
true antiquitie, which hath God that

of it, to the end that he may first see that
there is no suspition of imperfection of

insufficiencie in holy Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be moued to confesse, that all things,
and euerie thing requisite for mans salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is onely to be sought out of it, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be found in it. Shall thy God, ô my

onely to stand for a while, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
after he had called and fitted <hi>Bezaliel</hi>
&amp; <hi>Aholiah</hi> for the building of it, he will
haue it, and euerie thing belonging to it,
to be made after that fashion which was
shewed by his Maiestie vnto <hi>Moses</hi> in the

                        <hi>Many other things also did Iesus in

auow that all these who here do not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:21098:236"/>
This fire the Pope hath taken vpon
him to make vp of coales and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
neuer created by that great Creator
who made all things, but of a matter
knowne (I should haue said vnknowne
to himselfe.) And this strong fire he hath
kindled neither in the heauens, nor in the
aire, nor in the seas, nor in the earth, nor
in the hells; so that I must thinke, as the

And yet (if the Papist may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued) ô what extreame intollerable

not this written by their Doctors for a

soule hearing this, chused rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

to stay so much as one short Winter day
long in Purgatorie. But no wonder can it
be that the soule made her choyse thus, if
that fire be such a fire as the Papists make
it to be: for is it not written in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
that there is no earthly paine or
martyrdome to be compared to the
paines of Purgatorie? yea, is that great
schooleman <hi>Thomas</hi> ashamed to affirme?<note place="margin">Cap. qui in aliud dist. 25.</note>
that the fire of hell and the fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
is all one, and that they differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

and the other is eternall. And yet is it not
a wonder, ô my soule, that the Papists can
write so resolutely touching this their
forged fire, and the extremitie of the
paines sustained in it, considering that our
blessed God (to whom all things are
knowne) to this day told vs neuer by
Scripture that there was such a fire, or
such paines sustained in it; yea, considering
that these very Papists by whom these
things be written, (as I thinke) will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

or to be pained themselues therewith. But
ô my soule, it may be that I smell a farre
off (if I be not farre deceiued) that which

But yet they do daily see their owne

him that he was loosed from that band,

thereby giue men to vnderstand that they
should go to heare Masse on Sunday. And
therefore I must pray thee, ô my soule, let
me here enquire of the Papist first, what
sacrifice this his sacrifice of the Masse is?
Secondly, what is that which he sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth

what thy God speaketh to thee by his

about this point. The Papist
will answer thee, ô my soule, that his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Masse is an externall, reall,
vnbloudie, propitiatorie sacrifice, in the
which the true bodie and bloud of Iesus
Christ be offered vp to God his Father,
by the Masse priest, vnder the shape,
forme, and fashion of bread and wine, and
that for the sinnes of the liuing on earth
here, and for the dead in Purgatorie. I
know, ô my soule, that the Masse priest
knowes that he hath no conscience in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
and defending of this his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and yet I cannot but wonder how he
hath the face to offer it vp, and to
eate it when he hath done with it. Grants
he not, ô my soule, that it is an outward
sacrifice? now if it be an outward sacrifice,
it must necessarily be a visible sacrifice, all
outward things being visible? If it be a
visible sacrifice, then necessarily that
which is offered vp into it must be seene,
for how can an outward sacrifice be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
vnlesse the sacrifice offered vp

not by that sacrifice which he
offers vp, nor his altar, nor the many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
vsed by him, nor those hundred
crosses ouer and ouer made by him. The
bodie of Christ, saith the priest, stands by
his sacrifice: that I heare, but is Christs
bodie in that sacrifice of the Masse out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and visible? aduise with thy senses,
by the which outward things are percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
ô Masse priest, most sensible of siluer,
but altogether senslesse of thy Sauiour,
and then if thou hast any conscience, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me as thou wilt be answerable to
God: seest thou the bodie of Christ in this
thy sacrifice of the Masse? smellest thou it?
tastest thou it? touchest thou it? But the
accidents of the bread are seene (alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the Masse priest) as the roundnesse of
it, the colour of it, yea the taste and smell
of it are also perceiued, and these be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and externall. That I grant to be
true. But alwayes, ô Masse priest, when all
this is done, either thou must offer these
accidents to God, and these must be thy
sacrifice, which thou deniest, or else thou
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:21098:243"/>
must offer vp to God an outward visible
sacrifice without an outward visible offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
which cannot possibly be: or lastly,
that one and the same sacrifice must be
outward and inward, visible and inuisible.
But it may be, ô my soule, that the Masse
priest who hath learned his tongue so
grosly to contrarie God, can easily digest
these contrarieties. Forget not then, ô my
soule, that the Papist doth confesse that
Christs bodie is offered vp in the Masse,
and yet that it is inuisible in the Masse, and
therefore see that thou, throwing his
owne false doctrine in his owne soules
face, say to him, vpon his owne grounds,
that his Masse can be no visible sacrifice,
and if it be no visible, that it cannot be
outward as he affirmeth.<note place="margin">No remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins without bloud.</note> But will Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Christs offering daily offered, yea daily to
be offered while the world lasts; Christ
once offered, and Christ not once offered,
but often to be offered; Christ offered
once by himselfe, and to be offered often
by the priest. But all these contrarieties be
easily digested by that man, ô my soule,

which was spoken long ago of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises,

in vse, by the which they were inriched,
and not God; then that the Law ceassing that
sacrifice of righteousnesse should haue place,
with the which alone God is well pleased, and
by the which sinfull man is made righteous.</hi>
Now I appeale to thy conscience, ô Masse
priest, whither thou wishest that thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudie
sacrifice of the Masse, whereby
thou art inriched, and God is grieued,
should stand in constant vigor, as it hath
done with thee, or that it should ceasse
and be reiected of all men, as it was neuer
ordained of God, to the end that all men
euerie where might haue recourse onely
to that onely bloudie propitiatorie sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

once offered vp by Christ, and neuer
to be offered vp againe, albeit it be that
onely sacrifice wherein God delighteth,
and whereby euerlasting righteousnesse
is attained by man. But while the
Masse priest finds himselfe thus by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be straited, with Satan his maister
tempting my Sauiour, he dare flie to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and presse euen by it to make all he
hath alledged good (about the retention

in the seed of the woman promised, he
should be freed from the guilt of his sin,
and eternall death due thereunto: yet we
find that <hi>Adam</hi> beside this must endure
the first death, be cast out of the earthly
paradise, and haue his bodie afflicted with
many troubles and miseries. Surely reade
we not that notwithstanding <hi>Dauid</hi> had
his adulterie and murther remitted, yet he
was sharpely punished with temporarie
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:21098:245"/>

which was borne dyed according to
Gods threatning: <hi>Ammon</hi> his sonne defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tamar</hi> his daughter, <hi>Absolon</hi> his sonne

the Sun, whereof it is manifest (saith
the Masse priest) that after God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the great and eternall punishment
of sinne to his owne, that they themselues
must suffer for the temporarie, either here
before death, or after death in Purgatory.
Lift vp thine eares, ô my soule, and heare
I pray thee, he whom heresie hath once

hast any conscience, ô Masse priest, tell
me as thou wilt answer to God, if no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing moues our wise God, after he
hath freely and fully forgiuen his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for the merits of his dearest child Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
to correct and afflict them, but that
thereby they may satisfie his iustice for
the temporarie punishment due to them
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:21098:246"/>
for sinne? If thou shalt suffer Scripture
to leade thee, and not thy owne greedie
heart to miscarrie thee, thou shalt find
that no wayes, for that cause, but for
maine other good deeds doth our God so
behaue himselfe towards his owne. First,
that the bodie of sinne in them may by

least otherwayes they falling forth in
new sins should proue dogges returning
to their vomite, &amp; swine to their puddle.
The sense hereof moued, <hi>Dauid</hi> to say: <hi>It is
good for me that I haue bene afflicted,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> 
                        <hi>that I
may learne thy statutes.</hi> Secondly, this is
done by our wise God, to the end that
these his corrections may supply y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roome
of as many speaking, wise Maisters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
sounding in the eares of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that notable iewell receiued by
them, euen the remission of their sinnes,
together with the dutie they should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
vnto God for the same. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Dauid</hi> in the place alledged to say:
<hi>Before I was afflicted I went astray,</hi>

which the Papist cannot see, could say.
<hi>Deus imponit paenam non exigens supplicia
pro peccatis, sed ad futura nos corrigens. God
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:21098:246"/>
layes correction vpon his owne, not exacting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
punishment for sinnes, but correcting vs for
the time to come.</hi> Yea, this moued <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>

Prosperitie is the gift of God comforting men;
aduersitie is the gift of God admonishing men.</hi>
Thirdly, this is done least sinne (which is
both freely and fully remitted of God
with all punishment due thereto) should
be extenuate and accounted light, either
by the committers, or by others looking
on them, and in the end not onely excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but defended by them to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
This moued the Apostle to

might alwayes carrie about with them

                        <hi>Augustine</hi> seeing this, could

He answers: before remission of sinnes these

The hand of that sacrificer Iesus, was the
cleanest hand that euer man carried, the

<hi>Bernard</hi> reprouing the dead blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his time could say: <hi>Nec talia sunt

The merites of men be not such that by
anie law euerlasting life can be due vnto them
or as if God should do any wrong vnlesse he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed
them with eternall life: for besides
this which I will passe with silence, that all
merites of man are the gifts of God, so that a
man for them is rather a debtor to God, then
God a debtor to him; what proportion possibly
can there be betwixt mans merits and that
great weight of glorie which is layed vp in
heauen? And to conclude, what is man better

but (by that sea of filth which alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines

                        <hi>We haue all

                        <hi>Opera ex gratia, non ex operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

diffundatur in cordibus nostris per spiritum

grace of good workes; because faith which
worketh by charitie, could worke nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the loue of God were shed abroad in our
hearts, by the holy Ghost which is giuen to vs;
yea faith could not be wrought in vs, vnlesse
our God imparted to euery one of vs a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

                        <hi>Cum malus sum, nihil aliud est confiteri tibi

sed prius cum iustificas impium. When I am
wicked, offending thee, I cannot otherwayes
confesse my selfe to thee, but being displeased
with my selfe for grieuing of thee: when I am
vpright, doing good, I cannot better confesse
my selfe to thee, then by not challenging the
doing of that good to my selfe, because thou, O
Lord, doest blesse the iust man, and yet before
that, thou iustifiest him being vniust and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God.</hi> This moued him also to hold this
for a firme ground: <hi>Cum Deus remunerat
opera nostra, coronat in nobis dona sua. While
our God rewards our workes, he crownes in
vs his owne gifts.</hi> For as <hi>Bernard,</hi> who liued

saith, <hi>Gratia non solum peccata lauat, sed

that he should onely refraine his

thereby he may merit eternall life at the

cleane hand of an vpright seruant, but
doth prooue himselfe to be a very merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
slaue worthie to be put out of Gods
doores; for as God loued vs freely, so he
will be freely loued of vs. This moued our
wisest Maister, whose words neuer sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                        <hi>When ye haue done all these things
which are commanded you, say we are vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
seruants, we haue done that which was
our dutie to do.</hi> The sense hereof moued
<hi>Augustine</hi> sweetly to say: <hi>Hoc affectu &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderio
colendus est Deus, vt sui cultus ipse sit
merces.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August. ep. 120.</note> 
                        <hi>Nam qui Deum ideo colit, vt aliud

God is with this affection and earnest desire of
heart to be worshipped by vs, that he himselfe
may be the reward of that worship wherewith
we worship him: For whosoeuer worships God,
to the effect that thereby he may merit to
himselfe some other thing beside God, worships
not God, but that other thing which he desires
to obtaine at his hands.</hi> The sense whereof
moued him, toning his sweete song with
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:21098:260"/>
a loud voice, to crie out: <hi>Tunc enim recte,
tunc iuste, tunc pie fit; cum opus bonum in eius
laudem fit, cuius gratia donatur vt fiat. Then
a good worke is done rightly, iustly, and holily;
when it is done for the glorie and praise of his
name, whose fauour and grace made the doer
of it able to do it.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Ioan. tract. 3.</note> And againe. <hi>Si gratiam

thou loue thy God freely, loue not thy God for

they should be left by their blessed

would not ceasse to worship God, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:21098:260"/>
to regard his idoll. O when shall
the selfe iustifying Papist begin to take
some paines to know God, and his owne
heart? for could he know these two, he
would seeke for some secret place with
<hi>Peter,</hi> there to weepe bitterly that euer he
inuented or vented, or professed and
maintained, that damnable poysoning
leauen of <hi>iustification by workes,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that great and onely true teacher of

                        <hi>Ye are they which iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie

among men is an abhomination in the sight of
God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ignorance the mother of the vile doctrine of humane merit.</note> Ignorance then, ô my soule, yea,
most grosse ignorance (as thou mayest
see) hath rikled vp that sandie bray of the
Romane synagogue, now running spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
by its owne force to a decay; and
fearefull vncouth ignorance hath made
the blind Papist to inuent, and vent that
mischieuous doctrine of mans merits.<note place="margin">He who would me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit must do 3. things.</note> For
must not euen the simplest man confesse,
that whosoeuer would merit any thing
by his working at the hands of God must
do three things: for first, that which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
doeth, he must do it of himselfe, and by
himselfe; for if he do it by the grace and
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:21098:261"/>
strength of another, that other merits and
not he.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.</note> Now if Christ be true, no man can
do any thing which is good but him. And
if <hi>Paul</hi> be not deceiued, no man doing
any thing by the grace of God can but
with shame boast himselfe of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
doeth.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> Secondly, that which the meriting
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> man doth, must be done of meere good
will, and not of dutie; for if it be done by
the force of any obligation binding him
thereunto, the doer cannot possibly merit
any thing by the doing of it: and yet I
hope the Papist (if he haue not both cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terised
his conscience, and seared his face
with a brasen countenance) will blush to
alledge that he is not bound to do all, and
more then possibly he can do, and when
he hath done it, that he cannot merit
thereby, if he could heare the voice of
God and beleeue it, as the voice of him
who would be his Father and shepheard:
<hi>Ishow mercie vnto thousands of them that
loue me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezod. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>and keepe my Commandements.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that worke which is done by a
man to the end that he may merit by it,
must be proportionable, and answerable
to that reward a man expects for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. Now what man liuing here can
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:21098:261"/>
possibly do or suffer that which can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the worth and excellent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew
of that eternall life layed vp in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?
<hi>Paul</hi> saw that it was a greater gift to
suffer for Christ, then to beleeue in Christ:
and therefore could speake touching the
Philippians thus:<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>Vnto you it is giuen for
Christ, that not onely ye should beleeue in him,
but also suffer for his sake.</hi> And yet that
same <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Romanes can
say:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>I account that the afflictions of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time are not worthie of the glorie that
shall be shewed vnto vs.</hi> And so from my
heart I pray God make the hautie Papist
at length subscribe from his heart and
with his hand vnto that heauenly poesie:
<q>
                           <l>Datua, sed quae non debes, proportio constet,</l>
                           <l>Haud aliter meritum dixeris esse tuum.</l>
                        </q>
Giue those things which be thine owne,
but which thou art no wayes bound to
giue; let there be a proportion betwixt the
gift and the reward, otherwise alledge
not that thou hast any merit. Conclude
then, ô my soule, if thou wouldst appeare
iust before that onely iust Iudge, as <hi>I saiah</hi>
concludeth: <hi>We haue all bene as an vncleane
thing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 64. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>and all our righteousnesse as filthie

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:21098:262"/>
by my selfe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>yet I am not thereby iustified.</hi> As
<hi>Bernard</hi> concludeth, taught by the Spirit,
and led by the Scripture long ago. <hi>Sufficit

<pb n="507" facs="tcp:21098:264"/>

without any shew or reason, that effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
comparison; and from keeping it so
pertenatiously, euen to this day, without
any kind of shame? for this cause men and
women are moued to go to kings, by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

but men, and know not to whom they
should commit the gouernment of their
countrey: but while a man hath to do

be hidde (for all men are knowne by him)
we haue neede of no such mediator, but
of a deuout humble holy heart: for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
such an heart shall speake, God

deceiuing Seminarie! to what purpose
will this thy comparison serue thee in that

thou hast to do, hath by a speciall Edict,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:21098:265"/>
vnder his great seale and publicke procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
raised thereupon, authorised his
eldest Sonne, to be the onely mediator,
by whom his subiects great and small,
any wayes offending him, or standing in
neede of any thing at his hands, should
haue recourse vnto him; discharging
them herewith vnder the highest paine, to
make any suite by the mediation of any

the Kings eldest sonne, being thus autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised

proclamation (hauing receiued from his

all his fathers subiects, that none of them
possibly can come to him but by him?
Thlrdly, if the Lords of the Kings secret
counsell, being certified of the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
would beside this (being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the subiects to come to the Kings sonne,

demanding him euen from a strong heart

out of Gods mouth, speaking to thee by
Scripture, thou learnedst it neuer; albeit no
booke besides Gods booke, no mouth
besides Gods mouth, must in this point
informe thee: for telleth not Gods booke
me, and so Gods mouth, first, that we haue
no mediatour who can possibly intercede
for vs at the hands of our God, but that
mediatour who hath reconciled vs to our
God, for be not these the words of <hi>Paul:
There is one God and one Mediatour betwixt
God and man, the man Christ Iesus.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi>
had spoken thus, There is one mediatour
betwixt God and man, the man Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;
he had spoken enough to conuince
the lying Seminarie, but he will say more,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:21098:267"/>
euen this: <hi>There is one God and one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
betwixt God and man, the man Christ
Iesus,</hi> to make the Seminarie ashamed (if
he could be) of his subtiltie; for hereby
he would tell thee, ô my soule, that as
there is one onely true God, and no waies
in any respect another, euen the Father,
Sonne, and holy Ghost; so there is onely
one true Mediator, and in no respect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Secondly, telleth not Gods booke,
and so Gods mouth me, that this Iesus
Christ could not possibly haue bene a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
of intercession for vs, praying to
God for vs, vnlesse he had bene a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
of reconciliation for vs, by his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
sacrifice, satisfying his Fathers iustice
for our sinnes. O vile Seminarie, darest
thou giue that great disciple (whom Iesus
loued, and who lay in Iesus bosome) the
lye? for speakes he not thus. <hi>If anie

                        <hi>we haue an Aduocate with the

reconciliation for our sinnes.</hi> Thus ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ioyning Christs intercession and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
together; and from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
of vs, proouing that he hath
onely right to intercede for vs; for if he
had not reconciled vs, he could no wayes

haue any right to pray for vs, neither durst
we haue attempted to haue had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to him as to our Mediatour; yea,
which is more ô my soule, if he had not
bene our onely Reconciler, he could not
haue bene our Mediatour at all. <hi>Augustine</hi>
writing vpon this place out of the sense
hereof speaketh thus: <hi>Ioannes non dixit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatum

                        <note place="margin">August.</note>

superbos fratres. Iesum Christum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
habemus aduocatum ad patrem, ipse est
propitiatio peccatorum nostrorum; hoc qui

schismata, cum dicunt homines nos iusti su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
nos sanctificamus immundos, nos iusti fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus
impios, nos petimus, nos impetramus.
Iohn said not ye haue an Aduocate, but we;
neither said he, ye haue me, but putting Christ
for our aduocate not himself; for he had rather
haue put himselfe amongst the number of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to the end he might haue Christ for his
Aduocate, then to make himselfe aduocate in
Christs stead, and so in the end to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:21098:268"/>
We haue Iesus Christ the iust himselfe
for our Aduocate with the Father, he is a

this maintaines no heresie, makes no schisme;
for schismes proceed of this, when men say, we
are iust, we sanctifie the vncleane, we iustifie
the wicked, we pray, we obtaine.</hi> O when
shall the blind Popish Seminarie thinke
and write as honorably of that excellent
worke of mediation, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> thought
and wrote of it, for sees he it not to be so
excellent, that he can find neither Angell
nor man any wayes fit for it? yea, that he
must affirme that none can be mediatour
betwixt God and man but he who was
God. And therefore prouing Christ to be
God amongst other arguments he vseth

do grosly grieue that holy one Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
who hath called them to that high
dignitie to be called the sonnes of God:
but in this specially, that they take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to commit sinne, yea to continue in
sinne, with some pleasure and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because God the Father out of his
vndeserued loue, borne freely to man, hath
giuen his Sonne to dye for man, because
his blessed Sonne out of this same loue
hath humbled himselfe willingly, yea,
chearfully to the death for man; so that
blind nature, common ciuilitie, Gods
truth, their owne consciences, Angels,
and well informed, or any waies, reformed
men, cannot but condemne them, yea
pronounce them to be execrable. Woe is
me, ô my soule, that euer subtle and strong
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:21098:278"/>
Satan should haue preuailed so ouer man,
that man now can be content to abuse
that salue which is onely able to cure him,
yea that he doth runne headlong vpon
that sharpe slaying sword of sinne, because
he heareth that salue is prepared for the
curing of him. All men confesse, ô my
soule, that that second couenant of grace
made betwixt God and man in his blessed
Sonne Iesus, that second <hi>Adam</hi> (who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
fell nor can fall) is of greater moment,
and alwayes more glorious then that first
couenant of workes, which was made in
that first <hi>Adam</hi> who stood not long, but
fell fearefully. And canst thou deny but as
our God hath obliged himselfe more
strictly to man by this second couenant of
grace, then he was by that first of works:
so man is become nearer, yea sibber to
God by the last then he was by the first;
and in that respect obliged to worship and
attend his Maiestie, so much the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
faithfully, and constantly? findest
thou, ô my soule, when thou readest and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siderest Scripture, but God thy maker,
perceiuing that first couenant of workes
made betwixt him and man, broken by
man, prooued iust; and so adiudged man
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:21098:278"/>
with all his posteritie vnto that death
threatned against him and them, in case
that couenant should be violated by
them? And shall not our God, hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
his owne Sonne for man, proue much
more iust in condemning all such who
dare attempt to despise that bloud shed
by him for sinne, by selling themselues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

for buying them from sinne? If a Iew ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

men, who do resort to the house of God, who
call vpon the name of God, who daily in
troopes runne on foote, ride on horsebacke,
keeping their solemne meetings in citie and
countrey, who turne the sauing grace of God
into damnable wantonnesse, denying</hi> (albeit
not with their foule mouthes, yet by their

considering that his Maister writ before
him touching Chorasin, Bethsaida, and
Capernaum: <hi>Wo be to thee Chorasin, wo be

the desperate estate of this our deaddest

worthy the stile of a booke, to wit, the

the booke of this God; indited by his

ledde by this same spirit: yet our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
so liue, as all who do looke on
them, and heare them (being truly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

must euen solemnely sweare, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of a great manie of them, do either
denie this God who made the Bible, to
be that God whom they worship; or the
Bible to be Gods booke. Offend not
rashly, ô my soule, that I speake so to
thee: for after triall (alas) this will proue
to be most true. If our professors did hold
that God who made that booke which
we call the Bible for their God, would
they not striue to worship him, and to
liue with men, and among men, as God
by this his booke hath appointed them to
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:21098:283"/>

nothing euill but that which is euill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

commands them to obey? yea, durst they

those things which be there to be

Yea, I would loose my verie heart and life.
And no wonder, ô my soule, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it be so, for
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:21098:289"/>
in that Inne of heauen, thy God shall be
a bright shining looking glasse to thy
sight, a sweetly sounding Fluit, &amp; Cimball
to thy hearing, a delicious honie combe
to thy tast, odoriferous balme to thy
smelling, and a passing wonderfull soft
pleasant rose to thy touching: What man
of sharpest sight can behold this outward
Sunne which God himselfe hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to enlighten this world, which is the
common Inne of the elect, and reprobate,
in his full brightnesse and glorie, and not
haue his eyes hurt thereby? And shalt

Maiestie of the Father, and of the Lambe,
that onely Sonne which doth enlighten
this Inne, (within the which no reprobate

mans eares are not transported, when he
heares a number of sweete voyces, singing
artificiall musicke in diuerse parts former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

find thy selfe wonderfully transported, ô
my soule, when thou shalt be brought
within thy Inne, to be a hearer, not onely
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:21098:290"/>
of the sweetest musicke of the glorified
Saints; but of these celestiall Spirits the
Angels, there inioying the pleasures of the
spring, the glorie of the Summer, the
plentie of the haruest, and the sweet rest
of the Winter? But no wayes hearing, or
seeing, or feeling any hurt which euer
came to man by any of these. This moued
<hi>Bernard</hi> meditating vpon the estate of
Gods glorified children in heauen,<note place="margin">Ber. Ser. 33. in cant.</note> to
burst forth in these words, not without a
speciall exclamation, and admiration: <hi>O

glorious things, (being the lodging not

house of God be furnished with pleasure,
profit, and glorie; within the which none

such an inexpressible pleasant world of

ô with what earnest desire wouldst

This moued that Apostle who was well

                     <hi>Now abideth faith, hope, and

is loue.</hi> And therefore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> taught by

could write thus: <hi>Charitas pretiosior
est cognitione, gloriosior prophetia, &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
charismatibus supereminet. Loue is more
pretious then knowledge, more gracious then
prophecie, yea, it surmounts all gifts man

and adorned with a fourefold stole: first,
with the stole of rare <hi>beautie</hi> and <hi>holinesse,</hi>
so that the Sunne in his full brightnesse
did neuer shine so gloriously as my bodie
shall shine in that Inne. Tels not <hi>Daniel</hi>

                     <hi>Then shall the iust men shine as the

thou must not wonder, ô my soule, that
euen the blackest &amp; palest coloured bodie
of the glorified child of God shall thus

                     <hi>who shall

and hazards which do manie

or hazard, all these first things which
here do trouble men being ended. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with that excellent stole of wonderfull
<hi>Agilitie,</hi> for then our lumpish bodies shall
be freed of that heauinesse which now
doth clogge them, and make vs, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great difficultie and paine, we cannot
go from place to place: yea, that without
some outward helpe we cannot vpon a
sudden transport our selues, where we
would fainest be. For now the spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go but where the bodie goeth (the
bodie being a burthen to it) but then the
spirit being made the full maister of the
bodie, shall command it to go without
any trouble wheresoeuer it would haue it
to go. And therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> could say:
<hi>Tanta erit tunc corporis agilitas, vt vbi volet
spiritus ibi protinus erit &amp; corpus. Then the
child of God being in heauen, the agilitie and
nimblenesse of the bodie shall be so great, that
where euer the spirit would be, there the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
shall be also incontinent.</hi> Now thou must
no wayes doubt of this, ô my soule, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
as thou hast heard that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:21098:295"/>
in heauen shall be conforme to the
bodie of our blessed Sauiour, and so as
Christs bodie after his resurrection was
adorned with such agilitie, that in a most
short space it could be seene in diuerse
places, now at Ierusalem, now out of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
comming to his disciples vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
&amp; vpon a suddaine departing from
them,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 19. 26.</note> as <hi>Iohn</hi> witnesseth: our glorified
bodies shall euen in this be like vnto his.
Yea, what shall I say, shall the bodie of the
Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 31.</note> and of <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon,
soiourning beneath here, be transported
vpon a suddaine from place to place by
the Lord our God:<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 12. 46.</note> and shall we doubt
that our bodies being glorified, and made
like to the bodie of Christ shall be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to them in this point?<note place="margin">Acts 8. 9.</note> And ô how
farre shall this augment the ioy of the
glorified Saints, while we liue here: ô
how often do we desire to be with those
who be dearest to vs, and of whom we
are specially loued? yea, is it not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of speciall griefe euen to the dearest
Saints of God, that knowing themselues
to haue deere brethren and sisters, some in
that same kingdome with them, others in
diuerse kingdomes farre remoued from

them, lying vnder sharpe crosses and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
afflictions whom they are not able,
notwithstanding of this, to visite, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
the sweet honie of consolation to
them, being hindered through distance of

soone shall we find our selues, not onely
in minde but in bodie also present with
such we do loue, and who do loue vs.
Then <hi>Dauid</hi> shall haue no cause to crie

so that where now the bodie of Gods

or from all feare of any paine or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
whatsoeuer. This is that whereof
the Spirit would assure thee, when he
saith:<note place="margin">Reuel. 21. 4. 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold the tabernacle of God is with

shall be his people, and God himselfe shall be

all teares from their eyes, and there shall be no
more death, neither sorrow, neither crying,
neither shall there be any more paine, for the

words are faithfull and true.</hi> Yea, in this

shalt be loued by him, as thou shalt loue
them: for whosoeuer shall be there, and
all those who shall be there, shall be one

spouse to blessed Iesus; and therefore the
will of one shall be the will of all: yea,
which is more, ô my soule, there the will
of God shall not differ from thy will, nor

while thou shalt soiourne beneath here,
there shall alwayes remaine most grosse,

and shalt thou being aduanced to a higher

tell thee, ô my soule, that this is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
of this Inne of heauen, that none

they do resemble him by whom they be

and who doth assure vs of them, and so be
no wayes subiect to decay, but do last for

that thou vse the world circumspectly, as

<pb n="582" facs="tcp:21098:304"/>
King, which carries this <hi>Motto</hi> vpon his

I must be a king, for this Inne is for no
men but those who be kings, is for no
women but those who be Queenes, and
so who be true Christians. But what sort
of Kings and Queenes be these, ô my
soule, who shall rest within this Inne?
men &amp; women made kings and Queenes,
not by God the Creator of the world, but
by God that sole Redeemer of mankinde,
and so by Iesus Christ who hath loued
them, and washeth them from their sinnes
in his bloud, and made them kings and
Queenes vnto God,<note place="margin">Reuel. 1. 5, 6.</note> euen his Father. And
so I see, ô my soule, that there shall not so
much as one man, as one woman be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
within the doores of this Inne of
heauen, but he who is a Christian, but she
who is a Christian, and that not so much
as one true Christian shall be debarred
from it. Thou art a king, but not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and therefore thou must stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
&amp; haue thy portion in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone. Thou art
a Queene, but not a Christian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou must stay without also, to be
tormented with thy king. Thou art a
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:21098:304"/>
countrie clowne, and yet a Christian,
and therefore thou must not stay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
because thou art a clowne but must
go in because thou art a true Christian.
But because in these our dayes there be
such a world of men and women called
Christians, and holding themselues for
good Christians; I would haue thee, ô my
soule, to trie who if these be Kings and
Queenes made by Christ, &amp; so fit ghuests
for this Inne of heauen? Hearken vnto
me speaking with a warrant of Gods
word. None can be such Kings and
Queenes, but those who can be seruants,
and will be seruants; who cannot be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
nor will be seruants; who can be
seruants, and will be seruants to him, who
being the Lord of all, was heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to become a seruant for them; and
so to that blessed and sweete Lord Iesus:
who cannot, nor will not vpon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be seruants to any besides his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.
Can the true Christian forget
that ransome wherewith he was redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and can he thinking on it be a
seruant either to diuels or to men? No
no, for he can neuer forget that of <hi>Paul.
Ye are bought with a price, be not the seruants
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:21098:305"/>
men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye were once darknesse, but now are

                     <hi>walke as the children of
light.</hi> And thus the true Christian sees all
these whom he sees in Christ, and cannot
possibly see any out of him; he can ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and serue his king, his parents, his
neighbours, alwayes in Christ, and for
Christ but no wayes against Christ. And
therefore he can mocke all honour, but
that wherewith Christ is honoured; all
pleasures, but those wherewith Christ is
pleased; and all wealth, whereby his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
treasure is lessened, yea not aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
and all life, but that life whereby
his life Iesus Christ is conquised, and
conserued by him: yea, he doth not onely
misknow, but denie all friends and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
but those who in Christ be neare
vnto him: in this resembling his blessed
Maister who did all that he did for him;
who suffered all that which he suffered
for him; holding none for his mother, his
brother,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 50.</note> and sister, but those who do his
Fathers will which is in heauen: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
all such who did this his will,
for his mother, brother, and sister. Could
this be considered, ô what a shame should
couer the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christians of this age!
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:21098:305"/>
ô what a feare should possesse the hearts
of the Christians of this age! O man thou
wilt be a Christian, but not a king ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
the diuell? Thou wilt be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
yet not a king maistering this wicked
world, either alluring thee to euill by
faire offers, or drawing thee from God,
driuing thee to euill by threatnings, and
punishments, but maistered by it? and that
most willingly not eschuing sinne which
thy Sauiour came to slay, but delighting
in sinne which put thy Sauiour to death.

verie sauage Barbarions, by the report
made vnto them touching the Christians,
layed aside their barbaritie, and fiercenes,

content himselfe with the honour he hath
gotten, and ceasse to aspire vnto a greater?
what curious man can satisfie his eye with
seeing, or his eare with hearing? Yea,
what couetous man is heard saying, <hi>I haue

shall be condemned of <hi>Iacob</hi> in that day

that he had rather loose all the rest,

and proue onely curious about the

that they had rather want Christ, and part

vnprofitable chance to forsake all things for
him, who is aboue all things, for with him
all things are giuen also, and so soone as thou
apprehendest him, he himselfe alone shall be all
things, to all those who for him hath left all
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:21098:308"/>
things; yea, euen all things I say truly, not
onely of possession which a man can haue, but
of desire which a man can wish.</hi> Thou seest
then, ô my soule, that thou must seeke thy
God in this wildernesse of thy pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
if thou wouldst be found of him in
that wished Inne of his glorie; that thou
must serue him abroad as it were amongst
strangers, yea, amongst sworne enemies,
if thou wouldst reigne with him at home
with his owne onely deare children thy
friends. But here I will haue thee grauely
to consider two things. First how shouldst
thou serue thy God here? Secondly,
wherefore shouldst thou serue him thus?
Thou must serue him, ô my soule, frankly,
and with ioy: and so neither from a grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
heart, nor with an auerse or froward
countenance. Thou hast, I thinke, long
ago acquainted thy selfe with the third
petition of the Lords Prayer, <hi>Thy will be
done in earth euen as it is in heauen:</hi> Hereby
first confessing that thy God should be
serued by thee here on earth, as he is by
those celestiall spirits in heauen. Secondly,
earnestly begging grace from his hands
that thou mayst serue him so. Now couldst
thou, ô my soule, learne to consider, and
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:21098:309"/>
considering to take to heart three things,
ô how carefull wouldst thou be that thy
God were alwayes serued by thee here on
earth, faithfully, freely, heartily, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
as he is by his Angels in heauen?
First, couldst thou remember how these
three sacred persons of that glorious
Godhead concurred to make man, saying:
<hi>Let vs make man to our owne Image?</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
couldst thou remember how
heartily and gladly, that sweete meeke
Lambe of God Iesus, offered himselfe to
the death for thee, ô how heartily wouldst
thou seek thy God, ô how gladly wouldst
thou serue him? He is without Ierusalem,
and if it had pleased him he might haue
stayed without it: alwayes saith he not
vnto his disciples:<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>I must go vnto Ierusalem
and suffer many things of the Elders, and of
the high Priests and Scribes, and be slaine.
And when Peter tooke him aside, and began
to rebuke him saying: Maister pitie thy selfe,
this shall not be vnto thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers 22.</note> Turneth not bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Iesus backe this saying vnto <hi>Peter: Get
thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, because thou vnder stands not the things
which are of God, but the things which are of
men.</hi> Telling vs by these two things: first,
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:21098:309"/>
that he knew very well what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
him at Ierusalem: Secondly, that he
went vp most willingly thither, to the
end that he might suffer these things
there. Hast thou not, ô my soule, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the 15. and 16. verses of the 22. of
<hi>Luke? Then he said vnto them, I haue ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desired to eate this Passc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uer with you
before I suffer, for I say vnto you hence forth
I will not eate of it any more, vntill it be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in the kingdome of God.</hi> Telling his
disciples hereby, that albeit he had eaten
some Passeouers before that time with
them, yet he neuer longed to eate any of
those as he longed to eate this immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
going before his suffering, so ready and
willing was he to suffer. Hast thou lent
thy eares to that prayer made by thy Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
vnto his Father? <hi>Father saue me from
this houre,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>but therefore came I into this
houre.</hi> Yea, to close this point, pained it
thee euer to reade and to weigh that
conference (with those things fell out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it) thy blessed Sauiour hath with those
who came to take him, registred by <hi>Iohn,</hi>
in the 4. 5. 6. 7. and 8. verses of his 18.
Chapter? yea, canst thou with this thinke
vpon that speech spoken by this Iesus thy
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:21098:310"/>
sweetest Shepheard: <hi>I lay downe my life
that I might take it againe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 17. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>No man taketh
it from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe.</hi>
Shouldst thou not then seeke this Iesus,
serue, this Iesus, both of purpose and with
pleasure, who of purpose and with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
came to seeke and to serue thee?
Thirdly, couldst thou consider, ô my
soule, how frankly and willingly wicked
men do serue the diuell, wouldst thou not
be ashamed, yea afraid, if thou finde not
thy selfe seruing thy blessed maker and
sweet Redeemer, as frankly and willingly,
as these do serue that euill one? Hath any
wicked man receiued that, from that euill
one, which thou, ô my soule, hast receiued
from thy good God? Hath that euill one
done or suffered that for any wicked man,
which thy God hath done and suffered
for thee? yea can any wicked man expect
that from the hands of that euill one,
which thou, ô my soule, mayst expect and
must expect from the hands of thy God?
The sense hereof moued <hi>Chrisostome</hi> to
say: <hi>Turpe est impios diabolo tam strenuò ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uire;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysost.</note>
                     <hi>Christianos Christo, pro pretio redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis
nihil respondere, It is a shame that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men should so diligently and carefully
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:21098:310"/>
serue the diuell, and that Christians should
recompence Christ with no good seruice, for
the price of their redemption.</hi> Fourthly,
couldst thou remember, ô my soule, how
willingly, how ioyfully, thou seruedst thy
owne lustes before thy conuersion, and so
before thy God called thee from that
damnable darknesse of ignorance, of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,
and of impietie (vnder the which
thou layest being in the first <hi>Adam)</hi> vnto
this marueilous light of knowledge, of
faith, and of begunne holinesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thou art now happily adorned, being
in that second <hi>Adam;</hi> wouldst thou not be
ashamed not to serue thy good holy God
after thy conuersion, as willingly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
as before thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion thou seruedst
thy wicked and vile flesh? O would to
God that euery man had that grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vpon him, wherewith <hi>Paul</hi> was
happily inriched before his conuersion,
when he knew not Iesus, he ranne on foot
and horse in euery place where he came
like a furious lyon presenting those who
called vpon his name. But after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
I thinke he was as forward to
preach Iesus for the conuersion and sauing
of Christians; as he was furions before his
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:21098:311"/>
conuersion to persecute them for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his name. <hi>Bernard</hi> thinking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

thee to runne more negligently after life, then
thou walkedst before after death, to seeke the
increase of saluation with lesse care then thou
soughtst before the augmentation of thy owne
perdition. Bernard</hi> againe out of the sense
of this doth crie sweetly and chearfully:

bodie, but vpon our affections, but vpon our
desires, but vpon our sighes and sobs, because
not onely the Angels, but the great maker of
the Angels expects and awaites for vs. God
the Father expects and waites for vs, as for
his sonnes and heires, to the end he may make
vs maisters of all his goods. The Sonne of God
awaites for vs, as for his brethren and heires
annexed with him, to the end that he may
offer and present vnto God his Father the
fruite of his natiuitie, and the price of his
bloud. The holy Spirit awaites for vs, as
for his temple in the which he dwelleth here.</hi>
O when shall the loose Christians of this
our time take that to heart which <hi>Bernard</hi>
wrote long ago for the wakening of slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Christians, and for the punishing of
such toward that Inne of heauen, who
looking for it step neuer a foote forward
to the end that they may obtaine it? <hi>Qui

He who profits not in the schoole of

but specially seeing we are there, where
nothing remaineth in that same estate: and
where if men profit not by going forward,
they must receiue hurt by falling backward.
Let no man therefore say, it is enough I will
abide as I am; he who is such an one sits still in
the way, and stayes, without any motion on that
ladder, where that Patriarch saw none but
such, who was either going vp or going downe.</hi>
Let me be carefull therefore, ô my soule,

but which he hath absolutely kept in his

to their rest, so they take them vp in the
morning, and taking them vp they go
forth againe, either to their wonted or to
some new labour. But I must tell thee, ô
my soule, to thy great comfort, that thou
shalt take vp this tabernacle of my bodie,
in that shining morning of Iudgement,
in a farre more excellent estate then it
was layed downe in the chamber of the
graue.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 42. 43. 44.</note> It was layed downe in corruption,
it shall be taken vp in incorruption: It
was layed downe in dishonour, it shall be
taken vp in glorie: It was layed downe
in weakenesse, it shall be taken vp in
power: It was layed downe naturall, it
shall be taken vp spirituall. Could this be
well considered, ô my soule, would I
cease while I liue here, to employ all the
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:21098:314"/>
members of my bodie holily, and when
death should approach me, would I not
be heartily contented with ioy to lay
downe this earthly tabernacle? Againe I
will assure thee, ô my soule, (because so
hath my Lord, and Maister Iesus, by the
sweetest words of his owne sweetest lips
assured me) that thou hauing in that day
of Iudgement taken vp, and put on that
garment of this bodie, shalt neuer go
forth to any old, or new labours againe;
but shalt alwayes rest in endlesse rest for
euermore, free of all suspition of future
griefes, and filled with a verie sea of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
glorie; for in that day thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happily presented a chast virgine,
well decked and trimmed with the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thy glorious husband Iesus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy glorious husband Iesus, shalt
haue that marriage now contracted with
him, solemnized and perfectly consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated;
and then thy blessed husband ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
wiped away all teares from thine
eyes, shall take thee into his most secret
cabinate of glorie,<note place="margin">2. Cor 11. 2.</note> there not onely to see
but to possesse for euer, that glorie which
he possessed before the world was made.
Could this be well weighed by thee, ô my
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:21098:314"/>
soule,<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 1.</note> wouldst thou not crie with <hi>Dauid?
As the Hart brayeth for the riuers of waters
so panteth my soule for thee ô God. My soule
thirsteth for God, euen for the liuing God;
when shall I come and appeare before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God?</hi> yea, wouldst thou not crie
with <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>O wretched man that I am who
shall deliuer me from this bodie of death, I
desire to be loosed and to be with Christ, which
is the best of all.</hi> Yea, wouldst thou not crie
with <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August. sol.</note> 
                        <hi>Eia Domine, moriar vt te
videam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>videam te vt hic moriar; nolo viuere,
volo mori, dissolui cupio &amp; esse cum Christo,
mori desidero vt videam Christum. Viuere
renuo vt viuam cum Christo. God my sweet
Lord, Let me die to the end I may see thee;
let me see thee, to the end I may die here. I
will not liue, I will die here, I desire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
and to be with Christ. I desire to die to
the end that I may see Christ, I refuse to liue,
to the end that I may liue with Christ.</hi> And
to conclude, ô my soule, (praying my
God to blesse thee with the longing and
earnest desire of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine)</hi>
wouldest thou not crie vnces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
with the Church, Christs bride,
Come Lord Iesus: Euen so,
come quickly. Amen,</p>
