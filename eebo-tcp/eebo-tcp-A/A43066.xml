            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough I know the ſurprize of this place (as 'tis termed at <hi>Wallingford Houſe</hi> that take all for their own) was no novel to you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twas needleſs to have given you a bare relation of it, yet now ſince the laet proceedings of the Army have miniſtred an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of writing, I will give you a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47787:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->
of the condition of our affairs here, and our thoughts of the tranſactions there with you, in purſuance of thoſe reſolutions that were taken up by the Parliament preſently upon the late force, after ſome intelligence with the Governour here, we were aſſured of his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Parliament, and that the Town was at our Devotion.</p>
            <p>We entred here on <hi>Saturday</hi> the third of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> inſtant, at four of the Clock, my Self and my Son Colonel <hi>Morley</hi> and Colonel <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> with divers other Gentlemen, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were neighbouring inhabitants to this place, preſently after came in the Governour Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Whetham,</hi> who had been abroad that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and came to us to the Lyon Inne, where we quartered that night, and very honourably treated us (and indeed he is a very Noble true ſpirited Engliſhman) after a ſhort conference with him, he declared that he would ſecure the Town and Garriſon for the uſe of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and in order thereunto we did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeize ſome diſſatisfied Officers (whoſe names I ſuppoſe you have had.) The next morning the Magiſtrats of the Town came to complement us and bid us welcom, to whom we declared, that we intended not to levy or raiſe any War in the Nation, thereby to open a breach for the Common Enemy to enter, being more concerned againſt him, then to

afford him ſuch advantage, but that the Treaty being on foot betwixt the Army and General <hi>Monck</hi> the Commander in Chief of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments forces in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the gaining of this place might be a means to facilitate it, and ballance the affair, and that we hoped it would produce a right underſtanding and unity ſo much deſired by all goodmen; they anſwered us they would afford us all the aſſiſtance they could, and would ſtand by us in theſe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
            <p>We expected ſome additional Forces out of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and the neighbouring Counties, but you here what is become of them, however we doubt not of ſuccor and ſupply, if they ſhall offer to attempt us. We hear Coronel <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> is deſigned againſt this place, your Major <hi>Cadwel</hi> troubles us very little, we ſcarce know where he is.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday we had notice of a Proclamation for iſſuing out Summons for a Parliament to ſit down the twenty fourth day of <hi>January:</hi> 'Tis a meer deluſion to amuſe the people now the Scotch Army is advancing, and ſignifies nothing: Beſides their fundamentals, as they call them, interpret what a kind of Parliament it ſhall be; theſe are like that Engine the Scrue which inſtead of ſetling wil violently force &amp; raiſe the very being of Government from its proper Baſis, and remove and ſet it where

their fancy beſt likes them, nor will the Army abide long by this very form, but as the ſucceſſe and event of their affairs ſhall be, ſo will they be freed from, or obliged to theſe their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>We ſee now the ſword muſt decide the matter, and therefore by all plauſible waies they would wind themſelves into a better O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion then to be counted arbitrary and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons. We heard of ſome late Tumults at <hi>London,</hi> but the relation ſo imperfect, that we could wiſh you would correſpond with us in ſome private Character, ſince all waies are laid to prevent Intelligence. I can aſſure you from hence, that nothing will be done by Treaty at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> without a preliminary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of reſtoring the Parliament to a Free Seſſion without any other condition. This place is ſo well Fortified and provided, that we ſhall be able to preſerve it againſt all the Forces and more then they can make; nor do we fear any plots or conſpiracies to betray it. We are all well and in health, and I praiſe God unanimous, and the Towneſmen very cheerful and reſolute to go through with us and to bear part of the Duty, hoping by their cordial concurrence with us to encourage the reſt of the conſiderable places of the Nation to doe the like.</p>
            <p>For our own parts we are reſolved to aſſert
