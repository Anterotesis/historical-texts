            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Answerer of the <hi>Appeal</hi> were his Politicks as strong as his Passions, I should think him a Jesuit; but they are so far from being so, that I should disgrace that Order, if I should imagine him to be one of them: He is only an outragious and over-ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Papist, and differs from a Jesuit as a Wasp does from a Hornet, much of the same nature, but not so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; he would pass for a Member of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (I mean) as far as relates to the Crown and Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, but furiously rails in effect at the Protestants. But (thanks be to God) things are not yet come to that pass, as that he dares do it under that Name; therefore he terms them <hi>Presbyterians, Fanaticks, Schismaticks, Rebels,</hi> &amp;c. and then belyes them freely. Mark through this whole Treatise, and you shall find his main design is to shift away the real Popish Plot, which the Justice of our Laws have already found out, and instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would substitute to the Executioner innocent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants; much like the wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> who to save the Murderer <hi>Barrabas</hi> from publick Justice, did substitute, and by false witness condemn Jesus Christ. But not to trouble you with a separate Confutation of his whole Discourse, wherein he may pretend false Quotation, I will only annex to his own Text some marginal Notes, and leave them to the Reader's use, like Salt upon the brims of the Dish.</p>

            <head>THE ANSWER to the APPEAL, EXPOUNDED.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Appeal</hi> has made a mighty noise about the Town; and yet, Heaven knows, there is neither <hi>Good Faith</hi> in it, nor <hi>Argument:</hi> But all things mis-apply'd, or mis-reported, to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Government, and to inflame the Multitude. The pretended Reasonings of it are no more than <hi>fallacies</hi> and <hi>non-sequiturs,</hi> from the beginning to the end; and yet it serves in a <hi>Coffee-house</hi> for a<note n="(a)" place="margin">So that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Honest Men are Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, or all Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniers Honest Men: which makes him joyn them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> 
               <hi>Test</hi> of <hi>Honest Men</hi> and <hi>Mutiniers.</hi> Taking it barely in it self, it is scarce worth an Answer: But in the circumstances of the <hi>Boldness</hi> and the <hi>Malice,</hi> it is but reasonable to bestow such a Reply upon it, as may give it a Recommendation to publique Justice; Especially<note n="(b)" place="margin">Here he shews himself to be an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</note> having already taken notice of it by the By, in another place.</p>
            <p>It is a wonderful thing, the Confidence of this Audacious Pamphlet, in Addressing it self to the <hi>City,</hi> after so Fresh, so Loyal, and so Generous an instance of their scorn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of any thing that looks like a seditious practice.<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Wat Tyler</hi>'s endeavour was to destroy the Kings Life and Government, and plunder the City: whereas the <hi>Appeal</hi> desires to save King, City and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or at least to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their sufferings.</note> Why should a <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> expect better Quarter from a <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> under <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> than he had from a <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> under <hi>Richard the Second?</hi> Nay, that very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of<note n="(d)" place="margin">This year of 41. is indeed very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Massacre of 250000 poor <hi>Irish</hi> Protestants, by the Papists.</note>

upon the <hi>City.</hi> Beside, that it is as much their <hi>Interest</hi> as their <hi>Duty,</hi> and as much their <hi>Inclination</hi> as <hi>either,</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Government.</hi>
               <note n="(f)" place="margin">Herein I must agree with him, that the City lost many things by the last Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War; for they lost the Star-Chamber, High-Commission-Court, Knights-Service, Court of Wards, Privy-Seals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> For by a <hi>War</hi> they must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity suffer doubly: And not only in the loss or abatement of their Trade, but in the deep proportion of their Taxes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the publique Charge. So that these are not a sort of people to be <hi>Wheedled</hi> out of their <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Allegiance.</hi> But we shall now take a view of the <hi>Pamphlet it self.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>There is no doubt of the danger of the <hi>Papists</hi>; but still while the Government has <hi>One Enemy</hi> in <hi>Front,</hi> it is good to secure the <hi>Flank</hi> and <hi>Rear,</hi> from another: So that the <hi>Cities</hi> only safety lies in the <hi>mean,</hi> betwixt the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of <hi>Popery,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> hand, and <hi>Libertinism</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi> The <hi>Former</hi> (he says) <hi>can never be effected,</hi> but by a Popish Successor, or the French Arms.

                  <hi>I must acknowledge</hi> (says he in the next clause) <hi>that there is some Coherence between the</hi> Beginning <hi>of the Late Civil Wars, and this our present Age: For as well</hi> then <hi>as</hi> now, <hi>the</hi> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Papists, <hi>and</hi> French Faction <hi>were the</hi> chief, <hi>nay the</hi> only Incendiaries, <hi>which set us all in flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>French Cardinal</hi> did Artificially improve the Turbulent Humour of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish Schismaticks,</hi> to the advancing of the Interest of <hi>France,</hi> and to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyling</hi> of <hi>these Kingdoms,</hi> I make no question: But to call them the<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>Only Incendiaries,</hi> is to give the Lye to the constant current of <hi>History,</hi> and the known <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> even within our own remembrance. How were the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> and <hi>French Factions</hi> concern'd in the <hi>Scottish Uproar</hi> of 1637. and a hundred Sacrilegious Tumults, after that,

               </p>
               <p>He tells us further, <hi>that the</hi> Catholique Cause, <hi>like the</hi> Chesnut <hi>in the</hi> Fable, <hi>hath ever since Q.</hi> Marys <hi>days been in the</hi> Fire: <hi>and that both</hi> then, <hi>and</hi> now, <hi>the</hi> Papists <hi>make use of the</hi> Episcopal, <hi>and</hi> Court-parties claw, <hi>to take it out; the</hi> First <hi>of these, they allure to their assistance, by the Fright of</hi> Presbytery; <hi>the</hi> Latter <hi>by the apprehension of a</hi> Republique, <hi>tho'</hi> nothing is less Designed, <hi>or</hi> more Improbable.</p>

               <p>Now to support, and fortifie himself in his Opinion; he says farther, <hi>that not only Dr.</hi> Oates <hi>mentions this-in his</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>but that the</hi> Papists themselves <hi>were so well assured of the</hi> Scotch Rising, <hi>before it happen'd, that at the</hi> Disbanding <hi>of this late</hi> Popish Army, <hi>many of the Officers and Souldiers had secret Orders not to sell their Horses, but to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for that they should have occasion to use them again within a</hi> Fortnight, and so it happen'd; <hi>for within a</hi> Fortnight <hi>after the</hi> Disbanding, <hi>the</hi> Rebellion <hi>brake out in</hi> Scotland: <hi>So well acquainted were the Authors of this Mischief, with the time when it would happen:</hi>

                  <hi>Popish Army</hi>; and implies, that these <hi>Orders</hi> were given to <hi>Popish Officers,</hi> which <hi>Officers</hi> either <hi>went</hi> upon the service or <hi>not:</hi> If they <hi>went,</hi> they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw their own design; for he makes it the <hi>Papists Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> to entertain those <hi>Tumults,</hi> and these Gentlemen made it their business to <hi>suppress</hi> them. If they did <hi>not</hi> go, their Orders were to no purpose. But why does the <hi>Appellant</hi> call it a <hi>Popish Army?</hi> He should do well to wash his Mouth, after so foul and scandalous an expression.</p>
               <p>But now let us change hands; and see if it be not more probable that the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> knew <hi>before-hand</hi> of <hi>that Rising,</hi> then the <hi>Papists.</hi> For though we had at that time greater apprehensions of the <hi>French</hi> then ever,<note n="a" place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chiefly desired their disbanding: so as he accuses them for being privy to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Insurrection.</note> yet the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of some people were so violent for the immediate disbanding of the Army, that it lookt like a design to <hi>remove that Block</hi> out of the <hi>Scots way.</hi> The next passage is a little mysterious.</p>
               <p>He says, <hi>that it was likely the</hi> Scots <hi>would be beaten by the Kings Forces, that</hi> (says he) <hi>it might make both</hi> Them <hi>and</hi> Us <hi>less apt to</hi> Rise <hi>upon any account whatsoever,</hi> So that here is a<note n="b" place="margin">This <hi>tacit Confession</hi> is as improper an expression, as exposition.</note> tacit Confession, that the <hi>Appellant</hi> found some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in this <hi>discouragement</hi> to a <hi>joynt Rebellion:</hi> And so he goes on, saying, that <hi>if this had been a Fanatical Plot,</hi> the <hi>same Party would certainly have risen in</hi> England <hi>at the</hi> same time.

               <p>The Second Motive (he says Fol. 5.) which may incline a Prince to disbelieve the Report of a Plot, is, <hi>from his Own</hi> Good Nature, <hi>and</hi> Clemency; <hi>which makes him not believe any ill of those to whom he has been so kind.</hi> But this is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious way of arguing.</p>

in the History and Doctrine of <hi>Massacres,</hi> and <hi>Regicides,</hi> then to question the Malice of the <hi>Jesuitical Positions,</hi> or the credibility of the <hi>Plot</hi> here in Debate: and so we shall yield him in the Hellish <hi>Tenet,</hi> which he insists upon, of Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing KINGS, and a Hellish <hi>Tenet</hi> it is indeed; and as Hellish undoubtedly in a <hi>Schismatique,</hi> as in a <hi>Jesuit.</hi> For his Quarrel otherwise is to the <hi>Faction,</hi> not to the <hi>Maxim,</hi> which is equally Dangerous and detestable in all <hi>Factions.</hi> Now wheresoever we find the same <hi>Principles,</hi> we have the <hi>Appellants</hi> leave honestly to suspect the same <hi>Designs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was not this the Doctrine of the <hi>Fanatiques</hi> from <hi>Forty,</hi> to <hi>Sixty?</hi> And did they not make good their Doctrine by their Practise? Did they not declare the <hi>King</hi> Accountable to the <hi>People?</hi> And did they not put him to Death, upon that Foundation?

                  <hi>We propound</hi> (say the <hi>Remonstrants) that the Person of the King may be speedily brought to Justice, for the Treason, Bloud and Mischief he is Guilty of.

The Government of</hi> England (says a Fourth) <hi>is a</hi> Mixt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, <hi>and</hi> Govern'd <hi>by the</hi> Major Part <hi>of the</hi> Three Estates <hi>assembled in</hi> Parliament. <hi>Whensoever a King</hi> (says a Fifth) <hi>or other Superior Authority, Creates an Inferior, they invest it with a Legitimacy of Magistratical Power, to punish themselves also, in case they prove Evil Doers. It is Lawful</hi> (says a Sixth) <hi>for any, who have the Power, to call to account a Tyrant or wicked King; and after due Conviction, to Depose and put him to Death, if the Ordinary Magistrate have deny'd to do it.

               </p>
               <p>In his following way of Reasoning; under the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of proving it to be the <hi>Papists Interest</hi> to <hi>Murther</hi> the King, he does all he can in the world, by a side-wind, to possess them with the Necessity of doing it; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to <hi>force</hi> them upon it: Only, as good luck is, the Arguments will not bear that stress.

                  <hi>First,</hi> that the Libell is already, by several Impressions of it, made as Publique as a <hi>News-Book.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that his Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are erected upon a false Bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon which two Considerations, we shall presume to insert only two Periods of his, upon this Subject.</p>
               <q>Their Interest (<hi>says he</hi>) does unavoidably excite them to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Sacred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ajesty; For First, they know he cannot long subsist without a Considerable Sum of Money, which he must Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive either from the Party, or from the Parliament: Now for them to supply him with so vast a Sum, is a Charge, that (you may well imagine) they would desire to get rid of it, if they could, tho by the Kings Death. On the other side, for the Parliament to supply him with money, that, they know, cannot be done but by taking off the Heads of their Faction; excluding their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and consenting to such Laws as must of Necessity ruine them: Besides, his Majesty hath already permitted the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting so many of their Party, as they never can or will forgive it.</q>
               <p>It falls out Happily that the <hi>force</hi> of his Argument does not come up to the <hi>Drift</hi> of it. But the <hi>Weakness</hi> of the One, takes off the <hi>Edge</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66370:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but by the Murther of the King. The One half of this spoken in a Corner to a Knot of <hi>Priests</hi> and Jesuits, and fairly prov'd upon a man, would be as much as his Head's worth. And is the Crime ever the Lesse for doing the same thing in Publique, where the Provocation is stronger? These Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are not to pass for <hi>Simple Declarations</hi> of a mans <hi>Opinion</hi>; but Artificial <hi>Encouragements</hi> rather, and <hi>Advises,</hi> toward the <hi>doing</hi> of the thing; especially coming from the Pen of a Person that calls himself<note n="h" place="margin">Why might not the Author of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> like some of the Popes, take a Name upon him contrary to his Nature.</note>

               </p>
               <p>His First Argument runs thus. The King wants money; and there's none to be got, but either of the <hi>Papists,</hi> or of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>Parliament,</hi> he says, will give his Majesty none; and therefore the <hi>Papists</hi> will Murther him to save Charges. This is a Policy far fetch'd: The <hi>Fathers</hi> Head (we know) was set at a Price, but we hope better of the <hi>Sons:</hi> Now in his prejudging the <hi>Parliament,</hi> upon an Assumption that the King gets not a penny of Mony of them, but upon such and such Terms;<note n="i" place="margin">You are well acquainted sure with the Author, to know his thoughts.</note> he does not so much speak his <hi>thought,</hi> as vent his <hi>Proposition</hi>; rather <hi>Desireing,</hi> then <hi>Foreseeing</hi> that the <hi>Houss of Commons</hi> will hold the King to such unhappy Conditions. And then he finishes his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation with this Conclusion, that the <hi>Papists</hi> will never forgive his Majesty, for what he has done already. Wherein, <hi>First,</hi> he Contradicts himself, in supposing the King an <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>my</hi> to the <hi>Papists,</hi> whom he has hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated to be their <hi>Friend.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> instead of proving the <hi>Papists</hi> Design against the King in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he advances One of his <hi>Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if he would have come roundly up to the Point of the <hi>Papists</hi> Interest, he should have told us of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Dignities and Preferments that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has confer'd upon their <hi>Emissaries</hi> into his Majesties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: And he should have expounded it to the people, what pains they take, and what Hazards they run, only in the playing of their Own Game, and making way to their advantages in Reversion. This is so great a truth, that most of the serious Catholiques themselves reflect fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly upon these <hi>Busie</hi> People, as the common <hi>troublers</hi>

of the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Christendom:</hi> But then I should have oppos'd an Interest also on the <hi>Fanatiques</hi> side, to ballance this. For they have their Reversionall prospects too: their <hi>sequester'd Livings</hi> and <hi>Estates</hi>; their <hi>plunder'd goods,</hi> their <hi>profitable Offices</hi> and <hi>Commissions, Crown</hi> and <hi>Church Lands,</hi> &amp;c. And they wait for their day again as impatiently as the <hi>Jews</hi> do for their <hi>Messias.</hi> Nay to keep their title still a foot, they stand fast to their Old <hi>Covenant</hi> still,<note n="k" place="margin">I hope he doth not esteem all that are for <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> to be Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> as the <hi>Fanatiques Magna Charta</hi>; by which they pretend to make out a <hi>Religious claim</hi> to all the advantages they got by sacriledge and oppression. So that their <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>interests</hi> lying indifferently against the <hi>Establisht Order</hi> both of Church and State; there will be no need of casting either faults upon the other.</p>
               <p>After a worse then Astrological Determination upon the Kings Fate; he bestows another Cast of his Cunning upon the City and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">I think sad experience hath already justified this hint, which he calls malicious, as if he thought himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in Firing; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples would let him.</note> which (he says) is in danger to be consum'd by <hi>Fire.</hi> It is a lewd and a seditious Hint, in both these Cases, the putting of it into the head, as it is much in the power of any profligate and desperate villain, to verify his calculation. Besides that in telling the Citizens what they are to expect, he does at the same time, Counsell the Papists what to do. They will burn <hi>London</hi>; (he says) <hi>First, as the only United force, able to withstand Arbitrary Government, and without that, Popery can never prevail,</hi>

               <p>If <hi>Popery</hi> cannot come in without <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> if the <hi>Iesuits</hi> design the <hi>burning</hi> of <hi>London, as the only United force that can withstand that power:</hi> either there is no fear of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> and (consequently) of such a design taking place in <hi>this King's Reign</hi>; or the whole calumny falls directly upon his <hi>Majesty himself:</hi> or otherwise, if the <hi>Appellants</hi> prospect looks forward into the future, what's the meaning of all these <hi>Alarms,</hi> so unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably, to trouble our present peace with the sickly Visions of things to come?

               <q>Secondly, He says that <hi>London</hi> is the only place where by reason of their Excellent Preaching and daily instruction in the Protestant Religion, the people have a lively sense thereof, and doubtless will not part with it, to pleasure a Prince; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps rather lose their <hi>Lives</hi> by the Sword in the <hi>Wars,</hi> than by <hi>Faggots,</hi> in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>

               <p>The passage now is plain <hi>English</hi>; and as many indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the Government, crouded into one sentence, as could well be brought together. Here is <hi>First,</hi> an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a <hi>Rebellion.</hi> For the Prince here in question, against whom the sword is to be drawn, can be no other, upon his supposition,<note n="n" place="margin">The Sword is in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> no where bid to be drawn but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Popish Successor, and that too when the King is murdered. So that at the worst it is but Treason by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, which is not mention'd in our Law.</note> than actually the <hi>King.</hi> And let him take his choice now whether it shall be intended of his <hi>present Majesty,</hi> or of his <hi>Successour.</hi> It is a <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> that <hi>now is,</hi> in the <hi>one Case,</hi> and against the <hi>Next King</hi> in the other: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not only a <hi>simple Rebellion,</hi> but (to the scandal of the Reformation, and particularly of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) a <hi>Rebellion</hi> founded upon the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion: Thirdly,</hi> It is no other then (as he himself has worded it) the <hi>Hellish Tenet</hi> of <hi>Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings,</hi> in a <hi>disguise:</hi> only a <hi>Jesuitical Principle</hi> in <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade.</hi> It is, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> a Condemnation of the practices and submissions of the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> and the whole story of our <hi>Protestant Martyrology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He says, <hi>Thirdly, that the City is too powerful for any Prince that Governs not by the love of his people, which no Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour can expect to do.</hi> This is the very Translation of his Name-sake, <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> in his <hi>Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos. If the Prince fails in his promise</hi> (says he) <hi>the people are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from their obedience. The contract is made void, and the right of obligation is of no force. It is therefore permitted to the Officers of a Kingdom, either all, or some good number of them, to suppress a Tyrant.</hi> Here's a great deal of virulence in his Discourse, without one word of weight, to countenance it. For the well-being of this City is so essentially requisite to the well-being of this Kingdom, that the very charge of the Government is not to be defray'd without it. So that

it is the interest of all Governours to cherish, and support it. Here he trifles away some half a score lines more about the <hi>Fire</hi>; and then, from the danger of the <hi>City,</hi> advances to the further <hi>danger accruing to the Citizens, as well as to the whole Kingdom, upon the King's untimely Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>The greatest danger (<hi>says he</hi>) will proceed from a confusion, and want of some Eminent and Interested persons, whom you may trust to lead you up against a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Popish Army.</hi> For which purpose no person is fitter then his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> as well for Quality, Courage and Conduct; as for that his life and fortune depends upon the same bottom with Yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will stand by you, therefore ought you to stand by him: And remember the old rule is, <hi>He who hath the worst Title, ever makes the best King.</hi>
