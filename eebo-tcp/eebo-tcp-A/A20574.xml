         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Firſt therefore, it is to be conſidered, that in euery Benefice three perſons haue intreſt. That is to ſay, the Parſon hath a Spirituall poſſeſſion.<note place="margin">12.

               <p>That they haue a kind of Diſpoſition in them, it<note place="margin">2. H. 7. 36. Ratio 1.</note> is proued by many reaſons: 1. No charge can be founded to be laid vpon the Church in perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bind their ſucceſſors, but the Patron and Ordinarie muſt be made parties thereunto as all our bookes agree, and <hi>Litleton</hi> giues a notable reaſon for it. VV<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is, that if the Charge be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, the conſent of all 3. ought to concurre, of which enſueth thus much, that if a writ of Anui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be brought againſt the parſon, and he prayeth in aide of the Patron and Ordinarie and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron maketh default, and the Ordinarie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and confeſſeth the action; or if the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie<note place="margin">12. H. 8. 7. b</note> make default, and the Patron appeare, and confeſſeth the action, that this Anuitie ſhall not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:24643:10"/>
bind the ſucceſſor: but if they both appeare and one of them confeſſe the action, and the other faith not any thing, it ſhall bind the Rectorie in perpetuitie. For <hi>Qui tacet conſentire videtur.</hi> But if the Parſon onely with the conſent of the Ordinarie for Tythes or other conſideration ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutorie, charge the Church in perpetuitie, it ſhall bee good, without the conſent of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, as well as if the conſideration executorie had remained.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly it followeth, that the charge of the Parſon, Patron and Ordinarie, ſhall bind in like manner as their intreſt is. But if a man haue an <hi>Advowſon</hi> for yeares, and the Parſon by the conſent of ſuch Patron and Ordinarie, grant rent charge in fee, if the Parſon dye within the terme, &amp; the termor of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> preſents another, &amp; the terme expireth, <hi>Quere</hi> if then the Anuity ſhal be deliuered, but it ſeemeth by ſome that it ſhall be deliuered; for that, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent was not the party, that made the grant, and therefore he ſhould not hold it charged any longer, then during the intreſt of the Patron.</p>
               <p>And therefore if two joyntenants in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or parceners be of an <hi>Advowſon,</hi> who agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to preſent by turne, if the perſon ioyne in grant of a rent charge in fee, with one of them, the Parſon ſhall bee charged and alſo his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors (<hi>alterius vicibus</hi>) for euer; becauſe, thoſe ſucceſſors (that commeth in) by him that made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:24643:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Charge, ſhall bee ſubiect to it onely, and thoſe that commeth in by the preſentation of the Patron, that neither ioyned nor confirmed, the ſame ſhall hold their land diſcharged for euer.</p>
               <p>Alſo, ſuch Anuitie with which the Rectorie is charged, doth not properly charge the Land but the Parſon; for, if the grantee enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Gleebe, hee ſhall not ſuſpend the rent or anuitie.</p>
               <p>And if the Parſon, Patron, and Ordinarie, ioyne in a graunt of an Anuitie to <hi>S. H.</hi> and his heires, except they ſpeake of the ſucceſſors of the parſon, and that the ſame be granted for the parſon and his ſucceſſors, this cannot be good longer then forthe time, that the parſon that granted the ſame, continueth Parſon; for an Anuitie is nothing but a parſonall Dutie, and no otherwiſe. And if ſuch an Anuitie bee<note place="margin">21. H. 7. 4. ae</note> granted ouer, it is not needfull to haue Atturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all which proueth, that the ſame char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not the Land, but the Parſon; yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, the parſon is charge, for if the Grantor aſſigne or be remoued by any meanes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the charge followeth not his parſon, but reſteth vpon his Succeſſors, and the Iurie may bee taken of the Towne where the Church is, which proueth that ſuch graunt chargeth the parſon in reſpect of the Land.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when the Patron and Ordinarie, confirmeth the graunt of the Parſon, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:24643:11"/>
that the Confirmation be made, during ſuch time, as he is Incumbent that made the Charge; for if hee Die, be remoued, reſigue, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be deptiued before the confirmation, ſuch Confirmation is voyd notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>If an Incumbent grant rent charge, to begin after his Death out of his Rectorie, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Ordinarie confirmeth the ſame, this is good for ſo long time as it is graunted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond principall Reaſon, to proue the<note place="margin">Ratio, 2.</note> intreſt they haue to the Church or Rectorie, is,<note place="margin">31, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1 Deprivation, is in the Spirituall Court for that, that it is grounded vpon ſome defect in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:24643:41"/>
the partie deprived, although it bee by act of Law, yet it is deemed as the act of the partie himſelfe. The cauſes of Depriuation, by Cenſure in the Spirituall Court are to be referred to the Common Law, therefore let vs remember ſuch of them, vpon which queſtions haue beene mooved in the Bookes of our Law, all which cauſes mentioned ſeuerally, may bee reduced to three principle points; firſt, want of Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſecondly, Contempt; thirdly, Crime. As concerning the firſt, although by the Common Law, a Lay perſon bee preſented, and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Inducted, to an eſpeciall Benefice, which Curate is altogether vncapable of the ſame, yet the Church is not therefore to bee ſaid voyde, as if no preſentation had beene, but it is ſtill full of an Incumbent, <hi>de Facto licet non de Iure,</hi> vntill by ſentence Declaratorie for his want of Capacity, the Church be adiudged voyde, and vpon this no Laps ſhall incurre againſt the Lay Patron, without notice (of ſuch incapacity, &amp; ſentence of deprivation therevpon) to him giuen, King <hi>H.</hi> 4. preſented one that was incapable of his preſentation, and the Preſentee was thereby admitted, inſtituted &amp; inducted, and afterward the Pope enabled the preſentee by his Bill, yet the King had a <hi>ſcire fac.</hi> and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his preſentation againe, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent was not capable whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was preſented.

man, within the age of 25. &amp;. he vpon this be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Inſtituted, and Inducted, and afterward a <hi>Qua.

Imp.</hi> for though ſuch decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory ſentence giuen againſt him by the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law, cannot remoue him that is removed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yet it ſhall make this Incumbent anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the next Incumbent, for all the meane profits received by him, that was the firſt Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, from the time of his Induction.

               <p>Contempt, may likewiſe be a cauſe of Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as if the parſon or other Incumbent bee Excommunicate, and he ſo remaineth in his obſtinacie for the ſpace of fortie dayes, hee is for this depriuable of his Benefice, and yet the Church is not voyd in Deed, without ſentence in Depriuation giuen againſt him, and if before ſuch Depriuation, the King as ſupreame Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and the head of the Church would haue a Diſpenſation to the Incumbent, who for all the ſentence of Depriuation for his contempt had, hee ſhall hold his Benefice; ſuch Diſpenſation were voyde, and ſhould reſtraine the Patron from his preſentation acrewed to him, by meanes of ſuch Depriuation after enſuing.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe, is Crime, within which may be comprehended Delappidation, or ſpoyle of the Church Benefice, once, in our Bookes, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Depriuation, likewiſe Sohiſme or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie; for the which, or if for ſome other cauſes the Incumbent were depriued in ancient time in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon ſuch Depriuation comming in queſtion in our Law, the iſſue ſhould be vpon the avoydance, and it ſhould be tryed where the Church or dignitie is; but becauſe, Crime is <hi>Hidra,</hi> with many heads, and an evill Tree, whereof is bred <hi>Ingens prouentus</hi> much

fruit, for all fruit of offences which may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder this name; therefore let vs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe further to deale with it, onely in generall, noting thoſe three things as the incidents, and conſequents of Depriuations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that our Law adiudgeth not the Church actually voyde, without a ſentence of Depriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as hath beene before prooued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that though ſuch ſentence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation be meerely wrongfull; yet the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is voyd, and the ſentence remaineth in his force, vntill it bee releaſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, if the party depriued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time require by this Law an appeale (vpon ſuch ſentence of Depriuation giuen againſt him at the Court of the high Iuriſdiction) ſuch is the nature of an Appeale, that it holdeth (the ſentence vpon which it was firſt brought) in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; becauſe, in the Common Law it is ſaid, to haue <hi>effectum ſuſpenſum prioris pronuntiati;</hi> and therefore, if it bee brought vpon Depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it voydeth the vigour thereof, and reuiueth the former dignity, for ſuch Church ſhall not be voyde, vntill the firſt ſentence of depriuation chance to be affirmed in the appeale, and thus much of Depriuations in the Spirituall Court, ſhall ſuffice at this time.</p>

               <p>It is to be noted, that there are two ſorts of Reſignations, the one is abſolute, when the Incumbent intendeth ſo to make voyde the Church, and to ſurrender his right therein to the Ordinary, wherevpon the Patron may preſent whoſoever it ſhall pleaſe him to the Church, as if the ſaid had beene voyded by Death, or other meanes of Avoydance, as by precedent authorities hath appeared.</p>

               <p>Thus you ſee, that in ſome reſpect the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Biſhop reſembleth the Preſentation of a parſon, the Confirmation, reſembleth the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, of a parſon, the Creation reſembleth the Inſtitution of a parſon, and the Inſtallation or the inthronation the Induction of a parſon, yet in many other reſpects they differ.</p>

               <p>If before the 25. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. 10. the Incumbent of a Benefice had beene Elected Byſhop and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and before conſecration had, obtained of the Byſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> a diſpenſation ſtill to enioy his former benefice, notwithſtanding his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Conſecration, had enſued accordingly; yet by ſuch Creation, the Church ſhould not haue beene voyde, but the partie ſtill enabled to retaine the ſame Benefice againſt the patron

                  <hi>Eccleſiaſtica qua fungitur,</hi> may grant (to the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that is conſecrated) power to take and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by preſentation, Inſtitution and Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any Spirituall Benefice, and to hold the ſame in <hi>Commendam,</hi> notwithſtanding his eſtate of being Byſhop, for ſo the Pope vſed to doe, and the ſame Authority is recogniſed by the Statute of the 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. to be in the King or Queene of this Land, which was within this Realme by the Pope.</p>
               <p>Finally, this is to be noted, that whereas before it hath bin ſaid, that Deprivation is the act of the Law, yet grounded vpon the act of the partie; So is Creation of the Byſhop, the act of the Law, wherefore if a man bring an action and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant his writ, bee created Byſhop, the writ ſhall not abate; becauſe, it is onely the act of the Law, but yet Reſignation is meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the act of the party, thus much for Creation.</p>
