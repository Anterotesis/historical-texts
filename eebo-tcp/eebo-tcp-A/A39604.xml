            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THIS day, purſuant to the Sentence paſs'd at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on Mr. <hi>Edward Fitz-harris,</hi> for Treaſon, &amp;c. he was neer the <hi>Tower</hi> Gate, on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> delivered into the Cuſtody of the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex, viz. Slingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Bethel</hi> and <hi>Henry Corniſh</hi> Eſquires; who upon the Place ſign'd a Diſcharge for him, to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower.</hi> Then he was put on a Sledge, and thence conveyed through the City of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he overtook <hi>Oliver Plunket,</hi> who was juſt before on another Sledge, paſſing to the ſame Place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>Where being come, (ſoon after <hi>Plunket</hi>'s private Prayers, &amp;c.) <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> ask'd Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> whether the Sheriffs had a Warrant for the diſpoſal of his Body, Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Yes.</hi> Then he deſired Dr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> Aſſiſtance, which the Sheriffs <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eadily granted, and called for him to go to him on the Sledge; which the Doctor did, and on his Knees embraced him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63756:2"/>
               <hi>Sheriff</hi> Bethel <hi>ask'd Mr.</hi> Fitz-harris, What have you to ſay? <hi>Mr.</hi> Fitz-harris <hi>anſwered,</hi> The Doctor of the <hi>Tower</hi> would anſwer for him, he having left his Mind with him,</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sheriff <hi>Bethel.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You will do well to diſcharge your Conſcience.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fitz harris.</speaker>
               <p>I have left it all with the Doctor in Writing, 
under my hand, who will communicate it with Witneſs to the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Wood-ſtreet</hi> being at the ſame time in the preſence of the Sheriffs, deſired Maſter <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> to declare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he died a Proteſtant or a Papiſt. He anſwered. Having left his mind fully with Doctor <hi>Hawkins,</hi> he hoped it might be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. The Doctor replied, it would be more ſatisfactory to declare himſelf there, and that it was no ſhame to die a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. To which Maſter <hi>Fitz harris</hi> replied as before.</p>
            <p>Then Maſter <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> ſaid,

    <q>
                  <hi>Good People,</hi> This infamous kind of Death is much more irkſome to me than Death it ſelf: Such Judgments as theſe my Sins againſt God may juſtly bring upon me, and I do moſt humbly ſubmit unto it. But as to the Crimes which I now die for, I take God to witneſs, I was no further concerned in the Libel, than to diſcover to the King what Practiſes of that kind were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, being employed to that end, though thoſe that employed me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do me Juſtice at my Trial. And I call God to Witneſs, I never had a Farthing of Money of the King in my life, but on the Account of the like Service. And as to the Witneſſes that have ſworn againſt me, I do here ſolemnly declare, now at my Death, that I have not ſeen the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador ſince the beginning of the breaking out of the Plot, neither have I had any Acquaintance with him. And as to his Confeſſor, I never ſpoke with him in my life; neither have I had any dealing, either directly or indirectly, in my life with them, though Sir <hi>W. Waller</hi> and the reſt ſwore moſt falſely to the contrary. And how like it is that the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador would give three thouſand Crowns for writing that Libel, I leave the World to judge. What I may further declare, I have left with Doctor <hi>Hawkins.</hi> I forgive all the World, and do hope that God will forgive me. I beg the Prayers of all good People for a happy Paſſage into the other World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Fitzharris</hi> deſired to know of the Sheriffs, whether his Body might not be at the diſpoſal of his Wife, without Quartering. Upon which the Sheriff read him the Warrant.</p>
