            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS UPON THE <hi>Preſent Confederacy,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE moſt formidable Enterpriſe, no doubt, that ever was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd againſt the growing Grandeur of <hi>France,</hi> during the long and ſucceſsful Reign of <hi>Lewis le Grande,</hi> was this late <hi>Confederacy,</hi> form'd by the moſt powerful Princes in all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> An Undertaking of ſo dangerous conſequence to that Prince, that if their Carier had not been ſtopt by a ſurpriſing Providence, and diverted by the wonderful Vigilance and Activity of that truly greateſt Prince in all theſe parts of the World, that Monarchy by this time had laid expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. As the Confederates had reſolutely, and with prodigious Proſpects of Advantage to themſelves agreed upon this Deſign; ſo to facilitate it had ſagaciouſly enough foreſeen what Remoraes might lie in their way, and as reſolutely determin'd to remove them, <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong. England,</hi> which had for ſome years paſt skreen'd them from thoſe violent, and otherwiſe irreſiſtible, ſhocks they were expoſed to from <hi>France,</hi> was moſt feared at this time would ſtand in their way; and to ſpeak the Truth, from the Experience we have had of the <hi>French</hi> Power and Policy during this War, the leaſt Aſſiſtance from her, or a meer <hi>Neutrality,</hi> had left them to the Mercy and entire Diſpoſal of their Enemy. This, I ſay, was politickly enough foreſeen, and by moſt wicked and unjuſt means for ſome time at leaſt prevented; though by comparing the Succeſſes on both ſides hitherto, cannot in all humane probability be long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted: But more of this afterwards. To accompliſh this Grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theirs, King <hi>James</hi> muſt be depoſed, to make way for the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Pride of another, the moſt likely to carry on the War againſt <hi>France;</hi> if we either conſider that heighth of Malice which he had long
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40112:3"/>
ago conceived againſt that Monarch, chiefly from his being ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baffled in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> by the Bravery of his Generals there; or that Natural Malignity in his very Conſtitution, derived from his Anceſtors, who had never been famous for their Loyalty to their own Princes, or Affection for Crowned Heads. This they concluded feaſible enough, not being ignorant of the ambitious Deſigns the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had been carrying on for ſeveral years in <hi>England</hi> of mounting that Throne, by having a hand in all the Plots againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; but eſpecially his <hi>Father in-law,</hi> to exclude him, and what not; and the Diſpoſitions he had laid in order to that End, by his corrupting the greateſt Miniſters of State under that unfortunate Prince, to take advantage from his Religion, to which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are naturally averſe, to put him upon ſome Acts which would in all likelihood alienate his Subjects Affections from him, and make the P. or <hi>O</hi>'s Acceſs the more eaſie. All this being well known to many of the Confederate Princes, they had no more to doe but to ſound his Inclination ſomewhat nearer, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him their Aſſiſtance for the obtaining of what he ſo eagerly deſired, and by all indirect means purſued. To this end having engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and him in the ſtrict bonds of a Confederacy, they immediately lent him ſuch Aſſiſtance as was requiſite to land him in <hi>England,</hi> where all things were ready to his hand, and there moſt wickedly <hi>depoſed</hi> King <hi>James</hi> II.</p>
            <p>I confeſs ſome are apt to alledge that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> exceeded his Commiſſion, and acted directly contrary to the Determination of the Confederacy, their ſole Aim being onely by this Invaſion to draw King <hi>James</hi> in to their Deſigns: But if we conſider thoſe notable Hints in the foreign Papers upon this occaſion, particularly <hi>The General Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of</hi> Europe, <hi>publiſhed in</hi> French, <hi>at the</hi> Hague, <hi>by the Authority of the States of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Weſt Frieſland, we may be eaſily inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the contrary, out of which I ſhall preſent the Reader with ſome remarkable Paſſages, and leave it to him to judge, whether what I have laid down for my Principle does not look highly probable.</p>

               <hi>Hiſtorical Account for the Month of</hi> November, <hi>in the Article of Advice from</hi> England, 1688.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The King's Fleet (that is, King <hi>James</hi>'s,) is about forty three Men of War, ten Fireſhips; but though commanded by the Earl of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> who is entirely for the King's Intereſt, 'tis thought the Seamen, and many of the Officers, will not perform that Duty which the King expects from them.</q>

               <q>The Expence that has been beſtowed upon the Fleet and Army ſet forth from <hi>Holland,</hi> is a ſign they are morally aſſured of the Succeſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40112:3"/>
of the Enterpriſe, which I am apt to believe <hi>has been a long time ago in Agitation,</hi> though it was carried on with that Prudence and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</q> as not to be diſcovered till it could not be longer concealed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Advice from</hi> Germany, Decemb. 1688.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Confederates are arrived in <hi>Franconia,</hi> where they ſtay till General <hi>Dunewald</hi> comes up to join them with the Emperour's Forces, to the end they may march together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheleſs when they are joined, there is great probability they will do nothing till they hear what the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> does in <hi>England;</hi> for he is at preſent the <hi>primum Mobile</hi> of all things.</q>

            <p>
               <q>'Tis thought that Monſieur <hi>Seignalay</hi>'s Journey to viſit the Coaſts was particularly occaſioned by the turn of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. But now all thoſe Journeys will ſignifie little; for if Heaven conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues Proſperity to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> of neceſſity the moſt Chriſtian King muſt quit the Ocean.</q>

            <p>
               <q>So ſoon as the Enterprize of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was diſcourſed of all Men imagined that he was ſure of the greateſt part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>England.</hi> Some put the queſtion whether he will dethrone his Father in Law, or whether, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he'll be contented with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of having ſaved the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.—For my part I believe an Accommodation will be a difficult thing.—I make no queſtion but the next Parliament King <hi>James</hi> will be declared to have forfeited his Crown.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Reflexions on the Advice from</hi> Germany, February 1689.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am apt to believe they are not to be called by the name of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, who imagine that the Emperour cauſed the Marqueſs of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnan</hi> to be ſeiſed, that he might have an opportunity to enter into a Negotiation. Then again, What was befaln the Emperour ſince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us that ſhould enforce him to alter his Conduct? If it had been that the Affairs in <hi>England</hi> went ill on the P. of <hi>O</hi>'s ſide, that had been a Reaſon indeed;—but all the World knows there is no ſuch thing; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has been crowned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To all which I ſhall add a remarkable Paſſage out of the <hi>French King's</hi> Declaration of War againſt <hi>Spain:</hi> Amongſt other Motives he declares, That he is informed what ſhare the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Low Countries had in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Enterprize againſt <hi>England;</hi> but not believing what he did was done by his Maſter's Command, his Majeſty was in good hopes to have perſuaded his moſt <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> to have joined with him for the Reſtoration of the lawful King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. To which purpoſe he made ſeveral Propoſals that were all received whilſt the Succeſs of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> continued doubtfull; but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40112:4"/>
when 'twas known at <hi>Madrid</hi> that the King of <hi>England</hi> had left his Kingdom, then nothing was thought of but War with <hi>France.</hi> That his Majeſty was alſo farther informed, that the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſadour</hi> in <hi>England</hi> viſited the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> every day, and importuned him to declare War againſt <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. But finding that his moſt Catholick Majeſty was reſolved,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c. Gen. Hiſt. of</hi> Europe, <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>Month</hi> Apr. 89.</p>
            <p>As to this laſt paſſage I am ſenſible many prejudiced perſons will be ready to object the little Reputation the <hi>French</hi> King and his Miniſters have had for their Veracity theſe many Years; but if we reflect on the vaſt Charge he is conſtantly at for Intelligence in all places where he is concerned, and how much it imported him to find out the Myſtery of the Confederacy, it ought in ſome meaſure at leaſt to incline us to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit him, eſpecially when it's notoriouſly known he had intimated to King <hi>James,</hi> ſome conſiderable time before he could give credit to it, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the <hi>States General,</hi> againſt him; and proffered him ſuch Aſſiſtance, that if he had complied with it, would have effectually prevented this <hi>late Revolution</hi> in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently this bloody and deſperate War, which has been the ſad Effect of it. And there are ſome perſons now living, of unqueſtionable Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and ſufficient Intereſt to know the truth of it, who aſſert, that <hi>Don Ronquillo,</hi> the late <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, plainly told King <hi>James,</hi> that if we would not be induced to join in the <hi>Confederacy</hi> with the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> he <hi>would run the hazard of loſing his Crown;</hi> ſo certain it is that the Revolution here was an immediate Effect of the Conſultations and Reſolutions of the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> though not publickly enough hitherto underſtood, to the great injury of the King, and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſion of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>Theſe Paſſages out of a publick Account of the Affairs of <hi>Europe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be publiſhed,</hi> and (as we are obliged to ſuppoſe) <hi>approved</hi> by the States General for the preſent, (till ſomething more material be offered by more capable and intelligent Perſons,) may ſeem to any reaſonable man a ſufficient Proof of my Aſſertion, that what the Pr. of <hi>Orange</hi> has lately tranſacted there, was not managed by him alone againſt the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the reſt of the Confederacy: If ſo, why did not they remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt his Proceedings, by their Ambaſſadours to King <hi>James,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> too; and, as in Honour bound, contribute their Aſſiſtence, when eſpecially requeſted to it, towards his Reſtoration? Nay, why did they on the contrary by their reſpective Ambaſſadours and Envoys <hi>congratulate</hi> the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Acceſſion to the Throne, and by this means virtually declare to all the World, that King <hi>James</hi> was <hi>juſtly depoſed,</hi> and that the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> were become the <hi>lawfull</hi> and <hi>rightfull</hi> King and Queen of <hi>England?</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40112:4"/>
So that the more nicely we examine the methods of the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>'s Proceedings, the greater reaſon we have to conclude this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to be a meer <hi>Sham</hi> and Excuſe. His charging his Father in law with Male-adminiſtration, <hi>Violating the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, with ſetting up the Roman Catholick Religion, impoſing a Suppoſititious Heir upon the Three Kingdoms, in order to put by the Succeſſion of his own Children, meerly on the account of Religion,</hi> &amp;c. What was all this to the buſineſs of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Confederates?</hi> The only thing in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Daclaration, that makes for the buſineſs pretended, is the <hi>Private League</hi> Offenſive and Defenſive between King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding could never be produced, and expoſed to the view of the World; and if it had been ſo, could never be any juſt pretence for their aſſiſting to invade him, unleſs it had been contrary to former Alliances between him and them; none of which appearing, it is altogether as frivolous as many other Shams in that Maſter-piece of Villany, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Declaration.</hi> Upon theſe Suppoſitions then 'tis apparent, that that which was to give Life unto the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and bring it into Act, was the pulling down King <hi>James,</hi> and ſetting up the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> ſo that before all this was accompliſh'd, the <hi>Confederacy</hi> was but an <hi>Embrio,</hi> and no better than a Conditional Stipulation; and upon the unſucceſsfulneſs of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would have been ſtiſled and vaniſh'd into nothing. There was no War declared, before this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was moſt Traiterouſly Proclaimed King; but by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria, Nov.</hi> 10. as you may ſee in the <hi>London Gazette:</hi> The <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> did not till <hi>March—</hi>89. and in all probability it had not been done afterward on the Confederates ſide, if this <hi>Praeludium</hi> to all the reſt had miſcarried. To this effect we may remember that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadour when charged by King <hi>James</hi> in the behalf of his Maſters, the <hi>States General,</hi> with aſſiſting the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with Men, Money, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for his Expedition, (againſt the expreſs Articles of Peace and Alliance made between King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, of bleſſed Memory, and the <hi>States of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands,</hi> 1667. particularly the 11th <hi>Article,</hi> wherein it was agreed, <q>That the ſaid King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>States General,</hi> remain Friends, Confederates, united and allied for the Defence, and Preſervation of the Rights, Liberties, and Immunities of either Allie, and their Subjects, againſt all who ſhall endeavor to diſturb the Peace of either by Sea or Land.</q> And <hi>Artie.</hi> 13. <q>That neither the ſaid King, nor the ſaid Common-wealth, nor any of the Subjects of either, inhabiting or reſiding within their Juriſdiction, ſhall cheriſh and aſsiſt the Rebels of either party, with any Succour, Counſel, or Favour whatſoever; but ſhall expoſe and effectually hinder all perſons abiding, reſiding, or dwelling in either of their Dominions, from ſupplying or furniſhing any of thoſe foreſaid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40112:5"/>
Rebels by Sea or Land with Arms, Succour or Aſſiſtance either in Men, Ships,</q> Arms, or Warlike Furniture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Article</hi> 14. <q>That the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>States General</hi> ſhall Mutually, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and Faithfully as there is occaſion, asſiſt each other againſt the Rebels of either by Sea or Land, with Men, Ships, <hi>&amp;c. Article</hi> 15. That neither the ſaid <hi>King,</hi> nor the ſaid <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> nor the Subjects of either, ſhall in any of their Juriſdictions, Countries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> receive any Rebel or Rebels, Fugitive or Fugitives declared, or to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> pretended to know nothing of it; which is a plain Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they would have inſiſted upon that denial, and urged it in their own Vindication, if that Project had not ſucceeded, to prevent a Storm from King <hi>James</hi> and the K. of <hi>France;</hi> and it would have equally ſerved the reſt of the <hi>Confederates</hi> too: But as ſoon as they heard his Enterprize had its deſired effect, the next thing we heard of, was the <hi>States Manifeſto</hi> owning the whole buſineſs, juſtifying themſelves, and applauding the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Attempt of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> From what has been hitherto ſaid, I ſhall beg leave to infer, That this <hi>Revolution</hi> was the Contrivance of the <hi>Confederates</hi> in general, and not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s ſeparately from them, but in Conjunction with them; That all his Motives, of what nature ſoever, were meerly introductory to it; and that the moſt principal of them that ſeemed the moſt juſtifiable of his Proceedings, were calculated only to ſerve the Malicious and Diſaffected part of the Nation, and to wheedle and amuſe the reſt into a Compliance with him; That if thoſe had not been ſubtilly thought on, others would not have been wanting; That he had no deſign to ſecure Religion, vindicate Juſtice, to aſſert the Liberties, or ſecure the Properties of the People, but to execute the Deſigns of the <hi>Confederates</hi> in general, and to ſerve his own Ambition, and unſatisfied Thirſt after Empire in particular; That therefore the <hi>Grand Preſumptions</hi> (as he terms it) of the <hi>Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> of the <hi>Private League</hi> between K. <hi>James</hi> and the K. of <hi>France,</hi> the introducing of <hi>Arbitrary Power, Popery,</hi> &amp;c. were meer Cant, and nothing to the purpoſe, he having not performed any thing promiſed in that <hi>Declaration,</hi> but acted quite contrary; and for corroborating my main Poſition, I ſhall proceed to ſhew what pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Advantages the reſt of the <hi>Confederates</hi> propoſed to themſelves by ſuch a <hi>Revolution</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which may induce all impartial Readers to ſubſcribe to the Truth of what I have hitherto ſaid.</p>
            <p>The principal Advantage the <hi>Confederates</hi> in general, excluſive of the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> propoſed to themſelves by this Revolution, was to have the Kingdom of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> one of the Strongeſt and moſt Flouriſhing Monarchies in <hi>Europe,</hi> at their entire Devotion, to draw off Men and Money at their pleaſure, ſo long as they could keep this new ſet-up King in the Throne; an advantage ſo conſiderable, that whilſt they can do
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40112:5"/>
this, and any Wealth remains in <hi>England,</hi> they are ſure to make the cheapeſt Experiment they could poſſibly deviſe, and withall the moſt powerful effort imaginable towards the reducing the growing Power of <hi>France,</hi> and retrieving their former loſſes: And however the infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and eaſily deluded <hi>Populace</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may ſeem to deſpiſe the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates</hi> in their Diſcourſe; yet it's evident enough, that ſo long as this <hi>Confederacy</hi> holds, and no longer, ſhall they keep their new King; it being ſufficiently apparent to any one of common Senſe, that if the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>entire Confederacy</hi> have had hitherto enough to do, to oppoſe <hi>France</hi> even in the loweſt degree, it is more than demonſtration, that ſhe alone will be able to do it leaſt; for I muſt take it as granted, that if <hi>England</hi> breaks from the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> the <hi>Confederates</hi> muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity knock quite off, and make their beſt terms at any rate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unite with <hi>France</hi> againſt <hi>England,</hi> which we are well aſſured that King will oblige them to, in order to the compleating that moſt Glorious Reſolution which he has ſo often made, and will eternize his Memory, of the Reſtoring that Unfortunate Prince and Martyr for his ſake, the true and lawfull King of <hi>England.</hi> This ſuppoſition, I hope, will without much difficulty be granted me, if we conſider the great loſſes of the <hi>Confederates</hi> on all ſides, their apparent Poverty, and Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to carry on the War at their ſole Charge, that <hi>England</hi> is their principal ſupport, and has been all this War, that without the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of Aſſiſtance from hence, they muſt break, and <hi>England</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſubmit to her Lawfull and moſt Injured Sovereign again, which all theſe <hi>Allies</hi> know they would not be eaſily or ſuddenly inclined to from the Senſe of their horrid Guilt, and dread of his juſt Reſentment; and therefore till meer Neceſſity and the utmoſt Extremity drives them to it, they are ſure to drain them at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Another advantage the <hi>Confederates</hi> propos'd to reap by the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution here, and by engaging theſe Nations into the <hi>Confederacy</hi> is this, (ſuppoſing their ſucceſsfulneſs in Attacking <hi>France)</hi> that whatever Cities or Territories ſhould be recovered, or won from the <hi>French,</hi> ſhould either revert to their old reſpective Owners, or be acquired to ſome of the reſt of the <hi>Confederates</hi> excluſive of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as ſhould be agreed by them. This is natural and eaſie enough to be ſuppoſed; for can any one imagine, ſhould the late pretended Deſign of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to attempt the taking of <hi>Dunkirk, Ipres,</hi> or <hi>Namur,</hi> have been effected, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would have reſigned his right in them to him, and permitted them to be annext to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſince 'tis evident beyond all contradiction, that the ground of this <hi>Confederacy</hi> as is publiſhed by them to all the World, was to make War upon <hi>France,</hi> in order to recover what they urged was ſome time ſince ſo unjuſtly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from them by that <hi>Monarch;</hi> and nothing of this nature could
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40112:6"/>
ever be pretended with truth by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> as King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> we have not loſt one ſingle Town to the <hi>French?</hi> So that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, all the Prodigious Expence we have been at to carry on the War in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> was not in order to recover any thing from <hi>France</hi> that we had any right to, but only to asſiſt the reſt of the <hi>Confederates</hi> in regaining what was lately theirs; and pray what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is this to us? And let the War in the concluſion, be as ſucceſsful as can be wiſht, we ſhall only have the honour in asſiſting to debilitate <hi>France</hi> by weakening our ſelves, and enriching the <hi>Confederates</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing and reducing poor <hi>England.</hi> But perhaps it may be alledged, that what has been urged in reference to the retaking of ſuch places as have been unjuſtly taken from the <hi>Confederates</hi> by <hi>France,</hi> will be readily granted; but what Acquiſts the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhall make in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, will be their own. As to this I anſwer: By the late Project of Invading <hi>France,</hi> we may be ſatisfied that there was no manner of appearance it would be ſo, if it had been attempted, and really ſucceeded: For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they had landed at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> marched into <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> it was with a deſign to joyn the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s and the reſt of the <hi>Confederate</hi> Forces, to make Repriſals for what the <hi>French</hi> had acted in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> or in order to retake ſuch places as formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to that Prince, now in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>French.</hi> This is ſo probable, nay, next to certain, that it's non-ſenſe to think otherwiſe, no poſſible Acquiſts on that ſide being anſwerable either to the Charge of taking or keeping by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Neither can it be congruous to common Senſe, that it could be of any Intereſt to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to asſiſt the others in Subjugating any part of <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whilſt moſt of his own Countrey was already ſubdued, and in the hands of the <hi>French.</hi> Again, granting that the other deſign of Beſeiging <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with the Tranſport Forces from <hi>England,</hi> had anſwered common expectation, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> all the World knows was formerly the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Gariſon and Port that belonged to <hi>Flanders;</hi> and can any one ſo much as fancy that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would ever have been contented it ſhould be an Appendage to <hi>England,</hi> when it was alone of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to that Monarch to recover, than half of what he had hitherto loſt in <hi>Flanders?</hi> Or do we think the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army <hi>alone</hi> was in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to undertake the Seige of ſuch a Garriſon, and carry it; or if it were jointly performed with the reſt of the <hi>Confederate</hi> Army, that they would tamely let the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> have the ſole honour of <hi>winning</hi> and <hi>wearing</hi> it too? This can never enter into the Head of the meaneſt Dotard, and therefore the direct contrary muſt neceſſarily be admitted.</p>
            <p>The next Advantage, and that of no mean conſequence neither, that the <hi>Confederates</hi> have from our <hi>Revolution,</hi> beſides that of making theſe Experiments upon <hi>France</hi> at the vaſt expence of our Blood and Treaſure,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40112:6"/>
is, that if no poſſible hopes remain of attaining their Ends upon their common Enemy, as they phraſe it, they have a fair opportunity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Peace, whether <hi>England</hi> conſent or not: This muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a prodigious one, if duly conſidered; for when the worſt comes to the worſt, the leaving <hi>England</hi> (which in reality has been the moſt powerfull as well as the moſt malicious Enemy) to the juſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>France,</hi> will almoſt amount to an Expiation for all the envious Deſigns they have all this while formed againſt her, and by a timely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of her, or in conjuction with <hi>France</hi> againſt her, will in ſome meaſure attone for thoſe Injuries they have done to her lawfull Monarch, and indeed to themſelves, and all the Crowned Heads in the World, by ſo wicked a Precedent as they have given: This is a plain Caſe, and muſt be owned a ſingular Advantage on their ſide. All will agree 'tis no way feaſible for <hi>England,</hi> reſolving to maintain the P. of <hi>O.</hi> in the poſſeſſion of the Crown he has baſely uſurpt, ever to come to any ſort of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with <hi>France,</hi> excluſive of <hi>them;</hi> and that they, if neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, can and will, without him; it being impoſſible for us to wage War againſt <hi>France</hi> and them to, when we with all the united Forces of the <hi>Allies</hi> were not able to make the leaſt impreſſion againſt the former.</p>
            <p>The Objection that may be made to this Advantage of the <hi>Confederates,</hi> excluſive of <hi>England,</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the Articles of the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi> it's ſtipulated that no one of them ſhall make a ſeparate Peace.</p>
            <p>To this it may be replied, That this Proviſion or Caution at firſt ſight may ſeem to be of ſome force, to keep ſuch of them who are the weakeſt, and the moſt contiguous, within the bounds of it, for fear of being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and treated as Enemies by the reſt; but as for the more potent or remote, it can be of little moment, eſpecially after the ſad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their declining Condition, and the ſenſible and irreſiſtible Growth of the hitherto ſo much envied Power of <hi>France.</hi> The utmoſt Fury of the <hi>Allies</hi> has been already ſpent, and their utmoſt Efforts by Sea and Land, and all to their own loſs, and the Intereſt of their Enemy. That brave Army under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> a great part of which conſiſted of thoſe veterane Troops that for ſeveral years had ſignaliſed themſelves againſt the Turks, were broken and ſhattered in pieces the very firſt Campaign; by which means the Emperour has been extremely weakened both in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Enemy left at liberty to doe what he pleaſes on the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Moſell</hi> ever ſince; the ſtrongeſt part of <hi>Flanders</hi> loſt; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> upon the brink of Ruine; all <hi>Savoy</hi> gone; <hi>Piedmont</hi> in a ſinking Condition; the Commerce in all theſe Princes Countries deſtroyed: So that what they took to be one of the ſureſt Methods of reducing <hi>France,</hi> has faln moſt heavy upon themſelves; nothing but Miſery and an univerſal Diſcontent, with an utter deſpair of ever ſucceeding in their Enterprizes againſt their Enemy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40112:7"/>
multiplying among them; and <hi>England,</hi> which has been their beſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, hitherto growing leſs able and willing to go on with the War, and more diſappointed perhaps than any of the reſt. Theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid together, and ſeriouſly weighed, will more than evince my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and confute the Objection, ſince what has been for the moſt part practiſed in the like Caſes, may be now; That it has been no unuſual thing for ſome of a <hi>Confederacy</hi> (when altogether worſted, and ready to be over-run by their Adverſaries,) to make their beſt Advantage of a ſeparate Peace, when they could not bring down the haughty and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Spirits of the reſt to their Sentiments and Reſolutions; eſpecially when convinced by wofull Experience, that it would be their onely Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt ſo to doe, whereas at firſt they were really trickt into it againſt <hi>both.</hi> That this may be the Caſe of ſome of theſe united Princes, will be no hard task to demonſtrate; as for inſtance: What Honour was it for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to enter into the Confederacy againſt his Uncle, the beſt and moſt potent Friend he had, whoſe annual <hi>Penſion</hi> to him for ſome years amounted to a greater Summ than the Revenues of his Principality? What Honour to his Religion to entertain a hodgpodg of all Opinions, contrary to the Principles of his own; to permit them to preach up their filthy Cant where ever they go, and to gratifie their <hi>Gothiſh</hi> and brutiſh Zeal in the profaning all that is ſacred, and looks like good, by their irreligious and unchriſtian Behaviour, and ſuch Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies as are not fit to be named among Chriſtians? What Honour was it for him to let out his own native Countrey for a Cockpit to the reſt of the Confederates, (and in particular to the K of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for I muſt reckon the P of <hi>O.</hi> among them,) who had violated all their former Leagues with two <hi>Crowned Heads,</hi> to try tricks whether they could by that means divert the <hi>War</hi> from their own doors, to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation of his Territories, and Ruine of himſelf and poor Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any Recompence <hi>all</hi> of them together can ever make him, when he had ſuch Advantages at the ſame time offered him by <hi>France,</hi> of encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his own and Subjects Wealth and Proſperity beyond any of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors? What Honour is it for him to bring upon himſelf the juſt Hatred and Indignation of all his neighbouring Princes, for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Inſults, Ravages, and Plunderings they are expoſed to in quartering Foreigners upon his Account? What Honour for that miſerable infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Prince to be complemented by the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with the empty Title of <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> and yet be over-ruled in all his Projects and Deſigns by their Generals, as is evident from their refuſing to attack <hi>Briancon</hi> and <hi>Queiras,</hi> where he might have put in ſtrong Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and from thence have ſummoned in the Countrey to bring in their Contributions, and have ordered every thing to better Advantage, and with more Reputation than he has done; and all this perhaps with as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40112:7"/>
little loſs as the taking of <hi>Guilleſtre</hi> and <hi>Ambrun,</hi> which he has been forct at laſt to quit ſhamefully? What Honour was it to him, that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> againſt his Conſent, and Remonſtrances to the contrary, ſhould commit ſuch horrid Barbarities by their burning and deſtroying, for which he and his half ruined Country muſt be accountable, to the utter Deſtruction of it; or at leaſt be forced to ſuch an Accommodation (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>French</hi> King be ſuperlatively generous) as will in all probability leave onely the empty Title of Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> to him and his Poſterity? To conclude, What Honour has it been to him, by the Importunities of his perfidious and impotent <hi>Allies,</hi> to perſiſt in his Stubbornneſs, and to refuſe ſo many good Overtures as have been made him, (ſince the loſs of all <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the perpetual Diſappointments of competent Succours ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticled for in the very Alliances between him, the Emperor, and <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c. after his moſt preſſing inſtances made for them at their reſpective Courts, and as many empty Promiſes from them,) and opportunities of healing himſelf again in due time, (the <hi>French</hi> King having proffered him blanks to write his own Conditions,) and this ſince he was, humanely ſpeaking, paſt all hopes of regaining any thing by the greateſt Oppoſition he could make? Since then 'tis evident that this Prince has engaged himſelf againſt his Honor and Intereſt, unleſs we will ſuppoſe him uncapable of the leaſt degree of good Senſe, and irrecoverably deſperate, he will not after ſo many fruitleſs Attempts, and the baſe Diſappointments of all that Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance promiſed him from the <hi>Empire, Spain,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> reject thoſe Offers which are now made him of an Accommodation by the <hi>Fr. King</hi> and his <hi>Holineſs.</hi> All that he can expect from the Confederacy is onely a little <hi>Subſiſtence-money,</hi> to act defenſively, ſince the <hi>French</hi> Forces daily augment upon him, and all imaginable Care is taken to ſtrengthen the Gariſons on that ſide by new Works, and to ſhut him out of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphine</hi> for the time to come. And ſince the reſt of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates have been hitherto, notwithſtanding their utmoſt Endeavours to encreaſe their Forces, inferiour to their Enemy, and he grows ſtronger, and they weaker, and out of condition either to repair his Loſſes, or prevent their own; there's no other Method left him, but either to comply, or fall diſhonourably and unpitied. There is no great difficulty to ſhew this to be the State of that deluded Prince, ſince all the World is convinc'd, that he had the beſt proſpect of diſembaraſſing his Affairs this laſt Campaign that ever he could or can expect: The P. of <hi>O.</hi> promiſed him to land an Army at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> thence to march into <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> to join him; as did likewiſe the K. of <hi>Spain. England</hi> by that <hi>caſual</hi> Advantage at Sea was entirely Miſtreſs in that Element all the year, (at leaſt for that purpoſe,) had a powerfull Navy wholly at leſſure ever ſince to proſecute it, there being no probability of any Oppoſition, and 16000 Men, with a vaſt Train of Artillery, and Munitions of both ſorts,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40112:8"/>
originally deſign'd for that Enterprize, which if it had been put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, would in the opinion of all Mankind have exerciſed the Fineneſs and Politicks of <hi>France,</hi> more than any thing that ever was, or can be attempted for the future. This, I ſay, was the onely nicking Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for <hi>Savoy,</hi> while the <hi>French</hi> were viſibly weak at Sea, and altogether unprovided to make any <hi>reſiſtence</hi> at Land on <hi>that ſide;</hi> but by what Fate I cannot tell, all theſe Proſpects utterly vaniſh'd, to the aſtoniſhment of all <hi>Europe,</hi> without leaving the leaſt Effect but want of Policy, and the indelible Character of a <hi>panick Fear,</hi> downright Cowardice or Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more than an Improbability of ever having the ſame opportunity again; beſides the ſad <hi>Prognoſtick,</hi> that all's running down on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates Side, and <hi>Providence</hi> clearly on that of <hi>France.</hi> As to what may be pretended, that the <hi>ſame Deſigns</hi> may be proſecuted the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is eaſy to urge that there's no manner of likelihood it can be, ſince 'tis well known that <hi>France</hi> will be provided of as good, or a much better Fleet than ſhe ever had, by that time; and that ſince the World is now convinced that they can and will fight, and dare attempt any thing; and that 44 of their Men of War were able to make good their parts againſt 99 of their Enemies, and with the Addition but of 20 more in all probability had worſted them; that a Fleet of the <hi>French</hi> by 20 inferior to the others, for the future will be match enough for them: Nay, if we may credit our foreign Advices, they'l have by the next Spring a Fleet every way equal to that of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> let them both build, and put out what they can make; and then it's a clear Caſe that the <hi>Deſign</hi> of landing an Army to join <hi>Savoy,</hi> or any where elſe on the <hi>French</hi> Coaſts, will be impracticable. But then again let us conſider, Is there any greater likelihood that the <hi>Confederates</hi> will be ſuperiour to the <hi>French</hi> by Land the enſuing Campaign than this laſt? They had made, we all know, their utmoſt Efforts in order to it before, and yet the Pr. of <hi>O.</hi> told the <hi>States</hi> at his parting, that the cauſe of all the miſcarriages of <hi>this</hi> laſt muſt be imputed to the <hi>Inferiority</hi> of their Forces to thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> and we may modeſtly ſuppoſe, that 30000 Men will hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit the <hi>Confederates</hi> Loſs, by the <hi>Sword, Sickneſs,</hi> and <hi>Deſertion;</hi> and that their <hi>Augmentation</hi> will not be near half part ſo great as that of their Enemy; ſo that they muſt be inferior yet in a double reſpect, both in Men, and Conduct; and if ſo, of doing leſs than ever: For <hi>France</hi> has not loſt a quarter part ſo many as <hi>they,</hi> and it's reaſonable enough to ſuppoſe they have raiſed near as many ſince the Campaign was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Account of the Deſcent from <hi>England,</hi> beſides the ſtanding regular Troops of <hi>Iriſh,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and other Provinces, that never came into any Service; and his Augmentation, beſides Recruits, our <hi>Monthly Account</hi> tells us will amount to above 40000 Men, (though
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40112:8"/>
I am inclined to think, by comparing the foreign Accounts, they cannot amount to much leſs than 80000.) Beſides, his <hi>Cavalry</hi> will be prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reinforced: We are told the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Mets, Treves,</hi> and <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> have engaged to procure him 20 or 30000 Horſes, which with the 2000 the Marqueſs <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> took from the <hi>Lunenburghers,</hi> thoſe taken by <hi>de Lorge</hi> in the Defeat of the Prince of <hi>Wirtenburgh,</hi> and which <hi>Bouffleurs</hi> drove away from the Territories of <hi>Liege, Bois le Duc,</hi> &amp;c, will be able to mount 40000 Men, without reckoning what <hi>France</hi> and all his new <hi>Conqueſts</hi> will afford him. Add to theſe laſt Conſiderations the <hi>vaſt Wealth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as may appear by the free Gift of ſeveral Provinces, the <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Edicts</hi> for erecting <hi>new Offices,</hi> (which we hear never want Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers,) <hi>Augmentations</hi> of <hi>Salaries,</hi> and his <hi>Standing Revenues,</hi> beſides the great Summs of Money, or Equivalents to Money, brought in by way of <hi>Contribution,</hi> the multitudes of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Prizes, the Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Warineſs and Sagacity of that Prince in providing all ſorts of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Proviſions for the uſe of the Fleet and Armies at the loweſt Rates, and managing all to the beſt Advantage; here are ſuch Funds laid up for the carrying on all his Deſigns, that humanely ſpeaking he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not readily miſcarry in the Execution of them, and ſuch a Proſpect of Succeſs as all the Power and Malice of the <hi>Confederates</hi> can never defeat. In ſhort, the Inference I draw from the Premiſes is this, That in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability <hi>Savoy</hi> muſt break off from his hitherto unfortunate <hi>Alliance,</hi> and ſubmit; that if he will doe it, it is his true and onely Intereſt; that his <hi>Allies</hi> have moſt ignominiouſly, and contrary to their Treaty expoſed him to Ruine, by failing in aſſiſting him in thoſe Enterpriſes which were moſt likely to ſerve him; by over-ruling his wiſeſt Reſolutions and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in managing the Expedition into <hi>Dauphine</hi> for his Advantage; that Confederates cannot obſtruct an Accommodation between him and <hi>France,</hi> neither can they propoſe to themſelves or him to be in a better condition to aſſiſt him, having loſt their onely Opportunity, and being leſs able to ſtand upon their own Defence for the future, much leſs to <hi>protect him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To return: As to the <hi>Confederates</hi> that are more contiguous, it being a Point of ſomewhat leſs Importance, though I firſt propoſed it, yet ſhall take leave to ſpeak to it now. I ſaid in reference to them, that they could not ſo eaſily enter upon a Treaty of a <hi>ſeparate Peace,</hi> without being liable to the Inſults of their neighbouring <hi>Allies:</hi> This is true; but then we ought to conſider what may be done in ſuch a Caſe, and that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and juſtly; if a <hi>Confederate Prince</hi> finds himſelf expoſed to the common Enemy, by the Negligence or Perfidiouſneſs of the reſt, <hi>(Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies</hi> generally importing mutual Defence and Protection,) in ſuch a Caſe common Reaſon and Equity will dictate that he is at liberty to make the beſt Proviſion he can for himſelf; and if upon reiterated Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Entreaties he finds no Relief, his Intereſt will compell him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40112:9"/>
to make the beſt Terms he can with his Enemy. So that all that can be pretended from the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Confederacy</hi> providing that no one of them ſhall make a ſeparate Peace, can be of no Obligation to any one of the <hi>Allies</hi> to expoſe himſelf to certain and miſerable Deſtruction againſt the Dictates of Reaſon and Self-preſervation, nor can any of the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates</hi> be ſuppoſed ſo devoid of all ſenſe of Juſtice to themſelves. All this being, as I humbly conceive, undeniable, we are in the next place to conſider what is proper to be done in ſuch inſtances in order to prevent their being treated by their Fellows as common Enemies, and then make a particular Application of it to thoſe of them who ſeem to be under ſuch Circumſtances as render it altogether neceſſary, and their onely Intereſt to act accordingly. In theſe Caſes the moſt ſecure Method is to join with their Enemy, or at leaſt to endeavour to maintain themſelves in a Neutrality; by which means they'll eaſily ſecure themſelves, and perhaps reap ſuch Advantages by a timely Conjunction with the prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſide, as may in a great meaſure compenſate their former Loſſes both from their new <hi>Allie,</hi> and their <hi>old ones</hi> too, in the concluding a Peace: by the former they'll be in a condition to make Repriſals on their perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſelf-intereſted <hi>Confederates,</hi> who compelled them, or wheedled them into the War to their great Detriment; or at leaſt be enabled with their <hi>new Allie</hi> to drive them to the neceſſity of making a Peace, from which they may exceedingly profit themſelves: By the latter maintain themſelves in preſent Security, and gain by both; which is far more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than to be devoured by their <hi>Friends</hi> and Enemy too. This is all I can imagine at preſent adviſable in this point; and this ſeems to be the preſent Caſe of ſome of the <hi>Allies,</hi> in particular the Bp. of <hi>Liege,</hi> the Elector Palatine, the Adminiſtrator of <hi>Wirtenbergh,</hi> the Electors of <hi>Treves</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> and the K. of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf. What Devaſtations have been in thoſe parts, and what Acquiſts the French have made, is too notorious to be recited here. How meanly the <hi>Confederates</hi> have acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in defending thoſe Countries, is ſo well known, particularly in relieving <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> when beſieged; in preventing Excurſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Territories of <hi>Liege,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Wirtenbergh, Juliers,</hi> &amp;c. is a Shame, and grand Reflexion upon them to recount. And what Motives ſhould induce theſe reſpective Princes to go on with the War is the greateſt riddle in the World. We have not one ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of their Councils yet in making one generous Attempt on this ſide, in attacking or relieving any place of Moment for theſe three years; ſo that hitherto they have done nothing anſwerable to the <hi>Deſigns</hi> they have given out, and <hi>common Expectation;</hi> and there are but ſmall hopes, as has been hinted already, that they will ever be more <hi>unanimous</hi> or <hi>capable.</hi> So that if theſe laſt mentioned <hi>Allies</hi> ſhould yet be inclinable to proceed with the War, it ſeems to be againſt all appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40112:9"/>
and what Prudence and Foreſight cannot perſuade them to ſubmit to, Time and Neceſſity will compell them, to their greater Diſhonour as well as Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to prove my firſt Aſſertion, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in <hi>England</hi> was the Contrivance of the <hi>Confederacy in general,</hi> and not the P. of <hi>O</hi>'s <hi>ſeparately</hi> from the reſt of the <hi>Allies,</hi> or effected by his <hi>ſole</hi> Intereſt, and inſiſted upon thoſe <hi>ſingular</hi> Advantages they propoſed to themſelves by it. But hitherto, I confeſs they have not obtained any but the firſt; they have indeed drained our Wealth, and occaſioned our Bloud to be ſpilt moſt profuſely; but as to their Acquiſts upon <hi>France,</hi> or regaining their former Loſſes, not a tittle is to be bragg'd of, they having not been able hitherto to defend themſelves: All <hi>Savoy</hi> gone, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont</hi> in danger, <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> with moſt of their Dependencies, in the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Flanders</hi> in a tottering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> Territories of <hi>Liege,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Werten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> moſt miſerably haraſſed and impoveriſhed: In a word, the State of the <hi>Confederacy</hi> ſo feeble in all parts, that although they had exerted their <hi>utmoſt</hi> this laſt Campaign, and given out ſtrange Reports of grand Attacks to be made upon <hi>France,</hi> nay in the <hi>ſenſible part</hi> too, they have been able to doe juſt nothing. So that inſtead of carrying on a <hi>vigorous War againſt</hi> France, and <hi>humbling</hi> her, they have ſtood merely upon the <hi>Defenſive,</hi> which is only to ſuffer and endure the Evils of War, Waging War implying aſſaulting, attacking, or offending; but nothing of this hitherto, unleſs lately in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> which has been ſenſibly retaliated in <hi>Germany, Liege,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and without all peradventure in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> unleſs prevented by a ſudden Compliance.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay to poor <hi>England?</hi> What Advantages will ſhe get by engaging her ſelf into the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and by the late <hi>Revolution?</hi> Why truly I believe it would puzzle Men and Angels too to name one at preſent; but ſince we are taught to call things by falſe names, I ſhall mention that preſumed and moſt celebrated one, <hi>The Happineſs of having a Prince of the greateſt Reputation in the whole World for Juſtice, Religion, Valour, Conduct, and an indefatigable Studiouſneſs in promoting the Good of his</hi> natural-born Subjects. This is an Advantage indeed, and no doubt worth the purchaſing at the deareſt Rate. Theſe are great Characters, I confeſs, and would be extremely charming, if as true as eaſily ſaid. If his <hi>Invading</hi> his Father's Throne was rather owing to the <hi>Contrivance</hi> of the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> than the Pretences he made in his Declaration; then it's manifeſt to all Mankind, that he acted ſuch a Maſter-piece of Injuſtice as can ſcarce be parallel'd, and beyond all Apology: To name ſome; he charged his Father and Mother with impoſing a ſuppoſititious Heir upon the three Kingdoms, which himſelf never made the leaſt doubt or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of, before he publiſhed his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and he had invaded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40112:10"/>
upon whoſe Birth he congratulated the King and Queen, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be prayed for by name in his own Chapel at the <hi>Hague,</hi> till a little before his Expedition hither; and although in the aforeſaid <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> he promiſed the Nation he would refer the Enquiry into the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and all things relating to it, and to the Right of <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> yet it's notoriouſly known, the Parliament never ſo much as went about it, nor himſelf ever moved it to them; neither could the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated Petitions and Deſires of a great many Perſons of Quality ever procure any ſuch Favour from them or him, to the great Diſſatisfaction of no inconſiderable part of this Kingdom. Beſides, let any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his <hi>Declaration</hi> with the <hi>Original Contract</hi> with him, or <hi>Inſtrument of Government</hi> ſince, and I chalenge all the World to produce ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Injuſtice, and Violation of Promiſes, as this <hi>pretended Saint,</hi> and <hi>Mirror</hi> of Juſtice has afforded us. And though three preceding Kings have been blackened by a ſet of Villains and Profligates, that are a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to all the reſt of Mankind, as <hi>Neroes, Julians,</hi> and Imps of Hell, to ſet off their <hi>dull, gloomy Hero;</hi> yet we may with truth defie them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch Inſtances of <hi>Arbitrarineſs,</hi> and <hi>Violation of Property,</hi> ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. as his four Years Tyranny have produced. It may be ſaid, I own, he is a ſevere Puniſher of <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Clippers;</hi> but then if we do but reflect what a neceſſity he has reduced ſome thouſands of People unto for want of Trade, and the ill Example he has given himſelf, by inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding three Crowns, and ſending the Wealth out of the Nation never to return again, and notwithſtanding cried up by the <hi>Theologo-Politicoes</hi> for a <hi>Saint,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> a <hi>Deliverer,</hi> &amp;c. he has contributed exceedingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the taking off the edge of all religious Reſtraint, and the ſearing Mens Conſciences, and confirming them in Wickedneſs; ſo that nothing but the Terror of civil Puniſhment remains to put a ſtop to all manner of Injuſtice: And ſince it's undoubted that by the ſevere Infliction of Puniſhment in ſuch Caſes he chiefly aims at his own Intereſt, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> and <hi>Tyrants</hi> ſeldom doe otherwiſe, I am affraid, notwithſtanding ſuch pretended <hi>Juſtice,</hi> he will hardly avoid the imputation of being guilty of their Bloud, as well as in a great meaſure acceſſory to their Crime. And I believe it will not be forgotten in haſte, how one poor Fellow laid his Death to his Charge at the very Gallows, as being the ſad occaſion of it; and prayed for his true Maſter, intimating, that if he had not been driven away, in all probability he had never come to that diſmal end. Again, let us call to mind the many Sham Plots that have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his Mirmidons, to keep up the Rankour and Malice of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt their King and his Friends, the illegal ſining of Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their known Abilities, contrary to the <hi>Inſtrument of Government</hi> be ſubſcribed as the Condition of his having the Crown, for meer Trifles, as drinking K. <hi>James</hi>'s Health, or praying for him; in murthering that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40112:10"/>
worthy Gentleman and excellent Chriſtian, Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> the poor Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Mr. <hi>Croſs;</hi> in ſuborning and protecting from Juſtice thoſe bloudy Raſcals, <hi>Blackhead, Young,</hi> and <hi>Fuller,</hi> Fellows that were elected out of all the Gaols in Town by one <hi>Pearſon,</hi> and at his Expence no doubt diſcharged of their Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterwards allowed Salaries on purpoſe to ſwear all that he hates or fears out of their Lives, when he thinks it expedient; the frequent illegal Impriſonments of Perſons of the greateſt Quality, as well as others, and by all that does appear to the contrary, himſelf alone being the <hi>Evidence, Accuſer,</hi> and <hi>Judge;</hi> his ſhamefully detaining the Soldiers and Seamens Pay, by miſapplying it, contrary to the very Acts of Parliament that granted it; his vaſt Debts to the Tranſport Ships ever ſince the beginning of the Revolution; the frequent Embargoes; the refuſal of Convoys to ſecure the publick Trade of the Nation, notwithſtanding the Cuſtom and vaſt Taxes granted upon that, as well as any other Account; the ordering the publick Monies to contrary uſes in general than originally deſign'd, againſt the frequent Promiſes in his Speeches to both Houſes of Parliament: Theſe are ſuch notorious Violations of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that we may with as much Truth give him the Reputation of the handſomeſt Man in the World, as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then again for his <hi>Religion:</hi> According to the Rules of Method I ſhould have mentioned it firſt; but it's no great matter whether it be conſidered firſt or laſt, or indeed at all. What mortal <hi>Wight</hi> can tell what <hi>Religion</hi> he is of; or rather, Is it not a contradiction to ſay he has any? It's impoſſible he ſhould be of the Communion of the true Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> which he found eſtabliſhed by Law, becauſe he perſecutes thoſe with the utmoſt Violence he can, whoſe <hi>Defence</hi> he made one of the moſt ſpecious <hi>Pretences</hi> in his Declaration. <hi>Decl. Parag.</hi> 15. and ſo readily conſented to the rooting out <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſettled by ſeveral Acts of <hi>Convocation</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> and though he with his uſual Arts of Diſſimulation ſeemed to be very ſqueamiſh, when he came to that Clauſe of the <hi>Scotch Coronation Oath, We ſhall be carefull to root out Hereticks,</hi> by declaring <hi>he did not mean by thoſe Words that he was under any Obligation to become a Perſecuter,</hi> yet never made any ſcruple to ſet on foot and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage one of the moſt violent Perſecutions we ever read of againſt the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Clergy there. Neither can we indeed with any certainty deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to what ſide he is really moſt inclined, whether the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Epiſcoparian,</hi> he conſtantly varying his Favours to either, according to the Emergencies of his preſent Intereſts in <hi>Scotland</hi> itſelf. Sometimes he would ſeem to have good Inclinations towards the <hi>Epiſcopal Party,</hi> when he has any juſt reaſon either to fear them or careſs them; for we are all ſenſible enough that the main Body of the Nobility and Gentry, and the better ſort even of the Commonalty of that Kingdom, are moſt addicted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40112:11"/>
to them, and though in the hurry and Confuſion of Affairs there in the beginning of the Revolution, to gain the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> and other <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> he under hand encouraged them to fall upon the Biſhops and regular Clergy in a tumultuous manner, which was the moſt bleſſed juncture they could wiſh to vent their innate Malice, and over boiling Zeal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Party they hated, if poſſibly, more than the Devil himſelf, that he might have an opportunity to make good his Engagements to thoſe their Agitators, who had been for ſome years plotting and juggling with him in <hi>Holland,</hi> to bring about this <hi>Great Deliverance;</hi> yet finding at length the impoſſibility of maintaining his Intereſt there upon that foot, he has ſeveral times endeavoured by his Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to procure an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation between them, by ſettling ſome of the Epiſcopal Clergy in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reſolving, no doubt, aſſoon as he can conveniently, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine himſelf for that Party which he can moſt ſafely rely upon. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has his Management here in <hi>England</hi> been much different; he found the greateſt part of the Nation addicted to the Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as eſtabliſhed by Law, and ſome of their Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines oppoſite in the higheſt degree to his Deſigns; therefore like a <hi>true Machiaveliſt,</hi> he found it abſolutely neceſſary to bring thoſe Principles into Diſreputation, and extirpate them, if poſſible, right or wrong; and to this purpuſe ſet up the noted <hi>Latitudinarian Gang,</hi> by the eaſie Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Favour, and the aſſurance of the beſt Preferments, to decoy the reſt of their Brethren into a ready Compliance with him, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in their Preachings and Writings confeſſed and owned their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Errours to the People, and in a ſhort time rendred their ſo much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Nonreſiſtence</hi> the moſt ridiculous Doctrine and dangerous Error in the World, gave us new Comments on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. telling us that higher Powers muſt be obeyed, without any regard to <hi>lawfull</hi> or <hi>unlawfull;</hi> that <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> were all one; that in ſome Caſes it is lawful to violate the Commandments of God; that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and the <hi>publick Good</hi> knew no Relations; that it is lawful to ſwear with Reſervation, or to take publick Oaths in private ſenſes; that an Oath to the preſent Government did not interfere with the former to K. <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, any Pretences in the beginning were allowed and admitted of, provided they could but hook them into the intereſt of the Government, and bring them off in ſome meaſure from their former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; ſo firmly had it been reſolved by this Gentleman, and his <hi>Cabinet,</hi> to ruine the old Church of <hi>England,</hi> and let looſe her Diſcipline, and by all imaginable Arts and Devices to render her odious and contemptible. Neither has this wicked and atheiſtical Project wanted its Succeſs; in a moment of time her Face was ſo altered, and ſcarce to be known again, her Prieſthood perjured and turn'd ſchiſmatical, and like Renegades, their new Zeal and Malice boil'd up to that degree, that the Liturgy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40112:11"/>
muſt be alter'd, her ancient Creeds expung'd, her Ceremonies leſt at liberty, or laid aſide, and a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> eſtabliſhed for bringing all their <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> the <hi>Gifted Coblers, Tirkers, Taylors, &amp;c.</hi> with the Foreign Reformed <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> into Church-Preferments; all the <hi>Fences</hi> and <hi>Hedges</hi> muſt be pull'd down in order to unite theſe Brethren in Iniquity againſt the common Enemy, tho' indeed the only deſign was to extirpate and run down thoſe Principles, which whenever it pleaſes God Almighty to pull off the Scales of the Eyes of the honeſt and well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tho' deluded People of this Nation would ſet his Worſhip a packing, notwithſtanding that Security which he has promiſed himſelf from thoſe horrid Perjuries he has been the occaſion of, and which themſelves in all their common Diſcourſes own to have ſo little Obligation, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call <hi>Garriſon Oaths.</hi> Thus having, as far as poſſible he could, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the True Old Church of <hi>England,</hi> and erected a new One upon a mere civil Baſis, ſuch as 'tis, of Rebellion, Perjury and Uſurpation, and rendered it impoſſible to retrieve the Diſcipline of the Church, and her Sacred Offices during his Government here; the next thing he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours is to profit himſelf of all Parties in Religion (notwithſtanding his popular Pretence of uniting them all againſt the common Enemy, <hi>viz.</hi> Popery,) to this purpoſe he ſtudies privately to daſh them one againſt the other, by reviving old Stories under the former Reigns, and to keep up ſome <hi>neceſſary Feuds</hi> amongſt them, for fear of a good Underſtanding, and Uunion, perhaps in time to throw him out of the Saddle, when once they perceive their true Intereſt; and therefore never omits to careſs them, as his only Friends he can rely upon when he has a proſpect of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a particular Advantage upon them, as in the management of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Mayors, Sheriffs, and Aldermen in the City of <hi>London,</hi> (and in the <hi>Elections</hi> of Burgeſſes for <hi>Parliament</hi> all over the Nation) is too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to be inſiſted upon, in order to oblige them to lend or grant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When one Party begins to grow cold and indifferent, by Diſappointments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then he underhand applies himſelf to another, and by ſtirring up Animoſities and Quarrels among them, caſts Miſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes, that being intent upon their private Revenge, and little Plots and Contrivances one againſt another, they may take the leſs cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the more publick Concerns, and be the more eager and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of ſerving him, in hopes of drawing him in to favour and aſſiſt their Party. Thus he plays Tricks, and juggles with Religion, and that is the moſt Orthodox which conduces moſt to the eſtabliſhing himſelf in the Government, and is always ready to vary his Religion with his <hi>Fortune,</hi> let it be what it will; and I dare engage <hi>Arch John,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Johns</hi> ſhall readily concur with him at any time to ſet up what Religion he pleaſes, provided it will ſute their Turn, as well as his. But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more to this Point afterwards, and therefore ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40112:12"/>
to enquire, whether <hi>Valour</hi> ought to be admitted as an Ingredient of his Reputation.</p>
            <p>And as to this Quality, which I muſt grant never wants its Charms to get into the Affection of the Nobleſt as well as Popular and Meaneſt Minds; I would fain know what Right he can put in for it? or what gallant Proofs he has given of Perſonal Bravery, eſpecially ſince his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt us? The Victory at the <hi>Boyne</hi> indeed has made a great Noiſe among his deluded bigotted Mob: But its well known he never ran the leaſt risk in it, or paſs'd the River (which was the greateſt danger) till moſt of the Army were over, nor ever was within reach of, much leſs <hi>gently kiſs'd</hi> with a Cannon-Ball, or received the leaſt hurt there, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Paraſitical <hi>Mufti,</hi> and the pretended Thankſgiving Prayer roar'd out among the Mob by his Atheiſtical Prieſts, a clear Evidence of his and their Religion to dare to affront Heaven ſo profanely, meerly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the poor Innocent Sheep, as if they believed there was no God to take Vengeance of ſuch open Blaſphemies, as well as of the reſt of their Impieties. Juſt ſuch a ſilly Story we had of his Deliverance laſt Year, when he lay encam'd near <hi>Beaumont,</hi> of a Bullet that fell in the very place where he ſtood under an Oak the very inſtant after he went from it, tho' I have been inform'd it was ſeveral Hours after, which was cryed up too for a Signal Deliverance. And as to the Engagement at <hi>Steinkirk,</hi> tho' all the <hi>Dutch Courants</hi> are full of Encomiums of his Bravery in leading up of Battalion after Battalion, and of Thankſgivings, and many Godly Ejaculations for his wonderful Deliverance, we never for all that could be aſſur'd he was in the Action at all, or in the leaſt Danger; and ſome who had reaſon enough to know, poſitively aſſert he was not. So that theſe are all nonſenſical ſilly Stories, made on purpoſe to keep up the Hearts of the King-making Rabble, and to inſtil into their credulous Minds, that eaſily digeſt every Report that makes for their Side, without conſidering the Truth or Probability of what they hear, and to preſerve the Reputation of their Idol's being the Darling of Heaven; and two or three ſuch whisking Romances is all the return for four Millions <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and all we muſt look for.</p>
            <p>As little as we have to alledg for his Perſonal <hi>Valour,</hi> and Bravery, yet I am ſure much leſs can be produc'd for his pretended Maſterpeice <hi>Conduct,</hi> which we are all told ſtrikes ſuch Terrour on all occaſions into the <hi>French King.</hi> Pray what Inſtances have we of it? As to the Buſineſs at the <hi>Boyne,</hi> the grand Divertiſement for the <hi>Bartholomew Mob,</hi> and not worthy to be taken notice of any way elſe, all ſenſible People are convinc'd that advantage was got by mere Treachery, by the <hi>Germans</hi> laying down their Arms, and abſolutely refuſing to fight, conſequently betraying their Poſts, and that <hi>Arch-Traytor Hamilton</hi> his, the Treachery of both giving ſuch reaſon of Diſtruſt to the poor Iriſh, that they turning Tail, the General
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40112:12"/>
Officers with much ado perſuaded the King to comſent to a Retreat, and leave the Field to his uſurping Son-in-law, though with ſuch Order, that the <hi>great Hero,</hi> with his crue of <hi>Rebels,</hi> could not do any conſiderable Damage upon them, or have the Honour of a purſuit to any effect; and beſides, as his <hi>own Officers</hi> are not affraid to own, after <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s death, a ſenſible want of Conduct attended all his Enterpriſes all the remaining Campaign. Was ever any thing more weakly undertaken than the Siege of <hi>Limerick,</hi> more fooliſhly and inexpertly attackt? Or did ever any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under ſuch an <hi>incomparable General</hi> come off ſo baſely? What war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Policy to undertake ſuch a piece of Work without heavy Canon and Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to commit them to the care of ſo ſlender a Guard? To loſe about 8000 Men to no purpoſe, and at laſt through a pannick fear to run away <hi>incognito</hi> from his Army, and ſteal over in a <hi>Meal-boat?</hi> He who never ſaw Siege in his Life might have managed it in all points to better purpoſe; and yet, to our mortal Grief, all this owing to the ſage Management and Bravery of our <hi>Hogan Mogan William.</hi> But the next <hi>Campaign</hi> muſt make Amends for former overſights: The P. of <hi>O.</hi> was to be early at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to conſult in all haſte of the moſt effectual means to humble the Pride of <hi>France,</hi> and while a parcel of grave, dull <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> were ſucking their Whiskers, and ſtuffing their Paunches, the <hi>grand Hector of</hi> France had the confidence to ſit down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mons.</hi> The noiſe of this bold Attempt reaching the Ears of the Butterboxes, and the Proſound <hi>thinking Noddle</hi> of the <hi>Britannick Hero,</hi> away he goes to <hi>Hall,</hi> and before he could bethink himſelf what to doe, or get out of his Amuzement, the Town was ſurrendred; which ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded his Intellectuals, and ſtunn'd his conſidering Pate, that he never could come to any Reſolution what to doe the whole <hi>Campaign</hi> after; but <hi>march'd</hi> and <hi>counter march'd</hi> from place to Place, <hi>advancing, retiring,</hi> and <hi>running away,</hi> till he had ſpent all his Money and Proviſions, and cunningly took his leave of the Army as ſoon as he perceived <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> had pounded 'em up near <hi>Leuſe,</hi> and was ready to give them a Parting Blow, nois'd it about immediately after, that this Miſcarriage was owing to the Miſconduct of the Generals in his abſence, the cowardly <hi>French</hi> taking the Advantage of it, and ſo returned to his Parliament, and told them, <hi>That truly the</hi> French <hi>King was very powerfull.</hi> And yet we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in the beginning of that Summer it was rumour'd about that <hi>Mons</hi> was to be retaken, <hi>Dinant</hi> or <hi>Philipville</hi> beſiged, the French Army to be beaten, the <hi>Confederates</hi> having got together a much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Army than the Enemy, who was reported all along that <hi>Campaign</hi> to be hard put to it for want of Money, Forrage, Proviſions, and the Lord knows what; but then, as Miſchief would have it, they always had the luck to be ſo ſtrongly intrencht, (which our unthinking Slaves were made to believe was out of fear to be attackt by his <hi>Britannick</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40112:13"/>
asy the call him, and his Bear-skins,) that the <hi>Confederates</hi> could not come at them; as if that could be a Diſgrace to the <hi>French,</hi> which was ever the Glory of the greateſt Generals, to encamp themſelves ſo as not to be compelled to fight without a great Advantage, eſpecially when infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in Forces, and merely defenſive, which is well known was <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>'s Caſe all along the two laſt Summer Campaigns; and yet in the former of theſe, though much inferiour in number, he made a ſhift to fall upon their Rear, and put them to the rout, killing a conſiderable number, and taking divers Priſoners, and to conclude the <hi>Campaign</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; and this laſt, by a ſudden March to take Poſſeſſion of the very Ground, where there was plenty of Forage that was untoucht, which our brave <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> deſigned for his Army, who wanted it exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, entrencht himſelf; and in regard it could not be well avoided but our <hi>Proteſtant Knight Errant</hi> muſt either paſs that way, or march round about, (which would have proved a horrid Diſgrace to him,) by this means forced him to attack him with his own Men, his Allies poſitively refuſing to ſecond him, and looking on the whole time; himſelf in the mean time being ſenſible of the great danger, and very prudently keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of harms way: So that this attacking of the Enemy was mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effect of an abſolute neceſſity of his doing ſomething, though to no purpoſe, and the Conduct and Foreſight of the <hi>Crook-backt General,</hi> as this <hi>Thirſites</hi> call'd him, and his own Folly beſides in making an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable (and ought to be an unpardonable) Experiment too, in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing the Lives of ſo many thouſands of <hi>Engliſh, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> to make an empty flaſh, and to keep up the undue Opinion of his Valour among the abuſed <hi>Mob;</hi> for in one word all the Politicks he is guilty of lies in careſſing them; and ſo little ſenſe he has, that ſo long as he can keep them on his ſide, he concludes all is ſafe and well. Here is conduct with a Vengeance, and puts me in mind of a ſhort paſſage in an excellent Author, who comparing <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> together, writes thus: <hi>The Prudence of a General has two parts; the firſt reſpects the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Forces, and the other the Deſtruction of his Enemies.</hi> Alexander <hi>was defective in the former, becauſe he frequently led his Army into places where they ſometimes dyed of Hunger, or Thirſt, or by Stones, (as in ſome narrow Paſſages, with Mountains on each ſide,) where he was forced to engage his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at all Diſadvantages of Ground,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and conſequently brought his Men oftentimes merely to be butchered: Wherefore that Speech of the</hi> grand Scipio <hi>will ever be applauded,</hi> That he had rather ſave one Citizen, than ſlay a thouſand of his Enemies. <hi>Again,</hi> Alexander <hi>was wanting in the ſecond; for whereas two things are neceſſary to the Deſtruction of an Enemy, Force and Conduct, he ordinarily depended upon, and ſucceeded by the former; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of</hi> Caeſar; <hi>for aſmuch as he took as much care of his Men, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Family, nor ever went upon any Enterpriſe without great Stores of</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40112:13"/>
               <hi>Proviſions and all Neceſſaries; if he had not Corn enough he made it up with Fleſh, and having an advantage over his Enemy, choſe rather to defeat him by Policy than the Sword: and in all occaſions endeavoured to add Induſtry to his Force.</hi> This is but one part of the Compariſon of theſe two Great Men, and ſince our Boobies will be thought to have made a wiſe Choice of their King, as they call him, and he muſt be a great Champion, let him be dreſt up with all the Imperfections of <hi>Alexander,</hi> with whom they are pleaſed ſo often to compare him; for I am ſure nothing really honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and commendable in that Great Man can ever ſute their puny <hi>Hector:</hi> and then for a Concluſion, let them but be ſo juſt withal, as to apply the Character of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to his Adverſary, and judg what they may expect for the future from either.</p>
            <p>Another famous Inſtance of his Military Policy is the tender Care he takes in making Proviſion for, and paying his Soldiers by Sea and Land. It's not unknown to us all what numbers of Seamen died of ſtrange and unaccountable Diſeaſes the firſt Summer after this <hi>Revolution,</hi> through his notable Frugality in furniſhing the Navy for the moſt part with old and decayed Stores, and that abominable Lie that was ſpread abroad in excuſe of it, that their Meat and Salt were poiſoned with Nutgalls; whereas all Phyſicians will grant, if a quantity of them was really mixt with them they could not produce ſuch Effects, but would rather have proved an excellent Medicine to have prevented, or cured the Bloody or any other Fluxes; which were very frequent among them, being a great Aſtringent. But not to inſiſt upon this ſenſeleſs Story, theſe old Stores however decayed were thought a good expedient to ſave Money to hire Foreigners and many other neceſſary uſes. What Care did he take to ſend over Proviſions for the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereof at leaſt ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand periſhed through want of all manner of Neceſſaries, and were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to leap at what our very Dogs would refuſe, while the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other Foreigners, wanted nothing, but were fat, and well liking? And becauſe this Prince muſt be call'd and own'd as <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the Confederate Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and all Advantages againſt the Enemy there aſcribed to his Conduct, ſo it is not unreaſonable to lay all the Miſcarriages there to his Charge, as Evidences of his ſiniſter Conduct. Whence proceeded that great ſcarcity nay abſolute want of all ſorts of Proviſions, even of <hi>Tents</hi> and <hi>Straw,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Campaign,</hi> which occaſioned a great deal of Sickneſs, and the Death of many Men and Horſes, but from his Negligence, or want of Money to provide them, which is as inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable as the other; ſince that General who will go upon any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize without all things neceſſary, has been ever condemn'd as raſh, and void of all Military Prudence? What a Reflection is it upon the Politicks of this <hi>Mighty Warrior</hi> to be unprovided in the beginning of that <hi>Annus Mirabilis,</hi> which raiſed the expectations of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and was to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40112:14"/>
decide the Fate of all <hi>Europe,</hi> when he had engaged himſelf to be early in the Field, and ſeem'd reſolute to oppoſe the French in all they could pretend to; and yet tamely to ſtand ſtaring at the Head of 100000 Men, without making the leaſt Attempt to raiſe the Seige of <hi>Namur,</hi> the moſt important Town in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> or to give the leaſt Diverſion; and to ſerve only for an Evidence of one of the braveſt Actions that ever was perform'd by any Prince, and that indelible Diſhonour and Loſs to him and his Allies, which they in all likelyhood can never retrieve. Now, I ſay, the P. of <hi>O.</hi> committing ſo great an Overſight in not making timely and competent Proviſions for his Army in ſuch a difficult time of the Year, his Army muſt be more than ordinarily fatigu'd, diſpirited, and unfit for Action, and never ready on the ſudden to act offenſively or defenſively; and one thing which argues this was not a ſingle Error, but a perpetual Miſcarriage on the Confederates ſide all this War, is, That whereas the Foreign Prints have conſtantly given us an Account of the early and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Preparations of the French all this War, they ſeldom afford us the like Inſtances in the <hi>Confederates:</hi> let the true Reaſon lie where it will, its an Argument of a double Weakneſs, and that their Succeſs, whenever they have any, is an effect of Chance, and not of their Politicks and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. For want of timely and ſuitable Preparations for an Enterprize, its odds but it muſt miſcarry, eſpecially when it cannot be relieved by Prudence or Stratagem; and how ſagacious he is at a dead Lift let the World bear him witneſs, unleſs it be in throwing his Miſcarriages upon others, without any regard to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> We have not found yet that he has been early enough out either by Sea or Land, but onely by a <hi>meer Accident</hi> at Sea this laſt Year, the croſsneſs of the Winds favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is an Advantage he cannot always promiſe himſelf; and had it not been for that, in all Humane Probability, he would have for ever loſt all opportunity of playing the Fool again.</p>
            <p>But this is not the onely Defect remarkable in the P. of <hi>O.</hi> as to <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Prudence,</hi> (or Providence,) but his <hi>Pay</hi> has been all along bad. Money is called the <hi>Nerves,</hi> and the <hi>Belly</hi> of War; the Nerves becauſe it gives Motion to, and maintains Armies in their Motion; (hence <hi>Thucidides</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that few of the <hi>Grecians</hi> in reſpect of the extent of their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries went to the Wars againſt <hi>Troy,</hi> and could never keep themſelves long together, through want of Money; and that the People of the <hi>Morea</hi> made ſhort <hi>Campaigns</hi> upon that account. It's generally for Money and Subſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that Men liſt themſelves into the Wars, and when once that fails, they ſenſibly grow weary and dead hearted;) and it's properly call'd the <hi>Belly</hi> of War, becauſe like as the Belly diſtributes Nouriſhment to all parts of the Animal, ſo does Money to an Army. How far this P. has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged himſelf in this Point, no Body is ignorant from the higheſt to the loweſt amongſt us. The preſent Arrears to the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> is an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40112:14"/>
Inſtance of Injuſtice without Parallel. Men that had ventured their Lives, and indured all the Hardſhips poſſible for Humane Nature to ſuſtain, in hopes at leaſt of good Pay, if not ſharing the Country for their Service, having never received any other than a little Subſiſtence Money, and forced thereby to commit all the Villanies in the World, by Plundering and Murdering, to the Deſtruction of near a third part of the People, and three parts in four of the natural Riches and Product of the Countrey; and at laſt told by their Officers they muſt never expect their <hi>Arrears,</hi> but exact Pay for the time to come, and then immediately to be tranſported to <hi>Flanders</hi> to be made <hi>Forlorns,</hi> is ſuch a Monument of Inhumanity as we can ſcarce find in Hiſtory, though at the ſame time a <hi>juſt Reward</hi> from God for their <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt their <hi>Lawful King,</hi> who ever tender'd them as his Children, there being not one part of four alive of all thoſe Villains who had ſo baſely deſerted him, and betrayed him. This Matter of Fact about the <hi>Arrears,</hi> if occaſion ſhould require, will be readily acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome hundreds of Officers, particularly by <hi>Colonel Bierly,</hi> whoſe Caſe being ſingular, I ſhall beg leave to inſert it, which in ſhort is this; The Colonel was a Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune, and formerly very zealous for the P. of <hi>O</hi>'s Intereſt, and <hi>Colonel</hi> of a Regiment of Horſe from firſt to laſt, and hath expended between 5 and 6000 <hi>l.</hi> of his Eſtate in his Service, and there being an Arrear of above 4000 <hi>l.</hi> due to him; for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Months he ſolicited diligently for it, but without Succeſs: in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he told the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Treaſury</hi> that his private Affairs obliged him to go into the Countrey to ſettle them, having been ſo long abſent, therefore deſired that he might know whether he might expect an <hi>Order</hi> for his <hi>Arrears</hi> or not, and he would ſtay a Week longer to adjuſt that Buſineſs. The Lords Commiſſioners told him that he might go into the Countrey when he pleaſed, for he was to expect nothing from them, for they had no <hi>Orders</hi> to pay any <hi>Arrears:</hi> So he's gone into the Countrey, where he ſpares no occaſions to ſet forth the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of him, who was never guilty of doing a <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>honourable</hi> Action in his whole Life. What a Scandal and burning Shame is it, that the poor Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (whereof a great many have two or three Years <hi>Arrears</hi> due to them, and all the reſt proportionably, having been expoſed to all Dangers, kept out at Sea, and on Shipboard, longer than ever was known, and been inſtrumental of that <hi>Grand Deliverance</hi> he had only to brag of in his <hi>Speech)</hi> ſhould be defrauded of their Pay; nay, not having ſo much as Subſiſtence Money; and yet tied up to the Service by ſevere and repeated Proclamations, without and againſt all former Precedents, oblig'd to be at Sea moſt part of this Winter, and utterly forbidden their ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of making a ſhort Voyage or two to get Bread for their poor Wives and Families, who having Bankrupt their former Credit with Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, Bakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are forc'd to beg and ſtarve! This is ſuch a Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40112:15"/>
as they and their Fore-fathers never knew before, and ſuch a Yoke as none but a <hi>Dutch Bore</hi> could ever have fixed upon Engliſh Necks. The Cowardly, and juſtly to be abominated <hi>Dutch</hi> by all of our Nation, after the Defeat at Sea two Years agoe, were taken into our Hoſpitals before any of our Countreymen were put in, tenderly provided for, and had a Gratuity given by the <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> for their Encouragement, were entertained, and got Money from all ſorts of People; and beſides all this, This <hi>Gracious Governeſs</hi> promiſed to refit all their diſabled Ships at the publick Charge, to have Penſions for the Widows of the Men that were loſt in the Fight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may be ſeen in the <hi>London Gazette</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 21. 90, in the Article from the <hi>Hague, July</hi> 25. <hi>On the</hi> 22d <hi>Mr.</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord <hi>arrived here from</hi> England, <hi>and the ſame Evening had Audience of the States General,—to whom he repreſented, that he was commanded by the Queen to let them know how much her Majeſty was concerned at the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that had befall'n their Squadron, in the late Engagement, and that their not being ſeconded as they ought to have been, which Matter her Majeſty had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be examined into, in order to recompence thoſe that had done their Duty, and to puniſh ſuch as ſhould be found to have deſerv'd it. That her Majeſty had given Orders for the refitting the Dutch Ships that were diſabled, at her own Charge, and had commanded that all poſſible care ſhould be taken of the ſick and wounded Seamen, and that Rewards ſhould be given to the Widows of thoſe that were killed, behaving themſelves bravely in the Fight, to encourage thoſe that do well for the future.</hi> Here is a ſtrange Partiality and Tenderneſs for the <hi>Dutch, Rewards for their Widows, Encouragement</hi> promiſed to thoſe of them that ſhall <hi>do well for the future,</hi> beſides particular <hi>Care</hi> of their <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>wounded</hi> in our Hoſpitals; while our own Men were permitted to periſh for want of neceſſary looking after, and under the unskilful Hands of Country <hi>Chyrurgions</hi> little better than the Country <hi>Farriers.</hi> What Inſtances of ſuch <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to the poor <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which are numberleſs in <hi>Wapping, Chatham,</hi> and many other of our Ports, who never as yet could get the juſt Arrears due to their Deceaſed Husbands; and yet which is moſt barbarous and unjuſt, the <hi>Dutch</hi> muſt have <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Encouragements</hi> out of our Pay, whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are neglected and permitted to ſtarve. This is a Specimen of the Affection our New Governours have for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and a clear Forerunner of our Slavery, if God Almighty does not timely prevent it, which none but a degenerous and infatuated People to their own Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ever ſuffer themſelves to groan under? But this is not all, the ancient Encouragement of <hi>Smart-Money</hi> to the wounded is moſt frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently detain'd, the maim'd expoſed to meer Beggary, for want of their uſual <hi>Penſions</hi> paid to them by the reſpective <hi>Counties</hi> they belong to, and are become a publick <hi>Nuſance</hi> in our <hi>Cities</hi> and great <hi>Towns.</hi> What is become of the wounded and maimed in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:40112:15"/>
who, no doubt, were very numerous? God only knows; the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conjecture is, they are either ſuffered to periſh abroad, by being refuſed Paſſage Home, or knock'd on the Head to ſave their Pay, and that they might not come Home and tell Tales of their hard Uſage, to the diſcouraging their <hi>Fellow Slaves</hi> from entring upon the Service. The Story of 50 wounded <hi>Engliſh</hi> being burnt in a Barn by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> at the Command of the P. of <hi>O.</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the abſolute refuſal of an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Officer, who had ſome remains of Compaſſion and natural Affection for his own Countrey men, is real matter of Fact, and ought not to be forgotten; which was done, as is ſaid, meerly to avoid the <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Charge</hi> of curing them. Theſe are ſome of the Hardſhips the Soldiery groan under, and a Specimen of the <hi>Brutiſh Temper</hi> as well as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npolitick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of our <hi>

What Glorious Atchievements can he ever pretend to do with Soldiers, who muſt in due time (if there be ſo much Mercy reſerved in Heaven, have their Eyes open'd, ſee their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) and reſent ſuch ill Uſage and Partiality? However our dull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking <hi>Bigots</hi> may flatter themſelves with great expectations of what he has moſt ſillily given out in his <hi>Speech</hi> to <hi>both Houſes,</hi> of his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make a Deſcent, and do Miracles in <hi>France;</hi> the Soldiery are of the contrary Opinion, and through meer Deſpair of ever getting their Pay, or effecting any thing upon their Enemy, have deſerted conſiderably, and really entertain low and mean Thoughts of his <hi>Conduct,</hi> ſee through the Cheat; and are only hindred by the ſtrictneſs of his Diſcipline from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unanimouſly to their Old and Beſt Maſter. They own, as many as get over, that they are hated in <hi>Flanders,</hi> abuſed at all rates by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> expoſed upon all accounts as <hi>Forlorns:</hi> They can tell you how divers of their Officers were caſhier'd, and Soldiers hang'd immediately after the Battle at <hi>Steinkirk,</hi> for avoiding being knock'd on the Head by the <hi>French,</hi> when a numerous Army ſtood looking on, and not one ſingle Troop or Company permitted (though ſome of the Engliſh deſired it, and were ready to hazard their Lives to reſcue their poor Countrey-men) to go in to their aſſiſtance. By ſeveral Letters from Officers in <hi>Flanders</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, we have been informed, how the poor wounded Men, thro' the intolerable Pains they endured, curs'd and damn'd to the Pit of Hell, with their laſt Breaths, <hi>him</hi> who brought them to that <hi>horrid Butchery.</hi> They can tell you likewiſe what great Numbers deſerted his Service im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Fight, chooſing rather to run the hazard of being hang'd, and looſing all their <hi>Pay</hi> and <hi>Arrears</hi> than to continue in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They can tell you how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are univerſally hated by the Countrey People there, that they I ſcarce let them have Neceſſaries for their Money, and that the <hi>Flanderkins</hi> have more reſpect for the Enemy than for their pretended Friends the <hi>Allies,</hi> and much better uſage for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40112:16"/>
them. They can tell you that their Wounded and Priſoners, that fell into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> were more kindly treated by them than among their Friends; and how far ſuch Uſage may work upon the Minds of a People naturally Generous, though at preſent bereav'd of their Senſes, Time may demonſtrate. They can tell you how the P. of <hi>O.</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued and nos'd by the <hi>Confederates</hi> in general, diſtruſted by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> deſpiſed by the Inhabitants in all the Cities and Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and hated by all, and for want of thoſe Qualifications we are made to admire, and ſo fooliſhly and ſuperabundantly have hitherto magnified in him. What wonder then is it that our Engliſh Seamen and Soldiers mutiny, run away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they can neither get their Pay, nor good Words but at a dead lift; if they modeſtly demand their own, though incited to it by the keeneſt Neceſſity, they are immediately hanged or ſhot to Death without the leaſt Remorſe or Pity! Had we ever ſuch unjuſt Acts of Parliament made in any Kings Reigns, for enſlaving and puniſhing of Seamen or Landmen, as ſince this <hi>Revolution;</hi> ſo many brave Men hang'd or ſhot to Death for Triſles; ſuch Kidnapping our Landmen, under pretence for Sea Service, and ſent the Lord knows whither? Nay, I am credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it has been no unuſual thing to preſs Landmen, and ſell them for 3 <hi>l.</hi> a Head to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or into other <hi>Foreign</hi> Service. What Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy can be made for the wicked abuſes of the <hi>Mariners,</hi> a parcel of brave young Fellows, who were kept on Board till they were almoſt all dead of the Small-Pox and other Diſtempers, the remainder cheated of and denied their Pay, and then forced in a ſickly and moſt pitious Condition to beg from door to door, as <hi>London</hi> and other Places can ſufficiently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify? To recount all the Miſeries of our diſtreſſed Countreymen, who are actually engaged under this Government, would be an endleſs Task; all I ſhall add under this Head, is, that this ill Uſage looks more like the effect of Malice, and a perfect Hatred, and Diſtruſt, than of any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity upon our Governous; but if it be, our Condition is deplorable and remedileſs, by all the Supplies we are able to give, though never ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and without our moſt juſt and preſent Reſentments, a certain Forerunner of inevitable Ruine; but if we have but one grain of Senſe, or Reflection left, and be not benumb'd all over, an infallible Indication of the Stupidity of the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the beſotted and dull <hi>Confederates;</hi> and what the effects of ſuch Politicks may be, with relation to himſelf, I leave to the Judgments of all ingenuous Men to conjecture.</p>
            <p>Thus we find his Politicks are by no means adequate to his Deſigns, or proportionable to thoſe great Undertakings, his Reputation, and the neceſſity of his Affairs, as well as of theſe three Kingdoms unhappily under his Management, do abſolutely require: and in reference to this laſt particular, I ſhall now enquire, whether an indefatigable and ſincere ſtudiouſneſs to promote the <hi>publick Good</hi> of theſe Nations, ought to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40112:16"/>
admitted as a juſt Ingredient of his Character or Reputation: I need not much enlarge upon this Point, the direct contrary being eaſily dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from what has been ſaid all along, onely for the aſſiſtance of our Memories ſhall recapitulate. Our Conſtitution both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> are renvers'd, and quite disjointed; our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly invaded, and more Inſtances of <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> daily committed than in ſeveral of the former Reigns. Trade in general decreaſing, baſely and deſignedly betrayed, and rendered almoſt impracticable. A great part of our current Coin either tranſported in <hi>Specie,</hi> or melted into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and recoined into Dutch <hi>Scellings</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and irrecoverably loſt, to our vaſt impoveriſhment, and the enriching our ſworn Enemies. A Million at leaſt <hi>per Annum,</hi> by the confeſſion of Favourites of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, loſt ever ſince this War in Shipping and Merchandize, beſides the Produce of it in Trade at Home, to the undoing of Multitudes of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in a ſhort time; and this loſs like to continue as long as we have any thing to loſe, or the War laſts. <hi>Ireland</hi> a third part depopulated, and more than half of the intrinſick Riches, or Product of that Kingdom, embezzel'd and waſted; and a third part of our Seamen dead or deſerted. The Flower of our <hi>fighting Engliſh</hi> deſtroyed to no purpoſe. What ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe can be made for the detaining our <hi>Turkey Fleet</hi> above twelve Months, nay after our never to be forgotten Victory at Sea, when we could have well ſpared half our Fleet for Convoys? the remainder with the <hi>Dutch</hi> being more than ſufficient Guards to the <hi>Deſcent</hi> (a Deſign ſo ſenſeleſsly managed, and ſhamefully mentioned at this time of day, as the onely thing to buoy us up to ſpunge 5 or 6 Millions more out of our Purſes) and yet by their idleing in our Ports and Harbours, and doing nothing but louſing themſelves, have ſuffered more Ships to be loſt ſince than in any one Year ſince the War. I deſy all Mankind to ſatisfy us in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of ſo near conſequence to the very Being almoſt of the Engliſh Nation: And if the Deſcent be urged as a proper excuſe, What has been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of its miſcarriage, to the aſtoniſhment of all <hi>Europe?</hi> It muſt either be occaſioned through its Impracticableneſs, or for Want of Neceſſaries to ſuch an Expedition; but neither of theſe can apologize for ſuch an unpardonable Fruſtration, being a certain ſign of the <hi>Incapacity</hi> of the Authors and Contrivers of it, neither foreſeeing the Difficulties nor Charges neceſſarily attending ſuch an Enterprize; and thence we may conclude the great Infelicity, and Diſadvantages theſe miſerable Nations lie under, to be engaged in a War that our Governours have no skill to manage: and then what can we expect but to be perpetually worſted, and to come off with infinite Loſs and Diſreputation, and in the end be forc'd to ſubmit. So that unleſs our Parliament, by their Omnipotence, can ſupply them with more Brains and better Conduct, and inſtil into their Sculls more Wit to improve a Victory, when they can get it, it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40112:17"/>
will be equal to us whether we <hi>beat</hi> or be <hi>beaten,</hi> and then how deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable will our Condition be?</p>
            <p>The laſt Bleſſing of this Revolution that I ſhall mention theſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Nations enjoy under the P. of <hi>O.</hi> (which is a plain Inference from what has been hitherto inſiſted on) is this, That they ſhall not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy their Idolany longer than the Confederacy holds tight with us, or we with them; this is ſo neceſſary a deduction that it cannot be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe he is their Creature, ſet up meerly for their common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and his downfal may become an Advantage to them in time, as well as his Proſperity and Grandeur, (as has been ſaid.) Whatever Figure of <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> we may fancy he makes among the <hi>Confederates</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> it's certain he has not the command of any Forces (if really of thoſe) but what he carries over from hence. How often has he been over-rul'd in Councils of War by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governour <hi>Caſtinaga,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſince, Prince <hi>Waldeck, &amp;c.</hi> is to notorious to be recounted here. So that his Buſineſs is rather to be their <hi>Providitore-General</hi> than any thing elſe, to furniſh them with Men, Money and Stores, to build them <hi>Forts,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay their Loſſes, (as in that Inſtance lately produc'd of the <hi>Dutch Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron:)</hi> Nay, ſo unwilling are they ſo much as to find his Soldiers Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he is forced to tranſport part of his Quota back again, and to be at the expence of fortifying two Towns, <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Furnes,</hi> to lodg part of the Remainder, ſend over Proviſions, and even Coals for their Subſiſtence; <hi>Ghent, Bruges,</hi> and ſome other places refuſing poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to entertain the reſt, if not prevailed upon by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> All the Reward he has for the vaſt Sums he annually pilfers for them out of our almoſt exhauſted Coffers, is to King it here, and all he deſires; and upon that account it's his Perſonal Intereſt to keep the War on Foot whatſoever it coſts us. From whence it's proper enough to infer, that if we be able or willing to furniſh as many Millions yearly as the Support of the <hi>Confederacy</hi> will require, we may yet keep the <hi>Dutch Stadtholder</hi> for our King, and if not, we muſt part with him, and there's an end of the <hi>Raree Shew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a Corollary to this laſt Advantage, we ought not to forget another as remarkable, (for we do every thing aukwardly, and pray and hope, as they ſay, backwards, and in oppoſition to all the reſt of Mankind that are not infatuated or grown mad,) and that is the Bleſſing of never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Peace ſo long as the P. of <hi>O.</hi> Lords it here. I confeſs in his Speech the laſt Seſſions of Parliament, and in his Diſcourſe to the <hi>States</hi> before, or after that, he promiſed he would do his utmoſt to humble <hi>France,</hi> and procure an Honourable Peace to all <hi>Europe;</hi> but in this as well as in all other Promiſes he has deceived all our Hopes, and none but half-witted People would ever be ſo deluded. 'Tis Demonſtration he can never do the one or the other now; <hi>France</hi> was never ſo powerful as at preſent,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40112:17"/>
nay, is grown <hi>exceſſively Powerful,</hi> as he tells the Parliament in this laſt Speech; and I may add, the <hi>Confederacy</hi> exceedingly weak, and <hi>England,</hi> that muſt give Life and Vigour unto all, not exceſſively rich, nor I hope for ever abandon'd to the higheſt degree of Sottiſhneſs and Inſenſibility. And as for a Peace, himſelf is the only Obſtacle of it, and will firſt or laſt be curs'd by all <hi>Europe</hi> on that account. The <hi>Confederacy</hi> muſt of neceſſity have dropt long e're this, if we, through our Zeal and Malice againſt our Lawful King, whatever we roar againſt <hi>Louis le Grand,</hi> had not been ſo prodigal of our Wealth, and Bloud, to maintain the abominable <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a <hi>Foreigner,</hi> and through all the Courſe of his Management a ſworn Enemy and Hater of the <hi>Engliſh Nation.</hi> And now forſooth, in this laſt Speech (after all his ill laid Projects and Deſigns baffled, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated at <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> and that he had at the long run diſcovered, that the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was <hi>exceſſive, i. e.</hi> in plain Engliſh inſuperable, by all the Force and childiſh Politicks of himſelf and the <hi>Confederates,)</hi> he very humbly craves <hi>the Advice</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> at a dead Lift, when all lies at ſtake, which he never thought worthy of adviſing with before, and modeſtly asks <hi>at leaſt an equal Force to that of the laſt Year;</hi> as if a Force that was able to do nothing the laſt Year, either by Sea or Land (but by a meer Accident) would be able to do Wonders the next, againſt the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Forces of his Enemy by <hi>both.</hi> What pitiful Cant is all this? Is it not plain by his <hi>Speech</hi> that he dares not ſo much as flatter us with the hopes of any Succeſs againſt <hi>France</hi> the next <hi>Campaign,</hi> ſince he is fearful even of asking ſuch a Supply as all intelligent Men foreſee will be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to oppoſe the prodigious Preparations of the Enemy? And can we hope with the ſame <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> we gave him the laſt Year, which we experimentally found was inſufficient even for the <hi>Defenſive</hi> part, by Land eſpecially, will be ſuperiour to him the next? We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed of the great Preparations of all ſorts of Ammunitions the <hi>French</hi> are making in all their Frontier Gariſons upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> the <hi>Maes,</hi> the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the vaſt Magazines of Hay, Straw, Oats, and other Grain and Proviſions they are erecting in thoſe parts; their Forces ſo diſpoſed of in Poſts upon the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Maes,</hi> that 30000 can be got together at any time upon any Enterprize at a ſhort warning; and upon the <hi>Moſelle</hi> 20000 on any occaſion, and all without doubt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute ſome great Deſigns very early before the <hi>Confederates</hi> can be in a condition to oppoſe them. And will it be ſufficient for the <hi>Confederates</hi> to ſtand upon the <hi>Defenſive,</hi> which they never could do to any effect? And is this the way to <hi>humble France,</hi> to reduce her to her ancient Limits, and to reſtore Peace and Liberty to <hi>Europe?</hi> And then as for <hi>Savoy,</hi> what Meaſures are concerted to preſerve his Territories from the <hi>French</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals, or even to hinder them from being ſwallowed up? It's true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are ſeveral of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Troops quartered in <hi>Italy,</hi> beſides
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40112:18"/>
thoſe of ſome of the <hi>German Princes;</hi> but then if we do but remind our ſelves of the <hi>Winter Campaign,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> King has already begun in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and on the <hi>Rhine;</hi> his Reſolution (as we are informed by all the <hi>Foreign Gazetts</hi> and <hi>Courants)</hi> to act in concert with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and to puſh on the War with all imaginable Vigour during this Seaſon, while the other does the ſame in <hi>Hungary,</hi> (where as we are told the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces encreaſe daily; and by their Motions and Preparations it's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conjectured they have <hi>preſent</hi> and great Deſigns in Hand, having lately aſſembled in great Bodies between <hi>Belgrade</hi> and <hi>Semandria,</hi> as (it's thought) to fall into <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> or attack <hi>Peterwaraden;)</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Caſe</hi> as this, it's but reaſonable to ſuppoſe that both the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the foreſaid <hi>Princes,</hi> will be neceſſitated to recall the greateſt part of their Forces; and then let the World judge whether 50, 60, or as ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ſay 70000 <hi>French</hi> will not probably prove too great a Match for that <hi>Prince</hi> to encounter, and eſpecially in the Winter time; for theſe <hi>Prints</hi> do poſitively tell us, that all the Troops in <hi>Dauphine</hi> and thereabouts, with all the Magazines that have been erecting for ſeveral Months ſince, are actually removed towards the Frontiers of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and that the French deſign in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> if the Seaſon favour them, to beſiege <hi>Coni,</hi> or <hi>Turin</hi> it ſelf. The <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, notwithſtanding the moſt preſſing Inſtances of the D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> to detain them, are marcht into their Quarters; <hi>Bavaria</hi> had recalled two of his Regiments, if he had not been prevailed upon by the P. of <hi>O.</hi> to let them ſtay, upon his promiſe to maintain them this Winter at his own Charge, which by the way is a certain ſign of the French Forces encreaſing on that Side; and therefore could not be conveniently ſpared: So that the only preſent Security he has is the Winter Seaſon, and the deep Snows; and as ſoon as the Weather breaks, a Force by much ſuperior, and in all Points better provided for, will fall into his Country, and in all probability put a ſpeedy period to the War on that Side, either by an entire Conqueſt, or by forcing him into a ſudden Compliance. We hear of no Preparations anſwerable to thoſe of <hi>France</hi> on the <hi>Confederates</hi> Side, all being at a ſtand, waiting for the lucky News of more Money from the Parliament in <hi>England;</hi> and e're that be done, and Preparations made, the Enemy will have done his Buſineſs, and have little to doe but to dodge with them, and play with their Noſes the whole Summer, and ſhew the World what Fools they are. Again, what a piece of kindneſs is it to our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and an honour too to tell them, the <hi>Inconveniency</hi> of ſending out of the Kingdom great Sums of Money for the payment of the Troops abroad, (he dares not ſay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Scotch,)</hi> is very conſiderable, and <hi>ſo much wiſhes it could be remedied, that if they can ſuggeſt to him any methods for the ſupport of them, which might leſſon that Inconvenience, he ſhould be ready to receive them with all his Heart.</hi> Why truly the Caſe is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40112:18"/>
plainly this, he finds it's no concealing any longer the Tranſportation of all our Money for the ſupport of Foreigners, and is afraid this Trade will not hold long, either that <hi>England</hi> can pay the <hi>Confederates</hi> unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Penſions, or that the <hi>Confederates</hi> can be held together, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the exacteſt payment of what he is engaged to them; therefore he is willing to go on with them, or knock off as the Parliament will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him, (provided he mentions theſe Things <hi>bona fide,</hi> and does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the reſt, and the whole Kingdom beſides, <hi>by an aſſurance of a Majority that will carry all right or wrong for his Intereſt,)</hi> any thing ſo he may continue King, or have the ſatisfaction at leaſt of ruining the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with himſelf when he muſt fall. This is downright, (if he be in good earneſt) and the Nation has a fit opportunity to look to her ſelf. No means can be found out to avoid <hi>this Inconvenience,</hi> and to maintain an Army abroad at the ſame time: The only way is to take him at his Word, recall our Forces, break off the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and to ſtand upon our own Legs, maintain a good Army here at Home, pay them well, and augment our Navy. But yet this Method has its Difficulties too; ſo hard a thing it is to enſure any the leaſt degree of Mundane Felicity: For ſhould we leave the <hi>Confederacy</hi> in the Lurch, (which his preſent Circumſtances ſeem to encline, or neceſſitate him to conſent to, if the Parliament think fit,) then the vaſt Arrears owing to the Allies which they could never expect to get from him, would oblige them to unite with <hi>France,</hi> declare the P. of <hi>O</hi> the common Enemy, and <hi>England</hi> the Seat of War. (That he is indebted to the <hi>Confederates</hi> ſeems highly probable to me, by the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s preſſing the <hi>States</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſo hard for the Subſidies, or <hi>Penſions,</hi> due to him the laſt Spring, repreſenting to them that without them he ſhould not be in a condition to maintain the Forces he had on foot, which the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> did likewiſe the ſame time; and 'tis not unlikely, that was one pricipal reaſon of <hi>Hanouer</hi>'s ſlow Proceedings the laſt Campaign: And if I be not much miſtaken in my Conjecture, the P. of <hi>O.</hi> muſt come in for a Snack in that Affair, as well as the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> eſpecially if he be the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> as the Monthly Account and one of the late <hi>Slips</hi> term him.) But to return, the latter would be inſignificant, for Reaſons formerly mentioned; ſo that our Caſe looks deſperate. But if we ſhould break up the <hi>Confederacy</hi> by conſent, theſe Arrears muſt be paid, which no doubt will ariſe to a large Sum, which would be hard for us to part with in theſe Circumſtances, and to ſupport the Charge of a War beſides.</p>
            <p>But, Oh the <hi>Deſcent!</hi> This muſt be carried on yet. <hi>None can deſire more than I that a Deſcent ſhould be made into</hi> France, <hi>and therefore notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Diſappointment of that Deſign the laſt Summer, I intend to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it the next Year with a much more conſiderable Force,</hi> &amp;c. What a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40112:19"/>
parcel of Stuff and Contradiction huddled together, as if the Noiſe of the Cannon from <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Namur</hi> was not out of his Head yet! To talk of a Deſcent ſo publickly, ſo long before-hand, enough to fruſtrate the beſt laid Project in the World. If it were impracticable the laſt Year, much more the next. There are the ſame Difficulties at leaſt this Year, if not ten times greater; but nothing will ſerve our Turns, or be worth our Noble Attempts, but Impoſſibilities. By the next Year there will be a potent Fleet to obſtruct us, if not powerful enough to defeat and ruine us; more powerful Diverſion by Land; early notice of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; all poſſible means found out to prevent us by Sea and Land; and it may be a Deſcent to anticipate ours, and what then? Ay, but <hi>I intend to attempt it—with a more conſiderable Force.</hi> Is not this a palpable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to his modeſt Requeſt he had made before, of a Force <hi>at leaſt as great by Sea and Land as we had the laſt Year? i. e.</hi> If we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to underſtand him, he deſires, if it can't be otherwiſe, but the ſame aſſiſtance of Men and Money he had the <hi>laſt Year,</hi> and he will <hi>attempt it;</hi> and if they enable him with a much more <hi>conſiderable Force</hi> he'll attempt it; if, notwithſtanding all the forementioned greater oppoſition he's like to meet with the next Year than the laſt, he intends yet to attempt it, though with equal Forces to thoſe he had before; Why was it not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted then when there were far leſs? Will he engage to be wiſer next Year than the laſt, or that the <hi>French</hi> ſhall be more Fools, or that <hi>they</hi> ſhall be <hi>leſs able</hi> to oppoſe him with a <hi>more powerful Navy,</hi> and a greater number of Land Forces the next than they had the laſt <hi>Campaign,</hi> and he be ſtronger and abler to attack them with the ſame Forces he had before? And ſuppoſe he be enabled with a more <hi>conſiderable Force,</hi> can he aſſure us that their <hi>Diligence</hi> in <hi>repairing their Loſſes at Sea,</hi> and the <hi>conſiderable Augmentation</hi> of their Land Forces will not exceed his <hi>more numerous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and render his <hi>good Intention</hi> as impracticable as ever? This is juſt ſuch a paſſionate deſire as he had to fight <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>XEMB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RGH</hi> Hand over Head, without the leaſt ſhadow of Hope to get any Advantage, but meerly to keep up the Opinion amongſt Fools of his being a <hi>Fighting Spark,</hi> and ſcorning to paſs a whole <hi>Campaign</hi> with doing nothing; ſo he is reſolved to attempt ſomething by Sea, though he is ſure to get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hard Blows, and expoſe ſome thouſands of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be knock'd on the Head, or to die like Fools to their <hi>immortal Honour:</hi> And this is all he ſeems to promiſe in his Speech, to attempt a landing in <hi>France,</hi> which was ever <hi>laugh'd</hi> at by ſenſible Men before, and ought to be <hi>hiſs'd</hi> at now.</p>
            <p>Well! but here are grand Motives to ſtir us up to ſupport him with all the ſpeed imaginable: <hi>We are expoſed to the Attempts of</hi> France <hi>while the</hi> French <hi>King is in a condition to make them,</hi> and therefore <hi>the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we have at this</hi> very nick of <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>being joined with the moſt of</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40112:19"/>
               <hi>the Princes and States of</hi> Europe, <hi>againſt ſo dangerous an Enemy, ought not to be ſlipt,</hi> eſpecially our <hi>Countrey</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> lying at ſtake, <hi>&amp;c. and we have the ſame Religion to defend</hi> &amp;c. What Advantage have we now that we had not before? Are we but juſt now entered into the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> or have we or they been aſleep or drunk all this while? Why an Advantage now? Are they ſtronger now, or more politick, or reſolute than before? Or if we have had little or no Advantage in being joined with them all this while, what aſſurance have we of any from henceforward? I am ſure ſome wiſe Stateſmen, who have tranſmitted to us the Experience of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, do aſſure us if a <hi>Confederacy</hi> does not make ſome notable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the common Enemy the firſt or ſecond <hi>Campaign,</hi> they are never like to do it afterwards, but grow weaker and weaker till they ſink into nothing; and as to theſe <hi>Confederates,</hi> notwithſtanding they have ſerved almoſt an Apprenticeſhip under one of the wiſeſt Maſters of his Craft in the whole World, have added ſo little to their Skill, and approved themſelves ſuch <hi>notorious Dunces,</hi> that we have no hopes of ever ſeeing a Maſterpiece from them, to their grand Diſparagement, and our infinite Loſs. And after all this Pother, are we <hi>expoſed to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi> of France, and is <hi>France</hi> a <hi>dangerons Enemy,</hi> and the <hi>Power of France exceſſive?</hi> Who may we thank for all this? Was it not the P. of <hi>O</hi>'s <hi>being joined with moſt of the Princes and States of Europe,</hi> that brought us into theſe Snares upon a parcel of ſham Pretences, and Bugbear Stories, with his <hi>Bearskins and Laplanders,</hi> and the Devil knows what? And has not their ſenſeleſs management of their Affairs againſt their <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> as they call him, made him ſo ſtrong and dangerous as he is? And is there any proſpect they will be ever more <hi>politick</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> for the future, and have better Succeſs in all their Enterprizes? Can all the Speed they make in getting Money, providing Neceſſaries for the War be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Preparations, which are at this time ſo forward, as to wait only a proper Seaſon to employ them? And if from the nature of things they muſt be later, ſince all the World is convinc'd of the Agility and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the <hi>French,</hi> and that they are never guilty of loſing. Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; do we imagine that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Confederates</hi> can do will ſignify any thing? Then to what purpoſe is it to throw away our Money, and to impoveriſh and weaken our Selves? All the good that our Money is like to doe the <hi>Confederates,</hi> is only to diſcharge part of the <hi>Contributions</hi> they are obliged to pay the <hi>French</hi> to ſave their <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages</hi> from being laid in Aſhes; ſuch <hi>Brave Fellows</hi> they are in defending their own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Properties, that continually <hi>ſpunge</hi> the Money out of our Pockets under the <hi>Sham</hi> of being our <hi>Saviours</hi> and <hi>Deliverers:</hi> And ſo far from <hi>humbling</hi> their <hi>Enemy,</hi> and carrying the War into his own <hi>Bowels,</hi> that what he does not think worth the taking from them, they are forc'd to redeem from being deſtroyed at any rate, and we like F—depoſite the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40112:20"/>
Money. Again, how ſtrangely are all our Meaſures, and thoſe of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, broke in pieces in a <hi>trice?</hi> Our <hi>Doughty</hi> P. of <hi>O.</hi> demads but modeſtly <hi>at leaſt as great Force at Land and Sea as the laſt Year,</hi> conſequently at leaſt as much Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no doubt the <hi>Allies</hi> do what they can on their parts at the ſame time. Now if we conſider the vaſt Expences and Loſſes the <hi>Common Enemy</hi> is like to put them to by this <hi>Deviliſh Winter Campaign,</hi> (being deſtitute of Magazines, of Proviſions for Horſe and Man, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, Carriages, and all Neceſſaries, as we are well aſſured by the late Inſtance of <hi>Charleroy</hi> being bombarded almoſt to Aſhes before they could get up to its Relief, the carrying <hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and ſixteen or ſeventeen days playing upon <hi>Rhinfelden</hi> and the <hi>Kat,</hi> before they were in any condition to attempt the Relief of them,) by <hi>falſe Alarms, taking their Towns,</hi> and the <hi>bare</hi> attacking others to give them Diverſion, while they are in good earneſt in other places, and (which at the ſame time ſhews they have not Men enough to ſecure themſelves on all Sides, though the <hi>French</hi> have to beard them, and keep them in play, while they aſſault them in their <hi>tendereſt</hi> and <hi>weakeſt part)</hi> we ſhall find in the upſhot that theſe <hi>at leaſt</hi> as great Sums of Money will go near to be half expended before the Summer <hi>Campaign</hi> begins, (their Deſigns reaching no farther;) and conſequently all their Hopes, if they have any, and Projects of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting any thing upon <hi>France</hi> cruſh'd, in the very Shell. I know the ſaving of <hi>Rhinfeld</hi> is look'd upon as a very great <hi>Deliverance,</hi> and that <hi>Te Deum</hi> has been ſung in <hi>Germany</hi> on that occaſion, which is an Argument of its great Importance; but yet at the ſame time we are not ignorant that it was owing to the badneſs of the Weather, more than to any thing elſe; and for all I can ſee to the contrary, the <hi>Confederates</hi> have no reaſon to think themſelves ſecure, even as to that point; the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and the <hi>Kat</hi> are miſerably ruin'd, and before they can put them into any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible condition again, an indifferent good Seaſon may give the <hi>French</hi> an opportunity, if they have no better Fiſh to fry, to attack it the ſecond time, as undoubtedly they will, and with a ſtronger Force; and then it muſt go. How the <hi>Germans</hi> will be able to ſupply their late Loſſes in thoſe Parts, the whole Countrey round having been moſt miſerably plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and harraſſed during the Siege, and forced to pay ſwinging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions; the vaſt Expences in ſupplying that place with Ammunition and Proviſions, to repair the Breaches, add new Works, provide for the Subſiſtence of their Forces, and thoſe many ruined Families in the Towns burnt by the <hi>French</hi> in their Retreat, I cannot divine: But if we reflect upon the Monies and Monies worth raiſed by the <hi>French,</hi> in the ſeveral Excurſions made during that Siege into divers parts, forcing the Country to ſupply them with whatever they had for their convenience all the time, and what they have extorted from them ſince; I am morally aſſured the <hi>Germans</hi> have paid the whole Charge of the <hi>others</hi> Expedition. But to all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40112:20"/>
this let us add, that ſince the taking of that place would have been of vaſt conſequence to the facilitating of the <hi>Deſigns</hi> of <hi>France</hi> upon the <hi>Empire,</hi> (as generally was acknowledged and dreaded,) and the early taking of it yet would be ſo ſtill upon the former ſuppoſition, (eſpecially if the <hi>Turk,</hi> taking the Advantage from the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s weakneſs and unpreparedneſs, make ſome early and vigorous Attempt in <hi>Hungary</hi> or <hi>Sclavonia;)</hi> the effect will be this, the <hi>French</hi> will be able to penetrate ſo far into the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> as to put all <hi>Germany</hi> into a Convulſion, force that <hi>Prince</hi> to draw all his Forces out of <hi>Italy,</hi> (by which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> muſt fall off, and conſequently the War draw on to a period;) and though he ſhould, by the adding thoſe Forces to the Army in <hi>Hungary</hi> or the <hi>Rhine,</hi> make ſome tolerable defence, yet being unable to do the ſame on the other Side, he would be compelled to accept of any Terms from the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>French King;</hi> and then farewel <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> too; the one muſt be glad to ſubmit to her old Maſter, and the other to ſuch Conditions as ſhe can get. This is the Game we are likely to ſee in a ſhort time, the effect of our <hi>Weakneſs</hi> as well as <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> notwithſtanding our profuſeneſs and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to ſupport ſo wretched a Cauſe to the ruine of theſe Nations, if God be not the more merciful: Of our Weakneſs, I ſay, abſtracting all other Conſiderations, becauſe we will not learn Wiſdom and <hi>Forecaſt</hi> from our Enemy, in making Proviſions againſt the Winter, when he's always moſt active; and we may take it for a certain Maxim, grounded upon our Experience all this War, that if we can't prevent the <hi>French</hi> from doing their Buſineſs in the Winter time, or very early in the Spring, all our Summer's Expedition ends in nothing but marching and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marching, running away or getting a kick on the A—, and ſo Home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and tell our Loving Subjects ſome dreadful Story of the <hi>great</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Power</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and deſire <hi>more Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we are fool'd and cajol'd from Year to Year with the perpetual Outcries of the <hi>growing Power,</hi> and <hi>exceſſive Power</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> their <hi>aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their Forces by Sea and Land;</hi> put in mind of our being <hi>expoſed to their Attempts, the danger of our Countrey, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties;</hi> and to animate us to open our Purſes the wider, and bleed the more freely, he aſſures us in the Word of a <hi>True Proteſtant Dutchman,</hi> he has the <hi>ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to defend.</hi> What pitiful Nonſenſe is all this? It has been pretended all along this War, that the French King in his Negotiations with the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Italian Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> to encline them to uſe their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to procure a Peace among the Catholick Princes, or to take part with him, has made it his Buſineſs to perſwade them, that the War carried on againſt him ſo far as the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> or <hi>States</hi> were concerned, was on the ſcore of <hi>Religion,</hi> which has been denied by the ſaid <hi>Proteſtant Princes,</hi> and moſt of their <hi>Writers</hi> on this occaſion, and particularly by the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>General Hiſtory of</hi> Europe, <hi>publiſhed by the Authority of</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40112:21"/>
               <hi>the States General,</hi> in the P. of <hi>O</hi>'s <hi>Declaration</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Schomberg</hi> in <hi>Dauphine;</hi> and in the Articles of <hi>Limerick</hi> we find the P. of <hi>O.</hi> to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of many of our <hi>Proteſtant Rebels,</hi> has granted greater Liberty and Priviledges to the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> than ever they enjoyed in the Reigns of any of our <hi>Proteſtant Kings.</hi> But to come nearer, he uſes ambiguous terms, which look very ſuſpitiouſly, <hi>We have the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to defend.</hi> What ſame Religion? The new <hi>Latitudinarian Religion, Presbyterian,</hi> or the <hi>Oliverian Independent,</hi> or what? Even what you pleaſe. We are <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland, Epiſcoparians</hi> in <hi>England, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and (if ſome intelligent Perſons are not miſtaken) <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and after all every where <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> There are thoſe in the World who fear not to aſſert, that it was publickly enough reported at <hi>Rome</hi> by divers of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of the <hi>Rota,</hi> ſome time before the Revolution, that he was reconcil'd to the Ch. of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſome ſtick not to aſſert, that he made his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> in the Royal Chapel at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> before the High Altar, at his Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> that he would inviolably perform the Articles of it, whereof one is this, if we may credit a Copy printed here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> of the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of the <hi>Princes, Allies,</hi> and <hi>Confederates, which has been taken in the Aſſembly at the</hi> Hague, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Art. 1. Having reſolved to make a Deſcent into <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We will make no Peace with</hi> Lewis XIV. <hi>till he has made reparation to the Holy See for whatſoever he has acted againſt it, and till he has annull'd and made void all thoſe infamous Proceedings againſt the Holy Father</hi> Innocent XI. If this be really one Article of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, as there is a grand Suſpition, if we conſider the Lukewarmneſs of that Pope towards King <hi>James,</hi> as was frequently buz'd amongſt us formerly, what Figure he made in the Confederacy, and his Inveterate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt the French King, the <hi>Bigotry</hi> of the Emperour, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible Temper of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> as to matters of Religion, it's not to be conceived how they ſhould enter into a Negotiation of this nature with the P. of <hi>O.</hi> without an aſſurance of his coming over to their Perſuaſion, and Reſolution of promoting the Rom. Catholick Intereſt in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Neither is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe they would contribute their Aſſiſtance to remove a Prince of their own Principles, tho' with a grand Proſpect of advancing their civil Intereſts, to the hazard of impairing their Religion to make way for an heretical Prince. Beſides, how can we imagine they would ever communicate ſuch a ſecret to him, if they were not firſt ſure of him, or could be ſure of him without ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement? The ſole Refuſal or Diſcovery of it would have infallibly prevented all their Deſigns, brought an indelible Diſhonour and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal upon their Religion, as well as their Perſons, and provoked K. <hi>James</hi> and the French King to take the utmoſt Vengeance upon them, and made them juſtly odious to all the reſt of the Chriſtian World, of whatever
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40112:21"/>
Perſuaſion: What a Blemiſh would it have fixed upon the <hi>Emperor,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly characterized as a Prince of a moſt devout Temper, and actually engaged againſt the Common Enemy of Chriſtianity, to be found in a Deſign to depoſe a <hi>Catholick Prince,</hi> and at the ſame time to cut off all the Hopes of ever propagating the Catholick Religion in three Kingdoms? Neither is his uſual Partiality towards <hi>Popiſh Biſhops, Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in general, one of the ſlighteſt Arguments for his Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, though it's uſually objected, that by his Alliances he was obliged to ſhew ſome favour to them. Why was it not as well cautioned he ſhould not ſet the Mob upon their Houſes and Chappels? and why did not thoſe Princes by their Intereſt with him prevent the iſſue of ſo much Bloud, and put a timely ſtop to thoſe horrid Barbarities, and irreparable ruine of vaſt Numbers of their own Perſuaſion then, as to ſhew ſuch favour and marks of diſtinction ſince? No, ſome Severity was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the beginning to get the Affections of the People, and to his ſurer eſtabliſhment in the Throne; but ſince he has gained his Point, and dipt all Degrees and Orders of Men ſo deep in Guilt againſt their <hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> that they fancy themſelves beyond all hopes of Pardon, he rides them at his pleaſure, makes them believe what he liſts, and readily ſtops their Mouths, and entirely ſatisfies them with this Excuſe. There might be ſome other very conſiderable Arguments offered on this Head if neceſſary or prudent; all that I ſhall add is this, That for my own part I ſhall ever believe him to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as much as any others fancy him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or of the Communion of the preſent pretended <hi>Church of England,</hi> till he ſatisfies the World to the contrary, by taking ſome ſevere Teſt, and moſt ſolemn Oath; and if this ſhould prove true, (as it may notwithſtanding his communicating publickly according to the Form of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as many have done formerly to our knowledg before <hi>the Teſt</hi> was adviſed to make the diſtinction;) How finely are we trumpt upon? However, let him urge this Motive as far as he pleaſes, it's little to the preſent purpoſe; as the Buſineſs of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> has been managed ſince his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> 'tis no great matter <hi>what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> he or we profeſs; we have as good as renounc'd our Chriſtianity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to make and receive him as King; and I am ſure nothing can be more contrary to it, or affrontive of the Great God of Heaven and Earth, than our very Prayers and Devotions, wherein we beſeech him to ſupport and proſper one of the grandeſt pieces of Villany that ever was acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Face of the Earth, to confound all Juſtice and Probity; which is as great an Indignity to an <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Juſt God,</hi> as <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it. Nay, more than that, all our <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> tend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to nothing but the hardening and encouraging Men to perſevere in the horrid Sins of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> with their Concomitants, and by conſequence in the Eye of Reaſon give an inlet to all other Vices, it being
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40112:22"/>
as juſtifiable for a Man to plead a neceſſity for <hi>Whoring, Theft, Murder, &amp;c,</hi> as to incur the guilt of Perjury and Rebellion for the preſervation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and the conſequence is ſo viſible and intelligible by all the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> of the Age, that we to our great Sorrow perceive the viſible growth of both dayly; and one <hi>John Tillotſon</hi> has contributed more to the ſpreading and rooting of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> than 50 <hi>Spinoſa's, Hobbs</hi>'s or <hi>Vaninus</hi>'s: So that let him inſiſt as long as he pleaſes upon that old ſtale Cant of <hi>Religion</hi> to cover all the reſt of his profligate Deſigns, we are certain he has the leaſt reaſon to name it of any Perſon in the whole World; one may as ſoon with his <hi>Arch-Heretick,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmatick, Don John, find out a place for the Damn'd in the Manſions of Eternal Bliſs, after a certain period of ſuffering Hell Torments,</hi> or that the Devils and the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> in Hell, or that they ſhall at length merit a Releaſe from thoſe dreadful Torments, by their ſuppoſed Blaſphemies againſt, or Execrations of God Almighty, as the leaſt ſpark of Religion in him, if we reflect upon his Practiſes, (which are ever the Fruits of good or bad Principles;) or as ſoon demonſtrate that the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Bavarin</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> entered into the <hi>Conſederacy</hi> with him and the reſt of the <hi>Proteſtant Princes,</hi> out of no other Deſign but to preſerve the <hi>Church of England</hi> againſt the Attempts of King <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, as prove it ever was the leaſt part of his Intentions. For 'tis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to any one that knows the difference between <hi>Schiſm</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church, that he has perſecuted ever ſince he came hither the Members of the True eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England;</hi> and the firſt effort that he made was to let looſe all manner of Schiſms and Hereſies upon her to worry her to Death, if poſſibly, the preſervation of which he moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently makes one of the plauſible Pretexts of his <hi>Invaſion;</hi> and if the <hi>Latitudinarian Gentlemen</hi> had not out of a great Zeal to preſerve their Preferments more than their <hi>Religion,</hi> ſwallowed the Oaths againſt their <hi>known Duty and Allegiante,</hi> had put the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> into the actual Poſſeſſion of all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the Kingdom, as is conſtantly urged by them in private as the only Reaſon of their complyance, and ſo turned R—, as they ſay, <hi>to keep Rogues out.</hi> And here I muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to give them their <hi>Due,</hi> they prov'd apt Scholars and out-witted him: Nay more than that, by compelling them to Complyances againſt all that they formerly taught and profeſſed to believe to be their indiſpenſible Duty, he has been the occaſion of ſuch new Lights and Diſcoveries to them in matters of the neareſt Concernment to them, that in effect he has given the ſham to the ſo <hi>Glorious Deliverance it ſelf,</hi> and rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the future altogether <hi>uſeleſs.</hi> How natural is it now for them to urge, and indeed in ſome of their Writings they have already, that though there might be ſome pretence in the late dark Age of their Immaturity and Childhood for his Heroick and Generous Undertaking, there can be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40112:22"/>
none now for his <hi>Continuance,</hi> which by his Unſucceſsfulneſs, and the vaſt Expences he puts the Nation to, without any colour of hope to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the remainder of his Deſigns, has already dimn'd the Luſtre of his firſt Enterprize, and ſunk it almoſt into Oblivion. 'Tis not Change in Religion, let it be what it will, can affect them now; they've got a <hi>Clue</hi> that will readily extricate them out of all ſuch <hi>Labyrinths,</hi> with the new Arts of <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower Senſe,</hi> the Diſtinction between <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> as Circumſtances ſhall determine it: No Oaths can now enſlave them and tye them up, and no pretence of Religion impoſe upon them. Chriſtianity is not the ſame thing now that ſhe was in her Swadling Cloaths, one thing is to be done in propagating the Faith, another when ſhe has taken firm rooting. The Self-denial and Paſſivity of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was really neceſſary for the propagation of the Faith; but now it's ſetled it's become an uſeleſs Topick, eſpecially ſince the State has added her Sanction, and ſtampt it into Civil Property; and Chriſtianity as to the <hi>Agenda</hi> requires little more then what the pure ſight of Nature clear'd up from Paſſion and Prejudice ſuggeſts of her ſelf: <hi>Self-Preſervation</hi> is her <hi>prime Law</hi> and Dictate, and all the Religion in the World cannot null it without committing the greateſt violence upon Humanity it ſelf. Beſides, ſince Salvation is not confined to any Party or Sect of Chriſtians, but allowances muſt be made for Humane Frailty, it muſt be diametrically oppoſite to the <hi>Great Law of Charity</hi> it ſelf to be ſtrait-lac'd in a point of ſuch deep importance. Therefore let the P. of <hi>O.</hi> talk what he will as to <hi>Religion,</hi> Ours is as <hi>Comprehenſive</hi> as his, let it be what it will; we want only the much deſired Opportunity to reap the Bleſſings of our happy Change, which if it cannot be obtained under him, we are ready for the next propitious Providence; and let it come from whence it will, <hi>modo hic ſit bene,</hi> if we may but continue <hi>Vicars of Bray ſtill,</hi> we'll call it and celebrate it as the <hi>Greateſt Deliverance</hi> we ever had yet.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſhort Reflections upon ſome Paſſages of his Speech, I thought fit to ſubjoin to my Conſiderations on the laſt mentioned Diſadvantage theſe Nations have by this Great <hi>Revolution,</hi> viz. <hi>the unlikelyhood of ever enjoying Peace</hi> under the preſent Government. I might, if it were not to avoid being over tedious, enlarge my ſelf upon a Subject of ſatal Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to theſe Iſlands, the <hi>Daily Decay</hi> of <hi>Trade;</hi> all that I ſhall ſay in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto it is only this, that it's impoſſible for us to retrieve it ſo long as the P. of <hi>O.</hi> continues here; becauſe we can never hope to be at Peace, or Maſters of the Seas ſo as to ſecure it; and we muſt allow a Million and a half at leaſt to be yearly loſt during this War, in Shipping and Goods, and all the poſſible Product or Encreaſe of it in the way of Commerce, near a third part to be deducted out of the Trade in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, occaſioned by exceſſive Taxes, and ſcarcity of Money; a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part whereof is near loſt already for want of <hi>Seamen, Convoys,</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40112:23"/>
               <hi>Ships</hi> themſelves, by ſuch vaſt numbers being taken for <hi>Tranſportation,</hi> the frequent Embargoes, and unhappy detaining of our Fleets, to the loſs of their Markets, waſting their Proviſions, and raiſing Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſuch high Rates, that we had as good be without them; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> and <hi>Bank Fiſhery</hi> ſuſpended, if not loſt, to the impoveriſhing of divers of our Port Towns, by reducing numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to downright Beggary, to the exceſſive Charge of the reſpective Pariſhes they belong to. Then again, for our Comfort, let us but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Encreaſe of the <hi>French Shipping,</hi> by their perpetually ſnapping ours and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Encreaſe of their <hi>Seamen</hi> by the vaſt Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Privateers, the addition that will be made by the next Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to their Navy, and we ſhall find <hi>Trading by Sea</hi> will in a little time be rendred almoſt <hi>impracticable.</hi> Add to this the P. of <hi>O</hi>'s certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to betray our Trade to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for it's impoſſible to avoid ſuch a Reflexion, ſince no other Reaſon can be given for the detaining our <hi>Turkey</hi> Fleet above twelve months for want of Convoys, after they were ordered to be in a readineſs. What other account can be given of the Ineffectualneſs of the Petition made by divers Merchants and Enſurers to the Houſe of Commons now ſitting, wherein they ſet forth their Loſſes of 190 Veſſels taken by the <hi>French</hi> ſince the laſt Fight, (and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they mentioned only ſuch as belonged to the Port of <hi>London,)</hi> they were only ſlighted by the Committee, telling them opprobriouſly, <hi>they</hi> were not the <hi>chief Merchants</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and demanded whether they would ſwear on their own <hi>Knowledge</hi> to the number of the Ships, and the particular <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of their <hi>Taking,</hi> &amp;c. whether they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> for Convoys, and when they anſwered that they <hi>had,</hi> they referred them to the <hi>Council Board,</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> told them they could ſpare them <hi>none;</hi> the Committee quell'd the buſineſs, ſaying, the Council muſt have ſome Reaſons why they could not grant them any. Does not all this appear to be a real <hi>Deſign</hi> to ruine our Commerce, and to gratifie the <hi>Dutch?</hi> And are not we forced by this means to trade with them for ready <hi>Caſh</hi> or <hi>Bullion,</hi> for thoſe Commodities which we uſe to fetch in our own Bottoms from abroad? And if we do but reflect what a prodigious Summ of Money the Spices we annually take off from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which we were wont to barter for with our <hi>Tobaccoes, Sugars,</hi> &amp;c. from the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and the Loſſes we have ſuſtained during this War in our <hi>Jamaica, Virginia,</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes</hi> Fleets, by which means we are neceſſitated to part with our Coin <hi>in ſpecie;</hi> the Interruption in our <hi>Eaſt-India, Streights,</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Trade, being hereby obliged to take thoſe ſorts of Goods at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand from them; the Decay in our Traffick, and the great hazard of utterly loſing it, it will appear, to the eternal Reproach of our <hi>Mock-Deliver,</hi> the manifeſt Treachery of the <hi>Conſervators</hi> of our <hi>Liberties</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40112:23"/>
               <hi>Properties,</hi> and the Terror and (I hope in God) the juſt Regret of all thoſe who are not yet willing to have their <hi>Noſes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> cut off by the <hi>curſed</hi> and <hi>never to be forgiven Dutch.</hi> This is not all, let us reflect upon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours the laſt Seſſion of Parliament to diſſolve the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, which part of our Trade has been ever envied by thoſe greedy <hi>Mammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> and for many Years has been attempted to be engroſt by them; and you will eaſily foreſee to what a weak condition the Trade of the Nation will be reduc'd, if not ſpeedily prevented, which muſt require many Years to recover her priſtine Wealth and Glory. In one Word, <hi>All</hi> that's valuable to us runs to wreck, Our <hi>Religion</hi> dwindling ſenſibly into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſs,</hi> Our <hi>Liberties</hi> into <hi>Slavery,</hi> Our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> into <hi>Beggary,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> and Reputation of the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> into the utmoſt Contempt; the Conſtitution of our Government broken, and the People running more and more into Factions, the greateſt part of them however diſagreeing among themſelves, diſſatisfied with the preſent Government. Add to theſe Conſiderations the certain <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> of a decaying State; the loſt Reputation of him who ſits at the Helm; the growing Lukewarmneſs and Deſpondency of the People in general, occaſioned by <hi>immoderate Taxes, want</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> the barbarous uſage of our Soldiers by Land and Sea, <hi>unſucceſsfulneſs</hi> in all the late noiſy Projects, and the <hi>Known Strength</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> of the Enemy. Then conſider and weigh ſeriouſly the <hi>looſneſs</hi> of the preſent <hi>Clergy</hi> both in <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> as to the former Atheiſts more than Chriſtians, aſſerting, in effect, that <hi>real</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> Evil may be done to good Ends, preaching up and practiſing Rebellion, <hi>reviling</hi> in their Sermons and <hi>blaſpheming</hi> the <hi>Lord's Anointed,</hi> applauding the Wickedneſs of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> and blaſphemouſly equallizing him to our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> as ſome of them have moſt impudently done; and by juſtifying all his moſt flagitions Proceedings make themſelves <hi>acceſſory</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> to all he does, imbruing by that means their Hands in all that Innocent Bloud of their Fellow-Subjects that has heen ſpilt by that <hi>Deteſtible Murtherer,</hi> to the ſubverſion of the Monarchy, and all the Calamities that have enſued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, let them be of what quality ſoever, (ſince if they had done their Duties, all theſe Miſeries had, morally ſpeaking, been infallibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to the grand Honour of themſelves and their Religion;) and ſo render themſelves unfit to approach the Holy Altar of God, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for a Bleſſing upon his People: Thus by <hi>their</hi> means the Gates of Heaven are barr'd againſt us, and inſtead of <hi>Bleſſings</hi> we have <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Judgments.</hi> The Degeneracy of the Prieſts has been ever lookt upon as a direful Forerunner of enſuing Deſtruction; and I am ſure it muſt look very horridly, when the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſhall pray and praiſe God for nothing but what's the effect of his Indignation, cauſed by the Sins of themſelves, and the People miſled by their wicked Examples, when they ſhall endeavour
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40112:24"/>
to harden and confirm them in the Sins they have drawn them into, and as much as ever they can prevent their Repentance; when they ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to take part with <hi>Diſobedient</hi> and <hi>Rebellious Children</hi> againſt their <hi>Parents,</hi> to violate their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> expoſe their Bodies and Souls in a moſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural Rebellion,</hi> and pray to Heaven to proſper them in the very heighth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Impiety; What a Diſhonour is this to God and Religion! What a Curſe to the World! What an Injury to Men's Souls! And what can it portend but Vengeance, and (without a timely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Repentance) inevitable Ruine? Neither can I omit putting my Fellow-Subjects in mind of that raging Peſtilence in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which has ſwept away Multitudes of our People; the never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Earthquake</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and thoſe late <hi>Monitory Shakings</hi> which ran through all this Iſland, as well as a great part of the Territories of our <hi>Wicked Confederates:</hi> I ſhall not pretend to divine what may be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of them; but we never heard of an <hi>Earthquake</hi> in this Iſland but did certainly forerun ſome very remarkable <hi>Calamity.</hi> All I ſhall farther add is this, The only Refuge this Government has (for I find they don't think it ſafe to ſtand upon their own Legs,) is to keep up the <hi>Confederacy;</hi> This is reality will prove a rotten Reed, we may lean upon it, but it will run into our Hands and wound us, but never ſupport us; it's grown already feeble and contemptible, and being originally founded in <hi>Villany</hi> there's little likelyhood it will proſper. By the Experience of former Ages, <hi>Confederacies</hi> ſeldom or never performed great Atchiements. Their <hi>Religions, Manners, Intereſts,</hi> being for the moſt part different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, their Conſultations for that very Reaſon ſeldom prove effectual: And <hi>Monluc</hi> tells us, that <hi>two Princes</hi> deſigning to overcome a <hi>third</hi> never agree long; and gives you his own Experience, and that of preceding Times for it. And the moſt acute and judicious <hi>Guicciardine</hi> tells us, That <hi>Confederacies</hi> can never be ſo <hi>knitted</hi> and <hi>united,</hi> but that ſome or other of them will grow remiſs, or go off from the reſt; and then all is ſpoiled. And <hi>Comines</hi> adds, That if there be not <hi>One</hi> to over-rule and govern all the reſt of the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> their Deſigns will be fruſtrated, and end in nothing but their own <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> of the <hi>Common Enemy.</hi> I might, if I dare take that Liberty, have produced a multitude of Examples of this Nature, but I hope any One's Reflection upon the Inſtances of this Age will ſave me that Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore will addreſs my ſelf to thoſe of my Countreymen who have had the misfortune to be miſled, that ſince they have found all their Expectations deceived, themſelves gull'd out of all thoſe real Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Government they formerly enjoyed, <hi>Peace, Plenty, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and all that could render a People happy, by <hi>One</hi> whom a Man would be tempted to think could never have been <hi>procreated</hi> of <hi>Humane Race,</hi> void of all ſenſe of <hi>Religion, Juſtice, Honour,</hi> and every Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that is apt to conciliate Love or Veneration from Mankind; who has really forfeited the Crown by his own Act, having violated the very <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> he ſubſcribed: One that has been the occaſion of ſhedding more Chriſtian Bloud, on both Sides, than was ſpilt in the ten Perſecutions, and meerly upon a <hi>Sham Pretence</hi> of Religion to us; that it is their Intereſt and indiſpenſible Duty, if they have any ſence of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs remaining, any fear of God before their Eyes, any reſpect for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or love for their Souls, <hi>any remorſe for the Evil they have done, any Bowels for their own Countrey, any Charity for the reſt of the World, to free theſe Nations of ſuch a Plague and Curſe,</hi> and if poſſibly, <hi>to redeem all thoſe Bleſſings</hi> which have been ſo long with-held from us by his Means, by atoning God Almighty, by doing Juſtice to their highly injur'd <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> to themſelves, and to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and averting thoſe <hi>diſmal Plagues</hi> which otherwiſe e're long will fall upon their Heads: Otherwiſe let them do what they can, be as <hi>obſtinate, malicious</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> as they pleaſe, if they be reſolv'd yet to act wickedly <hi>they ſhall be conſumed, both they and their King.</hi>
