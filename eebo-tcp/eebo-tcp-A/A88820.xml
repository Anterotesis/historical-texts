         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which requires his perſonal attendance there; And he being one of the ſaid

ſummons or other legal notice, hath, and doth endeavour by ſurprize to purſue
your Petitioner, and work divers things againſt him prejudicial to his right. And
whereas your Petitioners purchaſe was before he left <hi>England,</hi> confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in confidence thereof, your Petitioner ſuſpecting nothing, left no proviſion nor

he is in, is now deprived of all counſel, intelligence, Agents writings, evidences, proofs,
and other things neceſſary to maintain a Title, and of all fit means to make uſe of them.</p>

                  <hi>Your Petitioner therefore humbly prayeth that no proceedings be ſuffered againſt him otherwiſe

beſides the warrant of an Act of Parliament, which if permitted to be queſtioned, there can be

               <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
            </div>
            <div type="supporting_arguments">
               <head>Reaſons that the Petitioners purchaſe ought not to be queſtioned by Sir <hi>John Stowell.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I. Your Petitioner ſaith that ſuch members of the Committee of Articles as have acted for
the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell,</hi> againſt Purchaſers, are parties, and not Judges, and their Orders
and Certificates ought to have no credit or authority. And your Petitioner ſaith they have
miſtated the Caſe, tranſgreſſed the duty of an inferiour juriſdiction and preſumed on Acts of
Sovereigne power, they have wrongfully indebted the Common-wealth in vaſt ſummes of
money to the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel,</hi> they have occaſioned falſe ſcandal on it of infringing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and have not beene indifferent or equal in their proceedings, either as to publike or
private rights, all which your Petitioner will be ready to prove.</p>
               <p>II. Your Petitioner ſaith, that divers Purchaſers, ſome through fear, and others by conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell,</hi> have, and do put in divers feigned and feeble Petitions and
pleas, part of which the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell</hi> to delude the vulgar, hath put in print, and the
ſame purchaſers have and do endeavour to betray the Cauſe of the Common-wealth, and are
companions, your Petitioner therefore deſireth that no proceeding be made againſt him in
groſſe, but his cauſe heard patiently and particularly.</p>
               <p>III. Your Petitioner ſaith that it hath been already decided and adjudged by Parliament,
that the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell</hi> hath forfeited his Articles. And thereupon the Act of ſale of his
eſtate was made, and that judgement being given by Parliament, to whoſe proceedings Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers
neither could or ought to be privie, and ſo much time ſince paſt, That though the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and proofs were then never ſo clear, yet the memory may be now loſt; The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
witneſſes proofs dead, removed, unknown, or taken off. It would be unreaſonable to
put Purchaſers now to prove over againe what hath beene adjudged, and would not onely
queſtion Sir <hi>John Stowels,</hi> but moſt part of all the lands the Parliament ever ſold or ſhall ſell.</p>
               <p>IV. Your Petitioner ſaith, notwithſtanding that if he ſhall be inforced, he will prove that
the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell</hi> never ſubmitted to compoſition according to Articles, and that he
hath both omitted &amp; committed divers Acts then and ſince which have clearly forfeited them.</p>
               <p>V. There is ſufficient publikely and vulgarly known of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell,</hi> as none
needs admire at the judgement paſſed againſt him, for he offered nothing but inſolencies and
affronts to the Parliament it ſelf, when brought before them, he reviled the Committee for
compounding, charging them to be delinquents themſelves. He charged the Judges at the
Upper Bench that they ſate by a countefeit Seale, and that they were mock-Judges, and the
Jury a pack of Knaves; he openly denied and defied the Supreme authority, and charged the
Court and Attorney-General with high Treaſon for acting by it, publickly, and to their faces.
He declared for the Scots in Armes againſt this Common-wealth, &amp; till all was loſt; he made
only a ſhew and pretence to deſire to compound, but really reſolved and declared againſt it,
and derided and ſcorned all thoſe who ſubmitted to it. All which was beſides many others.</p>
               <p>1. No fit language or behaviour to demand a Compoſition with.</p>
               <p>2. A breach of the peace within the Parliaments quarters.</p>
               <p>3. An incenſing of the people to rebel, and adhere to the enemy.</p>
               <p>4 The higheſt prejudice to the Parliaments quarters a priſoner could do, though he knew
by his Articles he was not to prejudice the ſame, and had given ſecurity to that end.</p>
               <p>5. Divers of the ſame Acts have been made treaſonable by Ordinance of Parliament.</p>
               <p>6. If any innocent perſon had preſumed on halfe ſo much, it had been his ruine.</p>
               <p>VI. The ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell</hi> refuſed to acknowledge himſelf a Delinquent, and thereby
wilfully refuſed his Compoſition.</p>
               <p>1. It was the command of the Parliament, and the Commiſſioners for compounding could
not juſtifie compoſition on any other termes.</p>
               <p>2. The houſe of Lords being part of the Parliament, had not then confirmed his Articles.</p>
               <p>3. The Parliament had conſiderately deſigned that all Delinquency ſhould remaine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
that both in the diſpoſing of offices of truſt and power, and other future Acts relating
to the Common-wealth, they might the more readily guide themſelves.</p>
               <p>4. A diſhonour might have been aſperſed upon them, That it had been <hi>Latrocinium,</hi> and
not <hi>Bellum,</hi> a robbery, and no juſt warre, if together with the penalties a confeſſion or tryal
of the offence had not likewiſe appeared.</p>
               <p>5. Both Commiſſioners and Sequeſtrators might have been otherwiſe liable to future acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſuits from the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell</hi> and his heirs.</p>
               <p>6. The Parliament had appointed other Courts, as namely the Commiſſioners of Appeals,
and thoſe of the Common-Law for relief of perſons ſequeſtred, being not Delinquents, which
were open unto him for trial, if he would ſtand on that point: But by ſtanding on it with the
Commiſſioners for compounding, 'tis clear he ouſted them of juriſdiction to meddle with him</p>
               <p>7. His refuſal was not out of errour, or miſtake, but adviſedly, and obſtinately, and after
he was told of it.</p>
               <p>8. Both before, and at time of making his Articles, it was known that by the uſual courſe of
ſubmitting to compoſition; the firſt point was acknowledgement of Delinquency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell</hi> had not liked it, he might have choſen whether he would
have taken Articles without an expreſſe diſpenſation of that very point.</p>
               <p>VII. Your Petitioner ſaith that the intereſt of the land in queſtion doth not totally belong
to the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell;</hi> But there are divers charges upon it, and divers tranſactions have
beene made touching the ſame to other perſons, making no pretence to Articles, who never
made claime, and therefore bound by the ſale which your Petitioner ought to have liberty to
examine, as well by the oath of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowell,</hi> as other perſons, and to have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Deeds, Titles, and Evidences of the ſaid land in Court, if there be cauſe.</p>
               <p>VIII. Your Petitioner ſaith that Purchaſers were commanded to pay in their ſecond moieties
by act of Councel at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and their Eſtates were thereupon confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
called by his Highneſſe, which is the deepeſt fundamental of property can be laid, and
the higheſt aſſurance the Law can give, and ought not to be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>IX. His Highneſſe hath been pleaſed likewiſe by his oath in the Inſtrument Government,
to confirme the ſecuring property, and to Governe therein according to the Laws, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
the benefit whereof your Petitioner doth claime.</p>
               <p>X. Your Petitioner acknowledgeth Lawes may be repeall'd, Judgements reverſed, and
Authorities countermanded, but humbly ſaith, That buying and ſelling bindes Supreame
power it ſelf: And that in the particular ſale the full price, both of money and blood hath
been received. And therefore neither God nor man can revoke their own bargain, and
ſales, and the whole Chriſtian Religion it ſelf hath no other foundation but a bargaine
and ſale.</p>
               <p>XI. Your Petitioner ſaith, his Purchaſe being a reverſion, he was neceſſitated to drown,
and extinguiſh his old Leaſe, for which old Leaſe the ſaid Sir <hi>Iohn Stowel</hi> received of this
Petitioners father far more then the whole Inheritance was worth. And your Petitioners
occaſions have likewiſe ſince his Purchaſe compell'd him to commit acts of forfeiture of his
ſaid old Leaſe by Feoffments, and otherwiſe, and to charge the mixt intereſt of old and new
Purchaſe, part with a joynture, part in taile to an infant, part with debts, part orphans money,
part others. And upon ſuch tranſacting and charging, the ſame hath bound himſelf in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
penal Covenants, and Bonds, to warranty, ſo that if Juſtice be not done to your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
in maintenance of his Right, your Petitioner is utterly deſtroied and made incapable
of other Indemnity or Reperation.</p>
               <p>XII. Your petitioner was totally ignorant of the Articles of <hi>Exeter,</hi> or any pretence of the
ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> to the ſame, and the ſame Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> might and ought to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him notice of the ſame, and was earneſtly requeſted and ſolicited to give your petitioner
notice and directions of his deſires touching his intended purchaſe. And the ſaid Sir <hi>John
Stowel</hi> did notwithſtanding purpoſely and fraudulently conceale the ſame from your peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
which point, though your petitioner had nothing elſe to ſay is unanſwerable both in
the lawes of peace and warre.</p>
               <p>XIII. Your petitioner ſaith, that the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> might, and ought further to have
given notice to the Truſtees for ſale, the Committee of obſtructions, the Terretenants of
the Land, who had preemption, as it is the courſe, and other perſons have done, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
to be ſould, and their claimes taken away; as the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel's</hi> was, but he did
not; And therefore by his own wilful defaults he loſt the benefit of ſtopping ſales which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the like condition obtained.</p>
               <p>Your petitioner ſaith, that the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> is a ſubject, and the Land in queſtion
Engliſh Land, and the ſaid Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> neither doth nor can clame by his Articles to be
in better condition then the reſidue of the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> And they, if their Eſtates
happen to be ſould by miſtake in Parliament or erroneous Judgement at Common-law, or
their claimes have been unjuſtly refuſed, or there be a truſt or title of Equity in <hi>Chancery</hi> on
the Land whereof Purchaſers have no notice, muſt take in lieu thereof that expedient which
the Law allows, namely reparation in value as farre as is proper. And for the reſidue da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
by way of Action, which legal expedient is made good by the ſaid Articles, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them he can have no benefit of the ſame.</p>
               <p>By the Act for ſettlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Parliament declared in a farre ſtronger caſe, and
though no ſale were made to neceſſitate it; that perſons there might be tranſplanted from
their own Eſtates of equal value, notwithſtanding they had been adjudged comprized with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Articles.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Stowel</hi> hath meaſured the ſame, and farre worſe meaſure to others; For the whole
Pariſh of <hi>Cothelſtone</hi> in <hi>Somerſet</hi> hath been by him miſerably and totally depopulated. And
not awaiting the expiring of their Eſtates, he by force, fraud, and terrour expelled them,
their wives children, and families to ſwim through their own tears to new Plantations. Here
therefore as the Law warrants, and neceſſity commands; ſo the Finger of God ſeemes to
direct, and Juſtice it ſelf to cry aloud for Retaliation.</p>
               <p>It would be a very great cruelty and injuſtice by not making good publick ſales to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to his rage and revenge all the well-affected people of fifteen or ſixteen great Mannours,
who have incurred his hatred meerly out of ſervice to the publick, and have the faith and
