            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nothing can more inflame our hearts with the fervent love of our dear Saviour, then to conſider, that by his merits and bitter paſſion he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us this heavenly inheritance. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more confirm our patience in our light and momentary ſufferings in and for Chriſt, than to have our thoughts taken up with that far exceeding &amp; eternal weight of glory prepared for us, with which, the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this preſent life are not worthy to be compared. Nothing next unto Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, can be a more effectual intentive and motive unto all holineſſe or converſation, than this rich wages, with which this our good and bountifull maſter will of his free grace reward our worthleſſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and weak endeavours. And therefore ſeeing our Authour in this book doth piouſly and profitably diſcourſe on this ſubject, which is ſo pleaſant and uſefull, and (as it ſeemeth to me) not in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal manner, but with a ſweet relliſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall feeling of theſe heavenly joys in his own ſoul, unto which he inviteth others, (being already approved and licenced by
<pb facs="tcp:170254:10"/>an abler hand and better judgement) I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commend it (Chriſtian Reader) to thy peruſall, and pray that thou maieſt reap that fruit and benefit in thy reading, which the Authour intendeth in the writing of it.</p>

Now the end of faith being the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſouls, that grand buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we have to agitate and eye in all our actions, being in all, to plot for poſſeſſion of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory promiſed, reſerved for us in the heavens: whereunto by the mighty power of God, we are kept by faith unto ſalvation. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. I therefore (though

Honey we know is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the ſweets of diverſity of ſweet flowers; and what is ſweeter then honey, or the honey-Comb, ſave Gods word, which in ſweetneſſe far ſurmounts all the Aromatick fragrancies and

Therefore we, even out of diverſity of gifts, may pick out much ſweetneſſe and delight, finding ſome rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and much ſtrength therein, as a bunch of arrows knit together, is of more ſtrength than one or two of them. Wherefore as, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Ionathan</hi> having taſted a little honey on the end of his rod, had his ſight revived: So no queſtion, if we pleaſe to put forth our ſelves to lick deeply of this enſuing honey pot, vented in this diſcourſe, we may alſo by Gods bleſſing, attain to have our eies further ſo anointed and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with this eye ſalve, as we ſhall ſo much the more cleerly ſee into things inviſible, taſting how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious the Lord is, who before the foundation of all the world, had provided for us, eternall habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſo great and ſuperabound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

For,</p>
            <p>Certain it is, That <hi>we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yeeld to part with this life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we be aſſured of a better; and that the aſſurance of the certaintie and excellencie of that future glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eſtate to come in Heaven for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is the onely Antidote unto a Beleever, to make him out face Death, looking beyond it, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incident croſſes in the way unto it.</hi> As we know Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did,

Pſal.</hi> 27.4, 5. That a day in Gods courts is better than a thouſand every where, Pſal. 84. And in another place (eying Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the glory to come) he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that a thouſand years, in Gods ſight, are but as yeſterday, and a watch in the night, Pſal. 90.

               <hi>v.</hi> 4. And Pſal. 39.6. when he hath ſhewed that man walketh in a vain ſhadow, diſquieting himſelf in vain, with heaping up theſe earthly things, he adds; <hi>And now, Lord, what wait I for? mine hope is even in thee.</hi> So, Job 19.25. he there flies out in the middeſt of all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of his afflictions, ſupporting himſelf with the hope of the life and glory to come, and his intereſt therein; <hi>For I am ſure that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deomer liveth,</hi> &amp;c. And what is more frequent in all the Scriptures than ſtill (upon all occaſions) to raiſe up our thoughts from hence unto Heaven? I will onely inſtance a few more places: that, 2 Theſ. 1.7. He comforts that diſtreſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate they were in, with that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reſt they ſhould enjoy, when the Lord Jeſus ſhould ſhew himſelf from heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

When he ſhall come to be glorified in his ſaints, and made marvellous in all them that beleeve.</hi> and 2 Pet. 3.13. after he hath ſpoken of the heavens and the earth to be burnt up, and renewed, which now are, he adds, <hi>But we look for new heavens, and a new earth, (according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) wherein dwelleth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And Chriſt in all his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the ſeven Churches in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſtill points them unto thoſe glorious things to come; where he promiſeth the overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>To eat of the tree of life, which is in the middest of the Paradiſe of God: not to be overcome of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death: to have a Crown of life: to eat of that Manna which is hid: to have a white ſtone, and new names written upon them: to write upon them the new name of God, the City of God, the new Ieruſalem:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170254:14"/>and to ſit with him in his Throne, as he overcame, and ſitteth with the Father in his Throne.</hi> All which I have onely named, to ſhew a glimpſe of that ſupport the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures afford in general, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort againſt afflictions here; and wherewith the former darling Saint, in the ancient times (in the days of their fleſh) have ſtayed and ſupported themſelves: and to ſhew that in all our deſtractions preſent, <hi>We must ſoundly anchor in heaven, ere we can find true comfort upon earth; or be throughly armed against the fear of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which effect it is written <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. That foraſmuch as the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, Chriſt himſelf alſo likewiſe took part with them, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had the power of death, that is the Divel; and that he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170254:15"/>might deliver all them, who through <hi>fear of death,</hi> were all their life time <hi>ſubject to bondage.</hi> In which caſe, we muſt not look upon death alone, without Chriſt, who by his death hath perfumed the grave for us; otherwiſe (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him) it is a paſſage onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King of terrours and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death; but as it is ſubdued by Chriſt: as it is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſwallowed up in victory: <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victorie?</hi> and as it is a ſmooth paſſage unto heaven and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to go home unto our fathers houſe: as it is a ſleep after the weary toils of this life: a gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto our people and fathers again, from whence for a while we have been eſtranged: and as it is a paſſage from mortality, to put on immortallity, to be ſwallowed up of life. Thus muſt we look upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170254:15"/>death, as upon a ſtingleſſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which now onely affrights, but hath no ſting to hurt; and as upon our beſt friend, who rids us, in a moment, for ever, of all thoſe <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and vexing <hi>Perrizites,</hi> (thoſe fins and cares) as thorns in our ſides; that, as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> we may be contented to loſe our lives with theſe <hi>Philſtims:</hi> of all which, and the like vexations whatſoever, we may then confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and rejoycingly ſay, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did of thoſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of the Church of God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Fear ye not: ſtand ſtill and behold the ſalvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew you this day; for the Egyptians whom you have ſeen this day, ye ſhall never ſee them again,</hi> a wonderfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be freed from all at once.</p>
            <p>And it ſeems, that the Saints in Scripture, upon their removall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170254:16"/>hence, make thus much good, in their unmoved departures. How quetly did <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> die, having finiſhed all their earthly buſineſs? with what peace did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> die in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Mounts. And what ſhall we ſay of holy <hi>David.</hi> I <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.10. Who departed hence ſo chearfully bleſſing God, after that he had given order for them Temple building: and old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> when he would no more remain at Court, craves leave to go home and die, all whom with <hi>Steven</hi> (amongſt a ſhower of ſtones) ſaw unto the other ſide of Death, ſo making a peaceable reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this life, to exchange it for a better. And ſo I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others may, if their whole life, hath been ſo ſpent in meditation, and engroſſing the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts againſt that day. But yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170254:16"/>the ſureſt, and moſt laſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort againſt that encounter, is, to be often (every day) waſhed in the fountain of Chriſts blood, with the ſeaſonable right application of his everlaſting Righteouſneſſe unto the ſoul, which will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that we being in him, and he in us, by the habitation of his ſpirit, That there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to ſuch <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170254:64"/>this life time is nothing elſe, but a time to ſit and prepare us for to be Inhabitants of Heaven for ever, to learn the language of Canaan in; to be indowed with thoſe ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural habits of heavenly graces; putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all his holy vertues; ſo by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the exceeding rich and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, [to be partakers of the Divine Nature.] And as it was ſaid of thoſe Virgins that were to be brought unto King <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> Eſt. 2.12. They were firſt to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and perſumed a year, one half thereof with Oyle of Myrrhe, and the other with ſweet Odors. So this Impreſſion of Eternity ſhews us, that all our life time here, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but our perſuming time, to fit us with the fragrancie of all heavenly graces and endowments, that then willingly and chearfully we may mount up out of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of this world, as it is ſaid
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170254:65"/>of the Church, Cant. 5.6. perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Myrrhe and Incenſe, and all the Spices of the Merchants; fraught with the full fragrancie &amp; ſweetneſſe of all Heavenly Graces.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, It makes us that not onely we are not content to ſit downe quietly doting on theſe earthly things on this ſide of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as is ſaid) but further, It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the ſoul, ſets it on fire, and furniſheth it with grounds and arguments to attain to a habit of ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and groaning earneſtly to be cloathed with our houſe which is from heaven, not onely from the excellencies of all that glory and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence ſhewed of this heavenly houſe (which is abundantly enough to make us to long after the ſame) but alſo, in regard of thoſe grievous and heavy preſſures, and burthens wherewith we are preſſed down in this life: as what can we name wherewith we are not more or leſs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170254:65"/>preſſed down or burthened? ſo that that we have juſt cauſe to ſigh and groan earneſtly for this our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe.</p>
               <p>The body it ſelf, is a heavy lump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh corruptible body, ſubject to much toil labour and wearineſſe, which maketh us to ſigh and groan much; beſides the trouble and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe of ſo many troops of diſeases and ſickneſſes, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the condition of our frail bodies, cauſes of continuall ſighing and groaning. But in heaven all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and diſeaſes ſhal haven an end, with perfection of health for ever, and the body ſhall be no more lumpiſh or heavy as now, but a nimble ſpirituall body, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.21. Where they ſhall follow the Lamb whereſoever he goeth, it being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whereſoever Chriſt is, or ſhall ſhew himſelf; the body then being nimble and ſpiritual, able to mount upwards or downwards, backwards
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170254:66"/>or forwards, as ſwift as thoughts are now.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And then, wonderfull weights and preſſures, we have from others and from our own ſpirits, preſſing them down; burthens by the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing with others, weeping and mourning with them that weep, in priſon with them that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and ſo forth of all other miſeries bearing a part with them. And the bearing with the paſſions and infirmities of others is alſo a great burthen; to ſtoop to them and bear with them, as Nurſes and Parents do with their Childrens infirmities. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of others is alſo a great burthen unto us, for which, <hi>David, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> were ſo grieved and burthened. And from others alſo we endure Slanders and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of all ſorts; yea, and it is alſo ſome burthen unto us,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> That we are not able to do more good
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170254:66"/>unto others, and help them in their miſeries. But in heaven all theſe things ſhall have an end, all ſhall love and joy alike, all be of one will, mind, and affection; no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions, paſſions, diſtempers, miſtakings can be there; no Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Tale-bearers, or reports ſhall vex there; no Sorrow, Griefe, or Want ſhall be there, no objects of our compaſſion to grieve us, all ſhall have enough with a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſuitable unto heaven.</p>
               <p>And here our ſpirits have griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous burthens, vexing our ſpirits: <hi>and our affections of love and joy,</hi> are diſordered, either ſet on wrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or doting too much on earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, or coming far ſhort in joying or loving of God, whom we ſhould joy in with all our might, and love with all our ſtrength and delight, and can never joy in, or delight too much: theſe preſſe us down, as was ſaid of Chriſt, that his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170254:67"/>ſoul was heavy even unto death, ſo theſe depreſſe us, and make us lumpiſh, and (as it were) rounds his about with ſorrow. <hi>Now a Man that hath a little glimpſe of the glory excellency and eternity of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly eſtate by faith, knowing that then all ſorrows and tears ſhall be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and done away, cannot chuſe but groan earneſtly to be cloathed with its houſe which is from heaven. Becauſe in heaven there ſhall be no more erring in our affections, which ſhall all be placed on the right object; and then there ſhal be no more fear of doting upon the creature, or of the exceſs, degree, or meaſure of our love to God, or joying in him, whom we cannot too exceſſively love: for as on earth we cannot love him too much, ſo in heaven we ſhal not be able to love him too little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here <hi>our ignorance is great,</hi> and a burthen to us, a great toil and labour to attain knowledge, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170254:67"/>a burthen to be ſuch non-profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to profit ſo little and ſlowly in ſearch thereof; yea having attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a little knowledge, then it is a burthen to know ſo little of that we ſhould know, and that ſo much remains yet to be known; we are ignorant of. And when our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is here at the height, then is our burthen greateſt of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we moſt of all ſee into our own miſery and want in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (eſpecially in heavenly things) ſo that that falleth out to be true which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that he who increaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth ſorrow. <hi>But in heaven, the ſoul ſhal not be capable of any ignorance, but as ſoon as the interpoſing veil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſoul and heaven ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, as ſoon as this curtain ſhall be drawn, it ſhal be filled (as it were) in a moment with perfection of all knowledge, more then all this world ever had ſince the creation, were it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170254:68"/>altogether in one: ſo that now both our ignorance and knowledge, when we know are a great burthen unto us,</hi> and cauſes of groaning earneſtly, and ſighing for our houſe, which is from heaven.</p>
               <p>Our callings are alſo ſome bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then unto us, be what they will, on way or other there is weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe or vexation in them, and even the miniſtry it ſelf a great burthen to undergo, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himſelf, undergoing the care of all the Churches. <hi>But in heaven no burthens, weariſomeneſſe, or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhalbe in any thing we go about, but all done with eaſe, and much faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and cheerfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then alſo, <hi>there is a bondage of corruption in the wil,</hi> refractory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all goodneſſe, prone unto al e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, in all holy duty ſtill going whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our fleſh would not, which is unruly and untamed, ſo as we have great warring betwixt the fleſh and

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Some Caſes when Beleevers otherwiſe very good men, cannot thus ſigh and groan to be cloathed with this their houſe which is from heaven.</head>
               <p>Which may appear, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>others</hi> and <hi>our ſelves.</hi> Firſt, for <hi>others:</hi> Many beleevers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſpare this Sighing and Groaning (at leaſt ſuſpend the

Remember me, O Lord, with the favour of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, viſite mee with thy Salvation, that I may ſee the felicity of thy choſen, and rejoyce with thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and glory with thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ſome alſo, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are very able to comfort and help others, and therefore are ſparing to Sigh and Groan for this heavenly houſe, becauſe they may be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto others; as <hi>Paul,</hi> though in regard of himſelfe he could have been contented to have flowne into heaven; yet in regard of Others, he armed himſelf with that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſelf denial, to be contented to live for their ſakes. And ſo alſo may many other good Chriſtians linger and draw back from earneſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170254:70"/>groaning after this heavenly houſe, in regard of Others. Parents ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would live to ſee their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bred and brought up in the fear of God, and ſee the proſperity of other friends, and are not ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in Sighing and Groaning after their Diſſolution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For <hi>our ſelves;</hi> Wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may draw back from Death, and Sighing and Groaning after this heavenly houſe to be cloathed therewith, in divers caſes. Firſt, When we want the comfortable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Aſſurance of our Salvation; and when our Evidences of heaven are ſo ſlurred and blotted that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read the ſame, or have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them: Then we cannot ſigh and groan after this heavenly houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we are able more clearly to read our evidences. And Secondly, We <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are ſometimes ignorant of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Excllency and Eternity thereof, and ſo we cannot ſigh and groane
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170254:71"/>earneſtly for the ſame which we are ignorant of and know not, and yet for all this, may be good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Beleever, though they fail and come ſhort in theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And Thirdly, When for our humbling, the Lord is pleaſed ſometimes to ſet our ſins before us, and therewith the wrath due unto them; then, not daring to looke God in the face, they dare not look on death to encounter that, and ſo are far from ſighing and groaning after this heavenly houſe: as wee ſee in <hi>David,</hi> a holy reconciled man after Gods own heart; yet Pſ. 38.4. when God ſuffered his ſins to ſtare him in the face, he then complains, [Mine Inquities are gone over my head, &amp; as a heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me:] and ſo prays, Pſ. 39.19. [Stay thine hand from me, that I may recover my ſtrength, before I go hence &amp; be not.] Now, a ſenſe of ſin and wrath now and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170254:71"/>then being given unto the Saints, they cannot then groane earneſtly to be cloathed with this heavenly houſe. Fourthly, And again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> We are ſometimes to buſtle with the delights and pleaſures of this world, which ſteals away our hearts from ſighing and groaning after this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly houſe; which makes that with ſo much adoe we are drawn away from wallowing in them; as we ſee in <hi>Lot,</hi> a good holy man, yet what adoe was there to draw him away from Sodome, that whileſt he prolonged the time, he was in a manner pulled out of it; and when he was pulled away from it, yet he makes interceſſion for Zoar, which was one of thoſe Cities, that his ſoul might live, Gen. 19.20. And ſometimes again, Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The ſoul is as it were in priſon, and off hooks, as a door off the hinges, with ſtrong and many amazing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, ſo as the ſoule is not it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170254:72"/>ſelf, nor able to look after heavenly things, having much adoe to wraſtle after theſe encumbrances, when it is unfit to ſigh and groane earneſtly after heavenly things, yea, not to mannage earthly comforts; as it fell out with the children of Iſrael, Exod. 6.9. that though <hi>Moſes</hi> told them excellent things of the Egyptian bondage and captivity yet (it is ſaid there) That they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened not unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for anguiſh of Spirit, and for cruel Bondage; So that vexations of earthly encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances and wants, are great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments unto this ſighing and groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning earneſtly after heavenly things in this our houſe which is from heaven. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And ſometimes alſo in regard that our Accounts are not ready, we ſhrink and draw back again being loath to encounter death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Laſtly in this caſe we make no haſt but ſhun death, and ſighing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170254:72"/>and groaning after this heavenly houſe, <hi>becauſe we look on death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrong notions and apprehenſions,</hi> and therefore run from it, <hi>as</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>fled from his ſtaff when it was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Serpent,</hi> untill God quiet our ſpirits, and bid us to take it up again, ſhewing us that there is no danger in it, and making us in love with it. For indeed, <hi>Death is a part of the Saints portion,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 22 all things are yours ſaith he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas</hi> or the World, or life, or death, whether they be things preſent or things to come; all are yours, <hi>&amp;c. what great matter is this for death to be ours?</hi> O yes, a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it is ordered, as the Grave is ſanctified and perfumed by Chriſt, and as it were an inlet unto Glory, being the door of life; this alſo is Ours, and a great part of our portion, one of Chriſts prime Legacies. It ſeems that <hi>Iob</hi> had no
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170254:73"/>Croſſe, or bad apprehenſions of Death, Job. 6.11. <hi>What power have I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I ſhould endure? or what is my end if I ſhould prolong my life?</hi> And <hi>David</hi> he ſaith, Mark the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, and behold the juſt; for the end of that man is peace, Pſal. 37.37. and indeed if we look through the Scripture Glaſſe upon Death, it is nothing to a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, apprehending it rightly. For, then we ſee it to be nothing elſe, but <hi>A ſleep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Death what.</note> 
                  <hi>A peaceable rest, A gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to our fathers and people, The funeral day of all our ſins, and final destruction of all our enemies, The gate of heaven,</hi> as it were, <hi>Our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation day, and the Reſurrection of all our comforts, with which, and the like apprehenſions, we may come (as it were) to bury death it ſelf.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle we ſee ſpeaking of death, he paſſeth it over ſlightly, &amp; mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely <hi>the clothing after it:</hi> inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that which we ſhall have

               </p>
               <p>In all theſe and many more caſes (too tedious now to inſiſt in) the ſoul cannot ſigh and groan earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cloathed with this heavenly houſe, though otherwiſe Beleevers and good Chriſtians; wherefore in theſe and the like caſes, we muſt not be at quiet with our ſelves, until we have ſhaken off theſe lazy preſſing down habits of our diſtempers, with holy <hi>David</hi> chiding our ſelves as he did his ſoul, <hi>Why art thou cast down O my ſoul? and why art thou diſquietêd within me? wait on God, for I will yet give him thanks; he is my preſent help and my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at other times,<note place="margin">Times when the ſoul can ſigh and groan for Heaven.</note> 
                  <hi>when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to ſay unto our ſouls I am thy Salvation, when hee anoints our eyes with ſpiritual eye-ſalve to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170254:74"/>ſee a far off into things inviſible; when heavens gates are opened unto us by a powerful preaching and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of truth unto us, our beleeving breaking forth into rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, when with an enlarged heart we can run the ways of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the feet of them that bring glad tidings being beautiful upon the mountains unto us. And Christ comming by them, leaping by the mountains and skipping by the hils of our ſins to comfort and ſtabliſh us: when the water of our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is clear and not muddie, ſo as we can read our evidences in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with many ſtrong reports of the ſpirit, joyning with our ſpirits, when the bloud in our justification runs fully and clearly before us, that we can powerfully apprehend the ſame. And when in meditation wrapt a little, heaven and heavenly things ſeem great and glorious unto us, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things (compared with them)
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170254:74"/>mean and contemptible, when Christ becommeth that pretious pearl known and beloved above all things; for which we are contented to ſell all; when we have got ſome ſight and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of heaven, and eternity of glory, having been victorious in ſome ſharp croſſes, trials, and afflictions: having ſacrificed our</hi> Iſaacs <hi>and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto ſome good meaſure of ſelf denial, in uprightneſſe and ſincerity, being humbled Saintlike, to ſit down at Gods feet, and be whatſoever he will have us to be.</hi> Then, then, the ſoul cannot chuſe but ſigh and groan earneſtly to be cloathed with its houſe which is from heaven.</p>
               <p>And very great reaſon there is to ſigh and groan earneſtly for (a houſe of glory) ſuch a houſe as will keep us out of all dangers, and ſupply all our wants.

Which glory even Chriſt himſelf in the days of his fleſh prayed for, <hi>Iob.</hi> 17.5. And now O Father, glorifie me with thine own ſelf, with that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which I had with thee before the world was: that is, that the glory of the Divinity might ſhine forth (joyned with his Humanity) as bright as ever.</p>
