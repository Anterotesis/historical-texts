         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO HIS Dear COUNTREYMEN.</head>
            <p>THat the faith firſt delivered was the true faith no man can deny, but he that will accuſe Chriſt, and his Apoſtles of falſhood. All the difficulty is how aſsuredly to know this faith. To come to know it by force of argument and diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſurpaſſeth the capacity of moſt, wearieth many, brings many to deſpair lulling them at laſt into a total neglect of that whereof they ought to be moſt diligent. It would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe be a very ready and eaſie way even to the moſt unlearned to find this faith out moſt aſsuredly (if it were poſſible) with ſmall expences and little labour, by travelling into ſome countrey where all men confeſs this true faith to be ſtill uncorruptedly practiſed. For there without any noiſe of diſputation, we ſhal ſtand veiwing with our own eies, what is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in that happy country, ſo that though a thouſand crafty ſophyſters and ſubtile diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb facs="tcp:59591:5"/>
ſhould go about by words to perſwade me who am unlearned that the practiſes of that country, were not the ſame that my own eyes moſt att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntively and frequently ſee again and again, it wil not be poſſible for me prudently to give the leaſt credit to theſe captious diſputants: but I would ever credit more my own eyes then their arguments.</p>
            <p>Now then all the difficulty is how to make us witneſſes of what is practised in ſuch a country as undoubtedly holdeth and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the true faith, and to doe this with ſmal expence amd little labour. I hope (dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt country man) thou canst not ſay that the price of this little hook can either put thee to any conſiderable expence, or the labour of ſome three or at the moſt four howers required for the reading thereof put thee to much labour. Yet if this be done by thee thou wilt be as good as an eye witneſſe of the faith practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in our countrey in that age wherein it is very eaſie to prove the true faith to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly flouriſht in this our countrey. Firſt becauſe this faith was confirmed by the Preachers thereof with a number of <hi>miracles</hi> related in this ſhort book written by as worthy a man as ever was known to have handled Pen in <hi>England,</hi> in a book which no man ever judgd corrupted or written by any other pen
<pb facs="tcp:59591:5"/>
then <hi>Venerable Bedes</hi> a perſon not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd by any other of our nation. Secondly This faith here deſcribed as practiſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> immediately upon her converſion under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> was not found one jot differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from that faith which the <hi>Scotts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us had received by <hi>Palladius</hi> their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle ſent by Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Anno. <hi>423.</hi> as we ſhew here out of <hi>Bede</hi> li. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi> Only the <hi>Scotts</hi> fell to celebrate <hi>Eaſter</hi> at a wrong time not uſing likewiſe the ſame manner of ſhaving their crowns in their clergy either Religious or Secular. They differed not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any one of theſe points in which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> differ from Roman Catholicks as we note l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> whence being at laſt brought viz. to keep <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and to uſe the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſhaving the crowns of their Priests and Monks, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did, they diſagreed from them in nothing at all, as is cleer out of the three laſt chapters of <hi>Bede.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> therefore which thou here ſeeſt practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> is the very ſame which was held forth and practiſed in <hi>Scotland</hi> from the firſt converſion thereof, which was not four hundred years after <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſion, it being but four hundred and twenty three years after his <hi>Incarnation</hi> as hath been ſaid; yea this <hi>Faith</hi> thus practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:59591:6"/>
the very ſelf ſame which was taught the old <hi>Britans</hi> a little more then a hundred years after <hi>Chriſts</hi> Paſſion. For it was in the hundred fifty ſixth year after his Incarnation that holy pope <hi>Eluetherius</hi> ſent thoſe Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preachers, who baptized King <hi>Lucius</hi> and his people as you ſhall ſee l. <hi>1. c. 4.</hi> The old <hi>Britans</hi> being by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (who ſubdued this land being as yet heathens) driven into <hi>Wales</hi> ſtill kept the faith they received, and at the time that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were converted they were not found to differ, from what <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> taught the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in any one point, in which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or any of our other Religions differ from <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> in ſo much that as <hi>Bede</hi> relateth <hi>l. 2. c. 2.</hi> they were ready to joyn with <hi>Auſtine</hi> if he had but riſen up unto them when their ſeven Biſhops entred the ſynod where he was, and in this ſynod all their controverſie then was about keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi> at a ſeveral time, and about ſome difference in <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> neither was there any point hindring <hi>Auſtine</hi> to hold communion with them but theſe two. They remaining obſtinate in defending theſe againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>univerſal Church</hi> became <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> were confuted by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and their ruine miraculouſly foretold to be at hand for this their diviſion, and

            <p>And becauſe travellers deſire to have Card or Map, of all the countryes and Townes which they are to ſee in their Travels.

<pb facs="tcp:59591:7"/>
her Faith in the fourth Age after <hi>Chriſts</hi> Paſſion, ſends forth her <hi>Monks</hi> to joyn with thoſe Apoſtles ſent us by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and his Succeſſors. But now in this our new <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Church to be a <hi>Monk</hi> is to be a <hi>Traitor:</hi> then they were our Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe Apoſtles of ours did <hi>Miracles</hi> ſo frequently, that the <hi>Pope</hi> thought it neceſſary to write to them to be mindful of humility, ſor fear the multitude of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they wrought might by pride endanger them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both high and low, eagerly then embraced Monaſtical Vows. This courſe of life was accounted the moſt ready way to Heaven. Our Kings left their Thrones, and ſhaving the crowns of their heads, put on the habit of poor <hi>Monks.</hi> Everywhere in your travels you ſhall meet with <hi>Abbyes</hi> and <hi>Abbots,</hi> and <hi>Abbeſſes,</hi> with <hi>Monaſteries</hi> and <hi>Monks,</hi> with <hi>Nuns,</hi> and <hi>Nunneries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Theſe <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> ſhine frequently with extraordinary ſanctity of life, are endowed with the gift of Prophecy, very often made partakers of <hi>Heavenly Viſions</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> and graced with many <hi>Miracles.</hi>

book I have everywhere in the Margent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted down for thee all the places where every one of theſe half hundred points may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by thee in the ſhort paſſage through this Book.</p>
            <p>In leſs then a quarter of an hour thou (by caſting an eye upon theſe Marginal notes) maieſt take a ſufficient proof of any point here mentioned, and ſee if what I ſay be not as clearly to be ſeen in the practiſe of <hi>this old pure Church,</hi> as it is here ſet down by me in this Summary of ſuch things as are in this Book to be view'd. Whence the Reader cannot but ſee either the groſs ignorance or over-laſhing boldneſs of Dr. <hi>Henry Ferne,</hi> who durſt lately ſay, that the faith which <hi>England</hi> caſt off in <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> his daies (or rather in the daies of <hi>Q.

prov'd in the beginning of this Preface) was the ſame which the <hi>Scots</hi> had receiv'd in the fourth Age, and which the old <hi>Britans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived even in the beginning of the 2d.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me then undoubtedly the faith of <hi>England</hi> was uncorrupt: You have eaſt off the faith agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all points now in controverſie with that faith; therefore you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> off the true faith. And this very faith is the only faith which <hi>England</hi> cannot now endure, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us <hi>point by point</hi> to abjure in her new coined oath of <hi>Abjuration:</hi> ſo unlike is this preſent <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> to the <hi>Old Engliſh Church.</hi> If this ſhort Work makes thee not to ſee this with thy eies, I deſire no kind of credit with thee; but if with thy own eies thou ſeeſt all this, then I beſeech thee as thou loveſt thy own ſoul, not to let thoſe find cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with thee, who would perſwade thee that to be falſe, which thy eies tell thee to be moſt true.</p>

               </gap>t not ſay that the Faith of this Age was corrupted in any point, in which <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> differ from <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or from any of our many Religions in <hi>England.</hi> For I have already ſhewed <hi>(N. i.)</hi> that the Faith of this Age in all thoſe points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the Faith not onely of the Fourth Age, in which the <hi>Scots</hi> receiv'd this very Faith, but alſo with the Faith which was not a hundred yeares after the finiſhing of the Scripture: at which time
<pb facs="tcp:59591:16"/>
our old <hi>Britans</hi> receiv'd this very ſelf-ſame Faith. That Faith was not corrupted: This was that very Faith, this therefore was not corrupted. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all we have taken out of <hi>Bede</hi> his Latine or Engliſh Copies, is wholly conformable to the Saxon Tranſlation of <hi>Bede,</hi> made ſo long agoe by King <hi>Alfride,</hi> and lately ſet forth by <hi>Abraham Welock</hi> a prime Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctor. For it was in all theſe places diligently conferred with that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. Lastly, If thou ſayeſt this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is incredible, becauſe it relates ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (to thee) incredible Hiſtories: I muſt tell thee, that either all ancient Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Fathers, who wrote any part of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, did notoriouſly lye, or elſe the like things happened alſo in all other Countreys at the times, and near to the times of their firſt converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>St. Gregory</hi> did write a great while after the converſion of <hi>Italy,</hi> and yet his <hi>Dialogues</hi> ſpeak of great wonders.

And I would have my Reader know that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them ſo plentifully for this end: and that it may appear what kind of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſuch men as <hi>Bede</hi> (that is, ſuch as <hi>England</hi> cannot match) believed to be true in that pure Age, and related to have them believed by Poſterity, which <hi>Bede</hi> and the chiefeſt of the Fathers would not have done, were they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the <hi>Faith</hi> of that <hi>Age.</hi> And againſt this Argument, thus taken from theſe Hiſtories, no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> can give ſo much as any thing like an Anſwer, for

The eccho from the hils reſounded, as though they had been thrice as many: whereat the Enemy was ſo amaz'd, as though heaven had fought againſt them: Whereupon with all ſpeed they fled, caſting away their weapons, thinking it enough if they could eſcape with life.

The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander (for all that) at night, commanded he ſhould be kept in Irons; yet none would hold him: for as ſoon as they were gone that bound him, his Fetters fell off.
