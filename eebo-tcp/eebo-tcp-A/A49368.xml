            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>OH Times! Unequal and Injurious Days:</l>
            <l>Oh Fates! whoſe Cypreſs hath outgrown the Bays:</l>
            <l>Oh Moneth! Unfortunate to all that's Good:</l>
            <l>Oh Place! the Poyſon of this Royal Blood.</l>
            <l>Whom ſhal we blame, where ſhal we lay the weight</l>
            <l>Of ſuch a Heavineſs? Forgive the State,</l>
            <l>The Publick Weal, whoſe open'd empty Veins</l>
            <l>Scarce can endure to hear his Bloody Pains.</l>
            <l>And have we juſt but ſeen him, is he come</l>
            <l>Onely to Die, t' ennoble but the Tombe?</l>
            <l>Are all the Honors, all the Glories done,</l>
            <l>Moſt Arbitrary Death? (Muſt ſuch a Son</l>
            <l>Die violently too) Stay, and give place to Fame,</l>
            <l>Whoſe great'ſt Attempt is but to reach his Name.</l>
            <l>What Autumn's this, why do we boaſt Increaſe?</l>
            <l>Deaths Harveſt's valued in this Single Peice:</l>
            <l>And what the Plague in numbers would infect</l>
            <l>(A judgement witched for by every Sect)</l>
            <l>The Small-pox in this great and glorious Youth</l>
            <l>Did in effect fulfill, and curſe with truth</l>
            <l>Their Divinations. Now, what dreſs of Grief</l>
            <l>Shall give our Sorrow and our Loſs belief?</l>
            <l>Which then of the three Kingdomes ſhall expire,</l>
            <l>And ſhine together in the Funeral Fire?</l>
            <l>O you bright Citizens of Heaven know</l>
            <l>There's nothing worth Him but the KING below.</l>
            <l>We had an Earthly TRINITY before,</l>
            <l>The Stamp of that which you above adore;</l>
            <l>And you agreed to have our Saint away,</l>
            <l>Urg'd by the rival Worſhip of laſt <hi>May.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now they are <hi>Gemini,</hi> and the Royal Line</l>
            <l>Grows leſs with Fortune, and advanc'd, Decline.</l>
            <l>What Rebels Pride and Staring Inſolence</l>
            <l>Brav'd not to Kill, ſee the unwarded Fence</l>
            <l>Of a juſt Triumph laid it in the Grave,</l>
            <l>And Vertue, Honor, Goodneſ could not ſave.</l>
            <l>Well then, to Grieve is to comply with Fate,</l>
            <l>And make the Tyrant proud, and keep his ſtate.</l>
            <l>We quarrel not at this moſt partial Lot,</l>
            <l>Onely we ask our SOVERAIGN, Why Not?</l>
            <l>'Tis a true Parentation to the Dead</l>
            <l>When Son and <note n="*" place="margin">Duke of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
               </note> Kinſman follow'd Him that bled,</l>
            <l>No other Life to Expiate that Crime?</l>
            <l>KINGS may, but Deſtinies allow no Time.</l>
            <l>Our Loſs is greater than we dare to own,</l>
            <l>Let it not be among late Rebels known.</l>
            <l>Great Soul! whoſe Limits ſcarce can be defin'd,</l>
            <l>Better by Heaven than thy Moderate Mind:</l>
            <l>Thou ow'ſt not any thing to Life or Glory,</l>
