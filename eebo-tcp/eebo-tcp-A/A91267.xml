            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you cannot but take notice of <hi>Mal. 2. 1, 2, 8, 9. And
now, O ye Prieſts, this commandement is for you. If ye
will not hear, if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory
unto my name, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I will even ſend a
curſe upon you, and will even curſe your bleſſings; yea, I
have curſed them already, becauſe ye do not lay it to heart,
Behold, I will corrupt your ſeed, and ſpread dung upon

thus contemptible and baſe before all the people?</hi> Yea,
hath not your caſting off the Lords Supper for ſo many

they which eat of the Sacrifices partakers of the Altar?

ye are the Temple of the living God; as God hath ſaid, I

God, and they ſhall be my people. Wherefore come out
from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and
touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you, &amp;c.</hi> A

their many years ſinfull ſecluſion from this Sacrament,

<hi>that the people in the Primitive Church RECEIVED
THE HOLY COMMUNION EVERY DAY (when

ſine viatico, <hi>without their voyage proviſion) and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently

afterward BY THE NEGLIGENCE AND UNDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOTION
OF THE PEOPLE</hi> (in not repairing ſo
frequently to the Communion as at firſt) It is great
pity ſo good a thing (as it is ſuppoſed) ſhould have no
better beginning. One ſpecial principle of theſe mens
Doctrine, is, <hi>to imbar the people from reading and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the Scriptures, &amp; to ſuffer them to know nothing;</hi>
for that, as ſome of them<note n="q" place="margin">Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Tit. 15. Diviſ. 7. fol. 155 b.</note> have ſaid, <hi>THEY BE
DOGS &amp; SWINE, AND THERFORE SHOULD
NOT PRECIOUS STONES BE LAID BEFORE
THEM:</hi> yet now muſt their negligence be the rule
of Chriſts Religion. This is laid as the ground and
foundation of the whole cauſe. <hi>Charity,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is
cold, and the people careleſſe.</hi> But therefore hath God
appointed Paſtors and Miniſters to overſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
the people, and not to ſuffer them to periſh in
their negligence. Were it a matter of tithes, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
payment, the people ſhould be called upon, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115472:21"/>
not ſuffered in any wiſe to be negligent, neither
ſhould their negligence ſtand for excuſe; how much
leſſe ſhould it be ſuffered when the caſe toucheth
God? The Biſhops and Fathers in the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<note n="r" place="margin">Council Brac. 2. cap. 84. Seu ex Synodo Graeco collecto.</note> holden at <hi>Bracara</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> decreed thus. <hi>If any
man reſort unto the Church, and hear the Scriptures, and
FOR NEGLIGENCE OR WANTONESSE WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRAWETH
HIMSELF FROM THE COMMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NION
OF THE SACRAMENT, and in the reverend
myſteries does break the rule of diſcipline; we decree, that
ſuch a one be put out of the Catholick Church, until
he have done penance, and ſhewed the fruits of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that having obtained pardon, he may be received
again to the holy Communion.</hi> Thus the godly Fathers
in old times did not flatter and favour the peoples
negligence in this Caſe, as Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
doe; but exhorted, warned, reproved, rebuked
them, called them MALAPERT and IMPUDENT,
THAT WOULD BE PRESENT, AND NOT RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEIVE,
AND EXCOMMUNICATED THEM
FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE: But theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe
turn away their faces from their Brethren,
and ſuppreſſe their voice, and will not be heard, &amp;c.
and find no fault with the people; but rather make
them believe, that they receive for them, and apply
Chriſts death unto them by their Maſs, &amp; that the very
hearing thereof is ſufficient for them, and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and thus, as much as in them lyeth, THEY
INCREASE THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE
PEOPLE, AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM
THE HOLY COMMUNION. The people is
taught nothing, they underſtand nothing, they ſee
nothing, neither comfort, nor memory of Chriſt, nor
benefit of his paſſion. And this is the cauſe of their
Negligence; therefore they ſtand thus back, and
withdraw themſelves: Howbeit what needeth Mr.
<hi>Harding</hi> to charge the people with negligence and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115472:22"/>
undevotion? THE POPE HIMSELF AND HIS
CARDINALS DOE SCARCELY COMMUNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATE
ONCE IN A YEAR; BUT ARE AS NEG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGENT
AND AS UNDEVOUT THEREIN AS
THE MOST PART OF THE PEOPLE. Now
let us view the weight of Mr. <hi>Hardings</hi> reaſons. <hi>The
people is negligent and undevout,</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Priest may
ſay Maſſe alone.</hi> This Argument is very weak. So
might Mr <hi>Harding</hi> ſay, <hi>The people will not hear the word

preach alone. For Chriſts Supper</hi> (as<note n="ſ" place="margin">Auguſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Goſpel is received, glad to give teſtimony thereof,
&amp; to increaſe the ſame, BY THE HOLY COMMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NION

condemneth for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> CAN BE SO DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOUT,
AND HE AND HIS CATHOLICKS
THUS REMAIN WITHOUT DEVOTION?
Let the people be taught; let them hear the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration

the holy myſteries, and feel comfort and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <hi>The

<hi>Here in few words he condemneth the whole Church

whom, as he ſaith, there is not one well dispoſed and worthy,

               </hi> Harding <hi>wiſh indeed, that the

them? <hi>Doubtleſs there are many godly men among the
people, and oftentimes more virtuouſly diſpoſed a great
deal than the Prieſt. Neither is it of their unworthineſs
that they abſtain ſo often; nor of their worthineſs, that they
receive once a yeac, <hi>but only of cuſtom.</hi>
               </hi> But if the
People be ſlack, yet muſt the Prieſt doe the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,

Chriſt unto his Father for the ſinnes of the world.
<hi>Herein appeareth the wanton folly of this people: That
they may do, and are commanded to do, they will not do;
but that they cannot do, that they will needs doe, &amp;c.</hi>
Chriſts death muſt be kept in remembrance; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
the Prieſt is bound to ſay daily Maſſe, yea although
there be no man to receive with him. <hi>Alas! How
holdeth this poor argument? Or how may we make it
good? Is there no other mean to remember Chriſts death,

for the proviſion is very little to ſerve many. That all be

for neither the Priest nor the Deacon, either by word

for them if they were called; Yet are not theſe men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to ſay,</hi> They ſhall be received that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed

we speak. And the</hi> Pagans <hi>in their ſacrifices were wont

Pariſhioners from the Lords Table, and by the people
voluntarily to withdraw, debar themſelves from it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chriſts own precept and their bounden duties,
to the prejudice, if not peril of their ſouls. Which I

to ſtirr all up to a like conſcientious, holy preparation
in all their publike or private approaches to God in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duties; to rectifie this common, ſuperſtitious,
epidemical errour, that moſt think they are unworthy,
unprepared for the Lords Supper only, even then when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115472:32"/>
they deem themſelves not ſo for all or any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

            <p>1. <hi>That the Cuſtom of the Popes Church and Popiſh
Clergy is, uſually to adminiſter the Lords Supper to the
People, but once or twice a year, by which means the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of Christ is broken, the Sacrament of Chriſt
neglected, the death of Christ not ſo earneſtly remembred,
the people become unthankefull, diſſolute in life, vice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,

amongſt us, not only neglect, but peremptorily refuſe to
adminiſter the Sacrament to their Pariſhioners &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſo oft as once or twice every year at certain times;
but not ſo much as once in two, three, or four yeares
ſpace, or more, together? whereby all the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſins and evils are more multiplied amongſt us of
late years, than formerly in times of Poperie:
Herein therefore they are more inexcuſable and

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:115472:34"/>
2ly, <hi>That the Pope and Popiſh Prieſts made the peoples
negligence and undevotion in not reſorting daily and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to the Lords Supper, the rule of Chriſts religion,
and Ground-Work of their private Maſſes. And inſtead
of controuling, rebuking the people for not repairing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
and daily to this Sacrament, they ſuffered them
to perſevere and periſh in this their negligence; yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
their negligence, and diſcouraged them from the
holy Communion: whereas, were it a matter of Tithes
or other payments, they ſhould be called upon, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in any wiſe to be negligent, neither ſhould their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
stand for excuſe.</hi> And do not our Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,
Independent Miniſters, crept into many Pariſh
Churches, and ſome Presbyterians likewiſe, make the
peoples negligence, ignorance, unpreparedneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion,
the very Ground-work of their caſting off
and diſcontinuing all publike Communions in their
Churches, there formerly celebrated every Month, or
quarterly at leaſt, and to ſet up private Communions
in their Conventicles and private Meetings to ſome few
ſelected Proſelites like ſo many private <hi>Maſſes;</hi> yea,
inſtead of exciting their Pariſhioners to the frequent
conſtant receiving the Lords Supper, and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them for their undevotion, backwardneſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting

Arguments to diſſwade, deter, debar them from
the leaſt acceſſe unto it; though ſtrict and diligent in
calling on them for their own Tithes, dues, wherein no

in Chriſtian Communion, unity, amity, as being all fed
together, and partakers of this one bread: That by their
common open receiving of this holy communion frequently
together, they do openly teſtifie and declare, that they are
all one in Chriſt Jeſus, and all one amongſt themſelves;
That this is the principal means to joyn &amp; keep them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;

               <hi>Helvetia,</hi> cap. 12. writes thus of this Holy Supper,
<hi>Moreover we are admoniſhed, in the celebration of the
Supper of the Lord to be mindfull of the body whereof we
are made Members, and that therefore <hi>we be at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
with all our Brethren,</hi> that we live holily, and
not pollute our ſelves with wickedneſs and <hi>ſtrange Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,</hi>
but <hi>perſevering in the faith to the end of our
life,</hi> give diligence to excell in holineſſe of life.</hi> With
which accords the <hi>Former Confeſſion of Helvetia,</hi> in
theſe words, <hi>Alſo the Lords Supper is as a badge unto
us: for as one loaf, and one wine, are made of many grains
and grapes; ſo we being the whole multitude of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
are gathered together to be one bread and one body.
By this we teſtifie in an outward profeſſion, that we are
redeemed by the bloud of Chriſt, and made the members
of Chriſt, to whom we give thanks, <hi>in whom we are
Confederates,</hi> and do promiſe to perform mutual duties
one towards another.</hi> The <hi>Confeſſion of Saxony</hi> thus
ſeconds them, <hi>God will have this publick receiving to
be a Confeſſion, whereby thou maiſt ſhew what kind of

they embraced this Doctrine,</hi> and did invocate this
God,</hi> who delivered the Goſpel, <hi>and that they were
ſeparated from the worſhippers of Diana, Iupiter,
and other Idols. <hi>For God will be ſeen and have this
Church heard in the World,</hi> and have it diſtinguiſhed by
many Publike Signs from other Nations. <hi>And the

of all the premiſes, compiled, publiſhed for this
much-deſired end alone.</p>
            <p>For a cloſe of all, I ſhall deſire all proud Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
ſupercilious, over-ſevere Miniſters and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
puffed up with ſuch a ſwelling conceit of their
own tranſcendent Holineſſe, worthineſſe, and moſt
others unworthineſſe, that they think them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unworthy to communicate with them at the
Lords Table; to conſider ſeriouſly with themſelves,
theſe few particulars, which may abate this their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
pride and uncharitableneſſe, and reform their
erronious practices in this kind.</p>
            <p>1. Adviſedly ruminate upon Chriſts own <hi>parable</hi>
of the <hi>boaſting Phariſee, and humbled ſinfull Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
who went both up together into the Temple to pray;
and which of theſe two Chriſt himſelf justified,</hi> Luke 18.
9. to 15. <hi>Which Parable he ſpake unto certain who
truſted in themſelves, as being righteous, and deſpiſed
others, v.</hi> 9. This alone methinks ſhould at leaſt abate,
if not fully cure this their overweaning ſelf-conceit.
Compared with thoſe <hi>Iſay 65. 5. Which ſay</hi> (to
others) <hi>stand by thy ſelf, come not near to me,</hi> FOR
I AM HOLIER THAN THOV. <hi>Theſe</hi> are a
ſmoak in my noſe, a fire that burneth all the day;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115472:50"/>
               <hi>Behold, it is written before me, I will not keep ſilence,
even recompence into their boſoms.</hi> Let all ſuch pure
Juſticiaries take heed they come not within the verge
and cenſure of Prov. 30. 12. 13. <hi>There is a generation
that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not waſhed
from their fillhineſſe. O how lofty are their eyes, and
their eye lids are lifted up:</hi> (with ſpiritual pride)
Withall let them remember that of <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 5. and 1
<hi>Pet. 5. 5. Yea, all of you be cloathed with humility, for
God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace unto the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
With that of <hi>Phil. 2. 3. Let nothing be done
through ſtrife or vain-glory; but in lowlineſſe of mind,
let each eſteem other.</hi> BETTER THAN HIMSELF.
And then they would ſeclude none from the Lords
Table (eſpecially before a legal conviction, trial,
and ſentence of Excommunication judicially paſſed
againſt them) as unworthy to bear them company,
being as good, or <hi>better than themſelves,</hi> in the
judgement of true Chriſtian Charity and Humility, if
they purſue this Apoſtolical precept.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly, Let them Ponder our Saviours own precept,
Mat. 7. 1. Luke</hi> 6. 37. Judge not, that ye not judged;
Condemn not, and ye ſhall not be condemned. <hi>With that
of</hi> Rom. 14 4, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who art thou that judgeſt another
mans ſervant? to his own Maſter he ſtaudeth or falleth;
But why dost thou judge thy Brother? or why doſt thou
ſet at nought thy Brother? (<hi>yea count, call him a meer</hi>
Dogg <hi>or</hi> Swine, <hi>and ſeclude him from Chriſts Table
as ſuch, before any legal</hi> trial or conviction of him as
ſuch?) We ſhall all ſtand before the judgement ſent of
Christ, &amp;c. So then, every one of us ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of himſelf to God. <hi>LET VS NOT THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE
IVDGE ONE ANOTHER ANY MORE.
Compared with</hi> 1 Corinth. 4. 3, 4, 5: But with me it
is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of
mans day (<hi>or judgement</hi>) yea I judge not my ſelf, but
he that judgeth me is the Lord. Therefore <hi>IVDGE
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115472:50"/>
NOTHING BEFORE THE TIME,</hi> until the Lord
come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; wil make manifeſt the counſel of the hearts; &amp; then
ſhall every man have praiſe of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 12, 13. So ſpeak,
and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
For he ſhall have judgement without mercy, that
hath ſhewed no mercy; and mercy rejoyceth againſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>John</hi> 7. 51. Doth our Law judge any man before
it bear him, and know what he doth? <hi>Which texts duly
weighed, would take off all raſh, cenſorious, private,
illegal judgements paſſed upon whole Pariſhes hearts,
and ſpiritual eſtates, and ſuſpenſions of them from the
Lords Table upon bare ſurmiſes, before any judicial
hearing, trial, conviction of their ſcandalous Crimes
and Offences, deſerving ſuch a ſevere, unchriſtian cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
by thoſe who have no divine nor humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to inflict it, as now they doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3ly. Let ſuch remember, that as Chriſt himſelf never
erected any private Conſiſtory in himſelf, his Apoſtles,
Miniſters or Presbyterian Claſſis for the trial, examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any mans knowledge, preparation, worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
