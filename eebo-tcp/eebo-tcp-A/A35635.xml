            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the now <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice Scroggs,</hi> being Lord of the ſeveral Mannors of <hi>Southweald,</hi> and <hi>Goſtead</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> his Lordſhip in 1672. (did upon a pretended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture) Wrongfully Seize into his Hand and Poſſeſſion, a certain Copy-hold Meſſuage, and divers Copy-hold Lands, of 35 <hi>l.</hi> Yearly value, held of the ſaid ſeveral Mannors; And which were then the Eſtates and Inheritance of one <hi>Thomas Danwood,</hi> Unkle of the above mentioned <hi>Richard Radley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſoon after his Lordſhip had ſo Seized the Premiſes, he Felled all the Timber thereupon then growing, worth 100 <hi>l.</hi> And thenceforth received all the Rents and Profits of the Premiſes; which his Lordſhip inſiſted to be abſolutely his own, and therefore would not reſtore the Poſſeſſion thereof unto the ſaid <hi>Thomas Danwood,</hi> albeit, he ſeveral times in all humble and ſitting manner, beſought his Lordſhip ſo to do. Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Thomas Danwood,</hi> was enforced to commence ſeveral Actions at Law, in Treſpaſs and Ejectment againſt his Lordſhips Under-Tennants of the Premiſes; Which being brought to Tryal at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> the Sommer Aſſizes 1675. The ſaid <hi>Thomas Danwood,</hi> (upon full Evidence on all ſides,) obtained a Verdict againſt his Lordſhips pretended Title; And (after a Writ of Error ſpent therein,) was in <hi>June</hi> 1676. put into Poſſeſſion of the Premiſes, by the then Sheriff, upon an <hi>Hab. Fact.</hi> Poſſeſſion. In the Proſecution of which Suits, the ſaid <hi>Thomas Danwood</hi> was Neceſſitated to expend 700 <hi>l.</hi> or thereabout; and being himſelf near Fourſcore Years Old; He deſired his ſaid Nephew <hi>Richard Radley</hi> to aſſiſt him in the Management of that buſineſs; which he the ſaid <hi>Radley</hi> (in an unfortunate hour to himſelf,) did accordingly undertake, as conceiving himſelf bound in duty, to be helpful unto his ſaid Unkle, in what lawful ways he could, and otherwiſe then ſo did he the ſaid <hi>Radley</hi> never Act. And yet nevertheleſs, becauſe he the ſaid <hi>Radley</hi> did appear on behalf of his ſaid Unkle <hi>Danwood</hi> as aforeſaid; His Lordſhip, (the now <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice Scroggs</hi>) was pleaſed to conceive ſome cauſeleſs Diſpleaſure againſt him; which was ſo far taken notice of in the Neighbourhood, (he the ſaid <hi>Radley,</hi> then dwelling at <hi>Brentwood,</hi> within a Mile of his Lordſhips Houſe, called <hi>Weld-Hall.</hi>) That when any difference happened between <hi>Radley</hi> and any Neighbour; <hi>Radley</hi> was ſoon after informed againſt at <hi>Weld-Hall;</hi> As for Inſtance.</p>
            <p>He the ſaid <hi>Radley</hi> being neceſſitated to have a controverſie with one <hi>Samuel Whitehead</hi> of <hi>Brentwood</hi> aforeſaid, <hi>Shoemaker;</hi> a perſon well known in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, (as <hi>Radley</hi> doubts not to make appear by proof,) to be of ſuch Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principle, and Vicious converſation as rendered his Oath not fit to be Credited in any concern, to the value of 5 <hi>s.</hi> He the ſaid <hi>Whitehead</hi> to wreak his Revenge on <hi>Radley;</hi> Did in <hi>May</hi> 1679. Inform the ſaid <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> upon Oath; That <hi>Rudley</hi> had Spoken certain Scandalous words againſt his Lordſhip, (repeating the words in his Affidavit,) and told his Lordſhip alſo that one <hi>Robert Ralet</hi> a <hi>Brick-Layer</hi> (who was a conſtant Workman in his Lordſhips Service, as occaſion required,) did hear the Words ſpoken, as well as he the ſaid <hi>Whitehead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> going ſoon after to <hi>London;</hi> one Mr. <hi>Thomas White</hi> an Attorney and Steward of his Lordſhips Courts, came to <hi>Radley,</hi> as from his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, willing him to attend his Lordſhip at <hi>London,</hi> to give him ſatisfaction about an Affidavit made by <hi>Whitehead,</hi> of ſuch words ſpoken by <hi>Radley</hi> againſt his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as he the ſaid Mr. <hi>White</hi> then ſaid, he dared not repeat; But Mr. <hi>White</hi> then told <hi>Radley,</hi> that <hi>Whitehead</hi> had informed his Lordſhip, that <hi>Ralet</hi> alſo had heard the words Spoken by <hi>Radley;</hi> Hereupon <hi>Radley</hi> enquired of <hi>Ralet</hi> what the words were which <hi>Whitehead</hi> had Sworn, and whether he the ſaid <hi>Ralet,</hi> had ever heard <hi>Radley</hi> Speak the ſame; whereto <hi>Ralet</hi> anſwered, <hi>That he had Sworn to the</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice, <hi>that he never heard</hi> Radley <hi>Speak the words Sworn by</hi> Whitehead, <hi>nor any other word concerning his Lordſhip; But only, That</hi> Danwoods <hi>Cauſe was a good Cauſe, and that he (the ſaid</hi> Radley) <hi>would Seal it with his Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this, <hi>Radley</hi> waited on his Lordſhip at <hi>London,</hi> (as he was required,) where his Lordſhip making known to <hi>Radley,</hi> what words <hi>Whitehead</hi> had Sworn againſt him; and <hi>Radley</hi> denying (as the truth was and is,) that he ever Spoke thoſe, or any ſuch like words; and withal, giving his Lordſhip a true account, what a Dangerous Fellow <hi>Whitehead</hi> was; and of the occaſion why he thus ſought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Malice on him the ſaid <hi>Radley;</hi> His Lordſhip was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That there was another would teſtifie the words beſides</hi> Whitehead, but that his Lordſhip would defer the further Examination of that matter, until his being in the Countrey at <hi>Whitſontide:</hi> And ſo his Lordſhip diſmiſſed <hi>Radley</hi> for that time.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Whitſon</hi> week, all Parties attended his Lordſhip; and upon Examination of the matter, his Lordſhip being convinced, that there was no reality in this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt <hi>Radley,</hi> (albeit, <hi>Ralet</hi> then varied from what he had formerly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Radley</hi> as aforeſaid; and would ſeem to inſiſt, that <hi>Radley</hi> ſaid he would Seal to the words informed by <hi>Whitehead</hi> with his Blood.) His Lordſhip was pleaſed to declare, he would paſs by this matter for that time; but willed <hi>Radley</hi> to have a care, that no further Informations againſt him, come before his Lordſhip; Or uſed Monitory expreſſions, to that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Some difference afterwards happening between <hi>Radley</hi> and <hi>Ralet</hi> about work, wherein <hi>Radley</hi> Employed <hi>Ralet</hi> as his <hi>Bricklayer; Ralet</hi> informed the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> that <hi>Radley</hi> would have hired him to knock the aforenamed <hi>William White</hi> on the Head; Whereupon <hi>Radley</hi> was again ſent for by the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> and required to give Sureties for his Behaviour, which he did accordingly; though no colour of truth in the ſaid Information.</p>
            <p>At Summer Aſſizes, in <hi>August</hi> 1679. <hi>Ralet</hi> Recovered 39 <hi>l.</hi> againſt <hi>Radley,</hi> in an Action upon a <hi>Quantum Meruit</hi> for Building; and ſoon afterwards, <hi>to wit,</hi> on the Eighth of <hi>August</hi> 1679. aforeſaid. <hi>Radley</hi> ſtanding at his own dore; and <hi>Ralet</hi> being at Work over againſt <hi>Radley</hi>'s Houſe, and within hearing one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; <hi>Ralet</hi> ſaid to <hi>Radley, There be Rods in Piſs for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Radley</hi> ſaying, <hi>Why are you and your</hi> Cobler <hi>going to make new Oaths against me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ralet</hi> thereupon demanded, <hi>What have you got to ſay to my</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Radley</hi> thereunto replyed, <hi>As far as I know, the</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>may be a very worthy Gentleman; But for your part, you are a very Raſcal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe were all, or the effect of all the words which paſſed between <hi>Radley</hi> and <hi>Ralet</hi> at that time, wich he proved by Divers Perſons of Credit then preſent; And never but then had <hi>Radley</hi> any diſcourſe with <hi>Ralet,</hi> after the aforeſaid Tryal, between them at Sommer Aſſizes, 1679. Neither was any thing of this further taken notice of, (to <hi>Radleys</hi> knowledge,) until <hi>September</hi> following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Radley</hi> went with his Unkle <hi>Danwood</hi> to wait upon the ſaid <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Sep.</hi> 1679</note> and demanded from his Lordſhip ſatisfaction, for the Timber his Lordſhip had Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from off <hi>Danwoods</hi> Land; and an account of the Rents and Profits his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had received; and to re-imburſe <hi>Danwood</hi> the Coſts he was by thoſe unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Suits enforced to Expend; Which demand his Lordship ſeemed much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at; ſaying to <hi>Danwood, He owed him nothings; and again bidding him come by it as well as he could.</hi> And for Redreſs herein, <hi>Danwood</hi> hath now a Petition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before the <hi>Lords in Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> hath Oath made before him,<note place="margin">
