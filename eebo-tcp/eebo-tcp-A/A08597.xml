            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Of loftie Cedars; makes the stately Brow</l>
                  <l>Bend to the Foot? how all men see that now</l>
                  <l>The Breath of Infamie doth moue their Sayles;</l>
                  <l>Whiles thy deare name by Loues more hartie gales</l>
                  <l>Shall still keep Winge, vntill thy Fames extent</l>
                  <l>Fill eu'rie part of this vast Continent.</l>
                  <l>Then you the Syre of this thus murder'd Sonne;</l>
                  <l>Repine not at his Fate; since he hath wonne</l>
                  <l>More Honor in his Sufferance; and his Death</l>
                  <l>Succeeded by his Vertues endles Breath.</l>
                  <l>For him, and to his Life and Deaths Example,</l>
                  <l>Loue might erect a Statue; Zeale, a Temple:</l>
                  <l>On his true worth the Muses might be slayne</l>

                  <l>Whose Reason doth her Will to Loue inuite.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Reason begot, and Passion bred her loue,</l>
                  <l>Selfe-will She shun'd, Fitnes the Mariage made;</l>
                  <l>Fitnes doth cherish Loue, Selfe-will Debate.</l>
                  <l>Loe thus; and in this Monument of proofe</l>
                  <l>A perfect Wife, a Worke nor Time can fade,</l>
                  <l>Nor loose respect betray to mortall Fate.</l>
                  <l>This, none can equall; Best, but imitate.</l>

First, his opinion negatiuely, what should not be: the

and as a second thing, <hi>Beautie.</hi> The first only

woman by loue to himselfe, which makes her a wife.
And lastly, the only condition of a wife, <hi>Fitnesse.</hi>

               <head>A good Woman.</head>
               <p>A Good Woman is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
like a man. Shee
lacks of him nothing
but heat. Thence is her
sweetnes of disposition,
which meets his stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
more pleasingly; so wooll meets
yron easier then yron, and turnes resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb facs="tcp:23866:25"/>
into embracing. Her greatest lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is religion, and her thoughts are on
her owne <hi>Sexe,</hi> or on men, without ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the difference. <hi>Dishonestie</hi> neuer
comes neerer than her eares, and then
wonder stops it out, and saues vertue the
labour. Shee leaues then eat <hi>youth,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his <hi>lushious</hi> tales, and puts back the
<hi>Seruingmans</hi> putting forward with a
frowne: yet her kindnes is free enough
to be seene; for it hath no guilt about it:
and her mirth is cleare, that you may
looke through it, into vertue, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond.
She hath not behauiour at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
but makes it to her occasion. Shee
hath so much knowledge as to loue it,
and if she haue it not at home, shee will
fetch it; for this sometimes in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
discontent she dares chide her <hi>Sexe,</hi>
though she vse it neuer the worse. She
is much within, and frames outward
things to her minde, not her minde to
them. She weares good clothes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
better; for she findes no degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Decencie.</hi> Shee hath a content of
<pb facs="tcp:23866:25"/>
her owne, and so seeks not an husband,
but findes him. She is indeed most, but
not much to description, for she is direct
and one, and hath not the varietie of ill.
Now shee is giuen fresh and aliue to a
husband, and shee doth nothing more
then loue him, for she takes him to that
purpose. So his good becomes the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
of her actions, and shee doth her
selfe kindnesse vpon him. After his, her
chiefest vertue is a good husband. For
<hi>Shee</hi> is <hi>Hee.</hi>

                     <hi>A Very Woman,</hi> is a dow-bakt man,
or a <hi>Shee</hi> ment well towards man,
but fell two bowes short, <hi>strength</hi>
and <hi>vnderstanding.</hi> Her vertue is the
hedge, <hi>Modestie,</hi> that keeps a man from
climing ouer into her faults. Shee sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
as if she had no teeth, but lips, and
she diuides her eyes and keeps halfe for
<pb facs="tcp:23866:26"/>
her selfe, and giues the other to her near
<hi>Youth.</hi> Being set downe shee casts her
face into a platforme, which dureth the
meale, &amp; is taken away with the voider.
Her draught reacheth to good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
not to thirst, and it is a part of their
mysterie not to professe hunger; but <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
takes her in priuate and stretcheth
her vpon meat. Shee is <hi>Marigeable</hi> and
<hi>Fourteene</hi> at once; and after she doth
not liue but tarrie. Shee reads ouer her
face euery morning, and sometimes blots
out pale, and writes red. She thinks she
is faire, though many times her opinion
goes alone, and she loues her glasse, and
the knight of the Sunne for lying. Shee
is hid away all but her face, and that's
hang'd about with toyes and deuices,
like the signe of a Tauerne, to draw
<hi>Strangers.</hi> If shee shew more shee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
desire, and by too free giuing,
leaues no <hi>Gift.</hi> Shee may escape from
the Seruing-man, but not from the
Chamber-maide. Shee commits with
her eares for certaine: after that shee
<pb facs="tcp:23866:26"/>
may goe for a Maide, but she hath been
lien with in her vnderstanding. Her <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie,</hi>
is a seeming neglect of those,
that be too good for her. Shee's a yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
brother for her portion, but not for
her portion of wit, that comes from her
in a treble, which is still too big for it;
yet hir <hi>Vanitie</hi> seldom matcheth hir, with
one of her owne degree, for then she wil
beget another creature a begger: and
commonly, if shee marrie better, shee
marries worse. Shee gets much by the
simplicitie of her Sutor, and for a iest,
laughes at him without one. Thus she
dresses a Husband for her selfe, and after
takes him for his patience, and the land
adioyning, yee may see it, in a Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
fresh <hi>Naperie,</hi> and his Leg steps
into an vnknowne stocking. I need not
speake of his <hi>Garters,</hi> the tassell shewes it
selfe. If she loue, she loues not the Man,
but the beast of him. Shee is <hi>Salomons</hi>
cruel creature, and a mans walking-consumption:
euery caudle shee giues him,
is a purge. Her chiefe commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:23866:27"/>
is, shee brings a man to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

top of the table, where her wrie little
finger bewraies <hi>caruing</hi>; her neighbors
at the latter end know they are welcom,
and for that purpose shee quencheth her
thirst. She trauels to and among, and so
becomes a woman of good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for all the follie in the countrie,
comes in cleane Linnen to visit her: she
breakes to them her griefe in Sugar
cakes, and receiues from their mouthes
in exchange, many stories that conclude
to no purpose. Her eldest Sonne is like
her howsoeuer, and that dispraiseth him
best: her vtmost drift is to turne him
Foole, which commonly she obtaines at
the yeeres of discretion, Shee takes a
iourney sometimes to her Neeces house,
but neuer thinks beyond <hi>London.</hi> Her
<hi>Deuotion</hi> is good clothes, they carrie her
to Church, expresse their stuffe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
<pb facs="tcp:23866:27"/>
and are silent, if she be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout,
shee lifts vp a certaine number of
eyes, in stead of prayers, and takes the
Sermon, and measures out a nap by it,
iust as long. She sends Religion afore to
<hi>Sixtie,</hi> where shee neuer ouertakes it, or
driues it before her againe. Her most
necessarie instruments, are a <hi>waiting Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,</hi>
and a <hi>Chamber-maide</hi>; shee
weares her Gentlewoman still, but most
often leaues the other in her Chamber-window.
She hath a little <hi>Kennel</hi> in her
lap, and she smells the sweeter for it. The
vtmost reach of her <hi>Prouidence,</hi> is the fatnesse
of a Capon, and her greatest enuie,
is the next Gentlewomans better gown.
Her most commendable skill, is to make
her Husbands fustian beare her Veluer.
This she doth many times ouer, and then
is deliuered to old Age, and a Chaire,
where euery bodie leaues her.</p>

dares not salute a man in old cloths, or
out of fashion. There is not a publicke
assembly without him, and he will take
any paines for an acquaintance there.
In any shew he will be one, though he
be but a whistler, or a torch bearer; and
beares downe strangers with the story
of his actions. He handles nothing that
is not rare, and defends his wardrobe,
diet, and all customes, with entitling
their beginnings from Princes, great
Souldiers and strange Nations. He dares
speake more then he vnderstands, and
aduentures his words without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of any seconds. Hee relates battels
and skirmishes, as from an eye witnesse,
when his eies theeuishly beguiled a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad
<pb facs="tcp:23866:31"/>
of them. In a word, to make sure of
admiration, he will not let himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

no great mans actions during his life.
His new yeares gifts are ready at <hi>Alha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomas,</hi>

for he creepes as neere it as may
be, and as passionately courts it; if at

They call the thumbe vnder the

though his Mothers husband bee an

Vniuersity iests are his vniuersall

hath a Rash outside, and Fustian

clos'd with an <hi>Ergô</hi>; and what euer be

Tis a wrong to his reputation to bee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of any thing; and yet he knowes

giues directions for husbandry from

He seemes to bee very deuout, for his

<pb facs="tcp:23866:55"/>
sometimes in humility goes barefoot,
therein making necessity a vertue. His

prooues that he was the first founder of

most vpon crotchets. The companion
of his trauels is some soule sunne-burnt

Hee embraceth naturally ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
conuersing in open fields, and
lowly Cottages. If hee visit Cities or

a Coward; but beleeue it, hee is a Lad
of mettle, his valour is commonly three

the end for flying off. Hee is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident,
for he will fight but with one at

makes a wicked brazen face, &amp; weepes
in the Cuppe, to alay the heate of her

mary her Nose, and chin, intend very

for a <hi>Bawde</hi> is like a Medlar, shee's not
ripe, till the be rotten. Her enuie is
like that of the Diuell; To haue all

Rascall: yet poore Cottagers in the

she incloses to day, she makes <hi>Common</hi>

are all remou'd in one sort, onely shee
makes bold to take the vpper hand of
them, and to be Carted before them;
the thought of which, makes her thee
cannot endure a posset, because it puts
her in minde of a Bason. She sits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
at a rackt Rent; especially, if
her <hi>Landlord</hi> beare office in the Parish:
for her moueables in the house; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

turne a sempstresse, into a waiting
gentle woman, but her Warde-robe is
most infectious, for it brings them to
the <hi>Falling-sicknesse</hi>: she hath only this
one shew of <hi>Temperance,</hi> that let a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
send for tenne pottles of wine
in her house, hee shall haue but tenne
quarts; and if he want it that way, let
<pb facs="tcp:23866:63"/>
him pay for't, and take it out in stewde
prunes. The Iustices Clarke standes
many times her very good friend: and
workes her peace with the <hi>Iustice</hi> of
<hi>Quorum.</hi> Nothing ioies her so much
as the comming ouer of <hi>Strangers,</hi> nor
daunts her so much as the approach of
Shroue-tuesday. In fine, not to foule

The pedant of the house, though

not tied to answere to any Articles

hee accounts but a word without any

               <head>An ordinary Widdow</head>
               <p>IS like the Heralds Hearse-cloath; she
serues to many funerals, with a very
little altering the colour. The end of
her Husband begins in teares; and the
end of her teares beginnes in a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
She vses to Cunning women to
know how many Husbands shee shall
haue, and neuer marries without the
consent of sixe midwiues. Her chiefest
pride is in the multitude of her Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
and by them she gaines: for one
serues to draw on another, and with
one at last she shootes out another, as
Boies doe Pellets in Elderne Gunnes.
She commends to them a single life, as
Horsecourses doe their Iades, to put
them away. Her fancy is to one of the
biggest of the Guard, but Knighthood
<pb facs="tcp:23866:96"/>
makes her draw in a weaker Bow. Her
seruants, or kinsfolke, are the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perers
that summon any to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat:
by them she gaines much credit,
but looseth it againe in the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe:
<hi>Fama est mendax.</hi> If she liue to
be thrise married, she seldome failes to
cozen her second Husbands Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
A Church man shee dare not
venture vpon; for she hath heard wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
complaine of dilapidations:
nor a Soldier, though he haue Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in the City, for his estate may be
subiect to fire: very seldome a Lawier,
without he shew his exceeding great
practise, &amp; can make her case the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but a Knight with the old rent
may do much, for a great comming
in, is all in all with a Widdow: euer
prouided, that most part of her Plate
and Iewels (before the wedding) lie
concealde with her Scriuener. Thus
like a too ripe Apple, shee falles of her
selfe: but he that hath her, is Lord but
of a filthy purchase, for the title is
<pb facs="tcp:23866:96"/>
crackt. Lastly, while she is a Widdow,
obserue euer, shee is no Morning wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
the euening a good fire and sack
may make her listen to a Husband:
and if euer she be made sure, tis vpon
a full stomacke to bedward.</p>

by names enow of Diseases, to stuffe
it with, tis all the skill hee studies for.
He tooke his first being from a Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
woman, and stole this blacke Art from her, while he made her Seacoale
fire. All the diseases euer sin brought
vpon man, doth he pretend to be Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of; when the truth is, his maine
cunning, is Corne-cutting. A great
plague makes him; what with railing
against such, as leaue their cures for
feare of infection, and in friendly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:23866:97"/>
Cakebread, with the Fish-wiues
at Funerals, he vtters a most abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deale of musty Carduus-water, &amp;
the Conduits crie out, All the learned
Doctors may cast their Caps at him.
He parts stakes with some Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in the Suburbes, at whose house he
lies: and though hee be neuer so fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with his wife; the Apothecary
dare not (for the richest Horne in his
shop) displease him. All the Mid-wiues
in the towne are his intelligencers; but
nurses and young Marchants Wines
(that would fain conceiue with childe)
these are his Idolaters. Hee is a more
vniust Bone-setter, then a Dice-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
hath put out more eyes then the
small Pox; made more deafe then the
<hi>Cataracts</hi> of <hi>Nilus</hi>; lamed more then
the Gout; shrunke more sinewes, then
one that makes Bow-stringes; and kild
more idly, then Tobacco. A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
that had any way so noble a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as but to loue a good horse well,
would not suffer him to bee a Farrier.
<pb facs="tcp:23866:97"/>
His discourse is vomit; and his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
the strongest purgation in the
world: to one that would be speedily
cured, he hath more delaies, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
then a Hare, or a Law suite: hee
seekes to set vs at variance with nature,
and rather then hee shall want diseases
he'le beget them. His especiall practise
(as I said afore) is vpon women; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to make their mindes sicke, ere
their bodies feele it, and then there's
worke for the Dog-leach. Hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
the cure of mad-men; and sure
he gets most by them, for no man in
his perfect witte would meddle with
him. Lastly, he is such a Iuggler with
Vrinals, so dangerously vnskilfull, that
if euer the Citie will haue recourse to
him for diseases that neede purgation,
let them imploy him in scouring

               <p>TIs not vnlikely but hee was begot
by some intelligencer vnder a
hedge; for his minde is wholy giuen
to trauell. He is not troubled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Iointures: he can diuorce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
without the see of a Proctor, nor
feares he the crueltie of ouerseers of his
Will. Hee leaues his children all the
world to Cant in, and all the people
to their fathers. His Language is a
Constant tongue; the Northerne
speech differs from the south, VVelch
from the Cornish: but Canting is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
nor euer could be altered by
conquest of the <hi>Saxon, Dane,</hi> or <hi>Norman.</hi>
He wil not beg out of his limit though
hee starue; nor breake his oath if hee
sweare by his <hi>Salomon,</hi> though you
hang him: and hee payes his custome
as truely to his Graund Rogue, astri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

<pb facs="tcp:23866:98"/>
March Sunne breedes agues in others,
but hee adores it like the <hi>Indians</hi>; for
then beginnes his progresse after a hard
winter. Ostlers cannot endure him, for
he is of the infantry, and serues best on
foote. Hee offends not the Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the excesse of apparell, for hee
will goe naked, and counts it a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
pennance. Forty of them lie in a
Barne together, yet are neuer sued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the statute of Inmates. If hee were
learned, no man could make a better
description of <hi>England</hi>; for hee hath
traueld it ouer and ouer. Lastly,

he practised to make a little goe
farre; some deriue it from more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and say <hi>Adam</hi> (when hee pickt

not feed the belly, but the Palate: and
though his command lie in the kitchin
(which is but an inferiour place) yet
shall you finde him a very saucy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
Euer since the warres in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
hee hath so minc't (the ancient

Seruingmen call him the last relique of
Popery, that makes men fast against
their Conscience. He can be truly said
to be no mans fellow but his Masters:
for the rest of his seruants are starued
by him. Hee is the prime cause why
<pb facs="tcp:23866:99"/>
Noblemen build their Houses so great,
for the smalnesse of the Kitchin, makes
the house the bigger: and the Lord
calles him his Alchymist that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract

or anything: that which hee
dresses wee may rather call a drinking,
then a meale: yet is hee so full of varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that he brags, and truely, that hee
giues you but a taste of what hee can
do: he dare not for his life come among
the Butchers; for sure they would quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and bake him after the English fashion;
hee's such an enemy to Beefe

He could willingly all his life time bee
confinde to the Church-yard; at least
within fiue foote on't: for at euery
Church stile, commonly there's an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house;
Where let him bee found neuer

Hee breakes his fast heartiliest
while he is making a graue, and sayes
the opening of the ground makes him
hungry. Though one would take him
to be a slouen, yet hee loues cleane lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
extreamely, and for that reason
takes an order that fine holland sheers
bee not made wormes meate. Like a
nation cald the <hi>Cusani,</hi> he weeps when

die: the reason; hee gets by Burials

The rope-maker payes him a
pension, and hee paies tribute to the
Physitian; for the Physitian makes work
for the Sexton; as the Rope-maker for
the Hang-man. Lastly, he wishes the

though hee were found out long since
the inuention of the Canon, 'tis thoght
he hath not done lesse mischiefe. Hee

the Popes excommunication thunders,
hee holds it no more sinne the decrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

ambitious aboue all measure; for

               <p>VVHatsoeuer is commendable
in the graue Orator, is most
exquisitly perfect in him; for
by a full and significant action of body,
he charmes our attention: sit in a full
Theater, and you will thinke you see
so many lines drawen from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of so many eares, whiles the
<hi>Actor</hi> is the <hi>Center.</hi> He doth not striue
to make nature monstrous, she is often
seene in the same Scaene with him, but
<pb facs="tcp:23866:102"/>
neither on Stilts nor Crutches; and for
his voice tis not lower then the promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor lowder then the Foile and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
By his action hee fortifies morall
precepts with example; for what wee
see him personate, wee thinke truely
done before vs: a man of a deep thoght
might apprehend, the Ghosts of our
ancient <hi>Heroes</hi> walk't againe, and take
him(at feueral times)for many of them.
He is much affected to painting, and
tis a question whether that make him
an excellent Player, or his playing an
exquisite Painter. Hee addes grace to
the Poets labours: for what in the Poet
is but ditty, in him is both ditty and
musicke. He entertaines vs in the best
leasure of our life, that is betweene
meales, the most vnfit time, either for
study or bodily exercise: the flight of
Hawkes, and chase of wilde beasts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and so of diuers others. I obserue, of

There is no truer seruaht in the house

but let vs goe; and with his owne eye,
doth both fatten his flocke, and set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
all manner of husbandrie. He is
taught by nature to be contented with
a little; his owne fold yeelds him both
food and raiment: hee is pleasd with
any nourishment God sends, whilest
curious gluttonie ransacks, as it were,
<hi>Noahs Arke</hi> for food, onely to feed the
riot of one meale. He is nere knowne

sleep as vnquietly, as if their pillowes

When hee builds, no poore Tenants

Hee neuer fits vplate but when

but when he setteth snares for the

nor oppression, but when in the month

sheares his sheep. Hee allowes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

of the dead any thing bruifed, or the
worse for it, though the Countrey Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
dance in the Church-yard after

Wake in Summer, shrouings, the

Nature too much louing her owne,

Nothing dyes but qualities. No

That gaine works this miracle, to

that the sound of Commoditie drowns

               <p>IT is sayd among the folks here, that

two stooles. That a foole at the vpper

the salt. He that hates to bee reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
sits in his owne light. Hunger is
the cheapest sawce, and nature the
cheapest guest. The sensible man and
the silent woman are the best discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.
Repentance without amendment,
is but the shifting of a foule tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
He that tels a lie to saue his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
wipes his mouth with his sleeue to
spare his napkin. The tongue of a ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is the fiddle that the hearts of the

salt with his meat. That wit without

leane meat of aduersity. The Epicure
puts his money into his belly, and the
Miser his belly into his purse. That the
best company makes the vpper end of
the table, and not the saltseller. The
superfluity of a mans possessions, is the
broken meate that should remaine to
the poore. That the enuious keepes
his knife in his hand, and swallowes his
meat whole. A rich foole among the
wife is a gilt empty bowle amongst the
thirsty. Ignorance is an insensible
hunger. The water of life is the best
wine. He that robs mee of my inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntion,
bids himselfe welcome to another
mans table, and I will bid him welcom
when he is gone. The vaine-glorious
man pisseth more then he drinks. That
no man can drinke an health out of the

that riseth without thankesgiuing, goes
away and owes for his ordinary. Hee
that beginnes to repent when he is old,
neuer washed his hands till night.
That this life is but one day of three

               <p>IT is thought heere, that the world
was made for man, and not man for
the world, and that therefore they take
a crosse course that lye downe there.
That those that will not rise, their souls
must, and carry their bodies to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That we haue spent one inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
already, and are prodigall of
this. That there is no hope beyond
mercy, and that this is that time; the
next is of Iustice. That Christ when
hee went away, left good seede in his
Church; and when hee comes againe,
he shall finde Christians, but not faith.
That the Diuell hath got vpon vs, the
same way that hee did at the first, by
drawing shadowes ouer substances, as
he did the body ouer the soule. That
<hi>Protestants</hi> weare the name of Christ for
a Charme, as <hi>Papists</hi> doe the Crosse.
That States vse it, the Clergy liue by
<pb facs="tcp:23866:125"/>
it, the People follow it, more by a
stream, then one by one. That all are
religious rather then some. That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one lookes to another, but not to
himselfe. That they go so by throngs
to Heauen, that it is to bee feared they
take the broader waye. That the
Church is in the world, like a Ship in
the Sea; the Elect in the Church, like
<hi>Ionas</hi> amongst the Mariners. That to
mend this, is to cheate the Diuell, to
turne man the right side outward, and
set the soule foremost againe. That
the soule may be too ranke too, if wee
looke not to it: and so a <hi>Puritane</hi> often
times meets a <hi>Papist</hi> in superstition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way. That to binde from and
to indifferent things, is equall, though
it be thought otherwise. That some,
out of a good meaning haue fallen this
way into a vice. That these faults are
more subtill; and therefore lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and lesse to be blamed; but as
dangerous as the other, if they take
heed. That the rule is in all things,
<pb facs="tcp:23866:125"/>
the body and the soule must goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but the better before. That wee
haue contended so long about the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Religion, that some men thought
it was dead. That so, <hi>Atheists</hi> are
come into the Church, and that it will
be as hard to cast them out as Diuels.
That those, which haue thus broken
the peace of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> are obliged to
satisfaction; and those which first gaue
them cause of amendment. That they
are a good medicine one for another,
and both a good Composition. That
a pure <hi>Bishop</hi> is the best gouernment, if
the pride on both sides would let them
know it. That all Controuersies for
the most part, leaue the truth in the
middle, and are factious at both
ends. That the Church hath
this good by them, they cleanse the
way for others, but not for themselues.
That sincerity, in the cause of truth, is
more worth then learning. That too
much, and too little knowledge, haue
made the world mad. That we haue a
<pb facs="tcp:23866:126"/>
shorter cut to it, and a surer way then
<hi>Drake</hi> had ouer the world, if wee could
find it out. That euery man is a briefe
of the whole; &amp; as he is so, he is greater
then a King. That euery King is a
briefe of his Land, and hee hath a <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne</hi>
of the gouernment of it alwayes
abour him. That as the honour that
he giues vnto his Nobles and Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
is a charge; so is that which God
giues him. That as hee requires an
account, so he must giue. That he is
the Image of God in his Kingdome, as
man is in the World. That therefore
the Subiects owe him obedience, as the
Creatures doe Man. That those that
will not obey, are neither good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
nor good men. That to obey
well, is as great a thing as to gouerne,
and more mens duties. That those
that thinke not so, know not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
part, which is to suffer. That
though States bee naught, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
Religion, they may deliuer many
men safe to Heauen, though they goe
<pb facs="tcp:23866:126"/>
not themselues, and so they are like bad
Ministers. That this is Gods vse of
both, and of the world too, to conuey
his Elect to their place. That the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
face of the Church hath but the
same vse, and the Elect are the Church
themselues. That they are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the holy Ghost, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to plucke downe their Idols, and
set vp God there. That the Idolles of
these times, are Couetousnesse, Pride,
Gluttony, Wantonnesse, Heresies, and
such like admiration and seruing of our
selues. That we must make all time
an occasion of amendment, because
the Diuell makes it an occasion to
tempt. That he is a Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is cunninger then we. Thar there
is no way to resist him, but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit
of God, which is his Master. That
this is the gift of God, which he giueth
to all that are his. That it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by the word, and held by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and prayer. That Faith is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of it, and workes the assurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23866:127"/>That thus the vnderstanding and will,
which is the whole soule of man, is
made vp againe, and sanctifies the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
That so wee are the members of
Christ. That our Head is in Heauen,
as a Pawne, that where he is, we shall
bee. That there is no opinion but
