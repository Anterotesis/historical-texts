            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KING.</head>
            <l>GReat Sir, whose Throne amidst the Waters set,</l>
            <l>O're all design'd by God and Nature Great,</l>
            <l>Here, in that fam'd, long-wisht, unheard-of Spot:</l>
            <l>Stedfast on which, planting Your Royall Foot,</l>
            <l>You turn the Other World, You give it Law,</l>
            <l>You Arbitrate, and all its Motions awe.</l>
            <l>This Honour was to <hi>England</hi> early pay'd;</l>
            <l>And thus Your great <hi>Fore-runner, Edgar,</hi> sway'd.</l>
            <l>Yet were his Ships a weak, though Numerous, Train:</l>
            <l>Silent they pass'd, meer Infants of the Main.</l>
            <l>Grown up, Yours speak, in not a Mortall Strain,</l>
            <l>Threaten, and loud above the Billows beat</l>
            <l>Your dread Commands, which trembling Rocks repeat.</l>
            <l>Whilst <hi>Edgar</hi> joyfull, from his farthest Skies</l>
            <l>Looks down, and listens to the God-like Voice.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Hercules</hi> with <hi>Jason</hi> left the Shoar,</l>
            <l>Pale <hi>Greece</hi> despair'd to see her Worthies more:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Charybdis</hi> gap'd, and <hi>Scylla</hi>'s Dogs did howl.</l>
            <l>Who this could bear, was then a daring Soul.</l>
            <l>All Monsters seem'd in those Heroick days.</l>
            <l>Your Pleasure-boat with ruder Danger plays.</l>
            <l>If launcht in that bold Age of Poetry,</l>
            <l>Each Ship of Yours had bin a God o'th' Sea;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:34606:3"/>Or <hi>Jove,</hi> his Form in this Disguise that shrowds:</l>
            <l>Who having left the Air, and easie Clouds,</l>
            <l>Below a rougher Element controlls,</l>
            <l>And Thunder o're more solid Water rouls.</l>
            <l>This made Divining Priests of old preferr</l>
            <l>The Oak, as sacred to the Thunderer;</l>
            <l>The Oak, of old, that in <hi>Dodona</hi> reign'd.</l>
            <l>Now Oracles Your onely Forrests send,</l>
            <l>Which promise Seas and Empire without End.</l>
            <l>Grafted on these, the fairest Lawrells grow,</l>
            <l>And Wreaths that best adorn an <hi>English</hi> Brow.</l>
            <l>This Navall Power made <hi>Edgar</hi>'s chiefest Pride,</l>
            <l>(Four thousand Sail spred o're the Ocean wide)</l>
            <l>Whence Terrour on remotest Shoars was thrown,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Halcyon</hi>-days and Plenty blest his own.</l>
            <l>Thus, whilst Your Flags, wav'd high, for Homage call,</l>
            <l>And angry Nations let their Topsails fall;</l>
            <l>With Peace Your larger Empire happy made,</l>
            <l>Rests undisturb'd, rejoycing in the Shade.</l>
            <l>High on His Throne, and fill'd with Royall Care,</l>
            <l>Thus —You alone, great <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Person bear.</l>

            <head>Advertisement.</head>
            <p>THIS I call an <hi>Heroick Tragedy,</hi> having in it chiefly sought occasions to extoll the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy; and having writ it in that Verse which with <hi>Cowley, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Waller,</hi> I take to be most proper for Epic Poetry.</p>
            <p>The Tragedy ends Prosperously; a sort of Tragedy that rarely succeeds; man being apter to pity the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed, then to rejoyce with the Prosperous. Yet this sort seems principally to have pleased <hi>Euripides</hi>; and is necessary here for the Design first above mentioned.</p>
            <p>I doubted, indeed, whether Rhyme was proper for Tragedy. Not that I thought it unnaturall; for que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless, 'tis more naturall to speak in Rhyme, then to speak <hi>English:</hi> this we owe to the Nurse, the former to the Poet. Nor can that be said <hi>unnaturall,</hi> where Nature is help'd and improv'd. But Rhyme is rather sweet, then grave; unless temper'd with so must Thought, and with such Pomp of words, as suits not with that Sorrow and Lamentation which Tragedy ordinarily requires. And therefore, of the two, Rhyme is the more proper for this sort of Tragedy, which ends happily.</p>
            <p>The Histories examined, nothing in the Fable can seem Romantick or affected. But I must appeal from the late Epitomizers, who make <hi>Edgar</hi> point-blank guilty of <hi>Ethelwold</hi>'s Death, without any sufficient ground from Antiquity.</p>
