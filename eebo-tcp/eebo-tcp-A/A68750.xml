            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To him belongeth the power to

he fulfilled the Sacraments of the

ceaſed, becauſe he is our Paſſeouer, that
is,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 29.</note> the Lamb by whoſe bloud we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
When Chriſt came, Circumciſion
ceaſed, becauſe he is our Circumciſion,
that is, the purifier and clenſer of our
ſinnes.<note place="margin">Reuel. 7. 14.</note> Now theſe two ſacraments are
fulfilled, he hath appointed two other
Sacraments for them: in ſteed of the

eate,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 29.</note> he hath giuen vs another Lamb to

God,</hi> that is himſelfe, vpon whom all do
feede, whoſoeuer do receiue this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with an aſſured faith that Chriſt
died to poſſeſſe them of life. The brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the bread, doth ſignifie the
wounding of his bodie: the powring
of the wine doth ſignifie the ſhedding
of his blood. The eating of the bread,
and drinking of the wine, doth ſignifie
that his fleſh and bloud doe nouriſh in
vs life eternal, as the bread and wine do
nouriſh the life preſent.</p>

at night when they vſed to ſup.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13816:4"/>
But what night? <hi>euen that night</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Paul) when he was betrayed:</hi> that night
which he ſhould haue curſed,<note place="margin">Iob. 3. 3.</note> as <hi>Iob</hi> did
the day of his birth, if he had ſuffred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his will: that night when hee
ſhould haue thought to deſtroy men, as
men conſpired to deſtroy him, <hi>that
night</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> this Sacrament of
grace, and peace, and life began. <hi>Euen
that night when we betrayed him.</hi> Manie
nights did he ſpend in watching, and
praying for vs; &amp; is there a night now
for vs to kill &amp; betray him? That was a
darke night, when men went about to
put out the ſonne which brought them
light. Who can but wonder, to ſee how
Chriſt, &amp; they for whom Chriſt came,
were occupied at one time? when they
deuiſed miſchief againſt him, &amp; ſought
all meanes to deſtroy him, then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
how to ſaue them, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſame night this bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to conuay all his graces and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
vnto them, <hi>Euen that night when
they betrayed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13816:5"/>
vntill night,<note place="margin">Why this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was inſtituted at night.</note> is, becauſe that was the
time appointed by the Law to eate the
Paſſeouer, which was like a predeceſſor
of this Sacrament.<note place="margin">Why it was deferred till his laſt night</note> The reaſon why he
deferred vntill his laſt night, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Paſſeouer could not be ended,
before the fulneſſe of time, and the true
Paſchal Lambe were come to be ſlaine
in ſtead of the other. Therefore how
fitlie did Chriſt ende the Paſſeouer,
which was a ſigne of his ſuffering, ſo
preſently before his ſuffering? And
beſide, how ſweetly did he confirme
his diſciples faith, when as they ſhould
ſee that the next day performed before
their eyes, which ouernight both in the
Paſſeouer, and in the Sacrament was
ſo liuely reſembled vnto them? If any
from this do gather,<note place="margin">Why we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not the Lords ſupper at night.</note> that we ought to
eate the Lords ſupper at night as Chriſt
did, he muſt vnderſtand that we haue
not the ſame cauſe to do ſo which Chriſt
had, becauſe of the Paſſeouer. And
therefore the Church which hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of times and places, hath altered
both the time and the place, vſing the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13816:5"/>
temples in ſtead of the chamber, and
the morning in ſtead of the euening: for
indifferent things are ruled by order &amp;
decencie.</p>
            <p>Touching the maner,<note place="margin">Verſ. 23. 24.</note> 
               <hi>He tooke bread,
and when he had giuen thankes, he brake
it, and gaue it vnto them.</hi> He would not
eate it, nor breake it, before he had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thankes to God. What neede he which
was God, giue thankes to God, but to
ſhew vs what we ſhould doe, when we
eate our ſelues?<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>In all things giue thankes</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> whereby we declare, that all
things come from God:<note place="margin">Note.</note> but the wicked
beleeue eaſier that God doth take, than
that he doth giue, and therefore they
neuer pray heartily vnto him for any
thing, nor feelinglie thanke him for it.
For which the Lord complaineth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>I haue loued you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mala. 1. 2.</note>

haſt thou loued vs?</hi> Shewing, that we are
worſe than the Oxe,<note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 3.</note> which knoweth
his feeder. And if we acknowledge all
things from God,<note place="margin">Gene. 19. 20.</note> yet we do like <hi>Lot,</hi> Is
it not a little one (ſaith he) when he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to go vnto <hi>Zoar,</hi> as though it were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13816:6"/>
not much which he asked: ſo we mince
and extenuate the giftes of God, before
we receiue them and after; like them
which haue a grace for dinner, and none
for breakfaſt, as though they had their
dinners from God, and breakfaſtes of
their owne. Our exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple did not ſo: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was but bread which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
yet he was more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfull for bread,
than many which burie the fowles, and

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13816:7"/>
that it doth not onlie repreſent his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
but conuey his bodie, and himſelfe
vnto vs. The efficacie of this bleſſing is
in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t euer ſince, ſanctifying

            <p>Now ye haue heard the meaning of
theſe wordes, <hi>He tooke bread, and bleſſed
it, and brake it, and gaue it:</hi> you ſhall ſee
with what a myſticall reſemblance they
vnite Chriſt and vs. Firſt, as Chriſt in
the Supper tooke bread to feede vs:<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note> ſo
in his birth he tooke our fleſh to ſaue
vs. Secondlie as Chriſt when he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the bread, bleſſed the bread to make
it a ſpirituall foode: So Chriſt, when he
had taken our fleſh, powred forth moſt
rich &amp; precious graces into it, to make
it food of life vnto vs.<note place="margin">Iohn. 17. 19.</note> Thirdly, as Chriſt
when he had bleſſed the bread, brake the
bread: ſo Chriſt when he had filled his
bodie with moſt precious graces, brake
it vp like a rich treaſure houſe, his hands
by the nayles, his backe by the ſtripes,
his head by the thornes,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 24.</note> his ſide by the

ſpeare; that out of euery hole a riuer of
grace and goodnes might iſſue &amp; flow
forth vnto vs.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 17.</note> Laſtly, as Chriſt gaue the
bread when he had broken it: ſo Chriſt
by a liuely faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
after he hath crucified it. Hereby we
are taught, that when we ſee the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
take the bread to feede vs, we muſt
conceaue that Chriſt being God from
euerlaſting tooke our fleſh to ſaue vs.
When we ſee the Miniſter bleſſe the
bread to a holy vſe, we muſt conceaue
that Chriſt by vniting the Godhead
vnto it, ſanctified his fleſh for the work
of our redemption. When we ſee the
Miniſter breake the bread to ſuſtaine
our bodies: we muſt conceaue that
Chriſt in his death brake his body to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
our ſoules. When we ſee the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
giue the bread to our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, we muſt
conceaue that Chriſt as trulie offereth

If they conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it is a myracle, they muſt
ſhew vs a ſigne, for euerie myracle may
be ſeene, like all the myracles of <hi>Moſes</hi>

            <p>Againe, a myracle (eſpecially in the

be turned into fleſh and bloud, then
myracles are as common as Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,

and reaſon: but as they asked, who
had giuen him any meate,<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 33.</note> when he ſaid
that he had meate, and they coulde ſee
none: ſo they would haue asked, what
meate is this which we ſee not? How
can euerie one of vs eate his bodie, and
yet he hath but one bodie, and that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is whole when we eate it? Loe, he
ſtandeth before vs and saith, that his
bodie is like vnto ours, and yet hee
takes bread and breakes it, and giues
it vnto vs to eate, and when we eate
it,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 39.</note> he ſaith <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> and yet
his bodie ſtandeth before vs ſtill. If
his bodie be like ours (as he ſaith) how
can it be eaten and be there, for ours
cannot? Thus they would haue que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned,
if they had not beene vſed to
ſuch phraſes: but as they could vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
him when he called himſelfe a
ſtone, and a rock, and a dore, and a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and a Vine, ſo they could picke
out his meaning, when he ſaid that
bread was his bodie: for he had told
them before,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 5.</note> that he was <hi>the bread of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:13816:18"/>
Now the bread of eternall life is not
eaten with teeth, for the bodie cannot
eate ſpiritually, no more then the ſoule
can eate corporally, and therefore he is
ſuch a bread as is eaten with faith, and
ſo himſelfe ſaith in the Goſpel of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 35.</note>
Marke this eating by faith, and all the
ſtrife is ended. Fleſh and bloud indeed
need not faith to chew them, for the
teeth can chew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well enough. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the bread and wine were the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Chriſt, then we need not faith to
eate it, but all which haue teeth might
eate Chriſts bodie, yea the Mice might
eate it as well as men, for they eate the
ſame bread that we do, as well after it is
conſecrated, as before.</p>
            <p>If this be not enough to batter the
ruines of this vpſtart Hereſie, I will
come to interrogatories, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they haue learned it by rote, or
by reaſon. If they ground their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation

               <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> which
hee ſpake to his Diſciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I aske
them, whether they receiue that bodie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13816:19"/>
which was mortall, or that bodie which
is glorified;<note place="margin">Neither Chriſts mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bodie, nor his immortal bodie, can be in the ſame.</note> becauſe one of theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
they muſt needs receiue, either his
mortall bodie, or his glorified bodie.
If they ſay, that it is his mortall bodie,
the mortal bodie wil not profite them:
for you ſee that mortall food is but for
this mortall life, neither hath Chriſt a
mortall bodie now to communicate
vnto them, becauſe it is changed to an
immortall bodie, therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receiue the mortall bodie, becauſe
Chriſt hath not a mortall bodie to giue
them. If they ſay that they receiue his
glorified bodie, then they muſt ſhe
from this Text, for at that time Chriſt
had no glorified bodie.</p>
            <p>When this Sacrament was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and Chriſt ſaid <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> his
bodie was not glorified, becauſe the
Sacrament was inſtituted before his
death, and his bodie was glorified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his reſurrection. Therefore if they
receiue the ſame bodie which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
receiued, as they ſay they do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not receiue a glorified body, becauſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13816:19"/>
then Chriſt had not a glorified bodie
to communicate vnto them. Thus the
rocks and ſands are of both ſides them,
they receiue a bodie neither mortall,
nor immortall: if Chriſt hath any ſuch

            <p>Beſide, I aske them to whome
Chriſt ſpake when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Mar. 14. 24.</note> 
               <hi>This is my
bodie. Marke</hi> ſaith, he <hi>ſpake to them,</hi>
that is, to his Diſciples: well then, if

not ſpoken to the ſignes, but to the
perſons,<note place="margin">Chriſt ſpake not to the bread and wine, but to his diſciples.</note> not to the bread and wine, but
to the receiuers: as the words which
follow, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> if
theſe wordes were not ſpoken to the
bread and wine, then it is plaine that
they doe not change the nature of the
bread and wine. If the nature of them
be not altered, then the ſubſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
and then we receiue no other
ſubſtance with them, becauſe two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
cannot be in one place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:13816:20"/>
What then,<note place="margin">More in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than bread and wine.</note> is there nothing in the
Sacrament but bread and wine, like a
hungrey nunſcion? Nay we ſay not
that the Sacrament is nothing but a
bare ſigne, or that you receiue no more
than you ſee: for Chriſt ſaith, that it is
his bodie, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that it is the
<hi>Communion of Chriſts bodie and bloud.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 16.</note>
Therefore there is more in Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
bread, than in common breade:
though the nature be not changed, yet
the vſe is changed; it doth not onely
nouriſh the body as it did before, but it
bringeth a bread with it which nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
the ſoule: for as ſure as we receiue
bread, ſo ſure we receiue Chriſt: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the benefites of Chriſt, but Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not in a Popiſh maner: yet we
are ſo ioyned vnto him, as though we
were but one body.<note place="margin">A ſimilitude</note> As the ſpouſe doth
not marry with the lands &amp; goods, but
with the man himſelfe, &amp; being parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

ſo the faithfull do not onely marry with
Chriſtes benefites, but with Chriſt him
ſelfe, &amp; being partakers of him, they are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13816:20"/>
made partakers of his benefites: for
Chriſt may not be diuided from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites,
no more than the Sunne from
his light.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> It is ſaid, <hi>the Father gaue vs his
ſonne,</hi> and ſo the Sonne giueth vs him
ſelfe. As the bread is a ſigne of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
ſo the giuing of the bread is a ſigne
of the giuing of his body. Thus he lyeth
before vs like a Pellican which letteth
her yong ones ſucke her bloud: ſo that
we may ſay, the Lord inuited vs to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

if you aske how this is? I muſt anſwere,
it is a myſterie: but if I could tell it, it
were no myſterie. Yet as it is ſaid, when

               <hi>One like the Sonne of God wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

like the Sonne of God ſeemeth to come
vnto them, which fils them with peace

what it was which they receiued, beſides
bread and wine.<note place="margin">A ſimilitude</note> For example thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt

So beloued, this is as good, that vnder

We reade of a people which did eate

it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould take

is needfull that we ſhould take Chriſts

            </p>
            <p>I ſhewed you before, that euerie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

why ſhould we ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at this, more

Sacrament of Chriſt reuerentlie, ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie,

which prophaneth theſe Seales of

why Chriſt calleth the ſignes of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
his body, to make vs take this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reuerentlie, becauſe we are apt to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne it, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did their Manna.</p>

               <hi>Do this in remembrance
of me,</hi> that is, theſe ſignes ſhal be a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of my death: when you breake
the bread you ſhal remember the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of my body; and when you drinke
the wine, you ſhall remember the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

remembraunce of Chriſts body, which
was broken like the bread, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that his bodie is not there, becauſe
remembraunce is not of things preſent,
but of things abſent; we remember not,
but we ſee that which is before vs. This
might put the Papiſts in remembrance
that Chriſt is not ſacrificed now, when
we do but remember his ſacrifice: this
is not Chriſtes ſacrifice, but a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of his ſacrifice; he was ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
before, and now it is applied, leaſt
his ſacrifice ſhould be in vayne.<note place="margin">If Chriſtes bodie were in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it were not a Sacrament but a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> This

is called a Sacrament, becauſe it is but

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13816:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sacrament were offered indeed, then it
ſhould be called a ſacrifice as his once

               </gap> This is not a ſacrifice

Therfore if Chriſt did not giue his mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall

though Chriſt be aſcended, yet many
ſeeke his body vpon earth: but as they

that the bread and wine are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſtes body. Firſt, it will follow,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
that Chriſts body is not aſcended vp to
heauen, becauſe it remaineth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth,
and ſo one of the Articles of our fayth
ſhall be falſified,<note place="margin">Acts. 19. 11.</note> which ſaith, <hi>He is aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <note place="margin">Acts. 3. 21.</note> that is as <hi>Peter</hi>
ſaith, he abideth in heauen. Secondly, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
will follow, that Chriſt hath not a true
body, but a fantaſticall body, becauſe it
may be in many places at one time: for
if his body be in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he muſt
needes haue ſo many bodies as there be
Sacraments; nay, he muſt haue ſo many
bodies as there be bits in euerie Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
Thirdly, it will follow, that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is diuided from his ſoule, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
is a dead bodie, becauſe the bread
is onely changed into body, and not
into his ſoule. Fourthly, at will follow,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:13816:26"/>
that the wicked and prophane, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
may receiue Chriſt as well as
the godly, becauſe they haue a mouth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to eate as well as the beſt. Fiftly, it will
follow,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28. &amp; 10. 12.</note> that Chriſts ſacrifice once for
all was not ſufficient, becauſe we muſt
ſacrifice him againe, and breake his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
&amp; ſhed his bloud, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> him vpon the Croſſe. Sixtly, it
will follow, that the bread being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into the body of our redeemer, hath
a part of our redemption as well as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Chriſt. Seauenthly, it will follow, that
Chriſt did eate his owne bodie: for all
the Fathers ſay that he did eat the ſame
bread which he gaue to his Diſciples.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Laſtly, it will follow, that a Maſſing
Prieſt ſhalbe the creator of his creator,
becauſe he makes him which made
him: all theſe abſurdities are hatched of

            <p>Thus when men deuiſe articles of

they are like the man which began to

               <hi>it is ſayd. This Cup
is my bloud of the New Teſtament.</hi> This
is the firſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion which Chriſt makes
of a Teſtament, as though now his
promiſes deſerued the name of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe the ſeale is ſet vnto them,
which before this Sacrament was not
ſealed, but like a bare writing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſignet. This word <hi>Teſtament,</hi>
doth implie a promiſe, and therefore
teacheth vs, that the Sacrament doth
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen, and nouriſh our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13816:28"/>
fayth, becauſe it ſealeth the promiſe
which we ſhould beleeue.</p>
            <p>Here is to be noted, that Chriſt doth
not onely ſpeake of a Teſtament but he
calleth it a <hi>New Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> which words
neuer met together before, as though
the Law were for the old man to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
him, and the Goſpell for the new
man to comfort him agayne: or, as if the
old Teſtament had ſo waſht her face,
and chaunged her apparell at Chriſtes
comming, that one would not thinke
it the ſame, but a New Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now ſhe was ſhadowed with a
thouſand Ceremonies, &amp; now they are
gone from her, like a myſt at the Sunne
riſing.<note place="margin">Iohn. 13. 34.</note> As Chriſt calleth loue a <hi>New
Commaundement,</hi> becauſe he renewed
it like a Law worne out of memorie,
ſo he calleth the promiſe of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a New Teſtament. Becauſe as it
was renewed to <hi>Sem,</hi> and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and after renewed
to <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſo now he renewed it agayne:
which ſhould bee alwaye new and
freſh vnto vs. Euerie Teſtament is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13816:28"/>
with bloud; the old Teſtament
was confirmed by the bloud of Goats,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 18.</note>
and Bullockes, and Rammes, but the
New Teſtament is confirmed by the
bloud of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 28.</note> 
               <hi>My bloud</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>is the bloud of the New Teſtament:</hi> nay
<hi>This Cup</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 22. 20.</note>
You may ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they may
gather as well out of Chriſtes wordes,
that the Cup is the New Teſtament, as
that the Wine is his bloud. For Chriſt
ſayth, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament,</hi>
as well as he ſayth, <hi>This Wine is my
bloud,</hi> or <hi>This bread is my body.</hi> Beſide,
when Chriſt ſpeakes of a New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 13.</note>
he implieth, that the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is fulfilled, the Sacrifices, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the Law, did ſignifie Chriſt
before he came, therefore they are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in his comming, no mo Sacrifices,
no mo<note n="*" place="margin">For types and figures.</note> Ceremonies, for the truth is
come. Sacrifices and Ceremonies are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably
buried with the Prieſthood of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> let them reſt, it is not lawfull
to violate the Sepulchers of the dead,
and take their bodies out of the earth,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13816:29"/>
as the Witch would raiſe <hi>Samuell</hi> out of
his graue.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28. 14.</note> Therfore they which retaine
Ceremonies, which ſhould be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
reliques of Iudaiſme, or reliques of
Papiſme, may be ſaid to violate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers
of the dead, and diſturbe the
deceaſed, like the Witch, which preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to raiſe <hi>Samuell</hi> out of his graue.</p>
            <p>This Teſtament is called a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in bloud, becauſe the Teſtament
and will of a man is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, when the
man is dead; ſo Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
by his death. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>life is in the bloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 17. 11.</note> ſo the bloud of Chriſt
is the life of this Teſtament. If Chriſtes
bloud had not been ſhed, this Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made vnto vs had been vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as the Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a Father is to his
Sonne, if the Father ſhould not dye but
liue.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> Therefore the Apoſtle ſayth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhedding of bloud there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinnes. Therfore the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or couenaunt of the remiſſion of
our ſinnes, is called the Teſtament in
bloud; the bloud of Chriſt is the ſeale
of the Teſtament, which we haue to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13816:29"/>
ſhew vnto God for the remiſſion of our
ſinnes, and the two Sacraments are a
feale of that bloud, to witnes that it was
ſhed.</p>
            <p>Againe, this is a matter regarded in
Teſtaments and Willes; to the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him that is dead, no man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
or detracteth, but as the Teſtator
made it, ſo it ſtandeth without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
ſo ſhould this Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt,
and this Sacrament of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2.</note> no man
ſhould alter it now he is dead:<note place="margin">Reuel. 22. 18.</note> for hee
which addeth or detracteth hath a curſe
in Gods booke. Therefore Chriſt when
he inſtituted this Sacrament, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>do this,</hi> that is, do as I do, leaſt they
ſhould ſwarue one whit from his owne
manner: yet how many gaudes haue
the Papiſts added to it, that he which
had heard Chriſt ſay, <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me,</hi> and ſhould ſee how they
handle the matter in their Maſſe, could
ſee nothing to remember Chriſt by,<note place="margin">The popiſh receiuing vnder one kind confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> but
a vaile to hide Chriſt from him. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this commandement was repeated
againe when he gaue the wine, <hi>Do this,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13816:30"/>
&amp;c.</hi> as he commanded them to eate the
bread in remembrance of him, ſo he
commandeth them to drinke the wine
in remembrance of him: nay, he ſpeaks
more preciſely of the wine than of the
bread;<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 27.</note> for he ſaith of the wine, <hi>Drinke
you all of this,</hi> which he ſaith not of the
bread. Surely Chriſt did foreſee that
ſome proud Heretiks would do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
after him, euen as it is come to
paſſe: for the Papiſt doth breake this
Commandement of Chriſt, as flatly as
<hi>Saul</hi> brake the commandement of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 9.</note>
               <hi>Samuel</hi> commanded him to kill
the fat &amp; the leane: <hi>Saul</hi> killed the lean,
but not the fat; ſo Chriſt commandeth
to receiue bread and wine, they teach to
receiue bread, but not wine: Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>Drinke you all of this,</hi> they ſay drink not
all of this: Chriſt gaue the bread and
wine to all, they giue the bread to all, &amp;
the wine to ſome: their Prieſts receiue
all, but the people muſt content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with halfe: the Prieſt eates and
drinks, but the people muſt not drinke
for ſpilling on their cloathes. Is this the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13816:30"/>
Church which cannot erre? Doe they
think to hemme Chriſt in their Maſſe,
and ſhut his ordinance out of their
Maſſe?<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 35.</note> The Souldiers diuided Chriſtes
coate, but theſe diuide his bodie, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the bread &amp; wine which Chriſt
hath ioyned. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
which taught,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Touch not, taſt not,

not, handle not, when they ſhould ſay,
Touch,<note place="margin">How the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſtes do iniure the people.</note> and taſt, and handle, Of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
either old or new, there is none ſo
iniurious to the common people, as
the paſture of ſhauelings Poperie, for
they may not reade the ſcriptures; they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
may not come to Councels; they may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
not examine that which is taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
they may not be buried without a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
as though their Prieſtes were
their Lords. Therefore we may ſay as a
Heathen did, <hi>There is no charitie in the
Papists Sacrament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 5. 2.</note> becauſe like <hi>Anantas,</hi>
the Prieſtes keepe backe that which
they ſhould diſtribute, &amp; mangle the
Sacrifice as though <hi>Ely</hi> his Sonnes had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13816:31"/>
left their hooke to the Maſſing Friers.
Thus that yee may know who ſucceed
the Phariſies,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 13.</note> they haue fulfilled that
which the Phariſies did, that is, <hi>By their
owne Commandements they haue made
the Commandement of God of no effect.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 7. 13.</note>
For whereas the purpoſe of Chriſt was
to tye our faith wholly to himſelfe, that
we ſhould not ſeek for any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, knowing that the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of this life hath need both of meat and
drinke, to teach vs that all ſufficiencie
is in himſelfe, by bread and wine he
ſheweth, that he is in ſtead both of meat
and drinke, that is, in ſtead of al: which
ſignification is taken away where the
wine is not giuen as well as the bread.
Therefore as it is ſaid of a horrible and
odious crime,<note place="margin">Iudg. 19. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Conſider the matter and
giue ſentence:</hi> ſo I wiſh all to conſider
this Innouation, and giue ſentence of
it. Can there be any clearer contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Word, or bolder checke to
Chriſt, than when he ſaith, <hi>Drinke you
all of this:</hi> to ſay; drinke not all of this?
It is euen as when God ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Ye ſhal die,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:13816:31"/>
the diuell ſaid, <hi>yee ſhall not die.</hi> Shall we
go now to a Counſell, or a Father, or a
Doctor to inquire whether this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
be like Chriſt doctrine? I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
thinke that none here is ſo ſimple
but that he ſeeth, that if any thing can
be contrarie to Chriſts ſpeech, this is
contrarie to it. But this is onely their
detraction from the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now you ſhall heare their additions
to the Sacrament, looke vpon their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
and their geſtures, and their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
and their pix, and their incenſe, &amp;
their beckes, and their nods, and their
turnings, all this is more then Chriſt
did, and therefore the Prophet may ſay
againe,<note place="margin">Eſai. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath required this of you?</hi>
Did Chriſt commaund you to do more
then he did, and not do as he did? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let them which haue eyes to ſee, be
thankfull for their light, when they
heare how blind they were, whom God
gaue ouer to be ſeduced.</p>
            <p>The fruit of this Sacrament is noted
in theſe words,<note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Which is broken for you,
which is ſhed for you,</hi> that is (as <hi>Matthew</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:13816:32"/>
interpreteth) <hi>ſhed for the remiſſion of
ſinnes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 28.</note> As al was made for vs,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> ſo al which
Chriſt ſpake, he ſpake for vs, and all
which Chriſt did,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 15.</note> he did for vs, and all
which Chriſt ſuffered, he ſuffered for
vs, that the ſinnes of men might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen,
and yet ſo few apprehend this
benefite, that the way to heauen is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>a narrow way,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 13.</note> as though all theſe
pains did ranſome but a ſmal number,
and certaine order of men. All are not
ſaued by Chriſt death, but all which
are ſaued, are ſaued by Chriſts death: his
death is ſufficient to ſaue all, as the ſun
is ſufficient to lighten all: but if anie
man winke, the Sunne will not giue
him light: ſo, if any man contemne, &amp;
will not receiue, Chriſt will not thruſt
him into Heauen, but euerie man ſhall
haue that which he chooſeth (as <hi>Dauid</hi>

make thee quake and tremble if thou

what mercie, now, to pardon thee all
this, and ſaue thy life, and ſet thee at

here had committed reaſon againſt

free, like them which breake the lawes
of men, but to ſuffer and ſuffer, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to ſuffer all that the diuels would
heape vpon vs. Then came the mercie
of GOD for Chriſt which ſhed his

if he be to come, then he is not come; if

a ſhew of Chriſtes death, as it is called
here, then it is not Chriſt, or if you call
it a remembrance of Chriſt, as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

like <hi>Iudas</hi> which hanged himſelfe: if
theſe ſignes be receiued to ſaluation or

               <hi>Is thy heart vpright as my heart is

The golden Ring ſitteth higheſt at our

higheſt at this Table. It is ſafer eating

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13816:36"/>
on the fourteenth day after,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 3. &amp; 6.</note> they were
taught to eate him, ſo they had foure
dayes reſpit betweene the chooſing, and
the killing, to prepare and ſanctifie
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for the Paſſeouer, which was
a ſigne of the Lords Supper. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
them, that the matter now to
be performed, was verie waightie, and
therfore they were deepely to conſider
it, for now was the action, &amp; ſumme of

the figure of this Sacrament, how
ſhold we be prepared before we receiue
the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſelfe? Therfore as <hi>Ioſiah</hi>
commanded the <hi>Leuites</hi> to prepare the

whether they haue faith, and loue, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
before they come to this feaſt.
By this al may ſee, firſt that <hi>Paul</hi> would
haue euerie lay man ſo skilfull in the
ſcripture,<note place="margin">Al are bound to know the Scriptures.</note> that he be able to examine

to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which miniſter the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but
to al which receiue the ſacrament. And
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13816:36"/>
the rule by which we muſt examine
ourſelues, is the law which we ſhould
obey: therfore if the rule be vnknowne,
the examination muſt be vndone. Our
doctrine muſt be examined by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Prophets and Apoſtles;<note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note>
our prayers muſt be examined by the
ſixe petitions of Chriſts prayer;<note place="margin">Note.</note> our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe

may trie gold from copper, but he
which hath it not, takes one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 5.</note>
Therfore, before <hi>Paules Examine,</hi>
you had need to learne Chriſts <hi>Search,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 39.</note>
               <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> and they wil ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you to ſearch your ſelues. This is the
doctrine with which I will end, and the
neceſſarie point for which I chuſe this
text, to teach you (if I could) that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Arte how to examine your ſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe before he
eate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 28.</note> Here is firſt an examination.<note place="margin">The diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
an examination of our ſelues,
Thirdlie, an examination before we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13816:37"/>
come to the Sacrament. Touching the
firſt, here <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth, <hi>Examine your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,</hi>
but in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. he doubleth his
charge, <hi>Prooue your ſelues,</hi> and agayne
at next word, <hi>Examine your ſelues;</hi> as
if he ſhould ſay, this worke muſt be
done when it is done, becauſe it is neuer
throughlie done, and therefore we muſt
double our examination, as <hi>Paule</hi> dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell. If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuſpect his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
he will trie him with a queſtion, if
that will not ſearch him, he will put
forth another; if that be ſpied, he will
moue another, like one which putteth
diuers keyes into a locke vntill it open.
So he which examineth, muſt try and
try, proue and proue, ſearch and ſearch,
for the Angell of darknesse is like an
Angell of light,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 14.</note> and we haue no way
to diſcouer him,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 1.</note> but that of <hi>Iohn, Trie
the ſpirites.</hi> God examineth with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
the deuill examineth with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
the world examineth with
perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: we which are thus exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
had need to examine to. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
skill not what <hi>Examining</hi> meaneth, the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13816:37"/>
verie word. <hi>Examine,</hi> is ſo pregnant,
that it prompteth vs how we ſhould
examine; for it ſignifieth to put our
ſelues vnto the Touch-ſtone, as if we
would trie Gold from Copper. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one ſaith, that Examination is the
eye of the ſoule,<note place="margin">A deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of true exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</note> whereby ſhe ſeeth her
ſelfe, and her ſafetie, and her danger,
and her way which ſhe walketh, and
her pace which ſhe holdeth, and the
end to which ſhe tendeth: ſhe lookes
into her glaſſe, and ſpieth euerie ſpot
in her face, how all her graces are
ſtayned, then ſhe takes the water of life,
and waſheth her blots away. After,
ſhe lookes agayne, and beholdeth all
her giftes, her faith, feare, loue, patience,
meekeneſſe, and marketh how euerie
one doth floriſh, or wither. If they fade
and decay; that ſhe feeleth a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then ſhe taketh preſeruatiues, and
reſtoratiues of prayer, and counſell, and
repentance, before the ſickneſſe grow:
thus euery day ſhe letteth downe a buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
into her heart, to ſee what water
it bringeth vp, leaſt ſhe ſhould corrupt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13816:38"/>
within, and periſh ſodenly.</p>
            <p>To heare, and read, pray, and faſt, and
communicate, is a worke of many, but
to examine thoſe workes, is the faſhion
of few,<note place="margin">Iere. 8. 6.</note> and therfore <hi>Ieremie</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth,
<hi>No man ſayth, what haue I done?</hi> as if he
ſhould ſay, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examineth himſelfe:
and therfore in all the Scripture it is ſaid
but of one,<note place="margin">Iob. 9. 28.</note> 
               <hi>that he feared all his workes,</hi> as
though he durſt not thinke, nor ſpeake,
nor do any thing before he had exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
what it was, from whence it came,
and whether it went:<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 44.</note> ſo the more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
treaſure is deeper hid in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point is,<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 21.</note> to <hi>Examine our
ſelues, Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>Trie all things,</hi> much
more ſhould we trie our ſelues. The
good ſower doth ſow his own ground,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 25.</note>
but the bad ſower doth ſow another
mans ground, as the deuill did. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
of Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> not

asked,<note place="margin">Luke. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Maſter, what ſhall we do?</hi> not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

others, &amp; loue all, but examine our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13816:38"/>
That which we applie vnto others,
the Apoſtle applieth vnto our ſelues;
for when we ſpeake of an examiner, we
intend one which examineth other:
when we ſpeake of an accuſer, we inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
one which accuſeth other: when we
ſpeake of a Iudge, we meane one which
iudgeth others, but the Scripture crieth,
<hi>Examine thy ſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 13.</note> 
               <hi>accuſe thy ſelfe, iudge thy
ſelfe,</hi> that is, be not curious to ſearch a
mote in thy brothers eye,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 3.</note> but pull out
the beame which is in thy owne eye.
This doth ſhew that they which ſit in
Gods chaire to iudge others, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue greater faults themſelues, than
they whom they vſe to iudge: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt calleth their fault a beame,
and the others a mote.<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 4.</note> This made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
ſay, <hi>Examine thy heart,</hi> thy heart is
thy owne heart, therefore thou muſt
examine whether thou pray, whether

whether he pray, whether he watch, as
the Phariſie examined the Publica,<note place="margin">Luke. 18. 11.</note> leaſt
thou haue <hi>Peters</hi> checke: when he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
what <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould do, Chriſt ſaid,

               <hi>What is that to thee?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>follow thou me.</hi>
Thou art a priuate man, and haſt a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
examination, therfore let thy que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
be, <hi>What haue I done?</hi> and make
thy Anatomie of thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>See beloued, we may not beleeue our
ſelues before we haue examined our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:
for we are falſe hearted; and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableſt
coſiner that deceiueth moſt,
for one time that he deceiueth others,
ten times deceiueth himſelfe. Becauſe
the fleſh is a wylie ſeruaunt, and will lye
like <hi>Gehezi</hi> to his own maſter,<note place="margin">2. King. 5. 25.</note> and face

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo the ſoule muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
her ſeruant, that is, man muſt be
ielous of himſelfe, and take himſelfe for
a lyer, for a flatterer, for a diſſembler,
vntill he be throughly acquainted with
himſelfe: for no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſo often beguiled,
as by himſelfe, by truſting his double
heart, and taking his owne word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further triall. If <hi>Paule</hi> had bid vs
examine others,<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 31.</note> we would haue ſifted
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like Sathan <hi>Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath deſired to fift
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13816:39"/>
thee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo we haue a
deſire to ſift others: euen <hi>Peter</hi> which
was ſifted of Sathan, longed to ſift <hi>Iohn,</hi>
and know what he ſhould do, before he
karkened to his owne charge. Therfore
the helpe of examination is a needfull
preſeruatiue, although we were as ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
as <hi>Peter.</hi> They which are ſuſpected of
crime do not examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but are
examined of others, leaſt they ſhould
be partiall: but a Chriſtian muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
himſelfe of his crime, and be his
own iudge, his own accuſer, &amp; his own
condemner: for no man knoweth the
ſpirit of man but the ſpirite which is
in man,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 11.</note> which will condemne him if he
be guiltie, and tell him all that he hath
done, and with what minde he did it, &amp;
what he deſerueth for it. This is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
araignement, or cloſe Seſſions,
when Conſcience ſits in her chaire to
examine, and accuſe, and iudge, and
condemne her ſelfe, becauſe ſhe will
not be condemned of God.</p>
            <p>Thus holie men haue kept their Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

the foreman of the Iury, and examined

their lips, to examine euery word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it went out, whereby they eſcaped
a thouſand ſinnes which we commit, as
though we had no other worke. So thou

               <hi>but
the ſpirite which is in man,</hi> that is, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
feeleth the heart of man ſo well as him

doth not know his owne heart vnleſſe
he examine it narrowly, no more than
he knoweth his owne bones, or his
vaines, or his ſinewes, or his arteries, or
his muskles, how many are in his body,
or where they lye, or what they do. This
ſeemes ſtraunge that a man ſhould not
know his owne heart, yet it is true that
the beſt of vs al doth not know his own
heart, though he haue dwelt with it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his mothers wombe. For Chriſt ſaith to
his diſciples,<note place="margin">Luke. 9. 55.</note> euen to his diſciples, <hi>You
know not of what ſpirite you are,</hi> that is,
you think better of your ſelues tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you

knowledge, and there is a knowledge
without zeale; there is a faith without
obedience, and there is an obedience
without fayth; there is a loue without
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13816:41"/>
feare, and there is a feare with loue,
and both are hypocrites. Therefore
as <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſearched where <hi>Sampſons</hi>

worketh according as it is digeſted, &amp;

we ſanctifie our ſelues before we come
to Chriſtes Sacrament, wherein we are
commaunded to doe as the Lord him
ſelfe did which inſtituted it? It is ſaid,
that the Chamber wherein Chriſt did
inſtitute this Sacrament,<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 12.</note> was trimmed;
the Chamber wherein the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
this Sacrament was trimmed: If
<hi>Iudas</hi> Chamber, his inner Chamber had
bene trimmed ſo to, he had receiued
this Sacrament with as much comfort
as the other Diſciples did: but becauſe
his heart was not trimmed, therefore he
was the firſt which was condemned for
the vnworthie receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Gene. 3. 6.</note>
               <hi>Adam</hi> did not thinke that death

not thinke that death ſhould be in

the coale it ſelfe, which fire doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
warme or burne; ſo this meate
hath another meate in it beſide that
which is ſeen, which doth either ſaue or
deſtroy: therefore he which commeth
to this ſpirituall meate, muſt examine
whether hee haue a ſpirituall mouth,
as well as a carnall mouth, or elſe he
ſhall receiue no more than he ſeeth, and
that which he ſeeth not ſhall deſtroy

               <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>putteth new

Wine, therefore put it into new veſſels,
holy veſſels, ſanctified veſſels, or elſe it
will leake forth &amp; breake the veſſell, &amp;
thou ſhalt haue no more taſt of it, than
while the reliſh of bread is in thy
mouth. When Chriſt commeth to our
houſe, ſhall we not looke whether our
Chamber be trimmed, as the Chamber
was trimmed againſt his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the
Paſſe-ouer? But how ſhal we trimme it?</p>
            <p>When a man takes an office, he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13816:43"/>
his ſubſtaunce: when he takes a
trade, he examineth his skill: when
he goeth to fight, he examineth his
ſtrength, but theſe wants are no wants
when he goeth to the Sacrament. Wilt
thou know now vpon what articles
thou muſt inquire at that time, that is,
how thou ſhouldeſt examine thy ſelfe?</p>
            <p>As ſome prayer may be at all times,<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 16.</note>
and ſome reioycing may be at all times;
ſo ſome examination is at all times.
Thus <hi>Iob</hi> examined himſelfe euerie
day,<note place="margin">Iob. 9. 28.</note> nay, euery houre, becauſe he ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all that he did.</p>
            <p>But there is a ſpeciall examination
before the Sacrament, becauſe it is the
bread which is receiued to ſaluation, or
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 29.</note> becauſe it is the feaſt, to which

in it, whether it be of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
