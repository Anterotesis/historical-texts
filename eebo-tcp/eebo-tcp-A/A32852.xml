         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HE that is arrived at ſuch a degree of wickedneſs, that his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will allow him to equivocate in the moſt ſolemn Aſſeverations, and to put on any perſon or ſhape for the carrying on his Deſigns, has thereby a great advantage over the common people, who being more honeſt and ſimple, can ſcarce think it poſſible, that men, profeſſing God and Religion, ſhould admit of principles and practices ſo diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally contrary: and men that are prepoſſeſſed with prejudices of envy, ill-will, or the like, againſt their Neighbours, do readily embrace thoſe mens ſuggeſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe, how falſe and groundleſs ſoever they be. Hence it is, that our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Enemies having no other way to ſave themſelves from the Demerits of their Helliſh Plots, do very induſtriouſly by Pamphlets and otherwiſe labour to beget and encreaſe enmity among diſſenting Proteſtants, And they ſo far prevail, that notwithſtanding the deſtructin deſigned by them againſt Proteſtants, yet ſome have greater enmity and bitterneſs towards thoſe that differ from them either in leſſer points of Religion, or in ſentiments about civil Matters, than againſt the Papiſts themſelves. Which may be perceived, not only in common converſe, but even in the Pulpit it ſelf: whence I muſt confeſs, I have ſometimes heard (though not in my own Pariſh) diſcourſes ſo full of rancor and bitterneſs againſt diſſenting Proteſtants, that I could not but greatly bewail the ill tendencies thereof, and at the ſame time was glad my Children and Servants were not there, that they might not learn by ſuch Rhetorical Invectives to malign their Neighbours, inſtead of loving their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as Chriſt has commanded.</p>
            <p>Theſe men pretending great zeal for the Government and Church of <hi>England</hi> (as thoſe Members of the laſt long Parliament alſo did, who were expelled thence for being Papiſts) will difficulty allow any other but ſuch as themſelves to be at all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. Wherefore I thought it would be of ſervice to Proteſtantiſm, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Christianity, to mind my Country-men of the Judgment of the Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> concerning the Religion of Proteſtants, the Differences among them, the uſe of Force and Compulſion in Religion, private judgment of Conſcience, in diſſent from publick, and ſome other matters contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between Proteſtants and Papists, which I have collected out of his Book, Intituled, <hi>The Religion of Proteſtants a ſafe way to Salvation:</hi> and which I hope will be of the greater prevalency with ſome, not only for the great ſtrength of reaſon and judgment found therein: but moreover, for that Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> had himſelf been once of the Roman Church, and had therefore experience as well as judgment to guide him in theſe matters. He wrote alſo in the year 1637, which was before the following unnatural War. He was not only of the Church of <hi>England</hi> himſelf, which he defended againſt the Papiſts: but his Book had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the then Vice-Chancellor, and both the Kings and Margret Profeſſor's of Divinity in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon.</hi> the very chief men in Office there. Their Approbation take in their own words, Engliſhed for the ſake of thoſe that know not Latine.</p>

                  <hi>CHap. 6. Nom.</hi> 56. Know then, Sir, that when I ſay the Religion of Proteſtants is in prudence to be preferred before yours: as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide I do not underſtand by your Religion the Doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or any other private man amongſt you, nor the Doctrine of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> or of the Jeſuits, or of the Dominicans, or of any other particular Company amongſt you, but that wherein you all agree, or profeſs to agree, <hi>The Doctrine of the Council of Trent:</hi> ſo accordingly on the other ſide, by <hi>The Religion of Proteſtants,</hi> I do not underſtand the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Melanchton,</hi> nor the Confeſſion of <hi>Auguſta</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor the Catechiſm of <hi>Heidelburg,</hi> nor the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no, nor the Harmony of Proteſtant Confeſſions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all ſubſcribe with a greater Harmony, as a perfect Rule of their Faith and Actions; that is, the BIBLE, the BIBLE, I ſay the BIBLE only is the Religion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants! Whatſoever elſe they believe beſides it, and the plain irrefragable, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable conſequences of it, well may they hold it as a matter of Opinion, but not as a matter of Faith and Religion; neither can they with coherence to their own grounds believe it themſelves, nor require the belief of it of others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moſt high and moſt ſchiſmatical Preſumption. I, for my part, after a long (and as I utterly believe and hope) impartial ſearch of <hi>the true way to eternal happineſs,</hi> do profeſs plainly, that I cannot find any reſt for the ſole of my foot, but upon this Rock only. I ſee plainly and with mine own eyes, that there are Popes againſt Popes, Councils againſt Councils, ſome Fathers againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the ſame Fathers againſt themſelves, a Conſent of Fathers of one Age
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46138:4"/>
againſt the Church of another Age; Traditive Interpretations of Scripture are pretended, but there are few or none to be found: No Tradition but only of Scripture can drive it ſelf from the Fountain, but may be plainly proved, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have been brought in, in ſuch an Age after Chriſt, or that in ſuch an Age it was not in. In a word, there is no ſufficient certainty but of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture only, for any conſidering man to build upon. This therefore, and this only, I have reaſon to believe; this I will profeſs, according to this I will live, and for this, if there be occaſion, I will not only willingly, but even gladly loſe my life, though I ſhould be ſorry that Chriſtians ſhould take it from me. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me any thing out of this book, and require whether I believe it or no, and ſeem it never ſo incomprehenſible to humane reaſon, I will ſubſcribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no demonſtration can be ſtronger than this, <hi>God hath ſaid ſo, therefore it is true.</hi> In other things I will take no mans liberty of Judgment from him, neither ſhall any man take mine from me; I will think no man the worſe man or the worſe Chriſtian; I will love no man the leſs for differing in opinion from me; and what meaſure I mete to others, I expect from them again: I am fully aſſured that God does not, and therefore that men ought not to require any more of any man than this, To believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be God's Word, to endeavour to find the true ſence of it, and to live according to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> 57. This is the Religion which I have choſen after a long deliberation, and I am verily perſwaded that I have choſen wiſely, much more wiſely than if I had guided my ſelf according to your Churches Authority; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture being all true, I am ſecured by believing nothing elſe, that I ſhall believe no falſhood as matter of Faith: And if I miſtake the ſenee of Scripture, and ſo fall into error, yet I am ſecure from any danger thereby, if but your grounds be true; becauſe endeavouring to find the true ſence of Scripture, I cannot but hold my error without pertinacy, and be ready to forſake it, when a more true and a more probable ſence ſhall appear unto me: And then all neceſſary truth being, as I have proved, plainly ſet down in Scripture, I am certain by believing Scripture, to believe all neceſſary truth; and he that does ſo, if his Life be anſwerable to his Faith, how is it poſſible he ſhould fail of Salvation?</p>

N.</hi> 11.—To ſpeak properly (as men ſhould ſpeak when they write of Controverſies in Religion) the Scripture is not a Judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but a <hi>Rule only,</hi> and <hi>the only Rule for Chriſtians to judg them by:</hi> Every man is to judge for himſelf with the judgment of Diſcretion, and to chuſe either his Religion firſt, and then his Church as we ſay; or as you, his Church firſt, and then his Religion. But by the conſent of both ſides, every man is to judg and chuſe; and the Rule whereby he is to direct his choice, if he be a natural man, is Reaſon; if he be already a Chriſtian, Scripture, which we ſay is the Rule to judge all Controverſies by, yet not all ſimply, but all the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Chriſtians, of thoſe that are already agreed upon this firſt Principle, that <hi>the Scripture is the Word of God.</hi> But that there is any man, or any company of men, appointed to be Judg for all men, that we deny; and that I believe you will never prove.</p>

Now in matters of Religion, when the Queſtion is, Whether every man be a fit Judg and Chuſer for himſelf, we ſuppoſe men honeſt, and ſuch as underſtand the difference between a Moment and Eternity; and ſuch men, we conceive, will think it highly concerns them to be of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but nothing at all that this or that Religion ſhould be the true: And then we ſuppoſe that all the neceſſary points of Religion are plain and eaſie, and conſequently every man in his Cauſe to be a competent Judg for himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it concerns himſelf to judg right as much as Eternal Happineſs is worth, and if through his own default he judg amiſs, he alone ſhall ſuffer for it.</p>

The moſt diſagreeing Proteſtants that are, yet thus far agree, that theſe Books of Scripture which were never doubted of in the Church, are the undoubted Word of God, and a perfect Rule of Faith. 2. That the ſenſe of them which God intended, whatſoever it is, is certainly true; ſo that they believe implicitly even thoſe very truths againſt which they err; and why an implicit faith in Chriſt and his Word, ſhould not ſuffice as well as an implicit faith in your Church, I have deſired to be reſolved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your ſide, but never could. 3. That they are to uſe their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to believe the Scripture in true ſenſe, and to live according to it. This if they perform (as I hope many on all ſides do) truly and ſincerely, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that they ſhould believe aright in all things neceſſary to Salvation, that is, in all thoſe things that pertain to the Covenant between God and Man in Chriſt; for ſo much is not only plainly but frequently contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and believing aright the Covenant, if they for their parts perform the condition required of them, which is ſincere obedience, why ſhould they not expect that God will perform his promiſe and give them Salvation? For as for other things which lye without the Covenant, and are therefore leſs neceſſary, if by reaſon of the ſeeming Conflict which is oftentimes between Scripture, Reaſon, and Authority on the one ſide, and Scripture, Reaſon, and Authority on the other, if by reaſon of the variety of Tempers, Abilities, Educations, and unavoidable Prejudices, whereby mens Underſtandings are variouſly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and faſhioned, they do embrace ſeveral opinions whereof ſome muſt be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; to ſay that God will damn them for ſuch errors, who are Lovers of him, and Lovers of Truth, is to rob man of his Comfort, and God of his Goodneſs, it is to make man deſperate, and God a Tyrant.</p>

That it is ſufficient for any mans Salvation that he believe the Scripture, that he endeavour to believe it in the true ſence of it as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns his duty; and that he conform his life unto it either by Obedience or Repentance: He that does ſo, (and all Proteſtants, according to the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of their Religion, ſhould do ſo) may be ſecured that he cannot err fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, ſo that notwithſtanding their differences and your preſumption, <hi>the ſame Haven may receive them all.</hi>

Methinks with much more reaſon and much more charity, you muſt ſuppoſe that many of theſe Controverſies which are now diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians (all which profeſs themſelves Lovers of Chriſt, and truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know his will and do it) are either <hi>not decidable</hi> by that means which God hath provided, and ſo not neceſſary to be decided; or if they be, yet <hi>not ſo plainly and evidently,</hi> as to oblige men to hold one way: Or laſtly, if decidable, and evidently decided, yet you may hope that the erring part, by reaſon of ſome Veil before their eyes, <hi>ſome excuſable ignorance or unavoidable prejudice</hi> does not ſee the queſtion to be decided againſt him, and ſo oppoſes

not that which he doth know to be the word of God, but only that which you know to be ſo, and which he might know, were he void of prejudice: which is a fault, I confeſs, but a fault which is incident even to good and honeſt Men very often; and not of ſuch a Gigantick Diſpoſition as you make it, to flie directly upon God Almighty, and to give him the Lye to his Face.</p>

               <head>Of the Neceſſity of a Viſible Judge in Controverſies of Religion, as well as in Civil Matters.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ch. 1. N.</hi> 17.—In Civil Controverſies we are obliged only to external paſſive obedience, and not to an internal and active. We are bound to obey the ſentence of the Judge, or not to reſiſt it, but not always to believe it juſt. But in matters of Religion ſuch a Judge is required whom we ſhould be obliged to believe to have judged right, ſo that in Civil Controverſies every honeſt and underſtanding Man is fit to be a Judge, but in Religion none but he that is infallible.</p>
               <p>5. In Civil Cauſes there is means and power, when the Judge has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to compel men to obey his Sentence: otherwiſe I believe Laws alone would be to as much purpoſe for the ending of Differences, as Laws and Judges both. But all the power in the World is neither fit to convince, nor able to compel a Man's Conſcience to conſent to any thing; worldly terror may prevail ſo far asto make Men profeſs a Religion which they believe not, (ſuch men I mean who know not that there is a Heaven provided for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and a Hell for thoſe that diſſemble ſuch Truths as are neceſſary to be profeſſed) but to force either any man to believe what he believes not, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honeſt man to diſſemble what he does believe (if God commands him to profeſs it) or to profeſs what he does not believe, all the powers in the world are too weak, with all the powers of Hell to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>7. In Civil Matters it is impoſſible <hi>Titius</hi> ſhould hold the Land in queſtion, and <hi>Sempronius</hi> too; and therefore either the Plaintiff muſt injure the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant by diſquieting his Poſſeſſion, or the Defendant wrong the Plaintiff, by keeping his Right from him. But in Controverſies of Religion the caſe is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I may hold my opinion, and do you no wrong, and you yours, and do me none. Nay, we may both of us hold our opinion, and yet do our ſelves no harm, provided the difference be not touching any thing neceſſary to Salvation, and that we love truth ſo well, as to be diligent to inform our Conſcience, and conſtant in following it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ch. 3. N.</hi> 52. I anſwer that theſe Differences between Proteſtants concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errors damnable, and not damnable: Truths fundamental and not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental may be eaſily reconciled; for either the Error they ſpeak of, may be <hi>purely and ſimply involuntary,</hi> or it may be in reſpect of <hi>the cauſe of it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily:</hi> If the cauſe of it be ſome voluntary and unavoidable fault, the error is it ſelf ſinful, and conſequently in its own nature damnable; as if by negligence in ſeeking the Truth, by unwillingneſs to find it, by pride, by obſtinacy, by deſiring that Religion ſhould be true which ſuits beſt with my ends, by fear of mens ill opinion, or any other worldly fear, or any worldly hope, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray my ſelf to any error contrary to any divine revealed Truth, that error may be juſtly ſtyled a Sin, and conſequently of it ſelf to ſuch an one damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but if I be guilty of none of theſe faults, but be deſirous to know the truth, and diligent in ſeeking it, and adviſe not at all with fleſh and blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about

the choice of my Opinions, but only with God and that Reaſon that he hath given me: If I be thus qualifyed, and yet through humane infirmity fall into error, that error cannot be damnable. Again, the Party erring may be conceived either to dye with Contrition, for all his Sins known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or without it: If he dye without it, this error in it ſelf is damnable, will be likewiſe ſo unto him; if he dye with Contrition (as his error can be no impediment but he may) his error, though in it ſelf damnable, to him, according to your Doctrine, will not prove ſo.</p>

But they <hi>endeavoured to force the Society whereof they were parts, to be healed and reformed as they were, and if it refuſed, they did, when they had power, drive them away, even their Superiors both Spiritual and Temporal, as is notorious.</hi> The proofs hereof are wanting, and therefore I might defer my Anſwer until they were produced, yet take this before hand: If they did ſo, then herein, in my opinion, they did amiſs; for I have learnt from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers of the Church, that <hi>Nothing is more againſt Religion, than to force Religion;</hi> and of St. <hi>Paul, The Weapons of the Chriſtian Warfare are not Carnal;</hi> And great Reaſon: For humane violence may make men counterfeit, but cannot make them believe, and is therefore fit for nothing, but to breed Form without and Atheiſm within. Beſides, if this means of bringing men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any Religion were generally uſed, (as if it may be juſtly uſed in any place, by thoſe that have power and think they have truth, certainly they cannot with reaſon deny, but that it may be uſed in every place, by thoſe that have power as well as they, and think they have truth as well as they) what could follow but the maintenance perhaps of Truth, but perhaps only of the profeſſion of it in one place, and the oppreſſion of it in a hundred? what will follow from it but the preſervation peradventure of Unity, but peradventure only of Uniformity in particular States and Churches; but the immortalizing the greater and more lamentable Diviſions of Chriſtendom and the World? And therefore what can follow from it, but perhaps in the judgment of carnal Policy, the temporal Benefit and Tranquillity of Temporal States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but the infinite prejudice, if not the diſſolution of the Kingdom of Chriſt? And therefore it well becomes them who have their Portions in this life, who ſerve no higher State than that of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> nor this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any further than they may ſerve themſelves by it; who think of no other happineſs but the preſervation of their own Fortunes and Tranquillity in this World; who think of no other means to preſerve States but humane Power and Machiavilian Policy, and believe no other Creed but this, <hi>Regi aut Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati Imperium habenti nihil unjuſtum quod utile!</hi> Such men as theſe it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to maintain by worldly power and violence, their State, Inſtrument, Religion; for if all be vain and falſe (as in their judgment it is) the preſent whatſoever is better than any, becauſe it is already ſetled: An alteration of it may draw with it change of States, and the change of State the ſubverſion of their Fortune; but they that are indeed Servants and Lovers of Chriſt, of Truth, of the Church, and of Mankind, ought with all courage, to oppoſe themſelves againſt it as a common enemy of all theſe. They that know there is a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, by whoſe Will and Pleaſure Kings and Kingdoms ſtand and fall; they know that to no King or State any thing can be profitable which is unjuſt, and that nothing can be more evidently unjuſt, than to force weak men by the Profeſſion of a Religion which they believe not, to loſe their own Eternal Happineſs out of a vain and needleſs fear, leſt they may
