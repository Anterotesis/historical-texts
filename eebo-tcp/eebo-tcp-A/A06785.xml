         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Mistery of Exchanges,</hi> and that not without an

answer thereunto, shewing his maine scope to be,
to haue the moneys of the Realme inhaunced, and
the forreine Coyne to be currant at an equall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue:
which was to reforme things by a Remedy

make forreine Coyne currant within the Realme,
will ouerthrow his Maiesties Mint, and abrogate

            <p>Hereupon hauing in the Epistle Dedicatory of

            <p>The said <hi>Misselden</hi> (carping at the <hi>Simile,</hi>

humbly to beseech your Highnes to intercede for
me vnto his sacred Maiestie, to be well pleased to
<pb facs="tcp:12188:4"/>
peruse this my third Booke, intituled <hi>The Center
of the Circle of Commerce,</hi> wherein the meanes
to prouide his Kingdomes and Dominions with
<hi>Bullion</hi> &amp; <hi>Moneys</hi> are more distinctly declared,
according to the said <hi>Center of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce,</hi> which
is (<hi>gaine,</hi>) without which his <hi>Circle</hi> is (<hi>vaine.</hi>)</p>
            <p>To make <hi>A Definition of the Center of the
Earth</hi> is difficult euen amongst learned Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Schoolemen, considering <hi>Aristotle</hi> his
Doctrine grounded vpon <hi>Leuity</hi> of things ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and <hi>Grauity</hi> of things falling to their <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
and the opinion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> or rather of
the <hi>Pithagorians,</hi> ascribing <hi>a Stability</hi> to the
Heauens, and <hi>a Mobility</hi> to the Earth; But to
make a <hi>Definition</hi> of this <hi>Center (gaine)</hi> is easie,
and engraffed in euery mans iudgement.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Center</hi> maketh a perfect <hi>Orbe,</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all <hi>Geometricall proportions,</hi> and can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
all <hi>Mathematicall Problemes of Trade,
for the doubling of the Cube of Solids, and
the Quadrature of the Circle in Plaine,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Platos</hi> Exposition, or <hi>Misseldens</hi> conceited
<hi>Ballance of Trade:</hi> for all the weight of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
falleth within the <hi>Circuit of the Circle of
this Center (gaine:)</hi> insomuch, that if the due
<pb facs="tcp:12188:4"/>
consideration hereof be neglected in the course of
Trade, nothing can be expected but the decay of
Trade, and destruction of Common-weales, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the following <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
to a diseased body naturall so that States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Politicians are to bend their iudgements
in all publike causes to this <hi>Center (gaine,</hi> which
beareth the sway in all humane actions,) thereby to
finde out all fallacies and misprisions of Trade, to
the increase of the Kingdomes stocke, without pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
regard of particular Merchants making their
benefit by the generall losse of the Kingdome: there
is no man so simple but will auoide a losse if he can,
and on the contrary, procure a gaine where he may
or can; Shall it be imagined then that <hi>Bullion</hi> &amp;
<hi>Moneys</hi> will be imported when the bringer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
becommeth a loser, or that moneys will remaine
within the Realme, when so great a gaine can be
had by the exportation thereof? Or will any man
think that Trade can be driuen conueniently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moneys and Exchanges? will not the want of
it make a dead Trade within the Realme when
this <hi>Vitall spirit of Commerce</hi> faileth? surely
it is questionles in euery mans vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>Your Highnes therefore may be pleased to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
<pb facs="tcp:12188:5"/>
the establishing of this <hi>Center</hi> in the course
of Trade, whereby his Maiesties Kingdomes and
Dominions will flow with <hi>Bullion</hi> and <hi>Moneys,</hi>
and infuse life thereunto, which will be felt by the
<hi>Pulces, the Hammers of the Mint:</hi> vpon my
life and reputation of knowledge, which time and
occasion seeme to further by the price of Exchange,
inclining thereunto since this Treatise hath beene
vnder the Presse. If any thing therein shall seeme
impertinent to the <hi>Grauity of the Center,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
your Highnes to attribute the same to the
<hi>Leuity of the Circle,</hi> the rather because <hi>Nugae
seria ducunt.</hi> Thus with all humblenes taking
leaue, I shall continue my feruent Prayers to the
Almighty, to preserue your Highnes in health and
happinesse, to his glory, and your eternall felicity.

who was neuer graduated in Schools, do you think
to coniure me within the circuite of your Circle,
wherein you are inclosed? I am not to follow your
method of circulation, especially when you striue
to commend and make good that within booke
which was neuer in question, and maliciously vrge
some things without booke, that were neuer meant

And so I end, with an obseruation onely of

               <p>There is no Rule so generall in any thing, which
admitteth not some exception: but to ground any
thing vpon an exception, and to leaue the generall
rule, is neuer done by any man of iudgement. All
<hi>Misseldens</hi> contradictions are grounded vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
and the generall rule is neglected. As for
example:</p>
               <p>The Ship named the <hi>Dragon,</hi> comming from the

               <p>States-men haue obserued for a generall rule, that
the inhauncing of the coyne doth generally raise

giuen out at high rates, especially when intestine

               <p>Againe, when the price of commodities is raised
generally with the price of moneys inhaunced;<note place="margin">P. 25.</note> shall
we contradict the same, because one commoditie,
as Cloues, is not risen, but sold as a staple ware?</p>
               <p>Likewise when moneys are not imported, when
there is a losse by the bringing of them:<note place="margin">Moneys decaied of their price are imported againe.</note> shall we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
this principle when moneys are brought in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
decried or made bullion beyond the seas, as the
<hi>Iacobus</hi> and other coines haue bin of late in <hi>Holland</hi>

               <p>When generally all Diuines doe interprete and

               <p>The generall Trade, all the world ouer, is made

Now albeit that there are some countries where

where moneys are forbidden to be carried out,
there must of necessity some other meanes be found

               <p>This exchange for moneys cannot be otherwise,

surely here is matter enough to conuince him
of all his folly, which by the <hi>Prouerbiall</hi> Text in the
Title of his Pampflet is quoted, but I intend to be
briefe and substantiall.</p>
                  <p>All men of iudgement may easily perceiue, that
the maine point in question concerning our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
doth consist in the abuse of Exchanges, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the value of moneys of other Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries inhau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

vs, as if by exchange we did really receiue the
value thereof, there is no man blinder then he that

obserued out of <hi>Mafscius</hi> History, they would call
him blind by his owne reasons. He saith that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of experence doe diuide (as it were) their
eyes, by casting the one vpon commodities, and the
other vpon moneys, with a consideration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
value, and outward valuation thereof, if they
did so, there is no difference betweene him and me
in this principall point. So as the words <hi>Together
with the course of Exchange,</hi> were also considered of,
and that the price of Exchange did rise proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with the rising of the moneys, whereof we doe
complaine: Shall this Merchant come home by
weeping crosse that doth not the same? and shall not
Exchange for moneys be the publike measure? you
will buy cloth of a Draper by the yard at a certaine
price, and yet the yard whereby it is measured must
not be called the measure.</p>
                  <p>But some will say, why doe you take <hi>Missolden</hi> so
short, doth not he say that Merchants of experience
doe so, and herein he doth vse a little equiuocation,
or rather prouidence in pondering of his words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
well, I must craue pardon, and proue that Merchants
doe not so, and then it must follow that experience
is wanting: but howsoeuer the <hi>Maxime</hi> is true: <hi>That

their inward value, truely to be expressed by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

great errors in Trade, seeking their priuat gaine,
and the Common wealth doth receiue an incredible

                  <p>To make this more euident,<note place="margin">Generall Rules,</note> consider we of these

to their vse more or lesse, which rule is not
without exception, howbeit, <hi>Money</hi> must not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued

And so it is in matters of Exchanges, whereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities

proportionate this price of Exchange in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
according to the true value or aboue the same,
grounded vpon the said <hi>Positiue Exchange,</hi> so doth
plenty or scarsity of money doe the like, and the
commodities so bought by moneys taken vp by

wee looke one way, and goe another way, like men
that row on the water, or like Crabs on the Land.</p>
               <p>Wee haue obserued heretofore, that Polititions

of a thing vnto his Principle or Original, produceth
the longer continuance, shewing (by <hi>Digression</hi>)
how the same is decaied, and may be reduced to the

               <p>To reduce therefore the course of Exchange for
moneys to the first institution, may seeme very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to explaime this important matter.</p>
               <p>It is about 80. yeares since that there was an equal
Exchange between England and the Netherlands,<note place="margin">Aequall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</note>
which in true value may be called <hi>Positiue,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to alteration in price <hi>Currant,</hi> at which
time, twenty shillings of their coine, and twenty
shillings Starlin, were alike in denomination, that is
to say, were named all one in price, &amp; of intrinsique
or inward value, for their <hi>Imperial Royall of gold</hi> was
valued and went currant for Ten shillings Flemish,
and our Angell was valued at Ten shillings Starlin,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12188:15"/>
being all of a goodnes of Gold in value, which we
call <hi>Waight and finesse</hi> by the termes of the Mint, so
the French Crowne which was valued here at Six
shillings Starlin,<note place="margin">English &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine coyne all one in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</note> and beyond the Seas at six shillings
Flemish, was correspondent: the <hi>Phillip Doller</hi> of
siluer was valued at fiue shillings Flemish, and so
was the <hi>Edward</hi> Crowne of silucr fiue shillings Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin:
our ten Groats being three shillings and foure
pence, was correspondent to the Emperours Florin
of twenty Stiuers: and the Flemish shillings of six
Stiuers or twelue pence Flemish, was all one with
our shilling or twelue pence Starlin: for an ounce of
Starlin siluer was valued as fiue shillings, for there
was fiue peeces or shillings made out of an ounce:
and although the Standards of moneys did differ in
the finesse or goodnes of the siluer and gold, yet
the quantity in waight did answere and made good
the same: as for example, the Starlin Standard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
11. ounces 2. <abbr>d.</abbr> waight in fine siluer, in the 12
ounces Troy to the pound waight made into 60 <abbr>s.</abbr>
caused the ounce to be fiue shillings; and the <hi>Philip.</hi>
Doller being but ten ounces of fine siluer in the like
pound weight of 12 ounces Troy: was correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and currant for fiue shillings, or the said pound
was valued at 60 <abbr>s.</abbr> This <hi>Philip</hi> Doller weigheth 22
pennie weight, which is two pennie weight more
then an ounce, to answer our siluer by the more
weight of such siluer as is not so good as ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it containeth more allay or copper: so that
their inward value of siluer is made by weight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
and correspondent to ours. And so the
names for the price and value of the coine, were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12188:16"/>
alike; and the prices of commodities (both here
and beyond the seas) were likewise named accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
whereby all fallacies concerning the value
of moneys and the prices of commodities were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
and then Merchants (to accommodate one
another by exchange) would giue or deduct either
3 <abbr>d.</abbr> 4 <abbr>d.</abbr> or 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> or thereabouts vpon the pound of
our 20 <abbr>s.</abbr> or a pennie or two pence vpon the Noble
(wherupon exchanges were then commonly made)
to pay or receiue their moneys by exchange here or
beyond the seas, according as they could agree: in
so much, that 20 <abbr>s.</abbr> Starlin hath beene giuen here
to receiue beyond the seas 19 <abbr>s.</abbr> 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> Flemish by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.
And the like hath been giuen beyond seas,
to receiue here 20 <abbr>s</abbr> Starlin, according to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Merchants.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>equalitie</hi> or <hi>paritie</hi> of exchange, we are
fallen to very great <hi>inequalitie,</hi> by the inhauncing of
moneys beyond the Seas, whereby the price was
there altered in name or denomination, our moneys
remaining here at a stand; and the standards of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
both here and beyond the Seas also remaining
vnaltered, and so continued beyond the Seas vntill
this day, albeit they haue caused diuers new coines
of other standards to be made since that time,
which is to be obserued hereafter, the rather for that
it is a maxime, That the siluer coines doe rule the
markets in all places, because of the abundance
thereof,<note place="margin">Siluer coyne do rule the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</note> being 500 to one of gold, which causeth
the exchanges to be made according to the siluer
coines, which ouerruleth the coines of gold.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>inequalitie</hi> crept in by the inhauncing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12188:16"/>
of moneys, was vpon the <hi>Philip</hi> Doller, which was
come from 30 Stiuers or 5 <abbr>s,</abbr> as aforesaid, to 33 and
35 Stiuers; whereby the price of exchange began to
alter in the yeares of our Lord 1563 and 1564, which
then was looked into by the Merchants Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
according to the complaints of Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> their
Gouernour, and that made them to make exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
vpon our pound of 20 <abbr>s</abbr> Starlin at 22 <abbr>s.</abbr> 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> and
23 <abbr>s.</abbr> Afterwards in the yeare 1575, the said <hi>Philip</hi>
Doller went currant for 36 Stiuers, or 6 <abbr>s</abbr> Flemish,
which was inhaunced full twentie in the hundred,
or foure shillings vpon twentie shillings; whereby
the <hi>paritie</hi> of exchange was altered in name from 20
to 24, because that 24 <abbr>s</abbr> with them beyond the Seas
and our 20 <abbr>s</abbr> here was all one in value: so that 500 <abbr>l</abbr>
Starlin was correspondent or answerable to 600 <abbr>l</abbr>
Flemish, by reason of the said valuation, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
alteration of Standards. Before that time, that
is to say, in the yeare of our Lord 1567, the Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Rickx Doller was coined in the Empire for 32
Stiuers lups, or two Marks lubish, of 16 shillings the
Marke. So that then one shilling lubish and one Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<note place="margin">Shilling Lubish and Stiuers all one.</note>
was betweene Germanie and the Netherlands
all one in name; as we haue more amply declared
in <hi>Lex Mercatoria</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>position,</hi> let vs come now to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation
of our moneys in exchange by three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
and infallible meanes; and therein obserue the
progresse of valuation and the course of exchange,
for the maine places of Trade.</p>
               <p>First, by the Assayes of moneys made in former
times, and the calculations of exchanges made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12188:17"/>
upon, according to the prices or valuations of the
moneys inhaunced beyond the Seas, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunced
with vs in England.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Three meanes to proue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derualuation of our moneys in Exchange.</note> by true calculations deriued from the
said Assayes and inhauncing of forraine coines, as
also of our moneys beyond the Seas, which rule
cannot faile: so long as the Standards of the moneys
are not altered.</p>
               <p>Lastly, By the triall of Assayes both of our
moneys and the coines of forraine Countries lately
taken, concerning both the premises, by which
three meanes, any man of iudgement may perceiue
that the Exchange is the <hi>Publike meanes</hi> betweene
vs and other Countries already proued. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the first, it appeareth of record, that in the said
yeare 1575. there was (by order of the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
the Lords &amp; others of her Maiesties then
Priuy Councell of the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of

of sundry Countries, and the price of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
that is to say of the <hi>Positiue Exchange,</hi> was
set downe accordingly, whereof I haue made this
Abstract, for so much as maketh for the purpose.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Phillip Doller</hi> of 10. ounces fine at 36. Stiuers
or 6. <abbr>s.</abbr> Flemish, made the price of the said Exchange
24. <abbr>s.</abbr> as aforesaid, accounting 4 Dollers for the <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rickx Doller</hi> of 10. ounces 12. penny waight
at 32. shillings lubish or Stiuers Flemish made the

               <p>The <hi>Rickx Doller</hi> being inhaunced to 33. shillings
lubish, made the price of the said Exchange at one
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12188:17"/>
shilling more, vpon the 4. prices and a halfe to be at

did alter, and moneys were inhaunced by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissiue
times,</hi> by the warres and deuision of the
17. Prouinces.</p>
               <p>Come wee now to the yeare 1586. when <hi>Robert
Lord Dudley Earle of Leycester</hi> went ouer to take the
Gouernment of the <hi>Vnited Prouinces,</hi> at which time
moneys were much inhaunced, and the States did
coine the great siluer Royall of the goodnes of the
<hi>Phillip Doller,</hi> as also <hi>Rickx Dollers,</hi> in euery prouince
of the goodnes of the said <hi>Imperiall</hi> or <hi>Burgundian
Dollers,</hi> and the <hi>Arch Duke Albertus of Austria</hi> did
the like in the reconciled Countries vnder his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</p>
               <p>Hereupon there was Assayes made againe of the
said coynes and other moneys, and the goodnes of
them was by the said Assayes correspondent in
weight and finesse, and so the <hi>Positiue Exchange</hi> was
made accordingly vpon the valuation made in the
said Countries, namely the said <hi>Phillip Doller</hi> being
risen and valued at 50. Stiuers, or 8. <abbr>s.</abbr> 4. <abbr>d.</abbr> Flemish
made the said Exchange (by the said 4. peeces) to
be 33. <abbr>s.</abbr> 4. <abbr>d.</abbr> for 20. shillings Starlin: the said <hi>Rickx
Doller</hi> was valued at 45. Stiuers, or 7. <abbr>s.</abbr> 6. <abbr>d.</abbr> Flemish
made the Exchange to be after 4 peeces and a halfe
to the pound Starlin 33. <abbr>s.</abbr> 9. <abbr>d.</abbr> but because our shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
was valued at 20. <abbr>d.</abbr> Flemish, or 10 Stiuers,
whereof 20. <abbr>s.</abbr> made 33. <abbr>s.</abbr> 4. <abbr>d.</abbr> Flemish, it was agreed

by the Commissioners,<note place="margin">Exchange for the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at 83 s. 4 d.</note> that the <hi>Positiue Exchange</hi>

               <p>In the yeare 1600. (by a Commission granted to

taken concerning the goodnes and valuation
of moneys in exchange, and there ensued but an
alteration in the valuation of gold concerning the
proportion, with some small reformation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

was effected, for some reasons here not declared:
come wee now to this present time, and see how
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12188:18"/>
much the said moneys haue beene inhaunced,<note place="margin">Calculations vp on the last valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> not

               <p>There you shall finde that the <hi>Phillip Doller</hi> is

haue also done of other coynes: but the <hi>Rickx Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
of <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Nether-lands</hi> are inhaunced

which is iust one ninth part: take the ninth part of

               <p>Thus it appeareth vnto men euen of the meanest

by the precedent rules, maketh the price of this <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue

               <p>Now because we haue spoken of men of meane
capacity,<note place="margin">Inconueniences of the vnderua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of our. moneys.</note> and that I doe labour to expresse my selfe
in the plainest maner: I pray you, is there any man
liuing that will not conceiue, that this exceeding
great gaine had by exportation of our moneys, will
still depriue vs of our Treasure? And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that this great losse had by the importation
of money, doth still debarre vs from any to be
brought in? Againe, when greater gaine is giuen
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12188:22"/>
vpon the Spanish Royalls beyond the Seas, will
not the same be diuerted from vs and carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or if some be imported vpon occasion or by

and so take away the life of Trade, and cause the
<hi>Vitall Spirits</hi> thereof to languish? Surely all men
are able to vnderstand this, yet it shalbe made more
plainer.</p>
               <p>Thus may we obserue the <hi>Disgression and inequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
betweene the said moneys, which can neuer
(conueniently) be reducted to their first price and
equallity: I might likewise make instance of the

whereupon he would haue the Kings coine raised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

by vs declared were true (as true and manifest

that is to say, if moneys rise beyond the

whereby the said inhauncing of the Doller there,
and the price of Exchange doe iust concurre, and
there can be neither gaine nor losse. But the point
is, whether these 500. Dollers do containe so much

that for 381 Dollers deliuered there, there

might be recompenced and found to be correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
this consideration was very materiall, and
moneys were not then at all inhaunced at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
neither so much risen in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
whereupon it was thought conuenient to cast
vp the weekely price of exchanges one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to the Brokers Bills of the prices of

for certaine yeares) after 52 weekes for the yeare,
casting the <hi>Medium</hi> thereof, by certaine tables

               <p>In the managing whereof, wee are to make three
distinctions.</p>
               <p>The First, concerning the King and the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Gentlemen and Trauellers,<note place="margin">Three Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> who are here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerers

price of exchange is low, or foraine coyne is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunced
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12188:27"/>
or ouervalued in exchange vnto vs, as is
before declared in the first Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Second distinction concerneth particular
Merchants, who doe make a priuate benefit by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
and exchange to the preiudice of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
by a low exchange, and vndervaluation of
our moneys.</p>
               <p>The Third, concerneth the whole Kingdome in
generall, wherein the said perticular Merchants do
beare some losse vnawares, although they haue a
greater gaine by a disordered Trade another way,
to the vtter vndoing of all Trade, and destruction
of the Realme, which we are now to distinguish.</p>
               <p>It is demanded,<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> whether it be lawfull for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to seeke their <hi>Priuatum commodum</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their calling, whether gaine be not the end

and losse by the particular benefit of some,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and councell therefore in the reformation
of abuses of some priuate Merchants, is to be held
in suspition, and Kings and Princes are to sit at the

               <p>The gaines which are preiuditiall to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and beneficiall to some Merchants in
particular, are these as followeth.</p>
               <p>English Merchants (being here the takers of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by exchange) haue a great gaine when they
take the same at a low exchange,<note place="margin">Pernitious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</note> giuing lesse by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12188:28"/>
their Bill of exchange in forraine parts, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
maner beyond the Seas, in giuing Flemish or other
moneys there, to haue here Starlin money for it,
they being there commonly the deliuerers of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
so that a low price of exchange by the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation
of our moneys is profitable to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant:
and to maintaine this, it is inferred, that
merchant strangers would export more moneys out
of the Realme into forraine parts, if English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
did not take the said moneys by exchanges,
and that at a low price, whereby the English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
becommeth a gainer, and the Merchant stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a looser.</p>
               <p>Againe, if an equall exchange were vsed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Standards of moneys of other Nations
and ours: then could not English Merchants sell
our natiue Commodities so good cheape beyond
the Seas, to vndersell other Nations, casting their
calculations of buying and selling according to the
low price of exchange.</p>
               <p>Also, if the price of exchange were high beyond
the Seas: then the Spanish Merchants could not
make such gaine by the Royalls of 8 which they
transport thither, making returne of the proceede
of them by a low exchange, to their great benefit of
25 <hi>Per cento,</hi> where they can make here but ten vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hundreth.</p>
               <p>If the moneys were not inhaunced beyond the
Seas, Merchants could not sell our natiue commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at the prices they now do, and returne the value
thereof by a low exchange from thence, or taking
vp the same heere, giue so little by exchange there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:12188:28"/>
English Merchants buying here cloth vpon their
credits, and selling the same beyond the Seas, haue
a good gaine to returne their money by a low ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
to pay the seller of the Cloth with his
owne, &amp; so trading without stockes: are instruments
to sell the natiue Commodities of the Realme.</p>
               <p>If the exchange were not low vnder the value of
the Standard, Merchants could not make a great
benefit by taking vp moneys here (be he either
English or stranger) and transport the same to pay
their Bills of exchanges beyond the Seas, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
a great part of the money for their benefit,
neither could they buy forraine Commodities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas vpon long dayes of payment, and
transport money to pay the seller at the said times.</p>
               <p>All this is done by maintaining the vndervalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our moneys by a low exchange,<note place="margin">The Rule of iustice &amp; equity.</note> which must
be distinguished from the true rule of iustice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which requireth an equall valuation in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
or an aduantage ouer and aboue to acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
the course of Trafficque, and then it will
be found that the vnderualuation of moneys in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
is intollerable, and that this gaine procured
to the hurt of the Kingdome (although profitable
to particular Merchants) is to be abolished.</p>
               <p>The like is done by selling of our Cloth good
cheape beyond the Seas in greater quantity, when
Merchants haue beaten downe the price with the
Clothier, whereby the Clothier is forced to do the
like with the Woolegrower, which disimproueth
the reuinew of lands. But the Merchant imployeth
the lesser stocke, and hath not therefore the lesse
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12188:29"/>
benefit: the Woolegrower and the Clothier bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the losse, besides other priuate dealings of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,

of Trafficque, namely <hi>Commodities, Moneys,</hi> and

which ouerruleth the other two, whereby the
ouerballancing of forraine Commodities, with our
natiue Commodities in price is procured: and this
may be auoided and preuented by the contrary, if it

                     <p>Inconueniences arising to the Realme of England, by
the vnderualuation of our moneys in Exchanges
vpon the pound of xx. shillings for the maine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                  </argument>
                  <p>FIrst, when our moneys are vnderualued in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
whereby there ariseth a gaine betweene
the inward value of the moneys and the price of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change:
then are our moneys continually expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into forraine parts, for the like gaine can neuer
be made by any Commodity.</p>
                  <p>2 This exportation of money, causeth not onely
the lesse moneys to be employed vpon our natiue
Commodities, and returneth in forraine wares, but
taketh away also the <hi>Vitall spirit of Trafficque,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12188:29"/>
a great cause of ouerballancing of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities.</p>
                  <p>3 The said vndervaluation of our moneys in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
doth the like, and causeth our natiue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
to be sold better cheape beyond the Seas,
for want of knowledge of the true value of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
and theirs: euen as the inhauncing of forraine
coyne beyond the Seas, caused the forraine wares to
be aduanced in price, according as the said money
is inhaunced, whereby the said ouerballancing must
needes come to passe of course.</p>
                  <p>4 It doth hinder the importation of <hi>Bullion</hi> and
Dollers from the said places of Trade, which wee
haue had in times past: for the said inhauncing
coyne not being truly valued by exchange, cannot
be imported but to an exceeding losse, and Merchant
strangers will not take the same at a low exchange,
so that our Merchants are compelled to make their
returnes by forraine Commodities, thereby greatly
increasing the said ouerballancing of Trade.</p>
                  <p>5 Young English Merchants are constrained to
take vp a great part of the said money at a low ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
to maintaine their rechanges to their losse,
or else must make quick sales of their commodities,
whereby they spoile the markets of others, which
causeth them to set ouer their bills obligatory (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
for their Clothes sold there) either for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to pay the money taken vp heere by exchange,
or for forraine Commodities at deere rates by the
said inhaunced moneys and otherwise, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but breed an ouerballancing of Commodities.</p>
                  <p>6 The said low exchange (whereby the Spanish
Merchants make a diuersion of the Royalls of 8 vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12188:30"/>

can make ouer their moneys by a low exchange

as are made there vpon forraine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
as <hi>Bayes, Sayes,</hi> and other new Draperies
made in those parts, which might be employed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Commodities, and can this negotiation be
without argumenting of the said ouerballancing?</p>
                  <p>7 If by occasion or accident moneys or Bullion
is impotted: (which might be carried to the Mint,
and the moneys made thereof would be deliuered
by exchange to our Merchants, and so by them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
vpon our Commodities, if the said were
high or indiffetent:) it falleth out, that the said
moneys or Bullion are exported againe by other
Merchants, which bring in forraine wares for it,
<hi>for gaine still beareth the sway.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by buying forraine commodities (as it were)
by forcible meanes of course, by reason of the said
vndervaluation of our moneys by exchange: and
selling our natiue Commodities by a false measure
of exchange to our losse,<note place="margin">The causes of ouerballancing and decay of Trade.</note> at the pleasures of other

of our <hi>Center</hi> doth direct vs in the very nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
and nothing can be directed vnto vs by this
Ballance without the said <hi>Center?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vncertainty of this Ballance doth consist of
many particulars, whereby it is so farre from vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as conclusion is from order.</p>
                  <p>First. This Ballance cannot be certainly prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by one yeares time,<note place="margin">The vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Realme.</note> or any certaine or limited
time, for sometimes (and that vnexpected) some
East <hi>India</hi> Ship or other rich lading may come in,
or the Spices and other goods already come in, and
to be exported, are not carried out, when the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Ballance is made.</p>
                  <p>Secondly for moneys secretly exported: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
in Commodities may be yet to come, or if it
be for gaine had by intrest money or exchanges, it
neede neuer to returne for the Merchant stranger:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12188:34"/>
as also for moneys taken vp by exchange to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
vpon Commodities and other meanes
whereof the Ballance cannot be sensible, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to be Ballanced.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The profit made vpon our natiue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
as also for the forraine Commodities and
the charges is incertaine, both in the exportation of
the one, and the importation of the other, which he
bringeth vpon the Ballance by estimate, and is
meerely coniecturall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The forraine Commodities are not
vnderrated by one third part in the Custome
Bookes, in comparison of our natiue Commodities.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, The fine goods secretly conueyed inwards
more then outwards, by one hundreth thousand
pounds yearely, is but a supposition.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, The payment of Customes being vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and the concealing of Custome comming to
be twenty for one in the calculation, maketh the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
to be most incertaine.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly and lastly, There may be so much
gotten by Commodities exported &amp; retransported,
and for that gaine forraine Commodities brought
in, that it may seeme to be an ouerballance, when
it is not.</p>
                  <p>The premises considered, what <hi>Center</hi> is there in
this Ballance? is it not like vnto those great <hi>Balloons,</hi>
that men play with all fild with wind? for there is
not any sollid substance,<note place="margin">P. 126.</note> but all is coniecturall and
immaginary, neither is it practised by other Princes
and Countries, as he vntruly alleadgeth. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes and States are carefull to augment
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12188:35"/>
Trade, by increasing of their Manifactures, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

they get by Commodities, so doe they also by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
and exchanges, which cannot but preuent the
ouerballancing.</p>
                  <p>We all agree that there is an ouerballance, which
must be remeded by the redresse of the causes, and
not by the study of Ballances, which demonstrate
little in truth and certainty, but much in imagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Experience (as I haue said) maketh a full answer,<note place="margin">3. Answ.</note>
that as there wanted no takers of money, when the

which is farre more then the intended reformation,

Cloth: for if there were sale for duble the quantity
then, when Cloth was sold dearer by full one third

Nations are as willing to buy the same, as they are
willing to vent their Commodities vnto vs: and it

doe manifest, the taker will be ruled by
the deliuerer. For albeit that Trade requireth a
naturall liberty, (which in no Countrey is so much
restrained as in England) yet <hi>Gaine</hi> the true <hi>Center</hi>
doth ouerrule all (as it were) by a voluntary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

that therefore there would be Takers at the <hi>Par

doth not vnderstand the case,<note place="margin">P. 114.</note> for the Takers did not
gaine, neither did the deliuerer loose (as he saith)
by the fast rising of exchange at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> onely
he that was to take vp money backe againe to pay
his Bills of exchanges taken vpon him, might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

That he vnderstandeth not himselfe in the <hi>Par of

also by his inferrence, <hi>That it may proue also another
bar to Trade, and cause the Cloth Trade both in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier

and cheaper to the stranger by how much the naturall
course should be altered in exchange, when it should be

which is <hi>a sentence</hi> containing <hi>many sentences,</hi> when
the ouerballance is the decay of Trade.</p>
                  <p>To speake ingeniously, can the making of a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
cause moneys and Bullion to be brought in, or
hinder the transportation of moneys? or can the
calculation of the said Ballance procure that our
natiue Commodities exported, shall surmount in
price and quantity the forraine Commodities
brought in. And lastly, can the said Ballance bring
to passe that Spanish Royalls of 8 (now diuerted
from vs) shall be imported, and when the said Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
and Dollers are brought in, that they shall not
be carried out againe, but be brought to the Mint:
as the said <hi>Center (Gaine)</hi> will doe by the true course
of exchange, to the enriching of the Realme, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12188:38"/>
preuention of ouerballancing?</p>
                  <p>Questionles it cannot, for the end of the Ballance
(by his owne confession) is last in place, but first
and chiefest in purpose,<note place="margin">P. 130.</note> or in the beginning, which
is nothing else but to make a triall of things past: so
that put this <hi>Circle of Commerce</hi> into the <hi>Seals</hi> of the
Ballance, and lay a feather against it, and it will
weigh downe the same.</p>
                  <p>But some will say: Why doe you expostulate or
make inquiry of the end of this Ballance,<note place="margin">P. 132.</note> hath not
he contracted all the causes of our vnderballance
in two words? <hi>Pouerty</hi> and <hi>Prodigallity</hi> grounded
vpon <hi>Idlenesse</hi> and <hi>Excesse;</hi> and therein vsed such a

may be knowne without such a <hi>Ballance,</hi> and <hi>Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and want is not without feeling, neither ought

of moneys to heauen is lawfull, by charitable
giuing to the poore, which God himselfe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to reward, although men were neuer so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull.</p>
                  <p>Here (according to <hi>Misseldens</hi> maner) I haue
occasion offered me, to make a very ample discourse
concerning his presumption aboue the wisedome
of the City of London, his vncharitable dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to preuent tenne thousand pounds yearely cast
away to the poore, and his peremptory and absolute
conclusion in the gouernment of State-affaires,
wherein he is a meere nouice. But my intention is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12188:38"/>
to be briefe and substantiall.</p>
                  <p>To end therefore this matter of Ballance, it may
be thought strange that some men would be sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thereby,<note place="margin">Discourse of the East India Trade, by <hi>T. M.</hi> P. 49. 52.</note> and giue bridle to the present course of
Trade, expecting an ouerballance to happen on our
side without remouing of the causes, after they had
spoken well concerning exchanges: although they
confessed to be a ground, as a matter much too
high for their handling: saying, <hi>That the abuse
thereof is very preiuditiall vnto this Kingdome in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
whilst in the interim the benefits doe arise vnto
other Countries, who diligently obseruing the prices,
whereby the moneys be exchanged, may take aduantage
to carry away the gold and siluer of this Realme, at those
times when the rate of our Starlin money (in exchange)
is vnder the value of that standard, vnto which place
they are conueyed, for in respect the prices of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes
doe rise and fall according to the plenty and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of money, which is to be taken vp or deliuered out:
the exchange is hereby rather become a Trade for some
great moneyed men, then a furtherance and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Recall Trade of Merchants, as it ought to be in
the true vse thereof: and thus many times money may
be made ouer hither by strangers to a good gaine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
carried beyond the Seas to a second profit. And
yet the mischiefe ends not here: for by these meanes the
Takers vp of money in forraine Countries must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
driue a Trade to those places from whence they draw
their moneys and so do fill vs vp with forraine Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without the vent of our owne Wares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> And thus
wee see how the ouerballance of Commodities is
proceeding from the abuse of exchanges, which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12188:39"/>
ouerrule moneys, and moneys ouerrule Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as heretofore is manifestly declared.</p>
                  <p>That the vnderualuation of our moneys in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
is the <hi>efficient cause</hi> of the ouerballancing of
Trade,<note place="margin">Vnderualuation of our moneys inexchange is the efficient cause of the ouerballancing.</note> doth appeare vpon the consideration of the
causes depending one vpon another, inforced by
this <hi>Primum-Mobill,</hi> as followeth.</p>
                  <p>1. The vnderualuation of our moneys in exchange,
2. proceeding of the inhauncing of moneys beyond
the Seas, which causeth 3. (by gaine) the transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our moneys, 4. and debarred (by losse to
be sustained) the importation of moneys and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
5. hindreth also the bringing of Royalls of 8.
vnto vs, being otherwise diuerred. 6. The forraine
Commodities are risen in price according to the
moneys inhaunced. 7. The natiue Commodities
are in price vndervalued according to the vnderva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation
of our moneys, all which are feareful effects.
For the treasure is exhaunced, the Realme impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
and money is made a Merchandise. And this
cannot be cured but by the contrary, as shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the remedies.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto wee haue obserued and manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
First, That exchange is the publike measure
betweene England, and all places where wee deale
by exchange. Secondly, That the moneys of the
Realme are vndervalued in exchange betweene vs
and other Countries. And thirdly, That <hi>Gaine</hi> is
the <hi>Center of the Circle of Commerce,</hi> and that the said

King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, did constitute diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes<note place="margin">9. E. 3. 7.</note>

               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight being come to <hi>Callice,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>Arch-dutches</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> then gouernor of the

               <p>The Dutchesse dispatched <hi>Thomas Gramay</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

and the harme and losse should be so great,
that it were imposible to esteeme it: for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant

Nobles, by which meanes the Countrey and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of the same should be totally consumed, spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and destroyed, which would turne to a domage
inestimable.</p>
               <p>The like is affirmed to ensue by the tolleration of
our English siluer moneys to be ouer valued,<note place="margin">Gaine is still the Center.</note> because
all Merchants for their gaine would carry into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
not onely the materialls of siluer, but also pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
coyned, wherby the entercourse of Merchandise
should cease, and the Merchants should become
Merchants of siluer, without selling any other ware
or Merchandise.</p>
               <p>Furthermore she pleaded, that neuer any Prince
would permit strange money to passe higher then
his owne, but that of custome they vse the contrary.</p>
               <p>And which is most effectuall, she vrged that the
ordinances of the Mints for the benefit of the Prince
and his Subiects, ought euer to be kept of good
policy for a Law, firme and stable, forasmuch the
meanes of Princes and of Noblemen, together with
the rents, fees, and wages of all his Subiects are
taxed and valued, and all Merchandise ruled and
gouerned thereby: wherefore without great neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
or evident vtility, no alteration ought to be
made in the price of moneys.</p>
               <p>Vpon this remoustrance, the Arch-Dutchesse
Commissioners &amp; the Mint-masters of the Tower
made assayes of all English and Flemish coynes, and
after long disputing and wrangling, the King could
neuer obtaine to haue his coyne passe at an halfe
penny aboue the true value.</p>

hee seemes by his winsing to be somewhat

of <hi>a wilde goose chace,</hi> but <hi>the wilde goose race</hi>
is his owne. Wherefore I will leaue him, and follow
the chace, as he pursueth the forenamed supposed

as he hath named them, but that according to
the maner of <hi>wilde goose chace,</hi> he hauing got the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I must follow, and that within distance. And
first he leades me into a defence of that that I said,
<hi>the Merchants Aduenturers had ingrossed into their
hands by colour of their last Letters pattents, the sole
power of exporting cloth, &amp;c.</hi> this he saith <hi>is but my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of speech,</hi> and so he endeuours to refute it by
extenuating (as it were) his Maiesties fauor towards
them in point of exportation. For saith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 53.
<hi>in point of exportation of white and coloured clothes,
kersies, bayes, sayes, and other new draperies, there is no
more power giuen them in the said later, then his Maiesty
and his royall Predecessors haue honored them with in

and begins but in the eighth yeare of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12188:49"/>
by which he saith the aforesaid trade of cloth, &amp;c.
<hi>was intrusted vnto them.</hi> Let that be taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and it will plainly appeare that they haue no
priuiledge at all in this behalfe, but onely power to
assemble themselues to chuse a Gouerner to rectifie
their owne abuses, and by way of iustice to punish
one another for their misdemeanours; and to that
purpose that foresaid grant was made vnto them,<note place="margin">Power of the Merchants Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wherein one <hi>William Oueray</hi> was assigned to be their
Gouerner, as by the said Letters pattents at large
appeareth. And of this power and priuiledge, all
Merchants and Mariners of England, Ireland and
Wales are to be equally partakers without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
limitation or difference of person, countrey or
commoditie. And whatsoeuer freedome of trade
into the parts therein expressed, his Maiesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
are now barred of, is meerly vsurped. And
if you aske me, what meanes he then to mention
such large grants of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. and other succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Kings, with new titles and priuiledges granted
vnto them, and that with prohibition of all other,
as he relates? I answer, this man either hath not seen
or not vnderstood the main of this matter, but hath
dealt in it either ignorantly or concealedly: for the
making plaine whereof, let vs obserue, that in that
time of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4. (which he mentioneth to be the
beginning of the Merchants Adventurers) there
was then,<note place="margin">The antiquitie of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Staple.</note> and long before that time setled (both in
England and beyond the Seas) another famous So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
of English Merchants, called the Merchants
of the Staple, as by sundry ancient records hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
specified appeareth; these were the Merchants
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12188:49"/>
then entrusted with the trade of exporting the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
commodities of the kingdome, whereof Wooll
and cloth were the chiefe, which they exported in
such abundance, that they being trusted by the State
to collect the Kings Customes amongst themselues,
they haue paid out of the Staple into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
68 thousand pounds starling <hi>per annum,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by record of 36 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. at which time
an ounce of siluer was valued but at 30 <abbr>d.</abbr> which is
now 5 <abbr>s</abbr> being iust double the said summe in value,
or 136 thousand pounds. These were the Merchants
that (before cloth was made in England) exported
the materials of this Land, as Wooll, Lead, Tin, &amp;c.
and returned for the same Gold or siluer, either coin
or bullion; and to that purpose they made worthy
lawes and ordinances amongst themselues, still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
to which euery Merchant of that Societie was
sworne, and they did likewise giue good bond to
the Maior of the Staple (before their goods were
suffered to passe) that they should not barter away
the Staple co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of the kingdome, but should
returne a great proportion (if not the whole value)
in coine or bullion, whereby this kingdome was
at all times made rich and potent. And vnder these
Merchants, trade was so managed, that cloth making
began in England; and they exported cloth before
the Merchants Aduenturers or the Leidges their
predecessors had a name or being. And if you aske,
how then came those Leidges and these Merchants
Aduenturers to ship cloth, not being free of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
I answer, that the purpose of the State was
then so bent to cherish the manufacture of cloth,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12188:50"/>
that there was libertie giuen to all sorts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Mariners (subiects of this Realme) for
the exportation thereof. And though it was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Staple commoditie, and exported by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the Staple, yet other Merchants were
likewise permitted to export the same, though they
did not at all times returne coine and bullion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the lawes of the Staple; whereupon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Merchants and Mariners of <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and
<hi>Wales,</hi> not free of the Staple, did trade with English
cloth in forrein parts: and then finding themselues
encombred with many euils (which proceeded from
want of gouernment) some of them procured of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. the aforesaid Letters pattents,
granted (as before obserued) to all the Kings Leid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
trading beyond the Seas, into <hi>Holland, Zeland,
Brabant,</hi> and other Countries in amitie with this
Kingdome. This was the first originall and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the now Merchants Aduenturers, and from
that their beginning, there was not any other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
priuiledge or proprietie of trade, or any other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or addition giuen vnto them, but a meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that first grant (as appeareth by <hi>Missel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
his owne booke) vntill the xx. yeare of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.
when (saith he) they were honoured with the title
of Merchants, and had power giuen them to keepe
their Courts at <hi>Callis.</hi> Herein he dealeth reseruedly;
for though he sets forth the truth, yet he sets not
forth the whole truth; and that which he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
is the chiefe direction of that which he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
He sets forth their authoritie to keepe their
Courts in their Towne of <hi>Callis,</hi> but he conceales
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12188:50"/>
two matters of consequence contained in their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
pattents, viz an Exception and a Command:<note place="margin">An exception &amp; a command of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers grant.</note>
the Exception, that if in their Courts they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

royall or prerogatiue of the King, or to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution

the Haunce of ten marks sterling, according to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

within the time of our reigne, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And no maruel though he conceale it, for that the
practise of the Merchants Aduenturers is so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnto it: for, to say nothing of their orders, but of

of their persons, and seizing their goods, and other

notwithstanding that some great ones (whom I

and written in some of their behalfes.</p>
                  <p>Now to proceed according to his booke. From
this time the Merchants Aduenturers continued
without any other addition or alteration vntill the
sixt yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 34.</note> at which time (saith
he) they were inscribed by the name of Merchants
Aduenturers of England, and had authoritie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their gouernment within this Kingdome;
wherein is to be obserued, that the power and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
giuen them by their former grants, was but
for their gouernment and vse in forreine parts,
wherin such abuse was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were at two
seuerall times greatly complained of in Parliament,
in the 36. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. for interrupting of the Staplers,
and in the 12. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. for disturbing of other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Merchants, vnder pretence of a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
that they seemed to haue to S. <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi>
for redresse whereof there were at the same times
two worthy and memorable lawes made, that are
yet in force, wherein there is a large expression of
the complaints and remedies. And whereas he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
that in the 28. of Queene <hi>Eliz.</hi> these Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Aduenturers had a new grant for enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their trade into <hi>Germanie,</hi> with prohibition
of all other her Maiesties subiects not free of their
said Fellowship, to trade into any of their priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
places, which (he saith) he hath not by heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,
but by his owne collection. I wish he had made
a true collection, and expressed the especiall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that nothing therein contained should any way
impeach or preiudice the Maior, Constables or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
of the Merchants of the Staple, but that they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12188:51"/>
and euery particular brother of that Companie
should and might vse their trade and priuiledges, as
formerly they had done, &amp;c. And at that same time
the Merchants of the Staple had as free trade and
large priuiledges in the Low Countries and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
as the Merchants Aduenturers. And in his reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
of the Letters patents made vnto the Merchants
Aduenturers by his Maiestie, he continueth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
course, setting forth the tenor of the grant to
the vtmost, but not a word of the limitation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
For it likewise pleased his Highnesse into
those Letters patents granted vnto the Merchants
Aduenturers in the xv. yeare of his reigne, to insert
a most gracious prouiso and large exception for the
Merchants of the Staple. The prouiso followeth
<hi>in haec verba,</hi> viz. <hi>Prouided alwayes, that these our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
patents, or any thing in them contained, shall not in
any wise be preiudiciall or hurtfull to the Maior, Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Fellowship of Merchants of the Staple of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
or to their successors, or to any particular Fellow
of the said Fellowship that now is or hereafter shall be,
but that they and euery of them shall and may haue and
enioy all and euery such grants, liberties and priuiledges
as heretofore haue bin granted vnto them by Vs or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our progenitors or predecessors as they or any of them
haue lawfully vsed or had, in as large and ample maner
and forme as they or any of them might or ought to haue
had or enioyed before the date of these presents, any
clause, article or restraint in these patents contained to
the contrary notwithstanding.</hi> If they obiect that this
prouiso was in respect of the trade of wooll, and not
of cloth. I answer, that cannot be so: for that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12188:52"/>
by his publique Proclamation had forbidden
all exportation of Wooll three yeares before; so that
there was nothing to be reserued to the Merchants
of the Staple by this prouiso, but their trade of
cloth. And whereas he saith, that the Merchants
of the Staple neuer shipped any clothes at any time
as Staplers, but as Merchants Aduenturers. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that the Merchants of the Staple in their notes
aforesaid, exhibited to the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the last Session, did set forth that they had
vsed the trade of shipping cloth before the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Aduenturers or the Leidgers their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
had a name or being, as is before recited: and
that they afterward exercised the same trade into
the same Countries together with the said Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Aduenturers, as they affirmed they could
proue by Indentures of composition made betwixt
the said two Companies. They likewise signified,
that they haue had their trade of exporting all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
commodities, whereof cloth was one, continued
and confirmed vnto them by sundry Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
viz. in the 27. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and likewise in the
36. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. together with many other in the times
of succeeding Princes, and also by diuers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
the gracious Letters patents of <hi>Edw. 2. Edw. 3.
Ric. 2. Hen. 4. Hen. 5. Hen. 6. Edw. 4. Hen. 7. Hen. 8.

been effectually confirmed vnto them by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

                  <p>Vpon these, together with many other weighty
reasons concerning the conueniences and profit of
this State, then tendered to their graue considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the said house of Commons did passe a Bill for
them, intituled. <hi>An Act restoring the Free Trade of
the Merchants of the Staple, for the exportation of Cloth,
and all other Manufactures made of Wooll in the parts
beyond the Seas;</hi> as by the said Bill appeareth: so
that whereas out of false premises <hi>Misselden</hi> makes
this conclusion, whereby it is manifest saith he, that
the Cloth and other the Manufactures of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
haue with the fauour of the State, beene
conferred vpon the Merchants Aduenturers: not
onely by their last Letters Patents, but by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
former grants before recited. I answer, That
by this reply it is most apparant, that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12188:54"/>
Aduenturers from their first Grant, made in
the eight of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4, vnto the last Grant
made vnto them in the fifteenth yeare of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie:
they neuer had any propriety or trust of
Trade committed to them, but with exceptions
and limitations as is before expressed. And it is
also most manifest that the Merchants of the Staple
might, and did from time to time Ship Cloth in
their owne right into <hi>Holland, &amp;c:</hi> as Staplers, and
not as Merchants Aduenturers: wherefore the
power which the Merchants Aduenturers now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
vnto themselues, to restraine the Merchants
of the Staple from Trading with Cloth, as formerly
they haue done, and the practise which they vse, to
keepe out other Merchants being Subiects of his
Maiestie from being free of their Company, is
meerely by collour, and not by virtue of any of
their Grants or Letters Patents whatsoeuer: and
hereby <hi>Misselden</hi> may vnderstand what the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is:<note place="margin">P. 70.</note> betweene <hi>Authority and the Princes Letters
Patents,</hi> and find cause not to maruell, but to wonder
at his exception.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he hath put another glosse,<note place="margin">P. 56.</note> saying:
the Merchants of the Staple may Ship Cloth still,
such of them as are free of the Merchants Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,
whereof (saith he) there are many. I answer,
That of all the Merchants Aduentuers that are
now Traders in Cloth, there are but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely three of
them free men of the Staple.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre haue I followed him in his chace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Merchants of the Staple. And now I finde
him persuing another of his supposed aduersaries
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12188:54"/>
viz. the Merchant Stranger,<note place="margin">Concernin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Strangers.</note> and their losse or the
lessening of their Trade he would salue with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
of Cloth dressed and vndressed, affirming
that the Merchant Stranger could neuer ship Cloth
vndrest, by reason of certaine Statutes made against
it: and for Cloth dressed, and other Manufactures
he saith, they may ship them still paying Strangers
Custome, and <hi>perhaps</hi> better cheape also. This point
I thinke, and especially the (<hi>perhaps</hi>) is worth the
examining. It is true that there are Statutes against
shipping Cloth vndressed aboue a certaine value,
but there haue beene euer or for the most part
meanes to dispence with the said Satutes, as the
Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> his Lycence, and others of that
kinde, for which busines there hath beene vsually
heretofore an Officer in the Custome House ready
to admit composition with Strangers aswell as with
others, and so the Strangers paying Strangers Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
might ship Cloth vndressed aswell as the
Merchants Aduenturers: but now the Merchants
Aduenturers haue ingrossed the foresaid dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into their owne hands, so that the Strangers are
now preuented of shipping Cloth vndrest, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they haue done: by reason whereof, one
other meanes whereby great quantities of Cloth
haue beene heretofore vented, and the prices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
aduanced, is by the Merchants Aduenturers
wholly intercepted.</p>
                  <p>But now come to the (<hi>Perhaps</hi>) the Merchants
Strangers may now ship dressed Clothes, Karsies,
and all other new Draperies, paying Strangers
Custome: and (<hi>Perhaps</hi>) better cheape saith he;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12188:55"/>
How may this better cheape be? I answer, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he may compound with some Merchant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturer
for the vse of his name, viz. to enter the
Strangers goodes in the Merchant his name, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a certaine rate vpon euery parcell of goods, as
vpon euery Karsey, Bay, Say, Parpetuana, and
likewise vpon euery dozen of Stockings, which
composition being paid, the Stranger shall ship his
goods for English Custome. And for proofe that
this is so, I referre my selfe to the Blanck Bills lately
shewed forth in Parliament by certaine Merchants
of London, with the Seale of the Merchants Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers
fixed, and their Deputie his name also
subscribed: into which Bills being left blanck for
the purpose, the goods of any other English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
not free of their Company might be entred
without enquiry whether he were <hi>Probatae fidei,</hi> or
an Interlooper, a Nouice, or a new Merchant, that
for want of experience might betray the Trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of Strangers; and if any Strangers
goods of any value whatsoeuer might haue beene
entred in the said blanck Bills, and so shipped forth
vpon English Custome, I leaue to <hi>Misseldens</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
being not desirous to informe.</p>
                  <p>The third sort of those that he would chase out
of trade, he calleth <hi>Interlopers.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers.</note> This word of <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping</hi>
is a Brat of their owne breed: for such of their
Companie as will not obserue the shippings and
Mart Townes appointed by their orders, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay
ouer goods in other ships and to other places,
are vsually punished for <hi>interloping,</hi> and hence comes
this terme of <hi>Interloper:</hi> but hauing worne it thrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12188:55"/>
amongst themselues, they now put it as a note
of ignominie vpon all other English Merchants not
free of their Companie, if they haue any trade into
their territories, whether they be Merchants of the
Staple, or any other English Merchants residing in
London or any other the ports of this Realme,
whereof there haue been heretofore so many as
haue vsually shipped forth most part of the colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
clothes, kersies, and all other new Draperies of
the kingdome. For vntil the 15 yeare of his Maiesty,
that the Merchants Aduenturers obtained their
new Letters patents, other English Merchants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
and continually traded therein as well as the
Merchants Aduenturers, as may appeare by the
manifold entries daily made in al the Custom-books
of this Kingdom; for which purpose the Merchants
Aduenturers in their former Grants (as is before
obserued) procured this clause to be inserted, viz.
<hi>That other English Merchants that should trade into
their territories, might be compelled to obserue the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Aduenturers orders;</hi> whereby it appeares plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that though the Merchants Aduenturers haue
procured a free licence of exporting certaine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of white clothes to themselues (<hi>non obstante</hi>)
the Statutes, yet the State neuer intended that they
should also ingrosse the whole trade of all coloured
clothes, kersies, bayes, and other new Draperies into
their hands, to the vtter ruine and wearing out of
all other Merchants that traded therein as now the
Merchants Aduenturers would haue it. For they
now challenge an absolute power and proprietie of
trade into those parts, with all the foresaid English
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12188:56"/>
manufactures, and seek to exclude all other English
Merchants from that trade, vnder this terme of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlopers:</hi>
and haue of late (as aforesaid) brought so
many vexations vpon them, that most of them are
now constrained either to steale trade by secret
means, to the preiudice of themselues and the trade
of the kingdome, or else they must learne to trade
by <hi>Misseldens perhaps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last sort of those that trouble him, are the
Ports,<note place="margin">Of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Ports.</note> that is to say, all the Merchants of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

                  <argument>
                     <p>The second Assertion therefore is,<note place="margin">2. Assertion.</note> that this imaginary
blessing arising by the intended employment to be
made in Silkes and Indico, is mistaken, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Realme: especially if the Manufactures
of Silke be increased in derogation of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture

                  </argument>
                  <p>BVt some affectioned East India Merchant will
say, that the generall account aforesaid to make
fiue and one third part for one, is a great matter of
benefit towards custome, charges, and all other
things incident to trade. For the Author doth say,
that 10 <abbr>s.</abbr>
                     <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> employed in <hi>Pepper</hi> in the East Indies,
will require but 35 <hi>s.</hi> for all charges whatsoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
in London, which is 3 <hi rend="sup">•2</hi>. for one.</p>
                  <p>This Merchant cannot inforce his argument for
want of a true iudgement; for he might haue made
a better conclusion, to say <hi>Pepper</hi> doth cost but 2 <abbr>d</abbr> ½
the pound, and is sold for 20 <abbr>d.</abbr> which is 8 for one, as
aforesaid. And if with all charges in London it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
but to 3 ½, then the benefit of 4 ½ for one is an
admirable gaine to inrich himselfe and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth.</p>
                  <p>This iudgement vpon a particular, seemeth to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12188:59"/>
proue a far greater gaine then the abouesaid gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
gaine of 5 ⅓ for one. But to find out the truth,
there must be a nearer calculation made, by a true
distinction of the managing of the Stock remaining
at home, which was neuer adventured, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
stock of moneys and commodities sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Indies, and what both these did amount vnto.
Next, if the goods taken from the Indians and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals
be comprehended in the said returne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the said sum of 1914 thousand 600 <abbr>l</abbr> was made,
then the case is altered, and wil not produce the one
halfe. Lastly, the building and repairing of Ships,
Wharfes, houses, magazins, and the like emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the stocke at home, together with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
of Officers, Mariners, and seruants wages,
will come to an incredible summe.</p>
                  <p>But let vs come to the generall consideration of
this Trade, respecting the weale publicke, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the same to the former trade maintained by
the Portugals along the Cape of Good Hope; which
is more proper then to compare the same to the
trade betweene vs and <hi>Turkie</hi> and the said East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
for the trade of <hi>Portugall</hi> made the Merchants
trading <hi>Turkie,</hi> to sell the Spices brought from <hi>Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po</hi>
to losse, because the Camels back could not passe
the needles eye, without great charges &amp; difficulty:
neuerthelesse that trade was very profitable to the
kingdome,<note place="margin">The Trade for Turkey.</note> selling our kersies, broad-clothes, tinne,
and many other our natiue commodities with 60
<hi>pro cento</hi> gaine; and there is far more to be gotten
by raw silkes bought at <hi>Aleppo</hi> at 12 <abbr>s</abbr> the pound,
then to be brought from the East Indies at 8 <abbr>s</abbr> the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12188:60"/>
pound, which is the difference which the said An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
maketh, ascribing such happinesse to the trade
of silke, whom <hi>Misselden</hi> doth imitate.</p>
                  <p>I may affirme by experience, that before the open
warres with Spaine, the trade of Portugall and the
Ilands was very profitable to the Realme:<note place="margin">The Trade for Portugall and the Ilands.</note> for wee
made an ordinary gaine of 25 vpon the hundred,
by Bayes, Sayes, Reding and Kentish clothes, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
and Westerne kersies, stockings, and diuers
other commodities: and the debts being turned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to the Contraction house, returne was made in
Spices and Sugar in lesse then six months time, with
little aduenture, fraught and charges, whereby the
manufactures of the kingdome were aduanced, and
moneys from time to time imported; and the life of
Trade was felt by Merchants; Trades-men and
the Mint did flourish: so that for matter of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
there is no comparison in the sale of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Portugal</hi> with 25 <hi>pro cento</hi> in lesse then 6 months,
and 22 <hi>pro cento</hi> for the East Indies in 3 yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the aduenture of the Seas and enemies. And it
will be proued, that the natiue commodities of the
Realme vented in Portugal and Spaine before the
East India trade began, did amount to 300 thousand
pounds worth more then since euery yeare, which
is more then all the domestique and forreine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
come vnto, sent into the East Indies by the
Companie those 20 yeares, to say nothing of the
mortalitie of men and destruction of ships. And
from Spaine we had the West India commodities,<note place="margin">The Trade for Spaine.</note>

by the emploiment of Tobacco.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now examine the price of Spices in those
dayes within the Realme, and we shall finde that
Pepper was sold for 2 <abbr>s</abbr> the pound, Cloues 6 <abbr>s,</abbr> Mace
7 <abbr>s,</abbr> Nutmegs 3 <abbr>s,</abbr> and Indico 6 <abbr>s;</abbr> which small diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc

may be declared by the proportion set down

But the said Author doth set downe the prices as
they were in the time of warres, when Merchants
charges,<note place="margin">P. 45.</note> aduenture and all things were increased;
and herein he maketh his comparison with <hi>Turkie,</hi>

that the trade in Spice and Indico onely, saueth the

then one quarter of this summe shall buy in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

of Cloues, 20 thousand of Mace, 160 thousand

calculated by the prices of them, as they were sold
coming from <hi>Portugal,</hi> wil amount to 128 thousand

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw if vpon the matter we do consider the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
and Impost, the Factors, Officers and

increase, but with the great decrease of the
Kingdomes stocke.</p>
                  <p>But to proue that the said accounts are made at
random,<note place="margin">P. 27.</note> rouing at the matter, let vs consider of the
proportion made by him of 100 thousand pounds
in ready money to be employed yearely, whereof
there are 52499 <abbr>l</abbr> in raw silks and Callicoes, and but
47501 <abbr>l</abbr> in Spices and Indico, which should produce
500 thousand pounds or thereabouts: he doth allot
120 thousand pounds to England, and 380 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds for transportation; and of this 120
thousand pounds there is 108333<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 6. 8. in Spices
and Indico named in the sequel of his discourse,
which is now become one third part of all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Indico to be brought in by the emploiment
of the said 100 thousand pounds, amounting to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12188:62"/>
337083 <abbr>l.</abbr> 6. 8. Now if we take the like proportion
of raw silks &amp; Callicoes of 162916. 13. 4. to make vp
the said 500 thousand pounds, which is one third,
it will amount to 54305 <abbr>l.</abbr> 6. 8. which with the
108333 <abbr>l</abbr>⅓, maketh 162638 <abbr>l.</abbr> 13. 4. which is
42638 <abbr>l.</abbr> 13. 4. more then hee hath allotted to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to be spent in a yeare; which is a manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p>The consideration hereof caused some Merchants
of that Companie to be as craftie as <hi>Aesops</hi> Fox, who
being desirous to drinke, found a Well with two
buckets, and entring into one of the buckets, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
suddenly into the water; but hauing satia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his thirst, could not get out, vntill one of the
Goates of this <hi>Tropick of Capricorne</hi> came to the said
Well,<note place="margin">Primum mihi, secundum tibi.</note> whom he perswaded (by the goodnes of the
water, and by making her beleeue that the Moone
shining in the water was a Holland cheese to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
betweene them) to enter into the other buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
which done, downe came the Goate by reason
of her weight, and vp came the Fox, leauing the
Goate in the Well: euen so haue some Merchants
done, by extolling the great gaine of this trade, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they had drawne themselues out, by selling their
aduentures, leauing the buyer to the hazard of the
losse, which was (no doubt) to them well knowne.
For to make the best construction hereof, we may
conclude, that 400 thousand pounds lost by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the said Indies, are since come home, and
employed by the seuerall Factors in the said Indies,
and most of it in Silks and Indico, and yet there is
wanting 148 thousand pounds of the stock of 840
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12188:62"/>
thousand aduentured, accounting the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
made, to proceed of the commodities &amp; gain,
as aforesaid, which is almost one sixt part of the stock
aduentured to the Indies, whereof this account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
no satisfaction at all, vnlesse the 31079 <abbr>l</abbr> lost
in six ships cast away, were parcell thereof.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion which the said Author maketh,
is, <hi>That the East India trade alone (although it be driuen
in no ampler maner then is afore written) is a meanes to
bring in more treasure into this Realme then all the other
Trades of this Kingdome (as they are now managed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put together.</hi> For if the rule be true, That when
the values of our commodities exported doth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the worth of all those forrein wares which
are imported and consumed in this kingdome, then
the remainder of our stocke which is sent forth, must
of necessitie returne to vs in treasure, we must ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it will do so with vs in time.</p>
                  <p>Here you may see from whence <hi>Misselden</hi> drew
his <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> which he neuer dutst vndertake
to maintain before the aforesaid his Maiesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
who haue often called him by Warrants
and otherwise; for he was not able to maintaine an
other mans <hi>Proiect.</hi> We haue already shewed the
incertaintie of the said <hi>Ballance,</hi> and in the <hi>Remedies</hi>
wee shall intreate thereof further; neuerthelesse I
cannot omit <hi>Obiter,</hi> to say that this Rule may serue
for a Demonstration: but it can neuer be found true
vntill it concurre with the <hi>Center (Gaine:)</hi> for so long
as treasure cannot be imported without losse, we
shall still receiue wares in returne, and augment the
cause of ouer-ballancing. And which is more, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12188:63"/>
there were an ouer-ballancing of Trade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

our side, whereby moneys should be forced vpon
vs, yet should we find it would be to the incredible
losse of the Commonwealth, by the inhauncing of
the forreine coine beyond the Seas; and the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation
of our moneys in exchange, which may
be demonstrated by a trifle, as well as by hundreds
and thousands.</p>
                  <p>One buyeth a paire of Gloues for 5 <abbr>s</abbr> starlin,<note place="margin">An example of losse by an ouer ballance on our side.</note> and
selleth them beyond the Seas for 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> where he
receiueth a Rickx Doller for 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> or 50 Stiuers: and
moreouer, 5 single Stiuers taken to be worth 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> and
so getteth 10 <hi>pro cento.</hi> Suppose now that the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
is on our side, and this alledged necessitie
shewed her operation, and that he that sold the said
Gloues bringeth ouer this Rickx Doller and the 5
single Stiuers; and going to exchange them, no man
wil giue him aboue 4 <abbr>s.</abbr> 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> for his Doller, and 4 <abbr>d</abbr> for
his 5 Stiuers, which is the true intrinsique value.
Where is now his gaine of 10 <hi>pro cento,</hi> when he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
2 <abbr>d</abbr> of his 5 <abbr>s,</abbr> besides his labour, charges and
customes? But how shall this reuolution of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballancing
euer come to passe, when wee vse no
meanes thereunto, as other nations do, as shall be
declared in the next Chapter?</p>
                  <p>To conclude then with the East India Trade,
wherein we find no <hi>Center;</hi> let vs haue a care that

                  <p>The Trade for <hi>Russia</hi> was in times past very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable

For heretofore the commodities of the Realme &amp;

of our owne moneys, and of the said Royalls, we
doe loose the Trade also.</p>
               <p>We cannot make returne for our natiue commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
by the three ordinary meanes,<note place="margin">A matter of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> either by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or by exchange, or by commodities at our
choice and best aduantage as they doe: but are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
(of course) to buy forreine commodities
at deare rates, by a disordered Trade; how is it
possible then, that we should expect any such ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
ouer-ballancing of Trade to happen on our
side, when we haue not the like causes to produce
the like effects?</p>
               <p>Others are of opinion, that some moderation
might be procured herein, by making the Spanish
Royalls of 8 currant within the Realme at 4 <abbr>s.</abbr> 7 <abbr>d,</abbr>
or 8 <abbr>d</abbr>: that is to say, aboue the value. But they
doe not consider effectually of the inconueniences
which will ensue, as follweth.</p>
               <p>First, It will be the vtter ouerthrow of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
Mint, and vndoing of the poore Moneyers,
aswell for the coynes of gold as of siluer; for gold
will not be brought so frequently when siluer is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
by altering the proportion, and reducing
the same to 12 to one, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The forreine coyne will be aduanced
by these meanes 7 vpon the hundreth aboue our
Starlin moneys, and thereby increase the exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the said Royalls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The King will loose his coynage mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
being aboue 2 <abbr>d.</abbr> vpon an ounce: and the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe of his moneys and effacing of his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12188:66"/>
stampe, is a great derogation of his Prerogation
Royall, it being a marke of Soueraignty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The inhauncing of the said Royalls
will alter the price of Plare, as also of other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
within the Realme: which is a matter much
respected hitherto.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, When moneys are inhaunced beyond
the Seas, the price of exchange doth also inhaunce
in some measure: but when moneys are inhaunced
here, the exchange abateth, which causeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of our money to increase. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">The propery of true exchange.</note>
If to make siluer equiualent to gold of 12 to
one, the ounce should be valued at 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> 6 <abbr>d,</abbr> whereby
it would be inhaunced tenne <hi>Pro cento,</hi> should be
though conuenient, it would make the price of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
to fall 10 <hi>Pro cento,</hi> or more: which for the
Low Countries would fall to 30 <abbr>s.</abbr> and vnder, and
so it will be still transported: and the making of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
coyne currant within the Realme aboue the
value of ours, is not vsed vpon any good order, as
we haue noted by the <hi>Arch-Dutchesse of Austria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come therefore to the true remedy, wee are
to consider the true causes of their operations, to
which end we haue declared in the <hi>Equin octiall,</hi> the
losse which the Realme sustaineth by a low ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
or the vndervaluation of our moneys: as
also the benefits which will arise by the high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
as meerely opposite vnto it; so that we may
conclude certainly,<note place="margin">Causes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballancing.</note> 
                  <hi>è conuerso,</hi> I that when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
shall be rectified, and our moneys be truely
valued in exchange, 2 according to the inhauncing
of moneys beyond the Seas, 3 then will the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportation
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12188:66"/>
of moneys cease, 4 and the more natiue
commodities will be exported, and consequently
the losse of that inhauncing being preuented, 5 will
cause Bullion and moneys to be imported, 6 and
the lesse forreine commodities to be brought in: 7,
the Royall of Spaine will not be diuerted, nor the
Trade depending thereupon, 8, which will procure
plenty of money, 9, to aduance the price of our
commodities, 10, and abating the price of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
commodities, thereby effectually preuenting
the aforesaid ouerballancing.</p>
               <p>This is to be done onely by his Maiesties Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,<note place="margin">The way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Englands Wealth.</note>

whereunto Phisicke must be ministred vpon

                  <p>Another Practitioner in Phisicke was of opinion;
that the Flux of exportation should be diuerted and

to be exported at the pleasure of Merchants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but vpon better consideration of the weaknes of the

did alter the said opinion: obseruing that Art giuen

Manufactures and Fishing, thereby to cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the said surfeit or ouerballancing.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the learned Phisitians of experience
(hauing examined the causes of the diseases of this
Body) did resolue to apply and vse proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>First, That the continuall Flux of exportation
of our moneys must be stopt by taking away the
cause thereof, which is (<hi>Gaine</hi>) had vpon moneys,
proceeding of the vndervaluation of our moneys in
exchange, and the inhauncing of moneys beyond
the Seas.</p>
                  <p>Next, That the obstruction of the Liuer, (<hi>Money,</hi>
and the conduict Pipes of Spanish Royalls and
Germaine Dollers) must be opened by the meanes
of the Braine, (<hi>Exchange</hi>) to minister good Bloud
and Spirits to the Heart of our natiue <hi>Commodities,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:12188:71"/>
to make a liuely Trade, whereby <hi>Bullion</hi> brought
to the Mint, will cause the hammers (as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
of the Body of Trade) to beate with temperate
strokes, by meanes whereof the distemperature of
the Braine (<hi>Exchange</hi>) will be qualified: the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Gaule shall prouoke appetie, when cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
and impositions shall be moderated in the
rates, without diminution of substance: the Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wes
of the necessary ancient Statutes and Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the gouernment of Trade will be corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the Eye sight will be illuminated when the
ouer much smoake of <hi>Tobacco</hi> is vanished away: and
the Complection will be liuely when Merchants
shall be encouraged.</p>
                  <p>Wee shall not neede to vse <hi>Mechoacan or Indian
Rootes</hi> against the <hi>Dropsie,</hi> or Prohibitions against
the ouermuch importation of forreine Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the wearing of them (which will enforce
the like vse in other Countries:) for the humors of
the Leggs will be euacuated, and the convulsion of
the face (by our natiue Commodities <hi>truely made
and vented</hi>) will be extenuated: for plenty of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
shal aduance the quantity and price of them, and
abate the price of forreine Commodities, whereby
the <hi>Surfit</hi> or ouerballancing will be remedded, if we
preserue the good Bloud in the Body by the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Braine (<hi>Exchange</hi>) where the seate of
Iudgement is placed to increase the same for the
comfort of the Heart, (<hi>our natiue Commodities</hi>)
which shall receiue thereby his tintered <hi>Chylus</hi> by
his owne mouth and stomacke: and the bloud full
of Spirits shall fill all the veines, and strengthen the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12188:72"/>
Sinowes: by supplying the want of moneys, the
easie course and recourse of whose <hi>Exchange</hi> (find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rest by the Basis of true valuation) shall supple
the Ioynts and settle the bloud to serue all mens
turnes, whereby the said shaking of the body will
cease, the colour of the vrine will be rectified, the
too much vse of white Wine shall not be so much
offensiue, but in some measure reioyce the Heart,
and take away the melancholike disease of the mind,
which commonly procureth the disease of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Finally, The Body will be cured of the said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and grow fat againe by a true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
replection, of the generall good of the King
and Common-wealth, through Gods blessings.</p>
                  <p>If this <hi>Allegory</hi> be truely considered, we shall find
that therein is a liuely expression of the diseases of
the Politike Body of Trade: and if a naturall Body
had all the said diseases, there is no other remedy
nor way to to cure the same but after the maner here
declared, as the learned Phisitians of experience
will confesse: for the reasons are plaine and euident,
and without Phisicke it is impossible to cure it. Will
any man of iudgement thinke that the Flux will be
stopt of course by the strength of nature, so long as
we minister such things which of themselues are laxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue?
Or shall we expect that the Veines will be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Bloud, when the <hi>Hepaties</hi> want their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Or if Bloud did increase, shall the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
nutriment so long as there is a profusion of
Bloud? Or shall the Heart be comforted with the
liuely spirits of the Bloud? Shall the Braine receiue
rest, vnlesse she doe finde meanes to strengthen the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12188:72"/>
Heart: and that the <hi>Liuer,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
may all in one <hi>Simpathy</hi> performe their functions?
The Stomacke cannot disgest, euery thing prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a surfet: the Gaule (by her ouerstowing) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
appetite, which bringeth a distemperature to
the whole Body, and filleth the same with crude
humours, engendring <hi>Dropsies</hi> and other diseases,
which at last turne into a consumption: the Braine
wanteth sleepe, for the spirits are fatigated and
troubled.</p>
                  <p>To make application hereof to the Body Politike
of Trade, we know that euen as in naturall Bodies
the Heart (which is the <hi>Center</hi> of the Body) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
life first, and retaineth the same last; So Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
in Traffique are first, and moneys came
afterwards, whereby <hi>Commutation</hi> or Barter was
brought into a Trade: and to preserue that money,
(as the Bloud in the Body) exchange was deuised
as a spirit to quicken the same; and shall it be vsed
to destroy the Body because the true vse of it is not
vnderstood, and the same is made a Merchandise?</p>
                  <p>Shall we imagine that the exportation of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
shall be preuented, when by taking inhaunced
coyne beyond the Seas aboue the true value in
exchange, wee feede the causes of exportation? Or
shall we expect that moneys shall be imported vnto
vs, when there is a losse by the bringing of them,
which losse is measured according to the price of
exchange: which to auoide, compelleth vs to buy
forreine Commodities? Or if any moneys are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
(by accident or occasion) shall the Body of
Trade be the better by it so long as they are carried
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12188:73"/>
out againe? Shall the Trade of our natiue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
be liuely, when moneys are wanting? Can
the exchange haue his due course, vnlesse the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
thereof according to <hi>Parity</hi> and <hi>Equality</hi> be
respected, howsoeuer the price thereof may rise and
fall according to the occasions of Merchants, and
the plenty or scarsity of moneys? Shall not the price
of this true exchange impose a price vpon our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Commodities, so that Commodities, moneys
and exchanges may (according to equitie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice)
be gouerned in their proper natures accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly?
The Kingdome cannot consume the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
Commodities imported, but they cause an
ouerballancing; the Customes and Impositions
(which might be moderated in the rate, and yet not
decrease in value by the greater employment of
Trade) doth discourage Merchants, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a distemperature in Trade: forraine wares are
oueraboundantly brought in, in the liew of moneys,
whereby the Realme doth swell with forreine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
which (being retransported) bring still
other Wares in returne: so that moneys and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
(the vitall spirit of Trade) is neglected, which
is properly the decay of Trade; For the exchange
(which ruleth Commodities and money) is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by other Nations. Let vs therefore practise

the serious consideration of this <hi>Center of Commerce.</hi>
This is the firme North Starre of Trade, by which
your Compasse is to be directed according to the
Lawes, Statutes, and Ordinances of this Realme of
England; This is the Rudder of the Ship of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique

is recommended vnto you by the efficacy of other
mens words.</p>
               <p>For Money of it selfe (be it more or lesse) in
whose hands so euer, without Bullion to supply, is
but water in a Cesterne taken from the Spring, that
by vse becomes exhausted, or being but let alone,
consumes it selfe to nothing by strikes and putrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So Coyne becomes but <hi>Medals,</hi> out of vse, of

For <hi>Bullion</hi> being the Fountaine, <hi>Money</hi> is but the

               <p>
                  <hi>Bullion</hi> being the Sun, <hi>Money</hi> is but the Beames,

               <p>
                  <hi>Bullion</hi> being the Chylus, <hi>Money</hi> is but the Bloud,
<hi>Exchange</hi> the Spirit that quickens all the Body.</p>
               <p>To be short, <hi>Bullion</hi> is the very Body and Bloud
of Kings, <hi>Money</hi> is but the Medium betweene Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects

that ioynes them both together.</p>
               <p>Next therefore let the exportation of moneys, the
profusion of Bloud, be preuented by the meanes of
this <hi>Center,</hi> (wherein the vitall spirit of Trade doth
consist) and procure plenty of Money and Bullion
by all Reall Substantiall and Politike meanes; For
plenty of Money will improue your Lands, aduance
