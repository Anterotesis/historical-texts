            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> hereto intitles the right to Command, affirming the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopeans,</hi> from hence make the Election of their Magistrates and Kings; and <hi>Plato</hi> thought it necessary to the Conservators of his Common-wealth. To search farther into the ground of such an institution; we must conclude it to be raised from a conjecture, that the exactness of the <hi>Form</hi> gives either Evidence, that the Matter hath received a more perfect Impression of the Image of the Maker: Or, as the Naturalists say, that the disposition of the Soul answers the dimensions of the Body; as Twinns from one Original, the natural Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.</p>
               <p>A proof to the first Assertion may be deriv'd from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of the <hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> who (though <hi>Turtullian's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie hath other ways figured Him) was, without doubt, in his Person the most beautiful among men, according to <hi>Pub. Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> occular Testimony of him to the <hi>Roman Senate.</hi> The second Inference hath been so frequently found true, that the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is (among the <hi>French</hi>) digested to a Proverb, <hi>Lesbornes &amp; les boiteux sont tousjours meschants. The Blind and the Lame</hi> (meaning naturally) <hi>are always vitious.</hi> And according to this Rule, the Poets Figured <hi>Thersites,</hi> which, though it failed much in <hi>Socrates</hi> Constitution, rendring the Phisiognomist Judgement of <hi>Him</hi> but ridiculous: yet <hi>Socrates</hi> repaired again

the Dignity of his Art, affirming that <hi>He</hi> was by Nature such as he had Figur'd <hi>Him,</hi> but by the industry of <hi>His</hi> Mind, He had restrained that Propension. For conclusion therefore, since few or none will so much as strugle with one vitious Inclination, it will be far safer, that we should guide our true Election by this Appearance, though but a frail one, subject to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then yet to hazard it in expectation of a Miracle. To which position may possibly be objected, that since we have limitted the Faculty of our <hi>Minister</hi> in Council, we should as thereto onely proper, prefer the Abilities of the Mind, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supply the Defects of the Body, before the Integrity of the Manners, which follow but the complement of the <hi>Form;</hi> there being in matter of Advice more use of Reason then of Virtue. In answer to the first part of the <hi>Objection.</hi> It may be granted, that ev'n by the advantage of Excess (whereof the extern De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities are but inherent signs) the soul <hi>more perfectly</hi> in some intemp'ratures may exercise some one peculiar Faculty of the Intellect, then in any one peculiar Temp'rature, how regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar soever, as the predominant Humour is more proper to the usage of the Fancy or the Memory; but withal, becomes thereby inferior and defective in the rest. So that we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, since by virtue of the <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, the Soul produceth her Action, and by how much more pure the Instruments are, by so much more perfect are the effects. The Spirits <hi>Animal</hi> receiving onely this excellence from the Equality of the Temp'rature, whereof the exactness of the Form is but the Character. It of necessity will follow, that from the agreement of the Elements, must issue the most excellent and pow'rful Harmony of the soul. To the sequel of the <hi>Objection,</hi> we will only inferr, that it being too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every sense; how frequently frail Man doth make his <hi>Reason</hi> but a Prostitute to his <hi>Lust,</hi> not only to the abusing of others, but to the deceiving of Himself; it will be requisite to unite <hi>her</hi> to an Object nigher <hi>her</hi> own Nature, to preserve her in her Purity. And conclude, that since the <hi>Almighty</hi> hath not onely excluded the <hi>Impotent,</hi> but the <hi>Deformed</hi> also from <hi>His Ministrie;</hi> We therein have sufficient warrant, not to admit <hi>Him</hi> unadvisedly to <hi>Ours.</hi>

As the perfect knowledge of the National Laws, Customs, and Nature of the People, with the Facility and Elegance of the Tongue, to expediate or illustrate their Discourses. The subject of the second Branch inherent to <hi>His</hi> Parentage; presents to our Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two Propositions whether our <hi>Minister</hi> may be accepted from a <hi>Noble</hi> or <hi>Ignoble;</hi> from a <hi>Detected</hi> or <hi>Incensed</hi> Family. For solution to the first <hi>Quaere,</hi> we will unfold the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Advantages of <hi>Either.</hi> The onely Benefit <hi>Nobility</hi> can promise us in <hi>His</hi> Reception, is to give Lustre and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>His Ministry.</hi> The Advantage Ignobility presenteth us in <hi>His</hi> Admittance, is vulgar satisfaction. The First yields, but at most, an Ornament to Rule. The Later but Licentiousness in Rule. The Inconveniences wait on Nobility in <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> are <hi>Iealousie</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi> As appears between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> to the Translation of the <hi>Romain</hi> Common-wealth. And between <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Hannibal;</hi> to the destruction of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The Disadvantages attend on Ignobility in a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> are <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Contempt,</hi> as may be visible in the transaction of Affairs, under the Ministry of * * * * * and Others to the shaking if not hazarding our Own. In the first Ambition moves more Imperceptably., as being more nigh the Object of the Passion. In the later more Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as more removed from the Point it reacheth at; so that the Consequence of our Argument will guide us to a Mean participating of the Nature of both Extreams, as most expedient to the execution of our <hi>Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Proposition consisting in Parts of different Nature, we may devide them in our Treaty; and first take that, which moves, whether our <hi>Minister</hi> may be accepted from a <hi>Detected</hi> Family. Of which question ere we determine, it will be necessary first to propound Another, whether <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> or <hi>Punishment</hi> followed the Detection; if <hi>Mercy,</hi> the utmost Ground of our suspicion can be laid but on the Seeds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, contracted from the Impressions of Nature, or of Discipline, which reaching to no farther certainty, the Party safely may be joyned to our <hi>Ministry;</hi> induced by Example of <hi>Augustus;</hi> who happily convincing <hi>Cynna,</hi> by his proper Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

of his conspiracy against <hi>Him,</hi> did both the Crime remit, and readmitted him with such success, that neither yet by him, nor any other ever after, was any Treason, that was visible, or Practis'd, or design'd against Him.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Punishment</hi> hath followed the <hi>Detection,</hi> the Argument will meet with the divided Sequel of the Question, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in one Currant, fall under the Capacity of One Solution, under the Figure of <hi>Incensed.</hi> Although it may admit of some distinction in the Manner; as whether the efficient Cause were Just or Injurious, Direct, or but Collateral, Nigh, or Remote. Yet, since no Observation can prescribe a Limit to Mans Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being generally o're partial Judges in our own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; such Circumstances will afford but little Difference in the Consequence. So that we may herein conclude of Both, under one firme Position, in a general Exclusion of them from our <hi>Ministry.</hi> The dangerous issue of Indignation in a <hi>Minister of State;</hi> whether just or unjust, sprung from Injury or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, are truly figured in <hi>Cataline,</hi> who, ill-resenting the Disgrace of a Repulse, when he stood to be <hi>Candidate</hi> in the <hi>Pontique</hi> Warr, contrived secretly the visible subversion of the <hi>State.</hi> And was not farr off from effecting it. Like evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be instanced from <hi>Iulian</hi>'s far more Just, though more unhappy Fury; who on the violation of his Daughter <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> in his absence, imploy'd on publique exigents, was at Return, possest with so inveterate a hatred against the present Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Government, that he forthwith brought in the <hi>Moors</hi> to <hi>Spain;</hi> who, there in sundry bloudy Conflicts, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, became at length Possessors of the Territories four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together. Nor do such like <hi>Punctillio</hi>'s of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor produce less violent Passions in remote Successions, <hi>They</hi> being of such usage in most Common-wealths, That it is held as necessary to the Continuance of their Reputation, to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Quarrels of their Predecessors, as for the support of their Livelihood, to Administer to their Goods. And though the Fury hereof oftner doth reflect upon some private Family, as the indirect Promoters, or secret Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet are the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof too frequently, as fatal to the One, as to the Other: witness the incensed Proceedure of <hi>Arron,</hi> who on his Adversary's prevailing against him in a Plea indicted for the Ravishing of his Wife, brought in the <hi>Gaules</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> to the subversion of his Enemies, and Devastation of that Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>

               <p>But perhaps some may here cautiously object, that since the whole scope our <hi>Subject</hi> seems properly to aim at, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth only on the Sufficience and Integrity of the Mind, which consisting not in the variety of <hi>Tongues:</hi> such Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure will rather prove to us a Penible, Expensive and useless Curiosity, then any regular or expedient Institution.

How successful in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Negotiations, agreeable Ministers may be, is obvious to every Sense, and how they can be so, without that which should

               <p>The next <hi>Object</hi> propounded to our <hi>Minister,</hi> is <hi>Letters,</hi> to whose free Access, it will be necessary to be indued with the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, which (though not at present <hi>National</hi>) may also be to <hi>Him</hi> of farther use in Foreign Agitations, wanting <hi>Those</hi> that are, and with all sufficiently serve to the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of such a part of <hi>School-Learning,</hi> as shall be requisite to our <hi>Minister,</hi> which shall not need to be extended farther, then to lend <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Propriety</hi> to <hi>His</hi> Discourse: And to free his Spirit from the Tyranny of the strangeness of it in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Mouth. Not so far to handle <hi>it,</hi> to make it a Fetter to <hi>His</hi> Reason, a burden to <hi>His</hi> Memory, a servile anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>His</hi> Judgement, or a Discord in His Manners. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all which, it will be dangerous to encounter this many headed Monster (such more in Respect of disagreeing Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Pretenders to her Mysteries, then in her own Nature.) e're the Judgement be perfectly formed, and confirmed, least what <hi>He</hi> thought to Master and Possess for the Advantage of <hi>His</hi> Natural Endowments, Possess and Master <hi>Him</hi> to the Captivity and Extinction of the same.</p>
               <p>These with Dexterity handled, may prove superficial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to our <hi>Minister,</hi> but the more exactly useful and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to <hi>His Ministry,</hi> and in the Exercise whereof, <hi>He</hi> ought solely to imploy all the Vigor and Industry of <hi>His</hi> Mind, are the <hi>Laws</hi> Common or National, Civil or Universal. And <hi>History</hi> in General; which (for better enlightning of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in Either) should walk Hand in Hand. Not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Notions of <hi>Law,</hi> as unalterable Positions. Nor the Traditions of <hi>History,</hi> as meer Narratives to swell the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: But from History, to examine the Ground and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Laws.</hi> The Issues and Events of such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, such Affairs, such Enterprizes, by what Persons How Endowed, how Managed, and from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Laws to gather true Lights of the secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues of former Ages, by Corruption or Ignorance of the Chronologer smothered, Disguised or Neglected, so compa ring Occurrents of preceding Times with the Present, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by such Observation, what Laws should be Appealed, what revived, what reformed, what Introduced or Established. How farr to be Extended and where Limited.</p>
               <p>For other pieces of <hi>Learning,</hi> as Aids to our <hi>Minister,</hi> we shall only propound such Parts of the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> as shall concern the Military Function; whereto he possibly may be call'd to be an Arbitrator, either in the Defensive or Offensive Part thereof.</p>
               <p>The Third <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>His Education</hi> here specified, is Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.

Of which we may seem to have treated in the manner of His Acquisition of Forreign <hi>Tongues;</hi> but such years being not yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently mature, to make the true use of the most weighty Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations thereof, we have made it the immediate closure to <hi>his</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and the Preface to <hi>His</hi> Practice; The Advantages hereby acquir'd are numerous, among which he shall learn the true art of <hi>Conversation,</hi> not so much, what concerneth the Civil, Courtly, and Superficial part thereof (though not an immaterial faculty in <hi>his</hi> Function) as the Political and Essential. How to endear <hi>himself</hi> with the most Savage Inclination, How to secure <hi>Himself</hi> from the most fraudulent, How to avoid the Distastes of the most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, How the Disgrace of the most scurrilous, How to shun the Incumbrances of the Impertinent, and how the Importunities of the Impudent, How to fasten on the Babler for Intelligence, How on the serious for Instruction, How to suffer immov'd the most Contradictory, and how to satisfie unprejudiced the most Curious. How to distinguish and make use of all Humors and Inclinations. How with Dexterity to be All to All. To present every one their Figure, and yet retain his own. And in all these to become so perfect a Master of <hi>His</hi> Passions and Purposes, that the very shadows thereof shall never fall under Anothers sence: To which some may perhaps object, that this Mystery may as well be attain'd at home, without the community of Forreign Parts, diversities sufficient both in Manners and Affections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto with us to be found. This being granted, yet the insensible and unexamined Habits and Customs of the place, wherein we were born and bred, smother the perfect and visible Lights thereof; so that in the frequency of use, we not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish or not consider others Faculties, nor yet awake our own; whereas each Forreign place we come to, will afford in nature new Proofs and Figures to our observation, which Art elsewhere but slightly counterfeits</p>

               <p>WE might without Scruple admit of any Profession to this our <hi>Ministry,</hi> whose quality were no Dishonour to the Dignity <hi>Hereof,</hi> nor Nature repugnant to the vacancy <hi>Hereto,</hi> were it not an Imployment requires the whole Man in Action, and the whole Life for Instruction. If Civil Policy among the <hi>Chaneses,</hi> figuring one mans Life too short, <hi>hath establisht a Custom to introduce a Perfection, even in Mechanick Arts, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning each Artists Posterity to follow the Function of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</hi> How much more necessary will it be to sequester our <hi>Pretender</hi> to this high difficult and Noble <hi>Mystery,</hi> from all other Negotiations whatsoever. This was the ground of <hi>Philip's Reproach to his Son</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great, when in the Olimpick Games, he bore away the Glory in Musi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>k from all his Emulators, implying that his Excellence herein was a shameful proof against him, to have been remiss in time and Industry, in pursuit of other Endowments more proper to his Regal Dignity.</hi> The motions of the <hi>Civil</hi> Body can no more without hazard of Ruine suffer Cessation or Intermission, then those of the natural. And since the whole strength of the united <hi>Ministers</hi> is little enough to keep this <hi>Machine</hi> in a regular frame, it will be requisite not yet more to weaken their force in the Division thereof betwixt publick and private Interests. The Integrity of <hi>Atilius Regulus figured to us</hi> this inconvenience <hi>in his request to the Senate (on the Death of his Bailiffe) to be dismiss'd from his Embassy in</hi> Spain, <hi>that he might thereby have liberty to manage his own Domestique Affairs, which extended but to thirty seven Acres of Ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which may be objected, how any then shall usefully be admitted to our <hi>Ministry,</hi> since it is necessary to every mans live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, that he have <hi>Profession</hi> or <hi>Possession,</hi> either of which will afford but small Benefit to his Existence, if by him carelesly abandoned; we may answer this Objection with the Remedy borrowed from the Senates example and Answer to the Petition, which was, <hi>That he should repose the Burden of his Domestick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs on their Care, who would provide a faithful and sufficient Supervisor to the managing thereof:</hi> Nor is it but in reason equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that if our <hi>Minister</hi> address all his endeavours to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Publick, but the Publick should likewise contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute some cost to the support of his private Interests.</p>
               <p>It may also here possibly be farther alledged, that there are certain intermitting seasons of Peace and Relaxes of Affairs in most Commonwealths, whose smooth calmness may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time dispence with their Pilots Diligence, since oft it scarce af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth matter to <hi>His</hi> Action; to which for reply we infer, that



<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100123:10"/>
such Constitutions of <hi>State</hi> are subject to the most dangerous Accesses of Distemper. Since neither Nature nor Policy suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Retraction or Demur, must of necessity, proceeding still, fall into the Contrary Excesses; insomuch as all Extreams meet but in one and the same Point. As the most perfect Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of health in <hi>Natural Bodies,</hi> so in <hi>Civil,</hi> are obvious in their Changes, to the most desperate Infirmities.</p>
               <p>Another Argument may probably yet hereto be inserted against the strictness of our <hi>Ministers</hi> attendance on his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fram'd on the Multitude of Members, which may alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately supply each others vacancy: To which we may alledge, That it is the Bane of a Council, where the several Members Thereof rely upon each others Diligence, Sufficiency, or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; in which none answereth His peculiar Trust, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth not his proper Conscience, and inureth them to handle Publick Affairs (not having immediate Relation to their private Interests;) with that Indifference and Neglect, as if they not materially concerned Them. And farther lendeth an Advantage in Absence of Particulars, to facilate the secret Practices of a Faction. Secondly, By such Intermission our <hi>Minister</hi> looseth the preceding Coherences of several Agitations, whereby his Judgement cannot sufficiently be enlightened for the future. Thirdly, To the exact constituting of a <hi>Council,</hi> is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a just Proportion, as well as a due Propriety of Parts. If they exceed in number, Disorder will meet their various Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Obscurity their mutual Conceptions, and Protraction their positive Determinations: so that in the issue small fruit will follow their Consultations: If they fall short of a true Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it will rather be held a Private Combination then a Publick Convention. If they meet a perfect Symetry in their Union, we must then conclude, there being no one Superfluous, there will be no one conveniently to be spared; and if there might, on other ground then necessity (which admitteth of no Rule) such Licence would be to the rest, a just Plea for like Priviledge: so that in the dismission of one, we may perhaps often want the better part of our Assembly.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we figure our <hi>Minister</hi> so excellently endowed both in natural and acquired Habits, that no Age, how happy soever in the Production, or State so industrious in the forming, will at any time, with fertility beget such a croud in this Society, that a supernumerary shall still be ready to supply a Default. In Opposition hereto, may yet farther be alledged, that this is so servile and anxious a condition, that no generous or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Spirit (such as is here pretended necessary) would ever be won to render himself subject to. This being granted, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed from want of Love to his Countrey, Address in the

Faculty, or use in the exercise: could <hi>Milo</hi> else, <hi>with delight on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Advantage of his strength bear every day an Oxe?</hi> And shall not our <hi>Minister</hi> expose himself infatigably to the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity of so glorious an enterprise, as the <hi>Common Welfare,</hi> which <hi>Scevola</hi> held dearer then his <hi>Hand, Regulus</hi> then his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Curtius</hi> then his <hi>Life;</hi> and will not only render his present Being useful, but necessary, and <hi>His</hi> memory not only vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but eternal: to which we instance not here the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>His</hi> Fortunes (which must follow as a consequent) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too abject an inducement to bear any Influence over <hi>His</hi> nobler Inclinations: Nor will a plausible Recreation be at any time wanting in the Excellency and Variety of our <hi>Subject,</hi> though not perhaps those fancied by a looser Temper: yet such as are more proper to the Rellish of that Age, we shall hereafter figure <hi>Him:</hi> so that we here inhibit not <hi>His</hi> Divertisement, but only thereof change the Quality.</p>

               <p>WEre it so, that the Abilities of the Mind depended not on the Maturity of years, nor Experience on the frequency of Practice, as may be affirmed from the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of <hi>Alexander, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> in the early underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and successful Issues of their Enterprises, whose mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Fortunes seem to have had a more secret Foundation than humane Reason can either frame or discover. Yet to educe such Faculties to a useful Exercise, it were expedient, Time should infuse a perfect Allay to the natural Temper, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to withstand the Proof of every tryal, whereby neither the high fervour of the Blood in Youth might be too prone to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the captive will to such a wilde Temerity in Action, as to attempt on any Difficulty: nor yet the frigid sloth of Phleame in Age might so benum the vital Spirits, as in a timid Jealousie to restrain the passive will from ev'ry seeming opposition: Of which extreams the Danger to avoid, we Figure this our <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> which Naturalists style, <hi>Aetas Consistens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 35. and 48. In which years, Nature seems in her course to have attained a kinde of Repose, having as then in man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated her designed work, when no longer employing her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour on the disposing of her edifice: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> as yet shrinking under the burden of our frail Composure, seems at a stand to gather strength against the assaults of the succeeding time: Not that on such terms we so precisely fix, as never to admit Exception in our choice, since many times we see, Nature her self in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or exact Disposition of the matter, protracteth or anticipates



<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100123:11"/>
her course: but that we might receive a general Note to guide our purpose so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>igh Perfection, as natural Lights may reach to.</p>
               <p>From which Argument some curious Fancy may perhaps collect Matter to insert (if not by way of Opposition, by way of an exacter Proposition) That it were better to form our <hi>Council</hi> of sundry <hi>Ages,</hi> following herein the Pattern of a Natural Body, which is constituted in Parts of several Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to the end, that what One Member were defective in, might be supplyed by another.</p>
               <p>To which we may alledge, That Nature hath constituted the Body in parts of differing Tempers, in Respect of the Aptitude thereof to differing uses and Ministries: And so having divers ends, must (of necessity, to the perfection of her work) make use of Instruments of distinct Capacities. But our <hi>Civil</hi> Body, though formed of sundry Members; yet having but one only Object, It were rather more proper (if possible) that they should so sympathize in their tempers, that no one might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by dissent from other in their natural Lights: But from their equal endowments might result an uanimous Agreement in their Consultations.</p>
               <p>It may yet hereto farther be infer'd, That men are often more successful in the search of Truth, by interjected Doubts, and Oppositions formed from disagreeing Opinions, then by the general Allowance of assenting Judgements, <hi>Which hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time condemned Truth it self for Heresie,</hi> and may perhaps be the Reason, why <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>In the multitude of Counsel there is safety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This granted, by dissenting Repugnances, Truth may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be brought to Light, but far more frequently, is by such Contestation smothered in the Issue, leaving the Idea only of an unform'd Monster. Moreover, if such Discussions were needful to Truths Discoveries, these (so well as in obstinate Differences) might be otherwise stated in Agreeing Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which though oftentimes but slenderly supported, wanting the Passion of a proper Owner; yet may they unto every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence, afford such Lights, even in their first Discovery, as to disclose the Necessity of their farther Agitation: which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it self but weight, will want no Prosecution.</p>
               <p>But we may peradventure meet with so repugnant a Spirit, as would attempt to force us out of our pursued Tract, with <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> Observation, <hi>That Affairs are seldom successful, when sifted so fine in their inherent Consequences, as to admit no share for Chance to work upon, which notwithstanding will be the chiefest Agitator in the managing. Whence grosser mindes are oftentimes more happy in their Consultations, then more refined Iudgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100123:12"/>To which we answer, That it is safer and more satisfactory to a generous minde, as <hi>Alexander</hi> said, when advised to take the Advantage of the night to assail his Enemies more numerous then his Force; <hi>That he had rather suffer the injury of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, then the shame of his Victory.</hi> To fail under the conduct of that Light, God in Nature hath afforded us, then to be success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful either in the Opposition, Digression, or Omission of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, since every Age hath at least his innate propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to peculiar Imperfections, it will be safest to accept of such seasons, as are most remote from the Extreams.</p>
               <p>Peradventure we may here yet meet the Authority of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as an Objection to our Argument, <hi>Whoso often preferreth Gray Hairs to the Ministry of Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must Hereto so far agree, That <hi>Age</hi> (if rightly practised) wins great advantages to the Perfection of our <hi>Ministry,</hi> in the Observation of a long Series and Contiguity of Affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming still the Judgement by an Occular Proof, whereby It consequently becomes more visibly effectual to a civil Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it must be with this Limitation, That such years meet so perfect a Consultation, as may retain Capacity properly to dispence those Notions. Since we observe it evident by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proofs, That not onely by visible Infirmities of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans which follow our Disorders, but by an imperceptable and Natural declining of the Spirits; most Men, e're they attain that Term of Life, do oft out-live their own suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>

measure to be requisite in <hi>Him.</hi> Not meerly as a safeguard from such Necessity as threatens His present Existence.

               <p>First, in Respect of <hi>Himself.</hi> The burden of His own anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thoughts, will render the Faculties of His Mind, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indisposed, but unprepared to <hi>His Ministry. His</hi> Thoughts imployed, suspended, or diverted on His proper Exigents, to whose forc'd Summons, Nature her self will claim a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The inward Sense of his own abject Fortune, redoubled by Reflection of the Majesty of His own <hi>Assembly</hi> (if it encounter not an admirable Temper) will, Through the Dejection of the Natural Spirits, some time at least restrain the vigor of his Argument, if not extinguish It.</p>
               <p>In Respect of Others, the Inconvenients are, That <hi>His</hi> private Misery may sometime in <hi>His</hi> mouth render e'vn Truth it self suspected or neglected. <hi>Wisdom from a poor mans mouth,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>being, or not approv'd, or not followed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it seems not altogether consonant to Reason, that publique Affairs should be committed to <hi>His</hi> charge, who hath not a competent share of Interests in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
               <p>To which we may yet farther add the casual Frailty of our own infirm Natures, which thereby lays us open to the Battery of each Corruption; not onely in the Jealousie of Others, but likewise may as far intrench e'vn on our own proper Apprehensions.

Both which Propositions will fall under the capacity of one Solution, which shall be, That the safest proceeding in our Election, is to aim at the firmest Pledges of <hi>His</hi> fidelity, we constitute to our Trust, Not that we shall not hereafter be so cautious to exact of <hi>Him</hi> securer Proofs of His Integrity. Nor yet at present so Scrupulous, as not to admit Him to our <hi>Ministry</hi> without the exact concurrence of such Evidence, having e're this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Test of more Essential Tryals.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100123:13"/>To this Distinction in Order, succeedeth the <hi>Quantity</hi> of <hi>His</hi> Possessions, one extream hereof we have already handled with the preceding Principal; the other, that of course here falls in Agitation, is the excess of wealth (not such in measure propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the fancy, but condition of the owner.) How deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Impostor <hi>This</hi> is to cheat the sense, the wide worlds gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Homage to this Idol may be evidence, <hi>Who,</hi> to use <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigns</hi> Terms, <hi>judge of the Palfrey by his goodly Trappings: And believe my Ladies Chappein's an Essential part of Her admired Personage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How corrupt an associate to the Owners Reason, sacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath to us attested, <hi>Figuring the Incapacity thereof to all that's good, under a humane Impossibility.</hi> Moreover, how nigh and tempting an Access such affluence may lend Ambition, not seldome only to the disturbance of the common Peace, but to the Subversion or Translation of the whole Fabrick of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, all Ages will afford us woful Patterns.</p>
               <p>Rejecting thus the extreams, as inconvenient in our <hi>Minister,</hi> it follows without farther consequence, we must approve the mean, which from the result of our Argument not yet distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figured to the sense: We will propound It a Proportion ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in a sober Temper, to free the minde from the assiduous servility of others, or of His own occasions: which end, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, more by the vigour of His proper Reason, then the Advantage of His present Fortune, will render Him yet more acceptable as visibly more hopeful to our <hi>Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last inherent to this present <hi>subject,</hi> is the <hi>Dependance</hi> of our <hi>Ministers</hi> Possessions; which we shall negatively include in one convertible Proposition, That neither His Estate, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, depend by Tenure, Custom, Homage, Copy, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise on any others, then the Princes, or States, to whom he is Subordinate: nor yet that many others in like manner do depend on His.</p>
               <p>The former, if admitted, might perhaps form such engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on our <hi>Minister,</hi> as may enthral the freedom of His Spirit, and thereby sometime cast a private restraint on the Persuit of publick Purposes; or wrest some Publick motion to a Private Interest.</p>
               <p>The dangerous consequence of the <hi>Latter,</hi> if admitted, too soon yields fuel to incensed <hi>Ministers,</hi> to become unequal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers of their secret Discontents, as hath too oft appeared to the damage of this Nation; and formerly gave occasion to a Cautious Prince, by sundry Acts to take away the Ground thereof from all succeeding Ages.</p>

               <p>THis <hi>Principle</hi> (rightly considered) will lead us to more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and Essential Discoveries of our <hi>Minister's</hi> inward Temper, not so much in the borrowed Image issuing from the insensible Impressions our facile Nature receiveth from the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of our frequent Conversation; as in the innate Idea, others may thence collect of the secret and natural Propension of <hi>His</hi> minde, following therein such Objects as seem unto <hi>His</hi> fancy most agreeable, which may be lights to guide us in Election. But chiefly (when constituted a member to this <hi>Assembly</hi>) we shall by way of advice interdict Him three Societies as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent to the Advantage of <hi>His Ministery.</hi> Of <hi>Bibbers, Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans,</hi> and Forreign <hi>Ministers</hi> of State, under which Heads are figured to us the three eminent Strengths in Contestation for Preheminence in their Efficacy over the will of Man, <hi>Wine, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Wealth:</hi> Not that perhaps our <hi>Minister</hi> may not be of fo excellent a Temper, as to resist the Contagion of their contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Imperfections, though the common frailty of our own corrupt Nature may afford us hourly matter enough to entertain the exactest Virtue in uncessant exercise, without attempting on such Tryals, may in his failing, hazzard the common safety with <hi>His</hi> own. The Danger Hereof will appear more evident and weighty, when to <hi>His</hi> innate Infirmity, we shall Ballance the insinuating force of these their Instruments with the full extent of their Operations.</p>
               <p>The Imposturies of <hi>Wine</hi> first steal upon the wariest Temper, under the Disguise of Natures helpful Ministry, admitted thus in one Degree for useful; Custom, at length, will in Another form it necessary. Mirth exalts the measure, and company pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth the excess, which not only smothers the Natural Light in Present, but disables it in Future, leaving the irregular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour so ridiculous, that what should Grace <hi>His</hi> Dignity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from <hi>His</hi> Authority: while the shallow Image of <hi>His</hi> thoughts hang on his fleeting Breath, and by the least disordered motion of the Heart, drops from his slippery Lips, perhaps to the betraying of the general welfare.</p>
               <p>But peradventure some may alledge, that our <hi>Minister's</hi> happy Constitution may as well gain this Advantage over others Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility, as Another over <hi>His:</hi> and that there are certain Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, to whom this Custom is so proper, without the Proof Hereof, a <hi>Minister</hi> with them successfully can seldom agitate.</p>
               <p>To which we may answer, That it is too uncertain, hazzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and indirect a Procedure, to intrust an equal portion of Affairs of this high Nature, but to the Advantage of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Temper, to whose exact managing, the perfectest Lights of Reason or of Art, are scarcely capable: But were It granted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, there might be other Agents found hereto more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whose Ignorance might answer for their Secresie, and free the State from Casualty of such a Damage, without imbarking of an equal venture.</p>
               <p>How irresistably the Charms and slights of wanton Womens Subtilties work on our self-betraying Nature, lying in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, all Ages will afford us evidence, whose woful Proofs have not left Man the hope of a defensive Armoir. To these, we finde in <hi>Sampson, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> The strongest to his Ruine, betrayed his strength. The wisest to the dismembring of his State, his Knowledge. And the most zealous, to his Reproach, his Piety. It will therefore be no scandal to our <hi>Minister's</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience afar off to avoid this <hi>Precipice,</hi> become remarkable by the overthrow of so many eminent Personages; not only in <hi>His</hi> own Respect, but in Regard of publick Interests (by <hi>him</hi> to be preferr'd before <hi>his</hi> own) which lying in <hi>his</hi> Bosom, may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be incident to the like Disaster.</p>
               <p>Whereto may be objected, That there are also certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, with which our <hi>Minister</hi> may have Commission to communicate, wherein the sole, perfectest, and most material In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the occurrents of that Place, are only to be gained from such Instruments, whose private Interview may farther be authorized from <hi>Cicero</hi>'s suceess hereby in the Discovery of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talines</hi> Conspiracy.</p>
               <p>To which we make reply, That herein also (if assented to) the Ballance of our Argument remains but still in equal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise; since in one and the same subject we may to the Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Discovering, oppose the subtilty in attaining such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: so that hereby we attempt to gain no more, then we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger to lose. In which Respect, where Custom hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med such Proceeding useful, and not scandalous, it will be more applausive and convenient to have recourse to our preceding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and under the Faculty of a more remote substitute, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Dignity of our <hi>Minister</hi> unblemished, and Publick Interests from a Capacity of Prejudice.</p>
               <p>Our last Restraint on <hi>This Association</hi> is with Forreign <hi>Ministers,</hi> under which Distinction we have reduced the Force of Wealth, in that Money is the chief and usual Instrument such Agents work with, to the supplanting of their Neighbours Interests, or otherwayes advancing of their own, by secret Corruption of their <hi>Ministers:</hi> Of which Method in Proceeding, the <hi>Venetian</hi> is so jealous, That they have inhibited by a penal Law (extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature of High-Treason) <hi>That no Minister of State, or Senator, shall with Forreign Minister either at home or abroad,</hi>

                  <hi>Friend or Foe, have either private or publick Conference whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without the special Licence of the Senate.</hi> Which hath not (as some may figure) been enacted only, as a terror to suppress private practises; but clear contrary, hath in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance been prosecuted with such blinde severity, as hath in latter times, injuriously both to Themselves and Others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely dissected from their <hi>Civil</hi> Body (<hi>Anthonio Foscarini</hi>) a Member of the greatest Eminence, and perfectest Integrity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, such before reputed, and after to their Grief and shame too late acknowledged. In which proceeding, since we seem to cast a shadow of Reproach on so venerable a <hi>Society,</hi> and so universally approved Laws as hath induc't the ablest Judgements to believe, That no <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction either hath had, or need to have firmer Basis to the Establishment of a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Government. It will be necessary to digress somewhat from our present Subject, both to express and prove the Defects in such Ordinance, as also in the Dispensation of the same. Briefly therefore we may Object against one Clause in the Edict, That it is against the Dignity and Purity of a Law to propound any Recompence to the Dilator, as pre-intending to suborn by such Corruption false Witness to the Plea, and to invite the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent as well to suggest a Lye, as to disclose a Truth.</p>
               <p>To which if inferr'd, the Necessity Hereof to a due Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; we may reply, That if the Vigor of a plausible Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Common Cause, be not in every Peculiar Person suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently effectual to the vigilance of their proper safety inherent to the publick: yet, the never sleeping Spies of Envy and Malice (to whose Persecution the exactest <hi>Ministers</hi> are most incident) will need no stipend to provoke their Fury.</p>
               <p>Against the incircumspection of the <hi>Ministers</hi> to this Decree, we may in this particular infer, That no Judge whatever, by the Nature of his Office, is tyed so strictly to depend on the Evidence of a Witness, as to neglect the circumstance of the Matter, which divers times affords the exactest Lights to Truths Discovery, both without and beyond a farther Testimony; as appears in <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Daniels</hi> Sentences: which, duly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had not those <hi>Ministers</hi> admitted, the false Deposition of a Band of Braves, would not have had the weight to over bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the just Renown of so vertuous, long approved, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a <hi>Minister:</hi> where the defensive evidence was to be wav'd as irreceivable. But to come nigher to our present Subject, The true ground of this Law wants no other Authority to lend It consequence, then the numerous Examples of <hi>Ministers,</hi> thus corrupted almost in every Age.</p>
               <p>Not that we shall here declare a general suspicion of our <hi>Minister,</hi> but to prevent the irresistable motions of our common

Frailty from a dangerous issue. How forcible and prompt the means in Practice is to our Corruption; so obvious is to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sense, we only will insert this antick Observation; That the <hi>Common union of the strongest City is not of Force sufficient to resist the entry of an Asse laden with Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, where no such Institution is of force, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral freedom licensed, It will become the Prudence of our <hi>Minister,</hi> if wholly not to refrain such Conversation, at least to use it with so nice a Prudence as may not yield a seeming ground to others jealousie of <hi>His</hi> sincere Intentions.</p>

               <p>To which perhaps may be alledged, That the multitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no notions for positive Truths, or warrant of Their Own Sufficiency, but from the Tradition of the choicest Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, approved in the Agreement of succeeding Ages. In Objection to the Inference, we may reply, That when we shall exactly weigh the common Heresies, that hereby have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in Repugnance to <hi>Divine</hi> Principles. The absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>Civil,</hi> and the Fallacies to <hi>Natural:</hi> We shall finde Reason to believe, that even in those Ages, and over those Judgements the Passions of the Multitude have had too forcible an Influence in overswaying of Their Sentences, to admit Them for Authentick Generally. Moreover we may observe, in most General Councils, that men of greatest Wisdom and Integrity, have suffered the most obstinate Oppositions in their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either through Envy, Ignorance, or Inenmity, or else in favour of some secret Practices: which though examined with more freedom and Impartiality in remoter times; yet neither then want corrupt or perverse Champions to shelter Their Defects: so that the Multitude; in the doubtful strife (suspended from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Censure) incline to that, holds most Advantage with their proper Interests, assuming still the Authority to judge. From whence we may collect, That blustering Fame is but a doubtful Light to yield safe conduct to our Purposes, not only in respect of their premised Insufficiency to judge, who forms her Nature; but in regard the vitious multitude can not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeachment to themselves, approve of such are most to them unlike: so that a wise and upright man may have just Cause ev'n to suspect himself in their applausive Testimony: to which may also added be, the common Homage, most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the sense and proper Interests.</p>

Plot and Counter-Plot must wait upon an Enterprise to crown the undertaking with success, though sometime they may seem divided: as <hi>Eumenes, Who seeing many Billets were in his Camp dispersed by his Foe, to invite with great Rewards some greedy Temper to contrive his Death, assembled all his Troops by publick Proclamation; where highly exalting their approv'd Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Him, with tender of a seeming gratitude: He publickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, those Billets so disperc'd, were but the secret Machines of his Love, by him contriv'd to gather nigher Proofs of their Affection.</hi>

But withal, the Instruments of such glorious Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs (though shadowed with the fairest Lustres) seldom ev'n Here escape a just reward.

the usage of our <hi>Minister,</hi> forming his will to the exact Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of these <hi>Her</hi> differing Objects.

Yet since such act but under <hi>His</hi> Commission, we only <hi>Him</hi> consider, as the first Mover of such Instruments.</p>
               <p>Under the shadow of the three former Distinctions were figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red three Faculties necessary to the Exercise of <hi>Iustice</hi> in her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Objects. A clear Intelligence of the Subject agitated. Power and Courage to Punish or Protect. An unintressed and impartial Inclination to educe either into perfect Action.</p>
               <p>1. To the Acquisition of the <hi>First</hi> Faculty, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary not only to make an exact search into the Litteral and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible sence and coherence of a Subject in Discussion, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to sound the secret ground or purpose of such a League, Covenant, Contract, Law, Decree, or Act whatever from the Collation of Times, Circumstance, and Persons, in which, for what, and by whom they were passed, enacted, or Confirmed. It being inconsistent with the Dignity of a Legislator, to catch at nice Terms, or Distinctions to shadow an evasion from the true Intent. Or to leave such Incong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>2. The <hi>second</hi> Faculty, consisting of differing parts, must be assum'd from distinct Subjects. Power from the Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which <hi>He</hi> doth officiate. Courage from <hi>himself,</hi> to put that Power indifferently in Act; Both which we will consider as immediately contingent to His <hi>Ministry;</hi> properly and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly seated in Advice. In Delivery whereof, <hi>He</hi> may in Right, challenge an unquestionable Priviledge of Liberty, being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the Election of a Prince or People, and the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>His</hi> own <hi>Society;</hi> not erring from the Propriety of Time, Circumstance, and Order. A Consultation else seems indirectly managed, concluding, or Impulsively, or Omissive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And our <hi>Minister</hi> there posited but a Cypher to lend more value to the Ordinance. It will appear a gross piece of Mockery, to accept of any One to Council, but onely to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what others shall propound: Nor can the Advantage of Number claim a Right of Opposition, because it may a Right of Institution. The Integrity of that Vote must pass but for suspected, endeauours to avoid the exactest Trial. And Truth may sometime so happily expose herself unto One Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as <hi>his</hi> evidence in Her Distinction may oversway the Censure of a Multitude. <hi>His</hi> Power to agitate thus unprescrib'd,

will lend Him yet but small Advantage to advance the publick Interest, unless <hi>he</hi> can attain like freedom from <hi>himself.</hi> If either the Gravity, Preheminence, or Reputation of others sufficiency united or divided, fetter with Awe the Faculties of <hi>his</hi> minde in a servile Subjection, Dependence, or Relation.

               <p>3. The latter Faculty is the suspension of the Sense from all exterior Objects. From this Obscurity is <hi>Iustice</hi> brought to Light: It will little avail the Dispensation of Rights, to be indued with a Judgement to Discern, and Power to determine, if the corrupted will disguize the Impression.

Since we see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men (more through the Advantage of their Constitution, Passion, or Custom, then the benefit of their Reason) have assumed such a Habit of Resolution in the Exercise of Arms, as seldom formed is, by the most regular Discourse, the proper seat of <hi>Fortitude;</hi> which can admit of Ignorance nor Vice for an Associate in <hi>Her</hi> Faculty. The <hi>Latter</hi> was a stain to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Magnanimity, encountring, if not intending the Ruine of his Countrey.</p>

               <p>The offensive Arme he ought to use against the Incendiaries of this civil Insurrection, is the reversive Opposition of their mutual Force, one Passion being aptly supprest by the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another; yet not with freedom to their proper Motions, but under Reasons Conduct, which only can yield every one a proper allay to their looser Temper, and form their being useful to Her self, wasting or diverting their harmful violence on One Another.</p>

               <p>Antiquity figured <hi>This</hi> Virtue under the Dimension of the same Sex, as formerly the Rest, holding a Cup full of Wine in Her Hand.</p>
               <p>Under the shadow of which single Action, implying the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Her</hi> simple Nature: Of all vertues <hi>This</hi> gives us the nighest Pattern of Mans first Felicity.

               <p>If we shall truly consider the Idea of <hi>Socrates</hi> Discourses; ev'n in the last and exactest Tryal of his Vertue, we shall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceive, that the transcendent Excellence of his Minde was erected on the humble Scituation of <hi>This</hi> Virtue, neither in

Sence or Demeanor figuring so much as the smallest Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Emotion, Force, or Constraint, but with that Calm Facility, delivering his Plea: as Vertue had in Him cast off all Difficulty, the Foil lends Lustre, if not Matter, to Her proper Essence: The Prize of Vertue consisting not in the High, but the orderly Exercise of the Soul; not in Greatness, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which regulateth every Faculty thereof, according to the first Institution, and innocent Condition of Nature. To reflect more particularly on the Nature of <hi>Her</hi> Action figured, which seems to be the Regulation of that sense, most prone to exceed in her Licentious Ministry, and in that Quality of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which soonest seizeth on the Natural Light. Under the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>This</hi> Sense of Tasting, is figured the Appetitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul, as well as that of the Body.</p>
               <p>From the Nature of the Action, which is a necessary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to humane Nature, is figured the Necessity of the Work, whose end is, in the use, confined to <hi>Her</hi> measure. From the Position of the Subject, which is in Hand and View, we may collect, that the exercise of This Vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>In the Quality of the Subject is figured the difficulty of the Work, both in regard of the volubility of the Matter, and the alluring Faculty of the Nature thereof.</p>
               <p>From these figurative Distinctions, we may happily form some Notions essential to the usage of our <hi>Minister:</hi> How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary an Exercise <hi>This</hi> is, will appear in the Advantage or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the use, which tendeth to the due Regulation of every Sense and Passion to the Ministry of Reason, the only light to all his Consultations; which Passions are the very Springs that lend the Soul her proper Motion: which if extinguished, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the usage of the Stoicks, <hi>the</hi> Soul, as <hi>Mountaign</hi> sayes, <hi>Would remain useless in her Functions, like a Bark at Sea, suspended from the succour of the winde:</hi> But if the Passions were abandoned to their irregular Motions, Reason would be transported from her proper seat, with violence of the Agitation, and the exterior Senses become disabled to <hi>Her</hi> Ministry.</p>
               <p>In which Respect, that excess in the use of Wine should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly precede a Consultation, as necessary to the Establishment of Council, may justly be esteem'd, if not a Contradiction, so gross an Absurdity, as no Custom can Authorize, or example parallel: yet among the <hi>Persians,</hi> it was an order so frequently and strictly observed, that it became at length digested to a Rule; on what reason, so extravagant a Custom should be grounded: Reason it self can scarce produce Conjecture, unless

it were by such excess of Wine to animate or correct the vital Spirits in a defective Temper, become so through the innate Intemperature of the Climate, Age, Constitution, or Habit of the Practicers: Which usage. in <hi>Mountaign</hi>'s Observation, so happily encountred the Temper of a <hi>Minister</hi> of State in his time, That he affirms <hi>His</hi> Enemies felt often the Effects thereof to the common prejudice of their Affairs.

A Blemish to the Dignity of <hi>His</hi> Office, in regard such Competition and siding, rather figure our Purpose an Object of our private Commerce, then of the publick Benefit, every man expecting to be advantag'd in their private Interest by Him they have advanc't to a capacity to farther it.

               <p>To persue the Order of our Discussion on the Distinctions of <hi>His</hi> Institution.

It were far safer to require the Presentation of <hi>His Minister</hi> from the concurrence of the <hi>Society,</hi> to which he is to be a Member, under adjur'd Prescription, That without fear or Favour, they shall impartially propound no Person to his Trust, for any other consideration whatsoever, then for the advantage they conceive <hi>he</hi> holds or'e other in His Sufficiency and Integrity. And lest the Nature of this Method might bear some appearance to

form a Faction. The whole <hi>Society,</hi> if of too large a number, may be reduc'd into a small Committee, whose joint concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence onely should have force to nominate the Pretenders, which might amount to such a number, the Majesty of a Prince might in the vast extent thereof, remain unblemished in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>special</hi> Election of <hi>Ministers,</hi> under the sole and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Authority of a State, requires more Caution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause more incident to Faction.

               <p>The <hi>General</hi> Election of <hi>Ministers,</hi> whose Institution hath (with the Princes or States Authority) relation to the concurrence of the People, is yet of higher consequence then the rest; Insomuch, as in such consultation, Laws are usually enacted, reformed or repealed; new Impositions leavied, and weightier Enterprizes managed or design'd; In all which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the People make an essential Surrender of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, Lives, and Liberties to <hi>His</hi> Trust, without pretence of Reparation, the Issues being damageable, since licens'd by Their proper Act; It cannot therefore in reason, be a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warrantable in the selecting of this <hi>Council,</hi> to commit the establishment thereof soly to the Direction of a shallow mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, whose souls do seldom move to other Object, then the sense, prefiguring (in Reference to the Competitors,) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who makes most frequent and most sumptuous Feasts, wholets His Tenants set at easiest Rates, then who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the fairest proofs of Prudence or Integrity, both in the model of His private Oeconomy, and in the intercourse of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Commerce.

               <p>As unbeseeming also is it to the Honour of our <hi>Minister</hi> to betray the Trust of others to the Advantage of His private ends, and so deface the very Image of His Creator, belying <hi>His</hi> own Reason in favor of the Sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secresie</hi> is also, in the very Nature thereof, no less Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the success of a mature Advice. Publique Designs are often frustrated by common Rumour e're they are put in Execution, nor becomes it the Dignity of our <hi>Society,</hi> to make their daily Agitations of so little weight to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of each idle Censure, e're they are fully formed for a timely Issue.</p>

               <p>OUr <hi>Minister</hi> thus imbarqu'd for publick consultation, lest so high an erected Mind should improfitably float on the surface of a doubtful Agitation, and be transported from our use by every irregular Emotion. It will be requisite <hi>He</hi> always have in view the perfect Object of <hi>His</hi> Institution, the better to direct <hi>His</hi> Course, through the Transaction of <hi>His Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> He may at no time deviate from <hi>His</hi> glorious Enterprize.</p>
               <p>All Nations, Sects, and Factions, how differing soever in other Opinions (or repugnant in their Practices to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their own Distinction in this) agree in the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Object of our <hi>Ministry,</hi> positively affirming It to be the <hi>Publique Good;</hi> But in what, the Nature of this <hi>Publique Good</hi> consisted; few have sufficiently enlarg'd upon, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, obscurely, but persu'd her Acquisition; yet under what Definition soever this <hi>publique Good</hi> hath been figured in the Discourses of Immaginary Common-wealths; the secret Practises of all Essential States (exactly discover'd in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disguised Issue,) will truly inform us, the means to attain this <hi>Common Good,</hi> neither is, nor ever hath been really believ'd to have been rais'd on any other Baise then <hi>Wealth, Greatness,</hi> or <hi>Glory.</hi> Which since so generally and passionately persu'd by each united <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>State</hi> we briefly will examine, how farre such Attributes have or may conduce to the exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of our <hi>Edifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, If we shall reflect on the Effects of <hi>Wealth,</hi> as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally dispensed through the several Members of a <hi>Civil Frame,</hi> proportionable to the Quality of every part thereof; we shall find just Cause to suspect there may (ev'n in such Affluence) be an excess, which might be inconsistant to the perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> And although <hi>Riches</hi> may be said to be the Nerves of Warr, armes the security of Peace; Peace the Crown of every <hi>Civil</hi> Enterprize, yet it must still be with this Limitation; That <hi>It</hi> may be proportion'd to the use, Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein a true <hi>Analogie</hi> with the Natural Body, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the most perfect Element whatever, and thereof forming the most perfect Coction and Distribution, may yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, (as Naturalists inform us) in an unequal Repletion, become <hi>Plethorique, quòad vires,</hi> and <hi>quòad vasse,</hi> both in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>of the natural vigor,</hi> or in Regard <hi>of the natural vessels,</hi> and so consequently, either suffacate or extinguish the innate Heat. The proper instrument to all the Faculties thereof, or else extend the Organs beyond the true capacity of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the Production of a dangerous Rupture.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100123:28"/>Persuing the Parallel to this Pattern, we (from the Image of this prefigured Distempers in the Natural) may visibly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect like Inconvenients inherent to the Affluence of <hi>Riches</hi> in the <hi>Civil</hi> structure. In Reference to the four natural Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, either <hi>actively</hi> or <hi>passively</hi> receiving several Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Aptitudes to form the like Disorder.</p>
               <p>1. In the Sanguine Temper, Plenty procures Wantonness, Wantonness, Lux; Lux, Riot, Riot the extinction of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Vital, and Animal Spirits; the immediate Instruments whereby the Faculties of the Soul are educed into act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A proof of this opprobrious Termination is figured to us in the Translation of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empire from <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to the extirpation of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire by the <hi>Greeks;</hi> who as a latter Historian sayes, came equipag'd to the Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Foes, as if design'd to celebrate a Mask, rather then to execute a Fight. And from thence also sprung the Ruine of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Glory, as appears by <hi>Hannibals</hi> Judgement of <hi>Antiochus</hi> Army, when in their ostentive Bravery presented to his view: And by the Macedonian King demanded arrogantly, If that his splendid equipage of War were not sufficient for the <hi>Romans,</hi> replyed <hi>scoffingly, Enough, Enough, were the Romans the most covetous Nation of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We might here farther instance the several Breaches the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Roman</hi> Empire suffered by the like Distemper in sundry changes of the Constitution of their Government, under the Rule of some Licentious Princes; As also the Tragick Issue form'd from hence to <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> Naval Gallantry. But, such extent of Examples (though otherwise agreeing to the Reader, we have, from the first entrance on this work, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to avoid, how fluently soever they might fall into our memory. In that they possibly might swell into a Bulk, not answ'ring in proportion to the due Structure of our <hi>Treatise.</hi> And so instead of Ornament and Illustration to our Arguments, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guize the uniformity of our Method to the obscurity of the sense thereof; which here to re-assume, we must again reflect upon our premised Distinction.</p>
               <p>2. A fluence of <hi>Wealth</hi> meeting with a flegmatick Temper, enduceth Security; Security, Neglect; Neglect Sloth; Sloth benumming the Natural, Vital, and Animal Spirits, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on each others circular contribution, extinguisheth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Heat, so consequently tends unto the same destructive Issue.</p>
               <p>3. Riches encount'ring a melancholly Temper, forms a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Scene to entertain the flattering thoughts with Love of their own Image: Self-Love swells to Self-Conceit, Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to Pride, Pride to Ambition, Ambition to the actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100123:29"/>4. <hi>Opulence</hi> invested by a Cholerick Temper, foments a nice Dislike, Dislike cherisheth Passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Passion Stubbornness, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness Temerity, Temerity Presumption, Presumption Strife, the common Incendiary of a civil union. Secondly, The effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Treasure, in relation to the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> examined, when engrossed in the Exchequer of a Prince or State, may yet be judged of less prevalence to the due forming of our persu'd <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> considering that such affluence to the Publick stock, at length exhausts the private sources, furnish't the encrease, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Trajan the Emperor's Similitude of his Treasury to Tumors <hi>of the Spleen, as which encreas'd the other Members of the Body still were Lestned', and at length perished, deprived of the due proportion of their Aliment, unseasonably attracted to foment such Disorder:</hi> So common Receipts seldom become enriched but by the general Impoverishment of the people: Which Indigence so disableth their faint Bodies, and dejecteth their servile minds, that they are neither useful to the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> in time of Peace, to lend It ornament or enlargement: nor yet in time of War thereto to contribute or Succor or Defence.</p>
               <p>To lend more force unto which Argument we may yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adde, That such Accumulations oftentimes become the only Object of an hostile Invasion, when the indigence of a neighbouring State, opprest with number, debordes their use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less multitude on the most flourishing Continent. To pass over with silence divine Institutions in Reverence thereof, we might affirm this to be the visible motive of the Children of <hi>Israels</hi> penible enterprise through the Desart to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they thereby might exchange their <hi>Onions and Garlick</hi> for <hi>Milk and Honey. 'Twas the deliciousness of their Wine, brought the Gauls into Italy.</hi> By the like inducement were the <hi>Goths, Huns, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Francks</hi> invited to the Devastation of the Roman Empire, by which Assaults the Scepter was at length trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from that Seat.</p>
               <p>2. The second Tract so frequently in use to aborde This our affected <hi>Object,</hi> is <hi>Greatness:</hi> which <hi>Attribute,</hi> although im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying vulgarly a double sence, might seem to want a farther Exposition, either in respect of the qualification of our <hi>Subject</hi> in Power, or in regard of the essence thereof, in Dimension: Yet since the qualification of every Subject may properly be said to be inherent to the Essence thereof, We will reduce the intimation of the former into the intention of the latter. And take a view of this our present <hi>Subject,</hi> according to the Nature of <hi>Proportion,</hi> to weigh how far the vastest extent of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> may properly conduce to the due forming of the <hi>Common Welfare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In persuit whereof, if we shall reflect upon the Course of

Nature (handmaid to the perfect'st Governour) to see what Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits she observes herein to attain perfection in her useful Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. We may distinguish, that she faileth much of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, when she encountreth matter dis-proportion'd to the scope of her intended work, and either falleth under the burden of her proper Continent, her vigor spent or weakened e're she is able to communicate her force to the extreams too remote from their principle, from whence was form'd their union, or raiseth to her self but an imperfect and irregular structure; so that the parts thereof, wanting capacity to receive the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of her Faculties, must hasten to a sudden ruine.</p>
               <p>In the former manner sunck by degrees the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, under his prodigious Immensity.</p>
               <p>In the latter manner vanished immediately the Grecian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire under his unform'd contiguity.</p>
               <p>And according to the same method, ev'n Nature her self seems to haue proceeded in the composure of the whole sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary frame, in favour of our <hi>Civil</hi> union, prescribing scarce accessable Divisions to Scituations of distinct <hi>Communities,</hi> to facilate that Harmony should so arise from the Agreement of such equal Temperatures, in a close Precinct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>: which, in a vaster Latitude, suffering unequal Diversities from those various Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, which the Element, (our common Aliment) conduct to us from the Influxes of the Stars, would prove but too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant in the parts to constitute so unanimous a mixture in our <hi>Civil</hi> Composition, as might be needful to a common union. Such bounds hath Nature wisely trac't to the aspiring <hi>French.</hi> The East part of their Jurisdiction secluded from the Coast of <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Alps;</hi> the South from <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Pyrenean Hills; the North from <hi>Germany,</hi> by the <hi>Rhine;</hi> the West from <hi>England,</hi> by the Sea. So <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are by the <hi>Ocean</hi> wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limited, could but the Rules of Nature or of Reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe any to Avarice and Ambition.</p>
               <p>3. The third pretended conduct to our <hi>Object</hi> is <hi>Glory.</hi> A Tract, 'tis true, not frequently in use, perhaps because not clearly obvious to the refined'st sence; and of most held too slight and inessential a material for the foundation of our <hi>Civil</hi> welfare. Yet when we shall collect from the first model of the <hi>Roman Commonwealth,</hi> what speedy progress, and how lasting Atteintures the ravishing Lustre of <hi>Her</hi> Essence <hi>Heret</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, e're disguis'd with adulterate Ornaments, <hi>She</hi> appear'd in <hi>Her</hi> native purity, we may conclude <hi>She</hi> really out-stript <hi>Those Her</hi> Competitors in the advancement of <hi>Her</hi> purposes.</p>
               <p>What Soul so stupid that shall but reflect on the attractive Graces of their primitive Vertue, that will not without scruple affirm, that the influence thereof won more mindes to their

                  </note> he hath left a lasting Monument to the <hi>Vanity</hi> of his Passion, to <hi>be instil'd a Roman Citizen:</hi> But the splendor of those endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were suddenly ecclipst, when <hi>She</hi> corrupted by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of her Concurrents, <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Greatness</hi> became a common prostitute to their Imposturies. The frailty therefore of <hi>This</hi> Instrument weigh'd with the Imperfection of the former, in reference to the <hi>publick Good,</hi> disclosed thus, enduceth to propound more real and distinguishable Lights to the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our intended <hi>Object,</hi> to which the formerly discussed <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> may consequent Associates often be, but no essential Materials to the composure of our <hi>Civil Structure,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect'st simitry of Rule to form the <hi>publick good,</hi> more properly may thus be figured, <hi>Where by an Authentick, equal, known an insubvertible Law, the Lives and properties of the Members of a Civil Government are timely and impenibly Secured and Improv'd both to the private and the Publick use:</hi> On which Foundation we will endeavour to erect the Structure of our <hi>Civil</hi> Fabrick.</p>

               <p>MAn, from the fall of his first instinctive Purity, abandon'd to his own Direction, retaining an imperfect shadow of the former light, did aptly qualifie him for the Dignity of his first Institution, in this his Independency, became so arrogant and presumptious, he would submit to no prescription but his will, no not by way of precept, lest such an appearance of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the Intellect should seem to intitle other to a fairer Interest in this his forfeited Prerogative: which inflexibility and repugnance of Spirit enforst the wisest Legislators to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto more powerful Aides then humane Reason, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and reclaim so licentious and irregular an Inclination (as counterfeits of <hi>Moses</hi> procedure in his Divine Institution of the Jewdaick Law) pretending all to have received such Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in a supernatural manner, immediately from Heaven.

thus to cheat the sense, the corrupt <hi>Minister</hi> to the will. But such Imposturies may easily be disclos'd in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of their prodigious issues, which bear not the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their pretended pattern.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law exactly represented the Divine Character of such a principle, consisting of two united, yet distinct Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as containing Subjects of a differing Nature, in reference to one only Object, <hi>Common Union;</hi> which equally was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the holy <hi>Word, Love God above all things, and thy Neighbour as thy self:</hi> From which compendious stock were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the inspired <hi>Minister</hi> (for Illustration and Eclarcise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the issuing Branches of the Ceremonial, and the Moral Law. And although the result of the first <hi>Apostolical Council</hi> seems to dispence with such Ordinances, <hi>as a yoke too weighty for their Fore-fathers:</hi> yet is it questionless to be suppos'd in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the original; in which Distinction the <hi>Cabalists</hi> generally seem also to agree: affirming the <hi>Decalogue</hi> only to be the Law of God, the <hi>Appendices</hi> the Institution of Man. This Exposition the sence of <hi>Moses</hi> words (in the Publication thereof) seems implicitly to confirm. The Preface to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Decrees being, <hi>God spake these words and said.</hi> The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the Collateral, <hi>God spake unto Moses and said, say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people.</hi> In consequence of which Argument in obedience to the Institutor, we will positively admit of the principle, as a Rule unto our Ordinances, and in Reverence to his <hi>Minister,</hi> not neglect the Appendices, as a Light unto our Institutions, how which hath been, or yet may be pursued to the exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting an unquestionable <hi>Authority</hi> to a Law, We farther will examine. The Ornaments most in use to the investure of this awful Majesty of Rule, are either (in regard of the Act) form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Custom.</hi> Or (in respect of the Actors) from their <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Pow'r.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between Antiquity and Custom (in Relation to common Rights) there is only this Distinction: The latter may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said to be the unform'd and illegitimate Issue of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, unform'd in regard it bears not the distinguishable signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a digested Law, though it executeth the priviledge thereof, extracting the Virtue of such efficacy from Toleration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather then Commission. Illegitimate in respect the Original thereof alwayes is ambiguous.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Antiquity</hi> (for Reception) pleads the Perfection of Her work, from the stability of the materials thereof: the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety thereof to the use, from the Facility of Her burden (form'd in a long digested Habit) the consequence of the continuance thereof, from the common danger inherent to an Innovation. The essential weight of all which Arguments, we farther will endeavour to discover.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:100123:31"/>The pretended proof of the Perfection of Her work (right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood) is but a Badge to the inherent Distinction of her own Nature. What e're is Aged styl'd, of necessity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the same must have been lasting: Neither doth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Subject fall under the predicament of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, but Quality, <hi>Non quàm Diù sed quam Benè, Not how long, But how well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propriety of her work to the use is improperly posited a consequent to the facility in execution, since we may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times observe ev'n Nature her self translate the use of Parts; which not rightly constituted did frustrate her Intention: so in defect of hands some have exactly written with their feet. Which Action wanting the Grace and Order of Natures Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, may rather be instyl'd a Prodigy, then a perfect Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. Practice may possibly form a Habit in imitation of Nature or of Reason, which properly are consonant unto the Rules of neither. In discovery whereof, if we shall search into the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Models of <hi>Civil</hi> Government, we shall finde therein such ridiculous Absurdities (notwithstanding the common Union hath been lasting, and perhaps flourishing) that a clear judging Spirit will admire how the reverence of this Idol should keep enlightned Ages in such servility, as not to dare to handle her yet remaining Relicks: probably this may be in honour of the Vertue and Felicity of the Communities of those times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of such Institutions may be thought to have been the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Instruments, when really they are not so much as the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Relatives thereto. But the happy issues only of mans decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet not totally subverted Innocence, as nigher the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of his first Purity: but when this wilde distemper had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to a more eminent extream, exacter Rules became requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to rectifie the disorder.</p>
               <p>The third pretence whereby <hi>Antiquity</hi> may claim a right to her Establishment, is the consequent danger to an Innovation. 'Tis true, all Alterations, how profitable soever, bear in their Introduction an appearance of damage, especially not rightly managed (as when too sudden, or to the preceding directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite:) Yet any Pilate, though but meanly skill'd, may easily avoid those shelves, insinuating his Purposes by imperceptible Degrees, and guiding them obliquely to their End.</p>
               <p>Yet lest this notion (in the ejection of Antiquity from the right of a just Authority to the Institution of a Law) should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together seem impertinent to the use of that <hi>Community,</hi> to which this Treatise is peculiarly addressed. To enlighten the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our Argument, we humbly crave permission to weigh the consequence of a proof, extracted from our common usage.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:100123:31"/>Omitting to insert intails of Lands by private Act or Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (although the Tenors thereof terminate in the succeeding consequence) because therein perhaps may be alledg'd, the Laws were guided by the intention of the Donor, in the disposing only of his own. We will disjoyn them from all other Reference, and leave them soly to their proper issue, admitting (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>A man (by his own acquisition) become possessed of a real Estate dies intestate, and leaves surviving a dozen Children, Males and Females: The Law confers the said Possessions wholly on the eldest Son, in right of His Succession, with small regard or none unto the Rest,</hi> who thereby are enforced to subsist on Almes or Servitude.</p>
               <p>With all due reverence to our Legislative Power, can the allowance be adjuged equal? where the very innate form of Natures Rules (so sweetly and infallibly guide every Beast by secret and instinctive Motives to the impartial preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their kind) may seem extinguished.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Law less dissonant to <hi>Moses</hi>'s Moral Institutions, <hi>Which to the Primogenitor only, yield a double share, as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Birth-right.</hi>

               <p>But to make clearer discoveries into the Nature of this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, if we shall yet farther visit the secret props of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation by such Lights are afforded us to make Inspection into so obscure and remote circumstances, we may finde, that private Vanity and Faction have been the chief Promoters of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, to which (not being of power sufficient to form it to a Rule) may probably be joyn'd the Ambition of the Institutor, as the depending Aids to his support.</p>
               <p>How common and ridiculous a Passion hath transported the sence of man to perpetuate the glory of his Name by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of their Families, our Nation daily may afford too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and deplorable proofs; where it is become a plausible practice, to abandon their own proper issue, to raise their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory on so vain a shadow, that it wants frequently or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or relation to lend it a pretence to such Inherency. <hi>This distemper of the minde destroy'd that Miracle of the world at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>where the obscured Actor wanting, or worth, or wealth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his memory, lest dead he were forgot, would make his Name remarkable to all succeeding Ages by the eminence of his Mischief.

               <p>That faction should advance this Institution, it is probable

(such being the unlimited Envy and Avarice of Man) that (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all other appearance of Enmity aside) the most equitable enlargement of one Family near another, is of sufficient preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to engender secret Emulations, which are not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in such obscure Limits, but suddenly break forth to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ruptures of Dissention, which to foment (they dying) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract their Faculties in one Principle, thereby to contribute more force to encounter Opposition.</p>
               <p>The Interest of the Institutor may hereto also concur, whose greatness consisting in the Power of his Homogers, did consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute such Tenors to Possessions, as might no way be weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ned by Divisions, when summoned to his succor.</p>
               <p>But the most material Inconvenience inherent to this <hi>Civil</hi> practice, is altogether repugnant ev'n to the very Nature and Primitive Intention of the Law, which is <hi>Civil Union;</hi> and so much the more prejudicial is the consequence, by how much the Breach thereof is nearer the original of Unity, Amity, or Friendship, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirms, Legislators have in the establishment of their <hi>Civil</hi> Structure, more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then Justice it self. Can there be a more visible, Impulsive, and sensible cause of Division between Brothers, then that the Legitimate Children of one Father should (through necessity be reduced into Dependance, Subjection, nay Servitude one of another, without the advantage of any other Endowment, then the precedence of a little time. <hi>It was the apprehension of such unequal subordinacy did instigate the Patriarch's combining issue to sell their Brother into Forreign slavery: when yet his innocent Age was capable to form no other shadow of Inenmity, then this their envious jealousie.</hi>

               <p>The other Baise whereon the Authority of a Law may be judg'd firmly constituted, is the Virtue or Power of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor.</p>
               <p>That the reflexion of <hi>Vertue</hi> (how remote soever) hath ever had a powerful Influence over the Spirits of succeeding Ages, is altogether unquestionable, whereon perhaps was grounded this Custom amongst the Lacedemonians, <hi>That, what Law or Advice was first propounded by a vicious Agitator, if approved of, some Person of an eminent Vertue was by the General Council immediately required to pronounce the same, lest such a motion should want that Grace and Dignity, was requisite to lend Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Establishment thereof.</hi> But that the Institutions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by person or Assembly so exactly qualified, form'd from no other Object then the particular Occurrence of those Times, should totally so o're-sway the Judgement of succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministers, as to admit of them for unalterable Positions, beyond the confirmation of their own Discourse, is but a servile

                  <hi>Power</hi> (simply posited) though it may seem at first Inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to claim a high and more legitimate Title to this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as the affected Issue of such eminence, yet when we more exactly search into the secret nature thereof, in Relation to this Attribute, we shall so far dissent to subscribe to her Interest herein, we altogether shall suspect her very appearance in the managing of a Legislative Transaction: insomuch as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussions of an imperturbed Reason are soly requisite to the due Constitution of a perfect Law, whose issue circumscrib'd but by the meer Parado of a force is oftentimes obstructed, if totally not subverted. Violence, though ne're so fairly polished, bears but the exteriour semblance of a wrong: nor is it proper, that what intruding in our private Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, may legally dispence us from the <hi>civil</hi> Ties of our own Act, should be admitted to the Introduction of a common Ordinance. A due ordered force may, and must, of necessity, be the subordinate Minister to the Execution of the Laws, but not a president o're the Consultations thereof. The order of our Argument, circumspectly traced, will lead us to a consequent without a proposition; which is, that the most plausible and unquestionable Authority of a Law is that, <hi>Which is formed from the free agitation of the most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and faithful Ministers, and established by the unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the people.</hi> According to this Method was even the Law of God published by <hi>Moses,</hi> and by <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and confirmed by the assenting Multitude; And if that holy and powerful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign would not exact an obedience from the work of his own hand (though tending only to their proper Benefit) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Covenant, which could no otherwise be constituted, but by consent of parties. How irregular and unwarrantable are their proceedings, who violently impose a severe Ordinance to the reducing of their equals into servilty (altogether to their prejudice) not only without their liking, but absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the same. The primitive intention of a Law, is the good of the people, and how that should conduce thereto, which shuns the test of common approbation, may certainly be term'd a Mystery, but scarce receiveable in Equity.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, may be objected, that hereto as the Natural, so the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Body is incident to Infirmities, that sometime may deprive It of capacity to relish their own Common Aliment, much less to leave it Faculty to distinguish of Artificial Remedies; which reaching not their Judgments, do often not affect their will.

rectifie such disorder, the will must be prepar'd, or prepossest; convinc't with Reason, or intic't with Art: otherwise an open and repugnant violence will but exalt the Distemper, and so instead of repairing, or reforming, totally subvert the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a <hi>Civil</hi> Frame.

               <p>FRom this Attribute the very Law it self seeming to form her proper Nature, it may be judged altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to lend thereto farther Distinction: yet when we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that every perfect Ordinance must (of necessity) have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference not only to the <hi>Offence,</hi> but to the <hi>Delinquent;</hi> and the <hi>Injured</hi> it will be very material to weigh the due Conformity, a Law should hold with either.</p>
               <p>The true Analogy of a Law in Relation to the <hi>Trespass,</hi> be it either Omissive or Commissive, Publick, or Private, is an equal Reparation; on which Parallel was raised the severe Injunction of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth.</hi> On the decision of this due proportion, Justice in her Figure seems altogether intentive, in the firm Posure of her hand to the exact Poisure of her Ballance. Laws in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance may sometime extend their weight beyond the Nature of the Crime, tending especially to the publick use, by such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to restrain the rashness of Licentious Attempters: but in their execution should secretly provide a charm to allay the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, lest that the <hi>Civil</hi> frame should thereby else be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or Impoverished. Those Ornaments will ill become the Majesty of a State, are become purple in her proper Gore; nor is it consonant to the Dignity of a Law, to form a Commerce for Delinquency: As there are rewards for publick Offices, without the expence of the common Treasure: so there are Penalties for publick Damages, subvert not Interests of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate



<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100123:33"/>
Family. Which ne'retheless must with a nice discretion still be managed: a danger to the State may equally ensue the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missness, as the strictness of a Law. In dispencing yet of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Rights, the Law (without Impeachment) more firmly may adhere unto the litteral sence thereof: Insomuch as the publick Ministry is therein seemingly not much concern'd, but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely interessed, taketh away the Jealousie of a partial Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Edicts erected only for the publick Interest, seldom have other objects then the Obedience of the Members of the <hi>Civil</hi> Body; whose infringement may therefore be plausibly repaired in a due Submission. Decrees enacted to the support of private Interests, have seldom other Object then the Decision of Right, whose infringement seems properly repaired in a feisable restitution; yet since the violation of a private right is seldome perpetrated without indignity to the publick <hi>Ministry,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or Disorder, a submissive Penalty (of right) is thereto also, ev'n therein, to be constituted, the better to support the Majesty thereof; provided it may not be so considerable, to lend her the suspition of a Party in the Transaction.</p>
               <p>According to this Distinction (in reference to the Decision of Private Rights) were <hi>Moses</hi> Institutions parallel'd: as in matters of Felony, <hi>He shall restore it double, and if he be worth nothing, he shall be sold for his Theft.</hi>

               <p>The Gospel Institution is, that <hi>He shall steal no more, but rather labour with his hands that he may be helpful to others.</hi> Which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless implicitly must thereby first infer a reparation to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. Yet since all private dammage is inherently opposed in a common Consequence to the publick Interest, if we shall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consider this crime as a breach of publick Commerce; the equilibriate thereof may seem to reach no vaster Latitude, then publick Infamy. <hi>This the Lacedemonian Custom vised at, as the due Penalty to the attainture of a Felony; which otherwise, not surprized in the manner, was held a plausible enterprize, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed but to acuate the vigilance and Invention of the people, to the preserving and improving of their Properties.</hi> Which Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, (though not approvable in the use, that Virtue passing of necessity for suspected, which holdeth but a shadow of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance with the Ministry of Vice: yet may we from the former presidents (to the restraint of this Crime) form a mixt Method of our Punity, as more equivolently proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned unto the nature of the Offence; compos'd of Restitution, and of Infamy: And although the latter may perhaps not meet with that Efficacy in our vulgar people, with whom this Crime most frequent is in practice; as it hath formerly incountred in the more elevated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To which, may probably be the cause, in reference to the infringement of the publick interest, in such Trespasses, our Laws do yet exact the Attainture of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons Goods.</p>
               <p>2. In persuit of the Order of our Subject we next assume the second consequent involved in the Constitution of a perfect Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. <hi>The Delinquent,</hi> which although seeming totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the regulation of the Penalty to the Nature of the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:</hi> and in position of a Fact implicitely therewith included as one common Individual: yet since the Rules of Nature, as well as Policy, have lent peculiar Distinctions to several Members of a Community (not falling all under one and the same measure of Capacity, and therewithal, as special Graces to their Dignities or Infirmities, inherent Priviledges; it will be requisite to weigh how far such Freedom may consist with the integrity of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ordinance. Omitting to discuss on the Prerogative of Princes, as being a Subject of too vast a Latitude to be a branch of a peculiar Treatise, as also that they seldom agitate, but by their substitutes, who falling under the subjection of a Law, are not alwayes secluded from the common course thereof; or if sometime they be, it seldom under shelter is of the Authority of a Law, of whose equality we only are in search. We will proceed to agitate on the subsequents sequestered either in Goods or Person, from the attainture of a publick Ordinance, by Virtue of their eminence, under three Principles, <hi>Peer, Priest,</hi> and <hi>Publick Minister.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Peer</hi> pretendeth for the ground of his Priviledge in relation to his Person, the necessity of his Attendance on the Prince, as the essential Lustre to his Majesty, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Goods, the vast expence which follows this his Assiduity.</p>
               <p>To which we may Object, that the Lustre of a Princes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty consists not altogether in such titular Distinctions; but in the Virtue, Integrity, Wisdom, Gravity and Civil Reverence of his Ministry, which were yet more illustrated in the disclaiming such a Priviledge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Priest</hi> in right of the protection of his Person, pleads the Dignity of his Function, as not subordinate to the <hi>Civil</hi>

                  <hi>Ministry.</hi> For dispensation to his Property: the sanctified use thereof divided in the Inherence from the <hi>politick</hi> Body. This claim hath formerly been the subject of many violent and some tragick Contestations, licensing the appeal of Prelates to Ecclesiastical Conclaves in matters of <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction: but since this usage is at present of no force with us: we will not much insist on the Discussion: only thus much we may thereon infer, that if in honor of their Function there should be this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Reverence due unto their Person, or Reservation to their Properties, it equitably must be under this Distinction; so long as they contain the Action of their Lives within the Limits of that Holy Exercise; and their Possessions thereto only Relative.</p>
               <p>The Publick <hi>Minister</hi> may seem to lay a more legitimate Title to such Priviledge; insomuch, as of necessity, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is to be secluded (in a manner) from the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, to giue attendance soly in the most material Interests thereof: In which Agitation the Faculties of his minde are wholly so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grost, conveniently they cannot be relaxt, or yet diverted by a useful reflection on his own: yet in respect that such immunity may seem to question the integrity of the transactions of his private Commerce: whose Life should so far be from all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Reproach, that it should be exactly exemplary. His Institution will be more agreeable and Injunctions valuable in their apprehensions, to whose advantage he is design'd to Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, if therein equally concerned with the rest. Nor can it be of use to him, so to be sheltred from the Issue of the Law, whose proper Dignity speaks him a Law unto himself, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unequal suffrage that lends Authority to any man to <hi>agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of Common Rights,</hi> who violates the Image thereof in his private Dealings.</p>
               <p>The Subjects secluded from the common course of Laws, in favour of their Incapacity, have a more rational claim to such Priviledge, As a Wife, Children, and Servants, whose persons in some cases are dispenced from the Penalty of publick Disobedience, as subordinate Members to a more distinct Head, who only is responsable to the publick for their Miscarriages, freed from the ingagements of their private Contracts, insomuch as their Dependance is upon anothers Property, in their possession only but in Trust. Lunaticks and Ideots yet justly reach a vaster Latitude of exclusion in their Acts (wholly divided from the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame) wanting the Faculty to distinguish them.</p>
               <p>The third and last Collateral implied in the Letter of an ex act Ordinance, is the <hi>Injured,</hi> of whom most penal Statutes hold but small account, regarding more perhaps the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a publick Disturbance, then of a private Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Publick Discontents</hi> gather more slowly and imperceptably to a head, but are more violent and sudden in eruption; and seeming more plausibly commenced, become more licentiously prosecuted, being pre-possest with Indignation, both against <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Ministry,</hi> inconsiderately without distinction, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally reverse the Institution of either, <hi>As may be instanc't in the proceeding of those Tribes revolted from the Government of</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam, <hi>with him forsaking both the Temple and the sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi>

               <p>Perhaps hereto may be objected, that the Nature of the <hi>Law</hi> so frequent is in use, the Virtue <hi>thereof</hi> cannot lie conceal'd, but daily is revived by some occular Proof.</p>
               <p>Omitting to insert the hazzard of a <hi>Light</hi> educ't from such Collation, in that the circumstances rarely meet in a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we farther may reply, that ev'n in revolution of many Ages some <hi>Laws</hi> meet not with any accident so fully toucheth every clause therein,, as might render the issue fully clear: nor also any clause contain'd in every Law, doth clearly answer every accident, may possibly fall under the proper object of the same, as may appear in <hi>Moses Appeal to the Almighty, for the decision of the claim of</hi> Zealophehad's <hi>Daughter in the common partage of the promis'd Land:</hi> In which regard, few <hi>Laws</hi> can be produc't, are so exactly constituted, that will not often want enlargement or enlightning.</p>

                  <hi>Laws in repugnance of their Nature</hi> tend yet more visibly to the subversion of <hi>their</hi> Institution; the which at first inspection may perhaps appear so gross an absurdity, as is hardly credited to be feisable in the deliberate result of a rational consultation.

               <p>E'Re we had qualified our <hi>Civil Ministry</hi> with those essential Attributes, which might lend Ornament and use to <hi>Her</hi> Investure, it would have first been requisite to the exact simitry of our Structure, to have enlarged more peculiarly on the true Definition of her Nature: But finding no material Mystery therein, we have persu'd the Order of the Letter, In favour of the Propriety of our Tongue, prefiguring the shadow e're we disclose the subject, and here accordingly give place to <hi>Her</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Law is a prescription, or a Rule impos'd by the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Nation, on every Member of Capacity, within the Limits of the Civil Union, to restrain each mans Actions from the Prejudice, and guide them to the mutual Benefit of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> So that we may positively affirm, as reason is seated in the natural Body for the direction of the active Members to their proper use, and <hi>Ministry</hi> to the rest: so the Law is consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, as a due conduct to our private Rights, and common preservation; neither can there be any proper distinction in their Faculties, both issuing from one source, and directed to one end: only Nature in that, form'd <hi>Her</hi> Jurisdiction in a smaller continent; which Policy in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a vaster Latitude. And what the <hi>First</hi> composed only to one, and for the benefit of one, the latter constituted to many, and for the advantage of many; from which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence we may conclude, that as <hi>Nature</hi> proceedeth in the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting



<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100123:39"/>
of a light to guide her <hi>Ministry. Policy</hi> must follow that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible light to the direction of <hi>Hers. Laws</hi> totally divest their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their proper Use; and Dignity, when they but swerve from Her Prescription: A proof whereof we perfectly discover in the Constitution of those Commonwealths, which live only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the first purity of Nature, wherein those common Crimes against which our <hi>Laws</hi> have formed their severest vigour, have not so much as Intimation in their <hi>Letters.</hi> To this the Apostle yields his evidence, affirming, <hi>That some not knowing the Law, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed those things contained in the Law, and were a Law unto themselves.</hi> Informed by that innate Light of Nature, Reason in her uncorrupted Purity, which secretly did prompt them, <hi>To do unto others, as they would that others should do unto them.</hi> But when man fell from the Rules of Nature to live according to Art and Opinion, he wrested <hi>This</hi> Light to their adulterate uses, and guided <hi>That</hi> should have directed him.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, every perfect Ordinance extends It self to the two foresaid Objects, <hi>The preservation of a distinct Right.</hi> And <hi>The Advantage of a mutual Benefit:</hi> as they are to be enfolded in one Rule, so they must not be divided in their <hi>Ministry.</hi> The just Interest of one must not so strictly proceed, as to subvert the existence of another: Such severity would utterly pervert the Nature of a Law, rendring <hi>Summum Ius, Summa Injuria, The utmost Right the highest Injury.</hi> In which regard, perhaps the Institutors of our <hi>Law,</hi> foreseeing the difficulty to unite these Heads in one Prescription, have divided them in their Natures, constituting distinct Courts to the peculiar <hi>Ministry</hi> of either, styling the one, Law; the other <hi>Equity, This</hi> only form'd to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the Rigour of <hi>That. Moses</hi> Moral Institutions had in every particular an especial regard in regulating the extreams of <hi>Civil</hi> Rights, <hi>One man might take anothers Coat for Pledge, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit ed to retain it longer then till night.</hi> Perhaps, lest he not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving other shelter to defend him from the Injury of that season, might possibly thereby incurr the hazard of his Life. <hi>In matters of private loan, all usury was interdicted:</hi> Prefiguring this course should only be an aid unto necessity, no <hi>Minister</hi> to Lux or Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.

The first Curse Man incurr'd, was for his Disobedience to his Creator, which in the Issue found an advantageous Cure.

               </p>
               <p>The first <hi>Subject</hi> considerable, on whom a violence may be practised, is (according to the Rule of God and Nature) that which each man acts upon himself: The ground whereof is hardly evident to a moral sence, which only measures the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the exteriour Actions, according to the damages su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained by another, prefiguring, without such Reference, each man might justly claim a priviledge in the disposure only of his own: in which regard perhaps the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> have assumed so much Glory from this Enterprise, hereby, as they conceiv'd, triumphing o're the Malice of their Fate, though peradventure

the Temerity might (more equitably according to their own Rules) merit, the reproach of Lachety, then the applause of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, since so ignominious an Evasion, betrayes not only the abjectness of the minde, but the infirmity of Nature, as well in the Anticipation of an evil, by an irrational Apprehension, as in the distrust of our Faculties, to undergo the encounter. The exercise of Fortitude is opposition; not flight: But yet this Consequence, if assented to, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not reach the Nature of this Crime: we therefore must make use of higher speculation to the Discovery. To ascend thereto, if we shall make the first step on the Base of Natures Rules, <hi>This Act</hi> will totally appear repugnant to her Order, <hi>Chaque Chose suit ce que la destruit.

               <p>To which may probably be objected, that a man may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time be reduced to that exigence, which probably may figure an authentick Summons.</p>
               <p>In reply whereto we may alledge, that such extreams are not distinguishable to humane sence, the Power and Providence of our Protector being unlimitable in the Measure, and inscrutable in the Manner, <hi>Snatching Daniel from the Iaws of the hungry Lion, and</hi> Jonas <hi>from the entrails of the Whale.</hi> Nor is such Grace dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, rarely or in favour only of his Prophets: as may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc't in * a Grecian Captain's <hi>Delivery by a Fox from out the Entrails of the Earth, for dead, by his Enemies cast in an Abiss, from whence no humane Art nor Industry could have withdrawn him by a timely succour.</hi>

               <p>The subject next material in reference to a violence is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parent, without distinction, and not without a valid consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, there being not a more legitimate inherency to Rule, then that which is the immediate cause to our Production.

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100123:41"/>In constituting Laws to the Restraint hereof, most Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have (in the primitive texture of their <hi>Civil</hi> Frame) been altogether negligent, either concluding, that nature had in such Relation too powerful an influence in her Impressions, to want the aid of artificial Ministry, or else reflecting on the common frailty of our Nature, which took more violence from restraint, forbore to agitate on such a Crime, as jealous to awake the faculty of Malice in such Discussion: So silently for many years, past unexprest, because unpractised, this <hi>Fact</hi> among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, till time, which lends Maturity to our Corruption, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't a Monster in her horrid Pattern, which then gave Light to this Infliction, <hi>The Patracide was tyed close in a Sack, and cast into the Tyber.</hi> A penalty perhaps by them esteem'd sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly severe, in that it figured not only a Division of the Soul from her frail Mansion, but an extinction. Yet e're we shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist to agitate on our Subject, we farther will examine the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Crime, in Reference to the other Members of a Family.</p>
               <p>Having discussed hereof in Relation to the Childrens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour to their Parents, we may insist upon the Wifes unto the Husband; whom though the Mystical Ceremony hath united in one Body, <hi>Affirming them to be but one Flesh:</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless since <hi>Civil</hi> Rules have lent a difference of Dignity in the Distinction of Parts, most proper to the Constitution of their union. The nature of the Trespass may possibly in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Husband meet a weightier Imputation, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Servants</hi> have a more subordinate Dependence on the Head of a Family, having from them their Livelihood, in Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration only of their due submission to his Will. In contempt or repugnance whereof, if their demeanour shall proceed to act a <hi>Violence</hi> on his Person.

In persuit of our Order, should here ensue a like Discussion on that <hi>Violence,</hi> the Master of the Family should Act upon the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But since therein is found no legal Distinction in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Act, from what is practised on other Members of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, more then the Infamy which justly followeth the Breaches of so nigh Relations.

to whom he doth officiate, as a contempt or Opposition to her Order: In which respect perhaps, this Fact (on Him) extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a higher Consequence (then on the former Subjects) might justly claim precedence in our Order, to all those our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited Distinctions, had not <hi>Policy</hi> succeeded unto Natures Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, both in her Pattern and Establishment. All other Persons of what Degree or Quality soever, Noble or Ignoble, Alien or Denison, in Reference to his Trespass fall in the Ballance of one common Estimate. The <hi>manner</hi> how this Trespass may be acted, well considered, will vary much the Nature of the Crime, lending thereto more weight or less from whence the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty receives due Regulation. The common differences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may visibly be reduc't to these Distinctions, <hi>Encounters, Duels, Surprises,</hi> in the first Principle. The intention of the Agent (which soly lends material Consequence to the Fact) seems wholly disengaged. In the <hi>Second,</hi> the intent of both seems clearly pre-ingaged.

               <p>If <hi>Encounters</hi> admit of a double Distinction, being such as are meerly <hi>Casual,</hi> having no farther motive then the present Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or <hi>Collateral,</hi> having Relation to some former Difference; yet so as neither Time nor place were pre-advised of either: If pre-advised of Both (as oftentimes is practised, to shun the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream severity of the Law, disguising so the Action) then falls the Nature of this Trespass under the Distinction of a <hi>Duel.</hi> If but of one determined, the Fact may properly be tearmed a <hi>Surprise.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Casual Encounters,</hi> what e're the Issues thereof are, have the most specious pretence to plead for their Indulgence; in that the first motive of the incensed will is not oft-times within the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Command of the most regular minde, which herein but inform'd by unconsulted Appearance may facily seduce the Judgment to prosecute the sense: yet since no Imperfection how naturally soever inherent to our frail Condition (within the true Capacity of our <hi>Civil Union</hi>) can plead a priviledge to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice Another.

if he be foil'd, he justly payes the forfeit to his own Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, who else declining the attempt, might legally have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd the Advantage of his Injury, without contesting for an equal satisfaction.</p>
               <p>To which may possibly be alledg'd, that the <hi>first,</hi> most <hi>just</hi> and impulsive Law of Nature prompts every living Creature, (for their proper safety) to rise in Opposition in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Nor is he half secur'd that relies only on the passive Part.</p>
               <p>In answer to the objection we reply, the Law requireth but a visible declining from the Action, to acquit him of the event thereon ensues: To which, although perhaps <hi>It</hi> seems to have prescrib'd too vast a Latitude, as <hi>to retreat until he can Retire no farther:</hi> in which he probably may be slain e're he attains those Bounds. Yet other Circumstances that may reach the Intention of the Law therein, in Reason may acquit him unless the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing judge presume too much on his Authority to tye his Censure soly to the strictness of the <hi>Letter.</hi>

               <p>The trespass may hereon ensue unto the publick, is either in Respect of the Common Disturbance, <hi>Breach of Peace;</hi> or in Regard of the loss of a <hi>Subject, Man-slaughter.</hi> To <hi>that</hi> our Law hath equitably imposed Imprisonment or Fine. To this a total forfeiture of their <hi>Goods.</hi> Yet more effectually to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint hereof might possibly succeed the Influence of severer Laws, directed to suppress such Incivilities, as commonly are the Ground to such Disorders, in which most Civil Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons seem totally defective.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collateral Encounters,</hi> by our Laws, are not distinguishable from positive <hi>Duels,</hi> though herein Time or Place concur not with the motive in the Intention. In that the Reference of a former Breach prefigures a Design to persue the event to which Occasion then administers, remaining still an unremitting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity betwixt the efficient and the effect. Yet when we shall reflect on the Infirmity of humane Nature, which in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect'st Temper not alwayes is provided with sufficient Aids to check the suddain Motives of the Sense; but having often pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively sustained the Indignity of the extreamest out rages, may sometime be provok't to yield unto a less, the Spirits pre-dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed insensibly attracting the Flame, was formerly to them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, leaving no intermission for Discourse to agitate on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of the transported will: as also frequency in Injury may possibly proceed to an irresistable Importunity: And in an Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Solicitation, exact that our will assents not to, <hi>Potentia motata fit furor.

                  <hi>Private Duels,</hi> taken in the strictest sence, are only single Combats, in Weapon time and place determinable, sprung from no other ground then sence of Injury, nor prosecute other object then Revenge, though Both oft-times seem measur'd by the resentment of some others, more then by our own: Vanity the litigious pretender to Honour, must court her looser Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (vulgar Opinion) to attain his Prostitute. A ridiculous Motive to an arrogant Assumption, pretending both to Right and Power to arbitrate and to Execute in our proper Interests, in Contempt or Misprision of the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction: so that we may conclude, according to the Event, the Trespass is from Others of this Nature, but distinguishable in an oftentive At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, whether the extent hereof may possibly reach the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Murder, perhaps in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules, may be disputable. In that the Intent, which soly is effectual to qualifie the Fact with such Distinction, seems fully prepossest to use the uttermost Ability to take away anothers Life: yet, in Respect, the persuit is with equal hazzard of our own, meeting like purpose in the Opposition, such Attribute <hi>Hereto</hi> too strictly seems implyed, though not by Law for such too strictly punished: First, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as in such Procedure, the injured seems to usurp the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction, in persuit of his own unequal satisfaction, as also, in that the Tragick Issues of such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts often do engage succeeding Families, to their Inemnities thereon sprung, in like Oppositions. Furthermore, in that such Action passing with Impunity, may seem (i'th vulgar Voice) to constitute that Glory on a Crime, which soly should be proper to a vertuous Enterprise.</p>
               <p>One Controversie, inherent to our <hi>Subject,</hi> yet rests undiscust, whether the <hi>Seconds</hi> (acting no farther then to secure the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> from indirect Advantages, or treacherous practises) may equitably be attainted by the Law, as Accezoir, or Complice to the Fact. In solution whereof, we may reply, That since the <hi>Seconds</hi> were privy to the Intention of the Principles, which they had power to frustrate by Information of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, they, as Collaterals, may be accounted guilty of the event, in favouring so their purposes.</p>

                  <hi>Relative surprises</hi> are such, wherein the Trespasser, through Negligence or Presumption, obliquely only is concern'd, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under his Tuition, Guard, or Custody, the Subject, Beast, or Person, through distemper prone to act a <hi>Violence.</hi> This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wilful <hi>Violence Moses</hi> reflected on, though possibly not in so large extent, as totally might concern the Nature of such Accidents: Yet sufficiently to lend a perfect Rule to form an Ordinance unto the equal Prosecution of any in this Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exprest. <hi>If an Oxe shall gore a man that he dye, the owner or keeper thereof being formerly advertised of such a disposition in the Beast, the Penalty of the Trespass shall be the forfeiture of his Life: but so, That for a certain sum of Money, as a Fine, his Life shall be redeemable.</hi> The ground hereof is evident, being in regard the owner had capacity to have restrained them from such an Execution. To which, common humanity ought to have been a competent Injunction.

               <p>The Reference of an intentional Instigation to a violence, might orderly seem reduced under this Distinction: but since such Procedure falls under common Notion of a Principle, we should too far swerve from the positive Rule of <hi>Right,</hi> to lend them here but a Relation to the Fact, another executes by their direction: the nature whereof more properly is comprised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Distinction of the <hi>Essential.</hi>

A <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> there seems more immediately perpetrated in the presence of that high Judge, who soly to himself reserveth Vindication, and consequently denotes a great Insolence in Contempt of his Ordinance.

               <p>Private Divisions breaking into Actions of Hostility within the <hi>Princes Residence</hi> or Court of Judicature, highly exalt the Nature of Commotions: For that in such Timerity, the Agents seem totally to cast off the Imposition of the <hi>Civil Iurisdiction,</hi> violating so presumptuously the <hi>Ordinances</hi> thereof, under the immediate notion of her <hi>Ministers,</hi> which properly might seem to figure an open Insurrection against the <hi>Civil Power.</hi>

so absolute, as in some cases, the <hi>Civil</hi> Power seems there to limit her just Procedure, allowing him it the priviledge of a Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Whither <hi>Private</hi> Acts of Hostility perpetrated under a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Jurisdiction, may justly be subordinate to the Censure of our native Laws, or any other forth the Jurisdiction, wherein they were committed, is, in practice, negatively concluded: Yet in Reason, may affirmatively be asserted under this Distinction. If the effects of the Contention do reach no higher Nature then a Civil Trespass; the Civil Jurisdiction, wherein It was in Act, is soly therein interessed. But if the Consequence thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto a higher Nature, as to infringe the Law of God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Nations, the guilt can equitably not be dispensed with by any other exterior Jurisdiction, constituted under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of such Ordinance, if legally therein prosecuted, In that although the Jurisdictions are distinguished in Power, yet have they but one Object in their Rule, in reference to the Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass; in which respect mankinde may properly be said to form but <hi>one Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farthermore, the Issue of the Fact extending only to a <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass may sometime possibly concern the Dignity of a <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> wherein It was not executed; if primitively the Debate had there original and Intentionally transacted forth the Bounds <hi>thereof,</hi> but to avoid the rigour of the Law.

The more essential consequence of a <hi>wòlful Violence,</hi> whereat the Law most viseth to direct her Censure, is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or <hi>Measure</hi> of the effect, accompanieth the Fact: insomuch as the clearest Circumstance whatever is capable to yield but an obscure evidence of the intention, which really if perceptable, might properly perhaps qualifie the Nature of the Trespass. As also in That, <hi>This</hi> alwayes answers not the Damage of the Injured, whose reparation is the Principal, if not the sole Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Justice. As for the premised Collaterals considerable in perpensation of the Fact, <hi>Subject, Manner, Place,</hi> (simply, or joyntly taken) they reach no higher consequence then a <hi>Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,</hi> wherein the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction seems principally concern'd, which in it self indued with a Faculty to dispence a Grace (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the prejudice of the injured) may plausibly suspend Reflection from her proper Interests, to weigh the satisfaction of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; whose injury must questionless, fall under Latitude of these Distinctions. <hi>A Forcible Interruption.

The Penalty therefore (not without reparation to the injured) dependeth more materially on the Publick Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: yet in that such Attempts may sometimes meet with other Circumstance, in <hi>Subject, Place,</hi> or <hi>Manner,</hi> as possibly may extend the Nature of the out-rage to a Criminel Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

               <p>
                  <hi>Curative</hi> Remedies are such Medicines, as by the general Consultation of the Natural Ministry are composed to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick use, and by a Civil Injunction formed at the publick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Purgative</hi> Remedies have a more peculiar Reference to the Circumspection of the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry, although the Advice of the natural not totally therein is to be excluded, which tendeth only to the purging of the Habitations, Utensils, Vestures of Infected Persons, either by <hi>Aire, Fire, Water, Fumes,</hi> pollishing or demollishing; insomuch, as the Infection undistinguisht may remain conceal'd, not only past the tearm of <hi>Civil</hi> Circumseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; but after the elapse of many years sometime break forth into a new eruption to the publick prejudice.</p>

               <p>NO Moral Argument can more evidently confirm the fall of Man from the first Purity of his Nature, then <hi>This</hi> his acquired Misery; it being a Reproach to our Creator to figure an Insufficiency in his hand-maids Ministry: And although Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (suffering under the sentence of Mans Original Transgression) may seem declined from the Perfection of her primitive Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Retraction of his Grace, had formerly lent more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence unto the support of her Order; yet did such Affluence tend rather to the enlargement of his Felicity, then the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his existence, whose being had rather then for Object his Speculation then his Action; but having in the unhappy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of his Function, sorfeited the Excellency of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the measure of <hi>Her</hi> Fertility became proportion'd only to <hi>That</hi> use, not to the Ministry of his Licentiousness; which wild Revolt from her Prescription, in appearance, might detract from <hi>Her</hi> Benignity, but not exhaust <hi>her</hi> Treasury; whose sources, when restrained, are unsluo't, either in submission to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Trespass, <hi>To live by the sweat of his Brows:</hi> whence was concluded, <hi>the Industrious should be filled with Plenty:</hi> or in the tender of <hi>His</hi> Gratitude, in a helpful Dispensation, whence

               <p>From the general Result of our Argument, may visibly be collected three distinct <hi>Principles</hi> necessary in Practice against the Approaches of this Misery, <hi>Industry, Providence, Charity;</hi> which persue also three distinct Objects to attain the perfect use to which they were directed. <hi>Industry</hi> acquireth, <hi>Providence</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, <hi>Charity</hi> dispenceth: On which three columns, we will erect the Fabrick of our <hi>Civil</hi> Magazine.

               <p>Not <hi>Chargeable</hi> or <hi>Burdensom,</hi> else were exchang'd, but not remov'd the Misery, reversing totally the Nature of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had for Object soly mutual Relief of the Society, no <hi>Civil</hi> Commerce for abject Lucre to enlarge a Treasury.</p>
               <p>Many other remote Degrees of <hi>this</hi> publick Exigence may also be produc't by <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Disorder.</hi>

                  <hi>Exportive Commerce</hi> of this Commodity (except on special Licence from the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry) might totally be interdcted.</p>

                  <hi>The perversion of the Soyl</hi> hath almost every where found so general a Practice in persuit of Improvement by inclosure, that it may probably be apprehended, without a due and timely Restraint to such Liberty, the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame will suddenly fall under Prejudice of the Tolleration, either in an incompetent Proportion of our Tillage to the common use, Impoverishing the Labourer, or depopulating our Villages; which usage pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly might meet a proper Regulation, if Imposition might be laid on every Town to lay forth such a quantity of Arrable, as might sustain the Inhabitants thereof against all Casualty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Disorder</hi> also frequently may prove an Introduction to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Scarcity;</hi> which following usually the insolence of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Armies, the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry only can remit the regulation thereof to the vigilance of the Military, if over It remain <hi>there</hi> to such Influence.</p>
               <p>2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntary Vacancy</hi> meeting this misery, as a just Penalty, might seem but too indulgently treated by the <hi>Civil Ministry,</hi> to be but only visited for Relief, were not the publick welfare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently therein concern'd, either in the loss of a useful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Faculty, or in the sufferance of a useless and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Burden; to avoid the Dammage or Incumbrance of such superfluous Mixtures; The <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry can only safely imitate the Practice of the Physical; <hi>Aut corrigendo, aut ejiciendo, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Correcting or Ejecting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The perfect'st method of Correction is that, most probably may reduce them to a just Devoir, which properly may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the due Imposition of a penal Task, if which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not attain the intention of the Institution, such incorrigible Incapacity may equitably deserve an infamous Ejection from our <hi>Civil</hi> Union in a prescribed Exile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Impulsive Vacancy</hi> encountring Indigence, merits a more debonair Redress, and nicer Circumspection from the <hi>Civil</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, to educe obstructed Inclination into useful Action; not only in Compassion to an undeserv'd Dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To form a Remedy to this suspension, it would be requisite, a publick mannage were inherent to the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame (as <hi>Davids</hi> Rural Oeconomies, or <hi>Solomons</hi> Naval Commerce) to which all the necessitous vacant might freely have recourse for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment

                  <hi>Impotence</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty in Members of the Body <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,</hi> can only reach to these particulars, <hi>Infants, Aged,</hi> and the <hi>Infirm.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Infants</hi> abandon'd to the Casualty of their Existence, may justly from the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry, claim the exactest tender of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in that they are indu'd with a potential Aptitude to make a Reparation of the Breaches, which the <hi>Civil</hi> Body daily suffers in the Infirmity of Nature, rendring the Constitution thereof in such successive Springs, an everlasting Existence; under what Limitation of time we should denote this <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity, can not more properly be exprest, then in the <hi>Naturalists</hi> Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their order: Forasmuch as after seven years tearm they are (according to the Practice of divers Commonwealths) ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a <hi>Civil</hi> Introduction to attain their Livelihood. In the interim the equal and less Burdensome Tuition of them, is the Parochial Exhibition, where each particular becomes to his ability an unsolicited Adjutor.</p>
               <p>2. As the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry should reflect on the Indegence of <hi>Infants,</hi> in respect of what they may be; so on the necessity of the <hi>Aged,</hi> in reference to what they have been; which yielding a more visible Proof, may direct us to a more proportionable Distinction in the institution of their succor, some have exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted their proper store in the relief of others Miseries.

support to this Infirmity, may be discovered in the Nature of the Subject of their sterril Agitation, which falling under a Publick, or a Private Distinction, we may erect the Institution of supply in due Conformity to the Relation of those Interests. If the Publick more peculiarly have receiv'd Advantage by their Industry. The Dignity of the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry is engaged, not to permit their Industry to pass rewarded only in their precedent existence, both in respect their poverty may be a mark of their Integrity, as also such neglect may probably prove a Motive un to others, to prosecute the publick Interests less assiduously and faithfully: to which natural defect cannot be issued a more timely succour, and with less charge unto the Commonwealth, then to admit a substitute to his Office, under satisfaction only in future, to succeed to the imployment: the benefit thereof to be transacted soly to the use of the declined Officer.</p>
               <p>If their endeavours were directed only to the Advancement of a private Interest, those Relations (whither Natural or <hi>Civil</hi>) ought mutually to contribute to their succour: but since no such voluntary conducement can be expected from the degenerate Inclination of Blood, or Ingratitude of man so generaly in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. The <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry ought not to suffer the infringement of such rights to pass without a Legal Penalty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity implyed by <hi>Infirmity,</hi> may properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the sence thereof to every preternatural Affect, whereby the Body is disabled to the Ministry of a <hi>Civil</hi> Function, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Native or Adventitious, Temporary, or Irrepairable: which deficience meeting with the Calamities co-incident to Indigence, in Reason may require a speedier and more vigilant protection, then the rest, The afflicted sinking under a double misery, propensive to exalt the Evil of each others Nature. Whence hereto equitably should be deriv'd a succor, exacts a vast extent in the Distinction of the Accidents. If injurious, then is the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry charged to exact an equal Reparation from the Trespasser. If under an Assiduous Subjection, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the Function, then is the interessed thereto soly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the succor: If Naturally or Casually under a <hi>Civil</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Aid therein hath Reference only to the tearm of such Engagements. If under a voluntary succour of another, the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance is Reciprocal: If under none of these Distinctions fall the Accident, the Natural Relations are engaged next to the support. If those are not endued with a capacity thereto, their safeguard only resteth in the publick Succour.</p>
               <p>Who are reduced into Indigence by a <hi>Casual Dammage,</hi> be it Fire, Inundation, Tempest, War, or the like publick Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more equitably may repair, for their support, unto the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry: Insomuch, as it only falls under the Capacity and

Devoyr thereof to avoid such Accidents by a timely Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection. Nor can a more equal Redress thereto be instituted (since every one may therein be concern'd) then by a General Collection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>unjustly Dammaged</hi> to this extremity may seem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a Subject more properly inherent to the Decision of <hi>Civil</hi> Rights, then charitable Aids: Yet insomuch as some have not Capacity timely to prosecute Legal Rights to the Advantage of their Future Interests; either by reason of the Immaturity of their Years, Defect of Natural Light; or strict subordinance to nigh Relations, especially therein concern'd. The <hi>Civil</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry might impose the Circumspection and Tuition of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests upon the next Relation of Capacity to agitate therein, under the penalty of their support, whose Right had failed in their Negligence. This may appear, at first Inspection, but an inconsiderable Caution, to preserve the Members of a <hi>Civil</hi> Union from this Calamity: Yet when we shall more seriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the numerous failing of Successions, Breaches of Trust, and voluntary Reversions of Contracts of Marriage (the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Principles to the support of Families) through the irregular Expence of careless Parentage, we rationally may conclude that <hi>this</hi> Particular requires more Circumspection from the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Ministry (in respect of the Multitudes therein concern'd) then all the rest we have insisted on.

Agent a neglect of the Act: Of all the Appendices to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, no one is so remisly prosecuted (in Reference to the use) as is the Introduction to our Being: which being the Radix, Ground, and Foundation of all Natural Perfection, in Reason should exact the nicest Circumspection: And although the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Nature have higher and more secret Guides to form their operations, then humane Wisdom can pretend to alter; yet since the matter, whereon those hidden influences do ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, falls under Regulation frequently of humane Faculty, by a judicious and preadvised Preparation, the Matter being rendred more perfectly susceptable of their supream Impressions; the Form thereof will consequently become educed into more perfect Action. This is made evident in sundry vegetives by daily Practice of our terrein Culture. And more (to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach) in our Assiduous Conjunction of those Animals, whose kindes have a peculiar Reference to our abject Lucres, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Pleasures. Perhaps a curious Artist also might hereto insert the speculative Prevoyance of the order of the Celestial Lights, administer those predominant Influxes; to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our purposes in an exact Election: But since the Practice probably may seem repugnant to the use and instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those Superiour Ministers, attempting to direct their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, who do ours preside. We only will adhere to our prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited Induction, which to the establishment of our Position, will direct us to the Restraint of these Particulars from so mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial an Operation. The <hi>Immature of Years, The Drunk, The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Luxur, The Infirm.

the Position of this Rule, may probably be disputable: Yet since it is a work of Nature, we therein plausibly may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the enlightners of her Mysteries, who generally affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nobler and more solid parts of our Composure to receive the chief part of their principles from the Masculine, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly may incline to the exclusion of the Feminine from such Regulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Drunk.</hi> In the Intimation of this Exception, we only do imply the present State of <hi>this</hi> Disorder: not but perhaps Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom may therein probably attain to such a Habit, as might be requisite to admit of an Intermissive, or a General Exclusion. In Reference to our Position the Carthaginians form'd this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Not to exceed in Wine that night design'd for Procreation.</hi> In Respect the excess hereof not only perturbs the Spirits, chiefly officiate to the Operation. But nature also (surcharged with a superfluous Burden) contracting all her vigour to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Disorder, becomes not only then diverted, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled to the exact Execution of her highest Ministry. Nor is it probable but that the <hi>Genial</hi> substance suffers in the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per such an Alteration and Intemperature as may deprive it of that Aptitude, should render <hi>It</hi> susceptable of a perfect Form. But how the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry should equitably exercise a Faculty of Temporary Division, where It hath constituted a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Union, is scarce distinguishable, unless it be by Imposing Penalty on the <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass, Infamy on the Natural; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Modesty of womanhood impeeched, might possibly crown the Intention of the Institution with success.</p>
               <p>3. To interdict <hi>Licentious Luxury:</hi> from the legitimate Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Natures needful Ministry, may seem a Procedure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the <hi>Civil</hi> Institution of her useful Remedy; Yet in Respect such wilde desires rarely do submit unto a decent or regular Prescription: As also that the consequence attends on the Pretence may probably subvert the natural end of such a <hi>Civil</hi> Priviledge, either in debilitating the Natural Faculty by too much effusion of the Spirits, in an untimely frequency of the Act, or impairing the Natural Faculty by contracted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Diversity of Objects; we properly may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of such an Inhibition (not only as a Natural Caution, but as a <hi>Civil</hi> Penalty) since Nature in us covets to perpetuate our Existence in the successive Propagation of our kinde, nor is totally improbable, but that the <hi>Civil</hi> Institution of divorce assumed an Establishment from the Reflection of our equal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
               <p>4. That it should be requisite to an exact Production, to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend or exclude <hi>the Infirm</hi> in Natures Faculty from officiating to her Ministry, is so evident a Position, as will rarely meet a

               <p>What kindes of <hi>Infirmity</hi> (under the Capacity of <hi>Civil</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) or what degrees thereof should properly fall under Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>Under what general Principles our present <hi>Subject</hi> should be distinguished, or how persu'd, we farther will examine; such Notions first preposited, may form our rude and passive Nature, perfectly susceptable of so exact an Institution. In Reference to which order, our frail Composure being constituted of differing Materials, the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry must in the Regulation thereof vise at distinct Objects to educe the individual into useful <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chearful Vigilance,</hi> and <hi>Infatigable Travel,</hi> in Relation to the Body. <hi>Moral Civility,</hi> and <hi>National Affection</hi> in Reference to the minde.</p>

                  <hi>Vigilance,</hi> In regard such Habit endueth us with Capacity to anticipate all Occasions, may conduce unto our Purposes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the tearm of Life lost in a sluggish Stupidity, and lendeth more Facility to the Prosecution of an enterprise: Nor is this season of purility only material to this Regulation, as most sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Induction of any Form; but as most incident and propensive to yield the Indulgences of floth, most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then accompanying the o're humid Temperature of the Brain. Which exercise we have qualified with <hi>Chearfulness,</hi> lest the severity of such a Caution should become to yet unactive Spirits a disagreeing Burden, so render them less useful, fetter'd with such Anxiety: On which Consideration, was perhaps grounded the Prudence of those Parents, who have been so exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in Education of their Children, to have their Spirits,

(with the new born day) summoned softly from their flattering slumbers by the inticing notes of Harmony.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Travel,</hi> Insomuch as by assiduous Exercise, the Body by degrees becomes both strengthned and inured to encounter Actively or Passively, all Oppositions peculiar to our Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or accidental to our Fortunes. The constitution of our Body becomes hereby improved, and our Health secur'd, The Spirits hereby also will become more pure and vigorous to the Exercise of the minde, To which Practice we have annexed this <hi>Coherent,</hi> that our labours be not so remisly prosecuted, as they might suddenly become rebutable, but that they might inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly extend unto the time prefixed to the use, without Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to the undertaker, either by entertaining the minde with variety of Objects, or with the Recompence and Glory of the Issue.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Moral Civility,</hi> This Qualification extends It self to many excellent uses, perhaps beyond the full Prescription of our present Observation, or the just Capacity of our <hi>Treatise.</hi> First it layes an exact Foundation for <hi>Civil</hi> Rule to erect her Fabrick on, forming the minde to a gentle and submissive <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> whereon was constituted the <hi>Spartan</hi> Glory. It lendeth a ready Capacity to every knowledge, in a plausible Docility. It disposeth the minde to a timely and officious succour, in a resenting Humanity. It appeases the fury of an Adversary, and wins our Inclination e're we consult our will. It is the very band of common Union, and the establisher of Peace. Reproof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with this Ornament, is an effectual Balm, and the most strict subjection still agreeable: Nor yet becomes the Influence of this <hi>Vertue</hi> limited within the Notions of her proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but polisheth the minde to the more apt Reception of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mysteries. Our Savage Nature (of necessity) must first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume a meaner speculation, e're it can be endued with Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ascend unto so high a Lumination. Humility and Concord are the most proper Figures of a <hi>Civil</hi> Conversation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question the first and utmost step to Divine Institution. Nor can the sullen rigid Forms of a transported Zeal, win a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Credit of interiour Piety, which strive to smother these exterior Graces of Humanity.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>National Affection,</hi> Of all the endowments, may, in our frail Conjecture, tend to the exact composure of a well form'd minde. No one, in humane Reason, can be so requisite to the Establishment of a <hi>Civil</hi> Felicity, as <hi>This</hi> entirely constituted in every part of a <hi>Community.</hi> All other Vertues may have secret Sources, and Improper Objects, not consistent, perhaps, with their true Essences, but in form, adhering only to peculiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests. This only is the proper test to all their Attributes,

most Histories being pregnant in Authentick Proofs, That Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues fairest Ornaments have frequently, not only attempted, but therein succeeded, nay materially conduced to the subversion of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. The first and most visible step to all the antick <hi>Roman Glory,</hi> and ensuing <hi>Greatness</hi> was formed from the secret influence of this their innate Lustre, and in decline there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Both</hi> terminated.

               <p>Our rugged Nature thus polished and prepared to the Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a more excellent Capacity. We will proceed to the Remonstrance of those Objects, we purpose to direct them to, as most material to the <hi>Civil Union,</hi> which properly may be comprised in these ensuing Principles, <hi>Letters, Arms, Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Manufacture:</hi> These being the only Columns that support a <hi>Civil Fabrick,</hi> though several useful Branches hence deriv'd, may possibly, at first Inspection, seem to participate a more distinct Nature in their Consequence.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Letters</hi> have in their Nature a very vast extent, possibly not coherent, nay probably not consistant with the Felicity of a <hi>Civil Society,</hi> since we may evidently collect this general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation from Records of Antiquity. That the most flourishing Empires have visibly declined from their Vertue, and Valour, as they have made higher progressions in the search of humane Sciences. Nor hath the secret effects hereof been less remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<note place="margin">* The Goths in <hi>Greece.</hi>

The truth is, Letters in their abord, have an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring Faculty, doth easily induce the minde, not only to a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but to a general misprision of <hi>Civil</hi> Practises, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentique Posture is of necessity imposed on us in persuit of their Mystery, unerves the Body, and effeminates the minde.</p>
               <p>To avoid therefore this Error in <hi>Their</hi> Nature, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient in the manner of <hi>Their</hi> Acquisition, we will confine <hi>Them</hi> only to <hi>Their</hi> proper use, and prescribe to their exercise such Objects only, as are material to the <hi>Civil</hi> welfare. All Arts and Sciences whatever, being but <hi>ridiculous</hi> Positions, which in their Speculation and Practise, may not become redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a <hi>Civil</hi> Benefit. The first and most perfect use of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in General, being, without Question, but to form our Judgments the better to direct our will, although our publick Seminaries seem, both in their Allowance and Practise, to vise at nothing more then the enfarcing of their Memories, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>The Objects of <hi>Learning</hi> especially conduce unto the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> welfare, must of necessity either have Reference to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation and Improvement of the Minde, Body, or Estate: To Illuminate, Rectifie, and Guide the Intellect, <hi>Letters</hi> presents us those two useful Pieces of <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Moral Philosophy.</hi> To repair the Breaches of our Infirm Nature, <hi>Physick,</hi> with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences thereon.

Prescribing these Limits to the extent of <hi>Letters,</hi> we without Difficulty shall reduce <hi>Them</hi> to their proper Institution.

But to the Interiour Reduction of every Member to the Conformity of the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction, Not inserting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety <hi>thereof</hi> to the enlargement of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, because such extent not properly is inherent (although sometime coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) to the <hi>Civil</hi> welfare: so that we may hereby perceive three distinct uses in their Institution, <hi>For Defence, For Offence,</hi> and <hi>For Parado:</hi> Though less civiliz'd Nations did first direct <hi>Them</hi> to a happier end, gaining therewith their livelihood.

proceed rather from the Excrescence of a private Store, then simply the Benignity of a Generous Inclination, wherein is nothing really of our selves, or hazzarded, or communicated, and what is so dispenced usually, but the Fragments of what our Frailty will no longer suffer us to enjoy: so that the essential Circumstances of the Motive clearly considered, we rather, in favour of the publick Interest, have lent such a <hi>Distinction</hi> here, a more noble Association, then properly is inherent to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Thereof.</hi> Nor can we thereto yield so eminent a Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Honor, as might induce Another to an equal Emulation of <hi>Munificence</hi> (where the Donor scarce survives the Induction of his Act) more then what the dull Letter of a Monument barely will infer: But to dignifie that Benignity, which shall, with a well composed Minde, cast from his Sense the Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Minister to Vanity and Lux; while yet in the Capacity of Fruition, to constitute the reviving Affluence thereof upon the languishing Misery of the Indigent, we no way can afford too illustrious an Inscription to <hi>His</hi> Merit.</p>
               <p>2. Before we enter to treat of the <hi>Second</hi> General Object, <hi>A private Beneficence extending beyond the common prescription of a Civil Devoyr.</hi> Two Arguments, thereon depending, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more distinct solution. <hi>First,</hi> whether the <hi>Publick</hi> may immediately be concern'd therein (remotely <hi>It</hi> alwayes of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity must.) And whether without such Reference the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> may be concern'd to agitate thereon: The <hi>First</hi> Proposition may, without Difficulty, admit of an Affirmative. The <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> not without some Intricacy. Insomuch as private Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence may sometime be conferred on a private Person, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a publick Use, <hi>Military,</hi> or <hi>Civil.</hi> And in that same Degree oft honoured by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had design'd a Crown of Triumph unto him, that had in publick Conflict sav'd the life but of the meanest of their Fellow Citizens; whereby the Band of Unity became amongst them far more strictly, vigorously, and intirely secur'd to give a happy repulse to the fury of their Enemies. But whether the <hi>Publick</hi> be so far interessed, as to censure of the unequal Resentment of a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Beneficence</hi> betwixt Party and Party, is a Subject yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined. If example may bear authentick weight to an Assertion, we may produce sufficient evidence from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of many <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdictions, wherein <hi>It</hi> by Prescription of the Law hath been allowed actionable, as a <hi>Private Plea.</hi> But in more severe Governments, prosecuted by the <hi>Publick</hi> as a Capital Delinquence: As may be instanced from the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Judicature, <hi>Where</hi> Callias <hi>was publickly arraign'd for his Ingratitude to</hi> Aristides, <hi>suffering Him and his Children even to perish through Indigence; by whose peculiar favour he had attain'd</hi>

                  <hi>an eminent Acquisition.</hi> In Objection to the procedure of the <hi>First</hi> Pattern may justly be alledged, that it is against the very Nature of a perfect Benefit, ev'n but to expect, much more to exact a Restitution. And he that formeth but a Repetition of the Circumstance of his <hi>Munificence,</hi> blemisheth the Grace of his Benignity. But he that reduceth <hi>It</hi> to the Reproach of the Receiver, perverteth the Nature of his own Intention. In Reference to the <hi>Latter</hi> Rule, though <hi>This</hi> may be alledg'd no proper Subject for the Institution of the Law: forasmuch as neither <hi>Publick</hi> nor <hi>Private</hi> prejudice ensueth the Mecognisance. <hi>This</hi> not endammaged in regard the freeness of the Act ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the very shadow of a Pretence. <hi>That</hi> not impaired in Respect the Consequence <hi>Thereof</hi> not immediately reacheth the <hi>Publick</hi> Interest: collaterally it may, in that the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the vice, not checked, may probably make so great a Breach in the moral Constitution of our <hi>Civil</hi> Union, as to introduce a common Barbarisme.</p>
               <p>As to the farther Discussion of our suspended <hi>Subject, A Private Beneficence;</hi> the Nature thereof (under the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Latitude in Devoyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For solution to the first Branch of our Proposition, we may infer, that he justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to fall unpittied, by a Common Decree, under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of a future Misery, who shall so far become restrained by the shame of his own Indigence or Impotence, as to smother in his silence either to God or Man, the immediate means to his security. In Reference to the <hi>Latter</hi> Position may be asserted, that to such Manifestation of the Act, may justly follow an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Encouragement from the <hi>Moral Censor,</hi> with due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause to dignifie the Action.</p>
               <p>It may here probably be objected, that having propounded our <hi>Subject</hi> in General, we have as yet omitted, clearly to

In answer, Although It may seem ev'n against the Nature of <hi>Vertue</hi> to be indu'd with an incommunicable Essence, since both in Example and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, she needeth not to borrow the Endowments of Fortune to illustrate her Expansion: but admit the Influence of her Graces so powerful and absolute from her own proper Nature: Nevertheless (to the common reproach of our Age be it attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>Vertue</hi> wants more material Ornaments to plead for her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Who adhereth to the Counsel of the <hi>Wisest,</hi> if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty o're shadow the Consultation, and be his minde never so impenetrably compos'd against the various and continual Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of an impetuous Adversity, if obscured in Indigence, Who regardeth or distinguisheth his <hi>Fortitude.</hi> So both his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> and his <hi>Temperance</hi> seem smothered in his Impotence. But happier Ages lend us more exemplary Presidents from their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, where we may observe, that in the most flourishing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, Vertue</hi> so humbly seated, did never want her Dignity, as appeareth in the Antick Grecian Glory, extracted from the Justice of <hi>Aristides.</hi> The Prudence and Moderation of <hi>Phocion.</hi> The Fortitude and Magnanimity of <hi>Epimenondes.</hi> Nor shall we need here farther to trace a Prescription to qualifie such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence with Honour, since we already have in the Inception of our Treatise thereon rais'd the true Capacity to our <hi>Ministry.</hi>

               <p>Having thus traced out some irregular Motions in our <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, under a more Especial Reference unto <hi>others;</hi> we will endeavour now to treat of some Disorders, under a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Reference to our <hi>Selves,</hi> not pretending to attain the full extent of either.

               <p>
                  <hi>Drunkenness</hi> may possibly appear a <hi>Subject</hi> here improperly inserted in our Order, in that most Laws may seem to form thereto a due Punition. Yet in Reference to the Nature of the Crime, not totally equivolent, weighing judiciously the common Damage thereon may ensue unto the <hi>Civil</hi> Texture, in regard it is a reproachful exhauster of the Publick Store. A certain Ruine to a private Family. An apparent Introduction to every Mischief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A temporary Dissection of a Member from the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. Under what Degree of Disorder this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per truly may be distinguished, is not altogether unworthy a due Perpensation, since the vulgar, in favour of their sensuality, have lent <hi>It</hi> so gross and ridiculous a Character, as is not to be encountered but in the highest extremity. But far more ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally may be affirmed, That every extravagant Emotion of the Spirit, and every impotent and irregular Motion of the Body, by drink procur'd, may figure the Distinction.</p>
               <p>Under the Intimation of <hi>Luxury</hi> may be imply'd all sensual Excesses whatsoever, more especially the inordinate Indulgence to the inticing Relishes of the Pallate, and the lascivious and unlawful Prosecution of a Bruitish Lust, How far the common Consequences <hi>Hereof</hi> may reach the Detriment of the <hi>Civil</hi> Structure, we will endeavour clearly to enlighten.

So that not only the Body, but the minde becomes hereby obscur'd, effeminate and slothful, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unuseful to every <hi>Civil</hi> Practice. Farthermore, the Charms of this Indulgence to our proper <hi>Genius,</hi> so endeareth the Affections to a bruitish Sensuality, that it totally alienates the Thought from any sense of others suffering, so far, that <hi>It</hi> becomes unto the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame a Burden incommunicable. <hi>This</hi> Subject taken in the <hi>Latter Sence,</hi> though from the other seldom found divided, the <hi>Latter</hi> being usually joynt Issue to the <hi>former,</hi> meeting a Celibate Condition, begetteth either a Protraction, or a perpetual Renunciation of an <hi>Hymeneal</hi> Union, both punishable by the Law in <hi>Civil</hi> Communities of severer Discipline, encountring a Conjugal Estate, <hi>It</hi> breaks that Band of Amity, which is the first strictest and most natural Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a <hi>Civil</hi> Union, in either (if any) <hi>It</hi> produceth but a spurious and degenerate Issue.</p>
               <p>That sence which the <hi>Former Attribute</hi> could not reach to in the common usage of our <hi>Tongue,</hi> more properly may under the notion of <hi>Riot</hi> be exprest, having for Object a servile Assub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Adulation of the senses (not formerly thereby inferr'd) at how profuse a rate soever: so that, in Respect of the vanity, This Piece of <hi>Licentiousness</hi> hath a Latitude beyond the Capacity of a Prescription; whether in the Curious, Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or Superfluous Ornaments inherent to a Person, Place, or Equipage; or in the alluring Rarities or Excesses of an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, tending rather to exhaust the Affluence of Nature, then satisfie with her Plenty.

                  <hi>Gaming,</hi> not taken in the sence of a Divertisement, but in the Nature of an ardent Persuit to a dishonourable Acquisition, where the Adventurer, to improve the Advantage of his Stock, puts it to the Question, whether his just Possessions be his own. A ridiculous and bewitching Itch of Avarice, where each one, in sport, persues Anothers Ruine in earnest. In the Victor the Facility of the Acquisition begets a Profuseness in expence. In the vanquisht a self-consuming Ranckour to repair the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: so that neither attain the end of the undertaking, since both become frustrate in the Improvement of their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>former</hi> swelleth with vanity of success, although not raised on his own sufficiency.

               <p>Though the explicit sence of <hi>Acquisition</hi> may seem impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applyed to so solemn an Institution, as a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that the sympathetick Influence of Nature often se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly determines the Contract, before the Overture is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, constituting the subsequent Agreement rather a <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> then a sollicitous Capitulation: nevertheless in Respect, the implicit Inference <hi>thereof</hi> may reach beyond the vulgar usage of our <hi>Tongue,</hi> we will apply <hi>It</hi> to the vulgar usage of the Ceremony, being in their Practise frequently, but a Mercinary Compact: under which Latitude of Sence, may be comprised divers species of <hi>Conjugal Acquisition;</hi> as that of <hi>Violence,</hi> which probably may be judged the most improper and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kinde imaginable.

And the most proper and plausible Motive to be successive continuance of that Production, the impulsive Influence of a vertuous Love.



<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100123:67"/>
The <hi>Civil</hi> Ballances thus counterpoised, we will endeavour to remove the Impediments may probably obstruct their Motion; whether in Reference to <hi>Sex, Age,</hi> or <hi>Condition;</hi> As to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Sex, no Law admitteth the <hi>Male</hi> to a capacity of a <hi>Conjugal Violence,</hi> either <hi>Personal,</hi> or <hi>Collateral.</hi> Many subscribe to the disanulling of the Contract transacted without the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Agreement: so that we may conclude the <hi>Female</hi> here only capable of a <hi>Personal,</hi> or a <hi>Collateral Violence.</hi> Neither can her Consent before Maturity for Generation free the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempter from the Guilt of a <hi>Personal Violence.</hi> In Respect, the natural Motives to such <hi>Vnion</hi> are yet to them held indistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable. From the Impeachment of a <hi>Collateral Violence,</hi> no <hi>Age,</hi> under the Paternal Tuition, can exempt the undertaker; her widowhood falls not under such Prescription; insomuch, as the Parent hath formerly made a surrender of his Title in a free <hi>Donation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and her Husband deceasing, leaves her as Head to the successive Government of his Family.</p>
               <p>In Reference to the <hi>Quality or Condition,</hi> why the Law should form the Distinction of a <hi>Violence,</hi> from her <hi>Civil</hi> Endowments, is not clearly obvious to a rational Inspection; since every <hi>Violence</hi> hath only for Object, the Impulsion of the will, either <hi>Personally</hi> or <hi>Collaterally,</hi> in Reference to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of anothers Inrerest, which is either <hi>Paternal</hi> or <hi>Guardiant.</hi> The former our Laws reflect not on, possibly, in Respect, it yet resteth in the Capacity of the <hi>Parent</hi> to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the Fruition of her Pretences. The <hi>latter</hi> being but a Relation of Trust, can less in Reason, challenge the Priviledge to such a Procedure, not rightly entitled to a <hi>Property,</hi> unless we should avow the venal Acquisition of the Tutelage, now abolished, to the approved Ruine of a Family, which might yet nevertheless more equitably have been repaired in the Censure of a slighter Trespass, had not the Dignity of the Prince here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in been immediately or remotely blemished; which being only successive to the <hi>Paternal</hi> or Natural Authority, why should the <hi>Parent</hi> be excluded such a Priviledge, where the succession is unalterable, depending on another Line: Which Proposition leads us again into the currant of our suspended Argument, whether the <hi>Parents Dissent</hi> only in a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Contract, may equitably fall under the Censure of a Rape? The Supream, Sacred, most General, and Authentick Rules to illuminate our wayes in the intercourse of humane Society afford us no appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Proof of <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union, but what hath been derived from the Agreement of the natural Parent, whose Reception of the Addresses properly did form the Introduction to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: insomuch, as the first most visible and legitimate Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Right, is that which is extracted from the course of



<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100123:67"/>
Nature, <hi>This</hi> Procedure seems also most authentickly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd in the Formality of the Ceremony, where the Transaction passeth from the Parents hand, or one that Personates his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. In competition to the Filial Liberty herein (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably might lessen the Nature of the Trespass) may be alledg'd the Irresistable Influence of the Celestial Orbes ordain'd to such Impressions on Inferior Bodies, as may impulsively attract them to an Union, without the Consultation of the will, which not submitting to the exactest Result of the Interior Light, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of their Motion, may equitably be dispenc't from the subordinance to anothers will, when as not under the subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own. Nor can the Advantages of Fortune, which usually herein o're-sway the Parents Inclination, be a plausible Inducement to so material a Consequence, where the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Institution dependeth immediately on the mutual Agreement of the Interior Faculties; which in their Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can produce but a degenerate Composure in Another, when formed from so Gross and Corrupt an Object. In favour of the <hi>Trespassor,</hi> where her <hi>Civil</hi> endowments are but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or casual, may be alledged the Sincerity of the Motive to an honourable Persuit, limiting his Pretences in the Fruition only of her Person, without the Inherences to her Fortune, having in the Disorder of his Proceeding frustrated his Capacity to acquire it. From the Result of our Discussion, may possibly be formed a Conclusion sufficient to suspend the Impeached from a Capital Offence: but nothing yet from thence inferr'd, might counterpoise the Parents Injury in the Miscarriage of a Childe, did the Loss extend no farther then the Ravishing of his Comfort might have redounded from the endearments of an agreeable Community, if but establisht by his Counsel or Election. In Reference therefore to the <hi>Trespassors</hi> may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that to the Disobedience of the <hi>Childe</hi> is justly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced the forfeiture of her Patrimonial Inherency. To the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence of the <hi>Violator,</hi> such Reparation in Honour, as the Dignity of the Family may require. In the sequel of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose remaineth yet a Difficulty not enlightned, whether <hi>It</hi> rest in the <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity of the <hi>Parent</hi> to disanul the Contract past by Nuptial Ceremony? For solution to the Question, may be reply'd, Few Laws herein dissent from the Affirmative. But how such Procedure may be consistent with the Honour or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Childe, or yet the <hi>Parents</hi> future Satisfaction (All conjugal Rights transacted) is indistinguishable.</p>
               <p>Another kinde of Conjugal <hi>Acquisition,</hi> more properly so tearmed, is the <hi>Venal Acquisition;</hi> where the <hi>Acquisitor</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth his Pretences from the <hi>Parent,</hi> for a certain summe of Mony, or other Consideration, which passeth sometime under



<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100123:68"/>
the formality of a Present. A Method of <hi>Acquisition</hi> very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unsuitable to the Practice of our Age, where the highest perfection of personal Endowments, cannot win so much as the shadow of Attraction on our sordid Inclinations: yet wants it not the Authority of the exactest Models of a <hi>Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> to form the Institution Regular. Probably in Respect, that such Proceeding is the highest Pledge to an inviolable Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the surest and most plausible Foundation to the happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and end of so necessary an Institution. But whether such Forms of Contract may meet no Inconvenient in the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is not so clearly obvious: Insomuch as the Nature of the Introduction may possibly figure a more hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> probably may be consistant with so perfect an Amity; seeming in the intention, rather to imply a Distance of Servilty, then a Coadjutance in the Ministry: We may therefore herein conclude, that a mutual Retribution of the <hi>Civil</hi> Faculties is as proper an Order to a happy Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this <hi>Civil Union,</hi> as the reciprocal communication of the <hi>Natural</hi> Faculties is to the successful Constitution of the <hi>Natural</hi> Union: yet in either Transaction will such a method be preposterous, if the Motive thereto do proceed rather from the means, then from the end or Object of the Institution: to the perfect forming whereof, the <hi>former</hi> should be but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed subsequent to the <hi>latter,</hi> not a primary and visible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement. Such Procedure, among the <hi>Spartans,</hi> adjudged so irregular to a happy <hi>Union,</hi> that <hi>It</hi> fell, by publick Ordinance, under the Censure of a <hi>Civil</hi> Penalty.</p>
               <p>The succeeding <hi>Title</hi> to a Conjugal Adherence is that of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> the most usual, proper, and legitimate Method in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting so material an <hi>Union,</hi> where the uncorrupted will moves freely to a deliberate Result in the Election, that a happy and agreeable Community may thence issue to every Branch inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Alliance. To what Latitude the Agreement of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may justly be extended, is a Subject not altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. The <hi>Parent</hi> and the <hi>Espous'd</hi> may probably here li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Proposition, though Custom, in <hi>Civil</hi> usage, requires it ev'n from the Remotest of the Family, yet rather under a Form of Ceremony, then a Pretence of Right. But why the Maternal Assent (she being the sole Regent to her Family) should here not be admitted to an equal Priviledge, in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Authority to her deceased Husband, as to appear a Principle in the Ceremony, is a <hi>Civil</hi> Impropriety, scarce sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a Rational Pretence, unless the practice be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily waved, in favour to the decent Restraint of a womanly Passion, which might possibly extend to a disorderly Erruption, personally to separate from her self by her own publick Act,



<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100123:68"/>
Whom tender Nature had so nighly united.</p>
               <p>From the example of that exact Pattern of Morality, <hi>Cato Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis</hi> may here be possibly inferr'd a Proposition, which seldom could elsewhere finde out a President, but in licentious Practises, whether <hi>this Conjugal</hi> inherence may be (with due conformity to <hi>Civil</hi> Rules) transacted by the Principle to anothers Possession, as a Common <hi>Property.</hi> The solution may properly without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, pass in the Negative. Insomuch as there was a mu tual Reception in the Contract, and the Husband not in right impowr'd to alienate himself from her Possession; to whom he was conferr'd by his own proper Act, Nor can a joynt Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from both Principles form equitably a Retraction of so strict a vow in so solemn an Institution. In Reference to <hi>Cato</hi>'s procedure herein may be alledg'd, that such elevated and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits, have in the source and course of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more noble Objects, then the vulgar can reflect upon, as the plausible Reception of his Wife again on her first Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood may express. Such Traces therefore can visibly form no proper Rules to common Actions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>latter</hi> Method of a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Investure is that of a <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> an Order not any where found in use, but in the <hi>Iudaick</hi> Society: And there also under a Conditional Position, <hi>If the Brother dyed without Issue.</hi> The intention of the Prescription had possibly both explicitly and implicitly a plausible Persuit. Explicitly, the support of the Brothers Name and Family. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, that such a nighness of Relation might more peculiarly in them engraft a stricter <hi>Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Right of <hi>Possession</hi> must necessarily proceed the Right of Institution, either <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> as the Legislative Power shall adjudge most proper to the Nature of the Transaction; which concluding in the <hi>latter,</hi> may possibly lend more weight unto the Ordinance: But both tending to a due and orderly establishment, require authentick Publication, to avoid promiscuous, scandalous, and litigious mixtures. Whence consequently ensues this Proposition, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private and concealed Contracts, under what form soever passed, tending to a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union, may be admitted to the full Capacity of a legal Institution. For solution, may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that such Agreement equally and effectually may engage the Transactors to a mutual Coherence. But not oblige the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society</hi> to an equal Reception of their Transactions under such Distinction, until by perfect and authentick Publication specified.</p>
               <p>One Ambiguity inherent to our <hi>Subject,</hi> may probably here require a due Discussion, whether the Allowance of <hi>Poligamy</hi> might prove consonant or useful to our <hi>Civil</hi> Order. If the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity or security of a <hi>Civil</hi> Society consisted in a numerous



<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100123:69"/>
multitude; the certain'st means to attain it in a lawful Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be allowed warrantable. But questionless, a due Proportion of the parts thereof is requisite to form a perfect Harmony in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. A noxious Repletion may as well happen to the Body <hi>Politick</hi> as <hi>Natural;</hi> both <hi>Quoad Vires.</hi> In respect of becoming a burden to the whole Frame, or <hi>Quoad Vassa.</hi> In regard of the excessive Extent of each peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent beyond a due Capacity of Reception. Furthermore, <hi>Unity</hi> being the sole Object of a <hi>Civil</hi> Felicity, can no way ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be attained in so unequal a Diversity.</p>
               <p>Having thus lent a legitimate Prescription to the <hi>Conjugal Union,</hi> e're we proceed to treat upon the subsequent Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, it will be yet material here to trace a Rule to their legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Separation,</hi> in Respect, it possibly may extend to so valid a Retraction, that each surviving party may legally be endowed with Capacity to transact their Persons, on another in a new Election.</p>
               <p>To what Latitude of sence a legal <hi>Separation</hi> here may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is not yet clearly obvious, since vulgar usage thereby only would imply a temporary Division, either voluntary or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive. The <hi>Total</hi> only falling under notion of Divorce.</p>
               <p>In Reference therefore to such Distinction, we will proceed to agitate on their Nature. <hi>A Conjugal Separation</hi> is either <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralegal,</hi> or <hi>Voluntary,</hi> or <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Impulsive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Extralegal</hi> or <hi>Voluntary Separation</hi> is such a Division in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Union, as may be constituted by mutual Assent or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parties, which may either be repealed or continued, without any Procedure or Formality of the Law.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Legal Separation</hi> is such, as by due course of Law becomes imposed on complaint. and by due course of Law, may with consent of Parties be repealable; if irrepealable, the true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction <hi>Thereof</hi> more properly falls under Nature of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Extralegal</hi> or <hi>Voluntary Separation</hi> form'd from Divine or Moral Prescription, not reaching any <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance, we will omit here farther to discuss upon, as altogether improper to our <hi>Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Legal</hi> or <hi>Impulsive Separation</hi> presents unto us a double Ambiguity, whether, and on what Ground, such <hi>Separation,</hi> may plausibly be constituted by a <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Act under such <hi>Separation</hi> passed joyntly or severally, wherein both Parties are concerned, may be accounted valid.</p>
               <p>For solution, we may conclude, that such a Procedure pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly may justly fall under the Concession of a <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature. But with this strict Limitation only, where a visible Attempt hath been practised against the Life of either party by the joynt



<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100123:69"/>
Associate, in regard our common safety is the immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>Civil</hi> praescription. And although it here may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the <hi>Civil</hi> Texture hath more forceable and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules form'd in it self to the due restraint of such Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Yet where the Fewel to the Action so nighly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually is fomented, the <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature might justly be held guilty of the barbarous Issue, should <hi>It</hi> decline from the removal of such opportunity, might minister to the Mischief.</p>
               <p>As to the Transactions joyntly may concern the <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union under a <hi>legal Separation,</hi> we either may reduce them to a <hi>Civil</hi> or a <hi>Natural</hi> Reference. The <hi>Civil</hi> have their Limits under private Contract or under publique Ordinance.</p>
               <p>The Natural suspended by Decree, cannot without a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Repeal, either severaly or joyntly transacted, attain a true Legitimacy.</p>
               <p>The nature of a <hi>Divorce,</hi> extendeth to a vaster Latitude, having for Object a total or perpetual <hi>Separation</hi> from a <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Society,</hi> impulsively constituted by a <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance,</p>
               <p>But under what Remonstrance such a censure may justly pass the <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature, is not so fully specified. Acts of Adultery are only explicit'ly expressed in the sacred Letter, and so far pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by the Institution of the Civil Law, but under such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity and Difficulty in the distinction, that the intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of totally thereby becomes frustrate. In Reference to the <hi>First</hi> obstacle, where the ground of the Procedure falls under a criminel Trespass. The Praescription vainly tendeth to a <hi>Civil</hi> Division, in Relation to the <hi>second,</hi> where the Charge requireth an occular Testimony to forme the Impeachment regular; the proof rests totally o're-shadowed with a humane impossibility.</p>
               <p>We may yet more properly hereto annex such incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities as may frustrate the intention of the <hi>Conjugal</hi> Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whether <hi>Civil, Natural,</hi> or <hi>Accidental.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the Notion of a <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity, may pass not only such, as are excluded by a common Praescription in the <hi>Civil</hi> Order, as <hi>Ideots, Lunaticks. &amp;c.</hi> But such Relations also of a Blood, as in regard of their Proximity may decently fall under Legal Interdiction, <hi>Quiloco Parentum inter se habent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Under the distinction of a <hi>Natural</hi> Incapacity, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such incorrigeable Imperfections, as by nature happen through the error of her work.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Accidental</hi> Incapacity may be extended to Praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Artificial Affections.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Praeternatural,</hi> where either Naturally or Adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, <hi>ex morbosa aliqua constitutione partis aliquid deest, vel su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest; by imperfect constitution of Parts, some thing is either wanting or superfluous.</hi> The <hi>Latter</hi> Imperfection may fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der



<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100123:70"/>
the possibility of a Remedy to render it a capacity of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Union.</hi> As <hi>Imperforatae.</hi> The <hi>Former</hi> never.</p>
               <p>Under an <hi>Artificial</hi> Incapacity may be inserted such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, as is contracted by inward Assumption or outward Application, or by Enchantment, as <hi>Ligati.</hi> But in respect such disabilities seldom are incorrigeable, we cannot justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from capacity of <hi>Conjugal</hi> union.</p>
               <p>Some difficulties inherent to our <hi>Subject</hi> may pertinently be here enlightned, as whether such a legal Incapacity ought to be subsequent or preceding the <hi>Conjugal</hi> Association? And whither such an Incapacity predistinguishable may justly, in concealment, fall under censure of a <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> Position seems a scruple scarce worth an Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since every just pretence of a Retraction in agreement (of this kind) is grounded on Deffaut preceeding contract. The <hi>Latter</hi> being a Subject more proper to another <hi>Principle</hi> we will remit to their peculiar Order.</p>
               <p>2. From the perfect fruition of the <hi>First Property</hi> usually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the justest <hi>Acquisition</hi> of the <hi>Second. Children,</hi> which nevertheless, without so strict a Reference, materially may be considered under the Distinction of the <hi>Natural</hi> and the <hi>Civil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Natural Acquisition</hi> is either <hi>Ligitimate</hi> or <hi>Illegitimate.</hi> The <hi>Civil</hi> only is <hi>Adoptive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The most proper and agreeable coherence is without doubt the <hi>Natural,</hi> in which our very Essence seems in the Currant of succession transferred to Eternity, without which, Mans suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful endeavors (though Crown'd with opulence and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,) yield in their fullest Affluence but an imperfect satisfaction, their charming Harmony still grating the affected Heart, with the good Patriarchs interjected Discord. <hi>Quid mihi.</hi> That the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate Dependence, though naturally constituted, should reach so high a consequence, can scarcely be affirmed. Since Infamy and Infidelity associate the Production.</p>
               <p>It will therefore be materially pertinent to our Order fully to appropriate unto either their Distinctions. <hi>Children</hi> intitled with Adherence of <hi>Legitimacy,</hi> may such be figured either <hi>properly</hi> or <hi>improperly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Properly,</hi> such, as after due solemnity of their Nuptial Rites, are in due season and maturety of time produc't.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Improperly,</hi> such as before Terme, under Terme, or after Terme of <hi>Conjugal</hi> Institution, untimely are produc'd.</p>
               <p>The Two <hi>First</hi> Distinctions the Civil Law admitteth to a priviledge of <hi>Legitimacy,</hi> and sometime the <hi>Latter,</hi> when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by some Accident, that Nature was disturbed in her usual course. Our Laws more Rationally, exclude them all from such capacity: Insomuch, as the succession of Families, (in



<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100123:70"/>
regard of their Possessions) ought to be preserv'd, so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pure, as not to become subject to the blemish of a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble suggestion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Illegitimate</hi> coherence of <hi>Children</hi> may also bear the same distinction, being such either <hi>Properly</hi> or <hi>Improperly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Properly,</hi> such as without Reference either to Preceeding or Succeeding contract, at any time are produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Improperly,</hi> such, as with Reference either to Preceeding, or Succeeding contract, or unto both, untimely are produced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latter</hi> Distinction of Illegitimacy may sometime plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly (in reference to many circumstances in the Transaction) by especial Grace of Prince or People, be admitted to a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Legitimacy.</hi> The former regularly and without <hi>Oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> never.</p>
               <p>To these Distinctions of Filial Inherency, may properly be annexed that of our <hi>Adoption.</hi> A <hi>Custome</hi> very frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> where Vertue being esteem'd the highest Dignity, became invested with adherence of the nighest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; on the immediate extinction of a Family, but to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Name.</p>
               <p>How farr the Agreement should extend to form the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution regular, may probably frame an Argument material in Discussion. Besides the Principles both <hi>Pater &amp; Patria</hi> are concerned in the Agitation, nor can either justly be excluded in consent to the Transaction. The <hi>Parenty</hi> in respect, a Member thus becomes desected from the Family; The <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society,</hi> in regard no alteration of Order in so Essential a Distinction can justly be admitted in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a publique Act, so that we may hereby conclude the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to his Property must pass under the Title of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whither the Paternal Inherencies, as <hi>Lands, Goods, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> &amp;c. may justly be transferred with the Person to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Family, is a <hi>Subject</hi> materially considerable, and may possibly without opposition pass in the Negative; insomuch as the common Affluence tending to support but one peculiar <hi>Stock,</hi> becomes enfeebled, when diverted to the enlargement of another.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Servants</hi> in Reference to their Use and Nature, have a vast extent in their Distinction, as <hi>Bond-servants</hi> and <hi>Free-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Domestiques</hi> and <hi>Retainers, Fealists</hi> and <hi>Facultists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bond-servants</hi> are distinguished in the Perpetuity of their Servitude, terminating only with their Owners special Grace in a publique Enfranchisement, or by the Common Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>These</hi> there are sundry sorts of <hi>Acquisition,</hi> The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and most Antick, was, questionless, the chance of War,



<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100123:71"/>
which inevitable Thraldom to the vanquished, was probably the highest and the justest Motive to a generous opposition. The hope of future enlargement, tending but to unnerve the Resolution. But Man contracting still corruption with the Time, formed hereto another <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Acquisition,</hi> the victor not contented with the use and Glory of <hi>These</hi> living <hi>Trophies</hi> to his valour, made them the <hi>Subject</hi> of his Avarice in a sordid Traffique. 3. To <hi>These</hi> two kinds of <hi>Acquisition</hi> succeeds a <hi>Third,</hi> not altogether properly so term'd, in respect it seems framed on a voluntary Concession, where the <hi>Bondman</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by publique Ordinance: the privilege of Enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisement, prefers his Bondage 'fore his Liberty, not accepting the Permission, whereon <hi>the Master nailing his Ear to the Post of the House, became entitled to his use for ever.</hi> Yet may this probably be judged an <hi>Acquisition</hi> of Benignity, which in his former Bondage had so engratiated the servant, he could not hope to improve in future his Condition.</p>
               <p>4. From these Distinctions of <hi>Acquisition</hi> may possibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a <hi>Fourth,</hi> more just and absolute then all the other, when in a lawful propagation, they are multipli'd, where the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled Infant receiving his Elevement in the Family by his Masters care, more sensibly accepts him for his Father, of such were form'd the good old Patriarchs Families.</p>
               <p>Whether the Authority of the Lord over his <hi>Bondman,</hi> justly might extend to Life and Death, is an Argument may properly be here reflected on. The practice of most <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths</hi> in which this sort of servitude was formerly in use, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it regular. To which the sacred Letter not much dissents, prescribing to the term of an accidental Dispensation, but the extent of three days from the Fact unto <hi>his</hi> expiration, rather as a Restraint to Inhumanity then a rule of Equity, as appears by the sequel, <hi>for he was his Money,</hi> which seems to acquit him from a voluntary Act, in reference to his own Interest. The weight of <hi>This</hi> Proposition chiefly depends upon the <hi>Rond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> adherence to the <hi>Civil frame,</hi> to which admitting him a Member, he justly then may claim a priviledge of security from the <hi>Civil</hi> Rule, if not admitted such, he must at least be yet allow'd to be a <hi>Civil</hi> Property inherent to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> benefit, which no way can be wilfully destroy'd, without a common prejudice, so that if the Fact prove not a criminel De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquence, it of necessity must be adjudged a publique Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass; which conclusion also will meet a farther impropriety in Rule, since every <hi>Bondmans</hi> life extinguished by any hand, can onely pass the censure of his Price, nor falls it equaly within a <hi>Civil</hi> Reparation, if the Agent be of equal incapacity, so that such a Liberty may possibly extend to a preposterous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order



<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100123:71"/>
in the publique Peace. To take away the cruelty of the Masters, redounding often to the publick prejudice. <hi>Antonius com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded they should be sold to others, not barbarously Treated by their Owners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bodin</hi> concludes our Customary forms of Apprentisage under this Distinction, though but improperly, in Respect, there is <hi>herein</hi> a voluntary and conditional Ingress and Egress of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: All which Parts of progression are utterly inconsistent with the proper Nature of a <hi>Bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Free Servants</hi> are by voluntary and mutual Contract under the subjection only of a Temporary Servitude: and may such properly be qualified from the voluntary Initiation of <hi>This</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, which limited by prescription of a Covenant, renders to them a voluntary capacity of enlargement; of which there are divers kindes, either in Reference to their Tearm of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as Septannual, Annual, Mensal or Journal; or in Respect of their Abode, as <hi>Domesticks</hi> or <hi>Retainers.</hi> These sort of <hi>Servants</hi> in their simple Nature, without a Reference to pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Covenant, are properly inherent only to the title of an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,</hi> In Respect the agreement is usually raised only on a personal adherence, which Ceasing by decease of either Party, the efficacy of the Contract must of necessity be void, though custom possibly may lend <hi>It</hi> other priviledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fealists</hi> are such, who by the Tenor of a real Possession, owe personal Service or Vassalage to the peculiar Lord, and might not altogether improperly be reduced to the Distinction of a Bondage. A <hi>Species</hi> of Assubjection not without due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration dissected from our <hi>Civil</hi> sufferance by publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Insomuch as <hi>It</hi> hath heretofore been found a visible fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter to our <hi>Civil</hi> Broils, and hath now only lest a shadow Thereof in our Court Suits and Services. <hi>These</hi> sort of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents fall under a Capacity of every Title to a <hi>Civil</hi> Property, whether <hi>Acquisitive, Donative,</hi> or <hi>Successive,</hi> being usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to the possession of the Royalty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Facultists</hi> have their subjection formed voluntary, by a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contract, in Reference only to the <hi>Civil</hi> Function, under Limitation of a tearm exprest; which being expir'd, they legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may challenge their Infranchisement to the publick Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Art, and may properly be comprised under the Distinction of <hi>Free Servants.</hi> Freedom preceeding the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Freedom succeeding the Intention, as the Object of their Servitude. In the common usage of this inherent, Custom hath form'd an Impropriety not equitably allowable. That any one, not yet, by <hi>Civil</hi> Rule, admitted to the Capacity of Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Property, should be permitted to dispose of his own Person. 'Tis true, the Parents frequently are supervisors



<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100123:72"/>
to the Contract, but yet therein no real Agitators, nor yet where their assent is not so evident, doth any <hi>Civil</hi> Rule afford a priviledge to the Retraction of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Offices</hi> in Reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> Property, are formed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Publick</hi> use: Nor, can plausibly be either admitted <hi>Acquisitive</hi> or <hi>Successive:</hi> Not <hi>Acquisitive</hi> insomuch as such an Introduction doth figure a pretence unto unequal purposes, and lends a colour to the corrupt execution of his Trust. Lucre being the common object of a venal Commerce, farthermore so improper a Reception detracteth from the Worth and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Minister, who should lend weight and Grace to the prescription of his Charge: under the license also of such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, improper Agents are admitted to the managing of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Agitations; not leaving the Institutor a priviledge of Election, while worth and vertue not stooping to so abject a procedure, become excluded the Capacity of a <hi>Civil</hi> Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Their proper and peculiar Sphere to lend true Lustre to their Nature. Such Imployments therefore might more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily be reserved to the Immediate Dispensation of a Prince or People, to recompence and dignifie approved Vertue in a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Distinction, and gratifie especial Services, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausting of the common Treasury. Whether this Mercinary Commerce fall under the practice of a Prince, his more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar or more general Ministers. The Inconvenients not differ much in Nature, only the Improvement of a Princes Treasure (though with impeachment to his Honour) may to a vulgar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection seem possibly to conduce more to the <hi>Publick</hi> Benefit: Yet the material Influence of either well distinguished, in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Publick</hi> Good. The Dignity, Vertue, and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Prince, clearly o're ballanceth such sordid Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</p>
               <p>Not <hi>Successive,</hi> For then the Impropriety of the Agent to the Action were irrepairable; and the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of necessity sinck under the Insufficience or Corruption of engrafted Ministers. Farthermore the progression of Vertue to a <hi>Civil</hi> use, would utterly be obstructed, were the transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her Ministry only inherent to the Natural Order. And the Influence of a Princes Grace not materially communicable, the Subject should dispence the same, removed from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Act.</p>

                  <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Houses</hi> have one and the same Distinction in Possession, being either <hi>Real,</hi> or <hi>Personal.</hi> And though the <hi>Latter</hi> Inherence may seem to issue from the <hi>Former,</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the <hi>Latter</hi> had first the preheminence in use; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the primitive and unstable abode of our Fore-fathers, before the Sword had yet establisht a distinct property, which



<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100123:72"/>
in process of time having reduced many Families of nighest Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance to one <hi>Civil</hi> Subjection, assumed, according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of their Powers, such a Proportion of the earth, as might preserve their lives with Pleasure and Tranquility. And to avoid the Incursion of their Borderers, erected such Receipts for their Assemblies, as might make Opposition to Invasion: In which, that every one might equally be concern'd, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts to each Owner was prescrib'd by common Divident, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tenor of the Institution, to whose Jurisdiction they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came subordinate by a mutual Interest: So that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Tenor</hi> of each <hi>Real</hi> Possession, is primitively inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> presideth the <hi>Society</hi> under the form of a <hi>Donation,</hi> with such Reserves of Interest therein, as might support the Investure of such Dignity. In Reference to such Consequence might probably become instituted the first Title of Inherency, as <hi>Feofs en taile,</hi> where the nighest male succeeds to the Possession.</p>
               <p>Subsequent to <hi>Feofs en taile,</hi> are <hi>Feofs simple,</hi> where the <hi>Real</hi> Possession descendeth to the Heirs General, under which Title Custom admitteth the <hi>Primogenitor</hi> also to succeed to the Succession, resting only this Difference betwixt <hi>This</hi> and the former Title of Inherence, that herein the Possessor hath a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to dispose of his Possession, in present or future, where and how he pleaseth, in the <hi>Former</hi> neither, being but Tenant for Life, and the next Male, lineally descended, must, though against his liking, become invested in the Right of his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>Another Title of Inherence to a Real Possession, is <hi>Feof en Farme;</hi> A Title usually issuing from the Concession of a Prince, where the Possession is transacted to a lineal Adherence, under the Reservation of a certain Rent.</p>
               <p>These Titles of Inherence have also Reference to certain <hi>Tenors,</hi> and are either held in Capite, Soccage, Knight-Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But why such Distinction of Tenors should remain, where the personal Engagements are dissolved, may prove an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a farther Inquisition: besides these general <hi>Tenors,</hi> there are also with us, customary or particular <hi>Tenors,</hi> as <hi>Gavil kinde,</hi> where every Party equal in Proximity, is admitted to an equal partage in the possession, <hi>borrow English</hi> where the youngest only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Personal</hi> Possessions are such, as by mutual Contract of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are consigned under certain Covenants, and for certain tearm, either by <hi>Copy,</hi> or <hi>Lease;</hi> though the <hi>former</hi> Title may seem under customary Priviledge to challenge a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Right. Yet since the Condition of the <hi>Copy</hi> bearing a Personal Prescription, and falling under a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity



<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100123:73"/>
of Retraction, may become void and divided from the Right of a Succession, without any voluntary Act or Surrender, it properly may fall under this Distinction.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Real</hi> Possession being originally derived from the <hi>Civil</hi> Institutor, whether his Investure therein were constituted by Agreement, or the Sword. Under the Title of <hi>Donation</hi> exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a special, or a general Succession, ought equitably to be serv'd by <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance in such adherence to a perpetuity: such was the Constitution of the <hi>Iudaick</hi> Possessions in their primitive Dividents, which could not be alienated from the Family or Succession, but till the ensuing <hi>Iubile,</hi> nor so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the next Successor, unless he had refused to accept the Sale. A plausible Institution to preserve agreeing <hi>Simitry</hi> in each Part of the <hi>Civil</hi> Structure, lend bounds to insatiate Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and succor to the Indigent. The <hi>Latter</hi> part of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution remaineth still in Force under the Texture of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law. The nighest in Relation, under Prescription of time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Capacity of Redemption. But the Corruption of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature still findes evasion to frustrate the Intent of any Ordinance establisht to the publick Benefit, usually disguising the Nature of the Sail, under the colour of exchange, though the pretence be never so unequally designed. That it may justly in this, as in many others, become a wonder to a rational In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection. Why <hi>Civil</hi> Societies so exactly consult, and so long deliberate on the Establishment of <hi>Their</hi> Decrees: yet suffer the Intent thereof, to become violated, mock't and cheated by adulterate Practises.</p>
               <p>No Title can truly impower the owner to pass the Possession of a <hi>Real</hi> Estate, equitably by <hi>Donation</hi> or <hi>Deed,</hi> but that of <hi>Acquisition,</hi> unles the Possession issue from a simple <hi>Donation,</hi> without reference to Succession; which then according to the Letter must terminate in his, to whom it is Transacted. In which case, if feasable, a <hi>Donation</hi> might fall under the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an <hi>Acquisition:</hi> In all other Respects the successors have a just Title of Inherence to the possession, and can no way be alienated without Injury, till the succession fail. The Industry of the Predecessors having equally for Object the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Family.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Real Acquisition</hi> is a Priviledge inherent only to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Aliens</hi> being generally excluded from the Capacity of a Real Possession under what Title soever, lest the substance In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to a <hi>Civil Society,</hi> should be transferred to a forreign use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Real Acquisitions</hi> are not without Reason limited in some <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi> by <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance, especially falling under usage of a Commulty; where the possession finding no Issue by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,



<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100123:73"/>
might possibly in process of time swell to so unequal a proportion, as might not be consistant with the <hi>Publick</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. To form the <hi>Acquisition</hi> legal, the <hi>Civil</hi> Law exacts the consideration be in a certain measure valuable, else becomes void in the Transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Real</hi> Possessions admitted general in <hi>Succession,</hi> are properly not subject to a Distinction in Sex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chattels</hi> or <hi>Moveables</hi> hold a vast extent in the Definition of their Nature, which may nevertheless be reduced to one <hi>Species,</hi> under the Distinction of Money, the Common Receptacle to all the Rest. In this Property we justly may become intitled from any hand by way of <hi>Donation,</hi> since no inherence can be constituted on so moveable and uncertain a Commodity, though Nature seem to claim the first Direction, and her order thereto the Progression: yet being the fruit of Industry or Parcimony, the Possessor denying himself the use thereof, may justly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Inclination in the Fruition of another, how remote so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But the most plausible Title to the Possession of this <hi>Property,</hi> is a just and regular <hi>Acquisition.</hi> The first and least subject to Corruption is the <hi>Manual,</hi> next the <hi>Official,</hi> last the <hi>Venal.</hi> Of the <hi>Venal</hi> the forreign. Of the <hi>Official</hi> the voluntary. Of the <hi>Manual</hi> the most necessary, from which principles issue all the Branches of a <hi>Civil</hi> Commerce.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Property</hi> also falls sometime under the Title of <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> when the Possessor dyes Intestate. But why the right of Administration should be so constituted in one Principle, by the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, contrary to her proper Order, as to exclude others equal in Descent, from equal Divident, may become a Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not unworthy a Publick Reflection, though the error seems cast on the untimely Advertisement of the pretenders. Or why as some affirm, the Female Line should be preferr'd before the Masculine, without Infringement to the <hi>Civil</hi> Order. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure admitting of no other Rule then what might blemish her own Institution, inclining rather to the certainty of Nature, then the Authority of her own Prescription.</p>

A more visible Proof whereof cannot be instanced, then what we may extract

from the Constitution and Issue of all humane Laws, though never so exactly constituted, being ordained for the Peace and Preservation of the whole Frame of <hi>Civil Union,</hi> are universally the highest fomenter of Division, and the most destructive Burden that any way imaginable can happen to <hi>It,</hi> insomuch, as all other Calamities and Inconvenients of what kinde soever have their peculiar Seasons, Relaxes, and Intermissions. But this inevitable poison, under the colour of a common Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is distributed, ev'n to the smallest Vessels of the <hi>Civil</hi> Structure. It will therefore be very material (more successfully to approach the general Nature of the Object of our Treatise) to search into the ground of so unhappy a Consequence, which probably may be disclosed in the Reflection of these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. 1. <hi>The mutual Disaffection of the People.</hi> 2. <hi>The Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that attends on the Issue and Pursuit of a Civil Decision.</hi> Though possibly might hereto be inferr'd divers other more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Circumstances, which frequently pervert the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law: as, 1. <hi>The Improper Constitution of Courts of Iudicature.</hi> 2. <hi>Their Error in Practice.</hi> 3. <hi>The Corruption of their Practitioners.</hi> 4. <hi>The Impropriety of the Law.</hi> Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, since the two former causes removed, will inevitably frustrate all Inconvenience might arise from any such Disorder, we only will insist on their Discussion.</p>

According to this Rule was form'd the Association of the <hi>Esseans,</hi> a Sect among the <hi>Iews,</hi> whose happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did far transcend the Pharisee, or Sadduce: Insomuch, as under their inherence, none fail'd of his security, depending wholly on the mutual succor of the whole <hi>Society,</hi> whose joynt Interest was engaged both to the timely, and the due support of every Member of their <hi>Civil</hi> Frame.

Our common Distinctions of Consanguinity, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance and Affinity, but spurious Emblems are of our Relations, in Reference to the proper use, and primitive Institution, being only kept alive by Record or Tradition, for the Advantage on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Particulars, not for the mutual Benefit of the joynt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency, which are no otherwayes therein concern'd, then as remote Collaterals, in future possibility, not in present Act; from whence ariseth Controversie, Dissention, and Debate; Batteries rather for mutual Ruine and Destruction, then <hi>Cytta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> for their common preservation; whose effects are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and deplorable, in that they frequently are distinguisht in the Transactions of the nighest Reference to a <hi>Natural Union:</hi> On whose Composure the <hi>Civil</hi> but pretends to raise her perfect Structure and Establishment: So that the Reflection of the Consequence justly may beget Astonishment in a digested sence, how it is possible the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction should resent the violation thereof, with so much Indifferency, since her Rights are to Natures but subordinate. Nor yet is our <hi>Positions</hi> only fram'd on <hi>Civil</hi> or on <hi>Moral</hi> Practises; our <hi>perfect'st Guide</hi> hath lent <hi>It</hi> a more eminent Distinction, affirming, <hi>Love to be the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> And how that <hi>Law</hi> should meet a happy Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which pursueth not in <hi>Her</hi> Prescriptions the Object of <hi>Her</hi> Execution, is questionless in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules a visible Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,

whether it be in the Imperfection of <hi>Her Nature,</hi> or Impropriety of <hi>Her Order.</hi> Whether in the Coruption of <hi>Her Ministers,</hi> or <hi>Error in their Practice,</hi> whereby the Members of a <hi>Civil</hi> Union may either be o're-powred, or ensnared in a <hi>Civil</hi> Transaction, lest any Grievance or Oppression hapning under such a procedure, might instigate the sufferers (judging the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Thereof</hi> by the Consequents) utterly to desert those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> whereon the <hi>Civil</hi> Fabrick chiefly was erected, and follow strange Chimero's of their own Invention, so form in their Division, such a Rupture in our <hi>Common Union,</hi> as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly may extend to the subversion of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame.</p>
               <p>From the Result of this our present Argument, will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ensue a due Perpensation of the next <hi>Collateral Impediment</hi> to the Intention, Propriety, and use of the Law. The first No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being the common Clause of a <hi>Civil</hi> Division, the second of a Relapse; In Regard that the <hi>Dammage</hi> and <hi>Disparagement attendeth on the Procedure and Issue of the Law,</hi> produceth in the resentment of the Agitators new passion for Revenge on any frivolous Pretence, which frequently are pursued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till both the Parties thereby become ruin'd with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. To remove this unhaypy Consequence from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Law, whose proper Object only is, <hi>Suum cuique reddere &amp; conservare.</hi> It will be highly requisite to the Propriety of a <hi>Civil</hi> Institution, in Reference to a Plea, that neither in the Issue or Persuit <hi>thereof</hi> be left remaining either sting or scar between the Agitators, which usually are therein enduced, either by <hi>Personal Disparagement, Indignity or Disgrace. Or Dammage in Cost or Delay. Or Burden of the Penalty.</hi> The former and the latter inconvenients may easily be rectified in a <hi>Plausible Summons</hi> only, and a <hi>feisable Reparation.</hi> The second not without Difficulty, in Respect the inevitable charge, which attendeth the Prosecution of a Plea, is not any other way distinguishable to be avoided, It seeming altogether Impossible, that so numerous a multitude should daily wait on the Proceeding of our <hi>Civil</hi> Agitation without any Advantage, more then the Demerit of the Action. In Reference to the Assertion, we may affirm, that there can not be a more honourable or satisfactory Imployment designed to any Person, whose fortune shall afford him vacancy from the urgency of his own Affairs, inherent to the necessity of his own subsistence, then to lend a voluntary assistance to so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Ministry, according to the Capacity and Number of his Associates: Such was the procedure of those ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, whose Vertue only lent a more splendid Lustre to the Dignity of their Countrey, then all the Glory of their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

               <p>But admit the parallel (in favour of our Infirmity) more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for our speculation, then our Imitation; might not Courts of Judicature be constituted in every County at the <hi>Publick Charge,</hi> allowing a sufficient entertainment annually to such a Number of Officiates, as might be fit to mannage the Affairs Co-incident to the Bounds of each peculiar Jurisdiction, whose Number being reduced into several Divisions, might alternately officiate ev'ry Moneth: so that the daily Agitation of the Court yielding a speedy Issue to their Pleas, they rarely could become o're-burdened in their Functions, either to their own Inconvenience, or anothers Prejudice: especially if no Action were admitted pleadable, which had not passed the Allowance of a peculiar Arbitrator, who might be so impowr'd as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a multitude of Frivolous Debates, which usually do but multiply one another to the Disturbance of the common Peace, and the Dammage and Destruction of the Agitators.</p>
               <p>In opposition to which Order may probably be alledg'd, that the inevitable Charge attendeth on the Issue of the Law, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly encounter a more just and proper Imposition, then that the Burden of the Agitation should fall upon the Injurer. The Objection may pass as an irrefutable Position, provided the Conclusion fall under the Restriction of <hi>a clear Capacity to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish,</hi> and <hi>a full Ability to perform.</hi>

               <p>WHen we shall with due Perpensation reflect on the extent of this <hi>Principle,</hi> in Reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> Transaction, It justly may produce a wonder in the shallowest Apprehension, that the Constitution of most Laws, in general, so remisly weigh the Consequence <hi>Hereof,</hi> as to cast the Decision in the common Ballance of a casual Trespass: under which indulgence probably the Practice <hi>Hereof</hi> hath spread It self into the most honourable Professions, and the nighest Relations, not only as an Act of Frailty, but as a plausible Habit in sufficiency, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Mystery of every mans Function in a <hi>Civil</hi> use: so that we might in Reason rather tearm some <hi>Civil Societies</hi> Artificial Pieces of disguised Impostury, then Essential or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Communities:</hi> In which Regard we will endeavour to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Nature, Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>Regulation Hereof</hi> most perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to a <hi>Civil</hi> welfare.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Trust is visibly the <hi>Band of Common Union,</hi> or the <hi>Principle conduct of a Civil Commerce;</hi> through which the nourishment of every Faculty therein becomes conveyed to the smallest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest Vessels of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, which received, as a regular Position, we may clearly from thence Collect how highly mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial It must be to the Improvement of a <hi>Civil</hi> Welfare to secure <hi>Trust</hi> from all manner of <hi>Fraud</hi> whatever, that it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd

               <p>In persuit whereof, we must first distinguish the Nature of a Trust e're we can reach our Intention, plac't in the extent of the use.</p>
               <p>In Reference to which Order, <hi>Trust</hi> is a free Act of the will to impart any thing in our Possession to anothers, under the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Retribution, either simply for the Interest of the <hi>Trustor,</hi> or soly for the Benefit of the <hi>Trustee,</hi> or generally for the mutual and common Advantage of either, or particularly for the use of neither; but to the use and Benefit of some other or others specified in the <hi>Trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which Distinction, in Reference to the Act, we may observe two Circumstances in manner of the <hi>Trust</hi> to establish it Authentick. First, That it be an Act of the <hi>Trustor</hi>'s free will, not enforc't on him by Violence, Urgency, Necessity, or any such Advantage on the Inclination of the will. Secondly, That whatever is transacted in the <hi>Trust</hi> be really without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in the clear Possession of the <hi>Trustor,</hi> as his unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable Property: otherwise, that Trust can prove but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect <hi>Trust,</hi> which is but raised on the Breach of <hi>Trust</hi> unto another, who may more justly claim an Interest in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
               <p>The Object of the Definition extends It self to four Branches, the <hi>two first,</hi> and <hi>the last,</hi> have soly Reference to a <hi>Common Unity,</hi> the <hi>Penultimate</hi> only to a <hi>Civil Commerce.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> may reach a Casual or Impulsive Breach to render It rationally unactionable. The <hi>second,</hi> but with Difficulty may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to such Priviledge. The <hi>two latter</hi> never fall under that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. In Regard the <hi>first</hi> Branch of <hi>Trust</hi> hath only Reference to the Interest of the <hi>Trustor.</hi> The <hi>Trustee</hi> only accepting of the trouble inherent to the Trust, as an Office of Amity, which is perfectly discharged in his endeavour to effect it; but not reaching the intention of either by casual or impulsive Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; the Dammage of necessity unjustly is imposed upon him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Branch of <hi>Trust,</hi> where the <hi>Trustee</hi> only reaps the Advantage of the <hi>Trust,</hi> meeteth some scruple in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of a <hi>Civil</hi> Procedure, on Casual or Impulsive Breaches of a <hi>Trust;</hi> inasmuch as the <hi>Trustor</hi> pretendeth to no benefit in the <hi>Trust.</hi> But possibly to his own Inconvenience, or other Disadvantage, for a season, hath resigned the use Thereof unto the Benefit and Advantage only of the <hi>Trustee:</hi> So that in Reference to the Priviledge aforesaid, on Casual or Impulsive Breaches of Trust, We only can, in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules, lay the ground of the <hi>Trustees</hi> Plea, upon a Right alone unto the <hi>Trustors</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, rather then in the inefficacy of the <hi>Trust,</hi> or the



<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100123:77"/>
Incapacity of the <hi>Trustee.</hi> It appearing a high Impropriety in <hi>Civil</hi> Rule to prosecute an Act of Retribution to the Dammage or Destruction of him to whose Improvement or Preservation It only was directed; and where the succor was friendly dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the Advantage Casually failing, a Reparation seems ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously exacted. But, as the <hi>Trustee,</hi> to whose use only the trust was intended, may seem too favourably admitted to the Exception of a <hi>Civil</hi> Procedure on Casual or Impulsive Breach of <hi>Trust;</hi> so the voluntary or Perverse Breaches of <hi>trust</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to the Advantage of the <hi>Trustee,</hi> may seem but too remisly Censured in a Bare Reparation of the <hi>trust:</hi> insomuch, as Pain for Profit must yet make the Return but too unequally Ballanced in a due Compensation of Right, which far more justly might extend to the Advantage, was thereby acquired, as a Retraction of the Intention of the <hi>trust</hi> so infamously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Branch of <hi>trust,</hi> which tendeth to the mutual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Transactors, is excluded such Capacity; insomuch as the <hi>trust</hi> is formed under a Conditional Contract, in pursuit of a common Lucre, where either runs the hazzard of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture by his proper Act, in Reference only to their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; so that the <hi>trust</hi> infringed, the <hi>Trustee</hi> voluntarily casts himself on the penalty of his Covenant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>latter</hi> Branch of <hi>trust,</hi> which requireth only the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection of the <hi>Trustee</hi> to the specifick use of others pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately or publickly concerned in the <hi>trust,</hi> can pretend to no <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity to free him from a Legal Prosecution, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a Breach of <hi>trust,</hi> in that it rests wholly in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>trustee,</hi> to accept or renounce the <hi>trust,</hi> to separate the Inherents of the <hi>trust</hi> from his own property, or alter or transact them as his own: so that nothing being exacted from the <hi>trustee,</hi> in execution of his <hi>trust,</hi> but his own will, It soly is his will that can infringe it, which tending to so material and charitable an use, failing only in the Retraction and Remisness of his will, he justly may sustain the penalty of his reproachful and injurious Reluctance or Neglect. This <hi>trust</hi> is usually a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamentary <hi>trust,</hi> which accepted, engageth the <hi>trustee</hi> as his own proper Act, so far as the Capacity of the Subject will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, which may also be farther distinguisht in a <hi>publick</hi> or a <hi>private trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Private</hi> so constituted, have frequently this Default, that they seldome reach to the intended use, when as directed to the Benefit of Children, who commonly have most need thereof; in that their present advantage is not only suspended, but the <hi>trust</hi> also many times so oft removed, e're they attain a due Capacity to exact it; that either the Inherents to the <hi>trust</hi>



                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:100123:77"/>
fail, or the <hi>trust</hi> it self falleth to the Ground, wanting either real or equitable Grounds yet farther to produce it: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect scarcely will be exactly rectified, but under the tuition of a <hi>Publick</hi> Court, constituted only for the safeguard of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as properly fall under a <hi>Civil Incapacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>trust</hi> exacted to a <hi>Publick</hi> use, seldom or never reacheth the Intention of the <hi>trustor,</hi> in that the Election is not sufficiently separated from the Interest of the <hi>trustees,</hi> who exercising their <hi>trust,</hi> as if only establisht for the Advantage of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, mutually assent to the Remonstrance or Intercession of one another, in favour of Particulars: whereas every Member of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> under the Capacity of the <hi>trust,</hi> ought to have an equal Priviledge in the Benefit <hi>thereof.</hi> And having, without just exception, attested his Capacity in Presentation, should by equal Lot be cast into a visible and orderly Reception with the rest, from thence to be extracted by an impartial hand. Farthermore, in such partial Elections, all Abuses and Breaches of <hi>trust</hi> whatsoever, become utterly smothered by taking away the freedom of Impeachment from those are soly interessed in the <hi>trust,</hi> in a servile Adherence to the patronage of the <hi>trustees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude our Discussion of the Nature of our <hi>Subject,</hi> we may pertinently here insert one General Exception against all the former Branches of a <hi>trust,</hi> That none of them be passed under such a form, oblickly constituted for collateral and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit uses, not exprest in the <hi>trust:</hi> which Procedure may justly be excluded the Suffrage of a <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction, being the common shrouds to the most specious and Considerable <hi>Frauds</hi> in Practice.</p>
               <p>As to those Forms of <hi>trust,</hi> passed on Contracts of <hi>Marriage,</hi> they seem improperly constituted in the Hands of a Particular, or Particulars, of how nigh Relation soever; in that every small Occurrent tending to the inconvenience but of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therein, have commonly sufficient Influence to o'rethrow the <hi>trust,</hi> unto the Prejudice of the Rest, not of Capacity to yield to the Transaction: so that necessity will lend us a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to fly to publick safeguard for Redress; where such Acts becoming totally irrevocable, they may infallibly attain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per use to which they were directed.</p>
               <p>Under which Notion may likewise be comprised. <hi>Guardiant trusts,</hi> either Testamentary, Successive, or Elective; which having, for Object only the Benefit of such as are not under a capacity to act either judiciously, or freely for their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, in respect of their <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity, or else the strict subordinacy to a nigh Relation. Their Interests (in reference to



<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100123:78"/>
many Inconvenients may thereon ensue) might more successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be managed under the publick Tutelage.</p>
               <p>Having thus far generally discussed on the Nature of our <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> we will proceed to agitate on the use <hi>thereof</hi> in some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; in the Introduction whereof we incounter some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, both in Reference to our Order, and Importance in our matter; which is, whether the <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Relation ought first to be admitted to a Precedency in <hi>trust?</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion may at the first Inspection appear of little Ambiguity, and as little moment, one only exception but reserv'd: insomuch, as we have formerly inserted, that the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame is only form'd from the connexion and concinety of the Natural: yet when the Dissolution of the <hi>Former</hi> may be threatned in the Preservation of the <hi>Latter.</hi> We must affirm it much juster, that one cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minel perish in the Infringement of a <hi>natural</hi> Law, then that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny innocents should be destroyed by the dispensation of a <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance: As in matter of Treason, where in every Act of unviolated <hi>trust,</hi> the <hi>Trustee</hi> becomes an Accessary to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, In which Respect, the Transaction falling between the Father and the Son, the Son may probably claim Advantage from the same Law of <hi>Nature</hi> to warrant his Discovery, as the Father might exact to enjoyn Concealment. <hi>Quisque sibi Proximus.</hi> Yet the Romans held such Primitive Inherencies in so great Reverence, that they dispenced with all <hi>Civil</hi> Tyes in favour of their Rights. A Slave might without Impeachment conceal his detected Master, much rather a Wife, a Childe might be admitted to such a Priviledge; though the case pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly may require a more exact Distinction; since after detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Attempt falls under a Capacity of Prevention: And the concealment then tends but to the safeguard of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, not to the Promoting the Delinquence: From whence we may conclude, that such Relations may, without Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be licenc't the Protection of the Criminel, provided It reach not a participation of the Crime: which exception in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance interjected, we may without farther scruple, accept the <hi>Wife</hi> to the first and highest degree of <hi>trust,</hi> since on her Faith we cast the Model of our <hi>Oeconomy</hi> for the enlargement of our Fortunes; and in the Affiance of her Fidelity, we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to our Succession. In Reference to these two Objects of a <hi>Civil</hi> Union, though perhaps unequally Ballanced, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest <hi>Societies</hi> of a <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction have passed the Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her <hi>trust</hi> under a Criminel Sentence, specified in the Interdiction of these <hi>Principles, Adultery, Suborning a Childe, Drinking Wine, Counterfeiting Kayes.</hi> The three first take is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue from one and the same Intention, which is the security of our own succession in a lawful Propagation: the <hi>two first</hi> really,



<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100123:78"/>
in regard of the Action. The <hi>third</hi> but conjecturally, in regard of scandalous Intention. The last particular reflecteth only on the safeguard of the <hi>Civil</hi> Property, which in such Infringement of <hi>trust</hi> manifestly tending to a fraudulent subversion; the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Judicature conceiving them to hold one and the same Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Intent, lent them but one and the same weight in the Punishment; yet with this Limitation, that the execution should pass under the Authority only of the Principal. The <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction, in all Ages, seeming very scrupulous to intervene in the Decision of Differences between Parties so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely united, that should, in Reason, but enjoy one common Interest; so that if any such permission in a Domestick Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action were derived from the <hi>Civil</hi> Authority, which might in Reference to the Offence, seem too severe. It might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Trespass was not only obvious, but of a very high Nature, that should enforce a man so to divide Himself ev'n from Himself, where the very sense of Nature was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently effectual to leniate the most rigorous Austerity: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which Conclusion, possibly, <hi>Moses Civil</hi> Institution forbore to judge the weight of a Filial Disobedience to lend it a Criminel Infliction, but commanded, that the Offender should be brought forth by the hand of his Parent; whose Bowels would ev'n in the first Intention, have relented in a natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment, so to expose their own Flesh and Blood to the Fury of the People, had not the offence been altogether held inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable, But the Frailty of Humane Nature, in succession of Time contracting new and extravagant Corruptions to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Natural Light, whose Motives now becoming not the Object of their <hi>Union,</hi> must not, without Reason, fail in her Resentment, hath justly deprived him of so material a Priviledge, without a Reference to the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction. The <hi>Civil</hi> Law not so much as admitting him to a capacity unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to divide his own Goods amongst his Children, without sufficient ground confirm'd by legal Procedure: to which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Decision, we will contract our former <hi>Principles,</hi> that we better may conclude on the equity of their Censure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adultery</hi> can want no other weight to lend it a Criminel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, then the Light of the sacred Institution, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To suborn a Childe,</hi> must without contradiction, in Respect of the Consequence, reach the highest Nature of a <hi>Felony,</hi> both in the Contriver and the Coadjutor: Insomuch as the Estate, both Personal and Real, unjustly is took from the Natural and immediate Inherents to the succession. As to the <hi>trust</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the <hi>Wife,</hi> which probably might herein alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Trespass; since Breach of <hi>trust</hi> can properly not be



<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100123:79"/>
extended to an actual <hi>Felony:</hi> which granted, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the <hi>Felony</hi> (not extending to the <hi>Trustor,</hi> both in Respect of his <hi>trust,</hi> and that he yet remains in full Possession of his Property) may notwithstanding be so qualified, extending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others Interest, betwixt whom and the <hi>Trustee,</hi> passed no act of <hi>trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To drink Wine</hi> seems but a frivolous offence to counterpoise so rigorous an Imposition as <hi>their</hi> Death, and probably may be rather judg'd an Inhibition only appropriated to some peculiar Custom or Climate, then an essential Rule to form a rational conclusion to a General use: yet taken universally, as extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Habit in excess. It may be held more then a conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral circumstance to the former impeachment, in that (without Reference to the motive thus visibly fomented in the Practice) A Woman in such Disorder can make pretence but to a slight safeguard of her Honour: So that, both in regard of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and Danger in the consequence of the use. We justly may suspend the Trespassor from the capacity of a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union, the ground being of sufficient weight to exact a legal Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To counterfeit Keyes,</hi> This Interdiction was probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted under the usage of <hi>Palygamy,</hi> where the <hi>Wife</hi> was rather esteemed the purchase of their <hi>Property,</hi> then a companion in <hi>Society:</hi> in which servile condition of Wedlock, like so many several Factions, every one endeavoured by all means possible to enlarge the Fortune of their own Production, and extendeth only to a breach of <hi>trust</hi> imposed on the safety of our Goods; wherein, according to the Institution of our Law, the <hi>Trustee</hi> hath an equal Interest, although sequestred from her use under the Tuition of another: in which Respect the <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature reflects not on the Nature of the Fact, but as a private Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and leaves it only to the regulation of the Principle, in whose capacity alone It is to separate His Wife from his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> or his <hi>Property</hi> from his <hi>Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Children</hi> can by the priviledge of their Extraction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be intitled to no inherence of a <hi>Civil trust</hi> more then the Father shall assign him by his special Order; and in the Breach <hi>thereof,</hi> become only liable to such correction, as the Father shall impose, without a Reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> censure: insomuch, as they have a collateral Right inherent to the property, and should in Reason, need no stricter tye to the due Execution of their <hi>trust,</hi> then their proper Interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Servants</hi> fall under the next Adherence to a <hi>trust,</hi> which may yet more clearly be distinguished in an <hi>Explicit,</hi> and an <hi>Implicit trust.</hi> The <hi>Implicit trust</hi> extendeth generally unto the safeguard of his Masters Goods. The <hi>Explicit</hi> lends a more visible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation



<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100123:79"/>
of the Nature of this <hi>trust,</hi> under the limits of a a conditional Prescription: so that the Infringement of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit <hi>trust</hi> may properly be tearmed a breach of Contract, though not so fully under the Distinction of a <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass, as the Explicit is: Yet if the <hi>Trustee</hi> shall under pretence of his General <hi>trust</hi> appropriate to his peculiar use, or otherwise alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Goods of his Master not committed to his charge, the guilt may be extended to a <hi>Criminel</hi> impeachment.</p>
               <p>In these <hi>Particulars</hi> only is establisht a <hi>Domestick Trust,</hi> with Reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> Unity. Our order next requires, that we reflect on other forms of <hi>trust,</hi> which properly may be reduced to a more general usage, either <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>Private.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Publick trust</hi> is either <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Special.</hi> The General is either <hi>Implicit</hi> or <hi>Explicit:</hi> The <hi>Special</hi> only is Commissionary; both are derived from one common <hi>Principle; Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and directed to one common <hi>Object,</hi> the <hi>Publick</hi> use: So that falling under one common Consequence in their Nature, they may meet one common Distinction in their Infringement. though in Reference to the Subject they handle, some have a more material extent of Dammage in their Issue then others: every visible and voluntary Delinquence in a <hi>Publick trust</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to a Crime of <hi>Iese Majesty,</hi> in respect, that not only the common welfare or Dammage depend on the Transaction: But the Dignity or Honour of a Prince or State become ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished in such miscarriages, passing as his or their own proper Act, either in the Election of their <hi>Ministers,</hi> or in the order of their <hi>Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>General trust</hi> in <hi>Publick</hi> Interest, is what every Member of a <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity, was born to in common Right of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and may be specifi'd in Acts of his <hi>Allegiance</hi> either <hi>Implicitly,</hi> as a <hi>National Injunction,</hi> or <hi>Explicitly,</hi> as an <hi>Adjur'd Prescription.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> engageth as a <hi>Civil</hi> duty; the <hi>latter</hi> also, as our proper Act. A Trespass against the <hi>first</hi> order may possibly seem but to infringe a <hi>Civil</hi> Institution. The <hi>latter</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a sacred Ordinance: The <hi>first</hi> may by Act of Grace become restored to his Purity. The <hi>latter</hi> justly never to be admitted to a <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity.</p>
               <p>Special Acts of <hi>Publick trust,</hi> extending to a <hi>Publick</hi> use, may reach a vaster Latitude. The <hi>National, Iusticial, Negotiary,</hi> and the <hi>Military.</hi> The two <hi>latter</hi> more properly inherent to the exterior object of our <hi>Minister,</hi> we have reserv'd to their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Order.</p>
               <p>The <hi>National trust</hi> extending to a <hi>Publick</hi> use, is the highest and most material Distinction of a <hi>trust</hi> (implied such under the License of a free Election) where the people under Commission of the Supream Authority, make a peculiar choice of their



<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100123:80"/>
                  <hi>Trustees</hi> to agitate on their common Interests, in a <hi>Publick</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. How this <hi>trust</hi> may become visibly and wilfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached in the <hi>trustee's</hi> prosecution of his <hi>trust,</hi> is not clearly obvious, where the lesser Number must of necessity recede unto the Greater, unless it might be imputed to a Remissness in his Agitation. If any Subject should fall in discussion, which might possibly be repugnant to the peculiar Interest of the <hi>trustors.</hi> The <hi>trustee</hi> led by Integrity, and Judgement, may, without blemish, promote the matter, tending more universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Advantage of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, since the whole <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> consisting of many <hi>trustees,</hi> can properly fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neither is the <hi>trust</hi> transigned to the <hi>trustee</hi> by the People, other then a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral <hi>trust,</hi> whose original resideth in the Supream Authority; to whose Councel <hi>they</hi> are summon'd to consult on the welfare of the whole <hi>Frame.</hi> So that the Infringement of <hi>trust</hi> must properly be derived, <hi>Either from the Peculiar Exercise of their Office,</hi> or the <hi>General Object of their use,</hi> inherent to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>trustor,</hi> and diffus'd from thence to the Collaterals. The Office is soly posited in Council, not in Rule; to Consult, not to Determine; to Remonstrate, not to Conclude; to Apply, not to Exact; to Present, not to Enact: All such Improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the <hi>Publick</hi> Transaction of the <hi>trustee</hi> may properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the infringement of the Publick <hi>trust,</hi> if singularly not cleared in a Publick Attestation.</p>
               <p>The General Object of their use, is one common Agreement the <hi>Publick Good;</hi> but that <hi>Good</hi> sometimes not rightly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, wanting a due coherence with the Principle, whereas rightly understood, the Interests of the Prince have so nigh a Reference with those of the people, that they are properly but <hi>termini Convertibiles.</hi> The Benefit of the Prince being the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the People, and the Advantage of the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Benefit of the Prince; so that of necessity, who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the one, impaireth the other, and consequently falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a visible Delinquence of that <hi>trust,</hi> which was imposed on Him in the Transaction.</p>
               <p>The next succeeding Act of special <hi>trust,</hi> is the <hi>Iusticial,</hi> or <hi>Iusticiary,</hi> which passeth also under a Commissionary Form. This Distinction of <hi>trust</hi> hath apparently a material Influence in a <hi>Civil</hi> welfare, and seems but too abstrusely limited in the capacity of the <hi>Principle,</hi> where so many <hi>Substitutes</hi> necessarily depend on the Transaction, unless we might conclude them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all Miscarriages, as visible Defaults in their Election. Suffrage or Incircumspection, too heavy a Burden for him to undergo, is only called to the simple <hi>Exposition of the Letter,</hi>

                  <hi>and the Regularity of the Court.</hi> Yet nevertheless, since every material infringement of <hi>trust</hi> must be enlightned by the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will (not distinguishable, but in an equal Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance clearly preceding to exact the Remedy) either in <hi>Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Difficulty,</hi> or <hi>Defect</hi> to our Addresses, may render the said <hi>Principal</hi> impeachable in his <hi>trust.</hi>

This inconvenience hath taken Root in most <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> either through <hi>a Licentious tolleration,</hi> or a <hi>Difficulty in Regulation.</hi> Pretences of Improvement, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Trade probably ushering an Indulgence to the <hi>Former,</hi> while Lux and Neglect lent Obstruction to the <hi>Latter;</hi> every one no farther weighing a General Interest, but in resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own particular: So that the whole Method of a <hi>Civil</hi> Commerce, becomes but one general intercourse of <hi>Pippery:</hi> But it may here possibly be objected, that this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order may sooner fall under every Mans Observation, then any Mans Regulation. In Reply we will only return a Pattern from some Particulars, as the common Materials to our Livelihood; which, under sundry <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> have their publick, known, and limited Imposition of Rates, rising and falling, as their depending Exigents require: From which method we may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a Paralel to a more General usage.</p>
               <p>For Closure of our Argument, as an equilibrate to this <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass, in General; we may cast into the Ballance a due Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the essential Dammage in Relation to the Fact; which reaching not a due Reparation to the Offence in a meer impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Restitution, being but a bare Consequent to the Casual Discovery: we must yet exact a weightier Imposition to lend the Crime an equal compensation, contracted from the more potential Issue, in Reference to the Intent, where the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets an equal Consequence in the Adventure: It may otherwayes be figured a Game but at half Stakes; where the Winner draws nothing but his own, and the Loser hazzards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Aire, in the Impeachment of his Fame, as the due

               <p>Of equal weight, and far more justly, in Respect of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, may hereto be annexed Acts of <hi>Iusticial Perjury,</hi> from whence a Dammage not only is contracted to particulars; but <hi>Iustice</hi> it self thereby becomes Impeachable, raising her Fabrick on a corrupt Foundation, unto whose Evidence she had resign'd her full Authority. A matter of the highest <hi>trust,</hi> where Goods, Fame, Liberty, and Life become subverted in a treacherous Procedure. In reference to which Trespass the <hi>Sacred Letter</hi> (according to the Potential and Intentional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the Matter) layes an authentick Reparation, in an equal Prescription, <hi>Then shall you do unto him, as he would have done unto his Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some other Acts of Private <hi>trust,</hi> may also here be instanced, which in their simple Nature hold not so strict a Reference with the <hi>Publick</hi> Interest, though according to the Matter they do work upon, may sometime possibly, with the <hi>Former</hi> hold an equal Paralel, as Acts of <hi>Forgery;</hi> which according to vulgar usage, strictly taken, is, <hi>Aliquid, Manus Artificio falsi vero In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuare,</hi> whether the quality of this Fact may reach a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then a <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass, is not clearly yet determinable. Most Laws seem in the Nature of their Penalty, which tending but to Infamy, yet leave the Trespassor, still Subject to a <hi>Civil</hi> Reparation; though usually the Practicers are in a condition not capable of either.</p>
               <p>The Constitution of the Trespass yet more nighly visited, we properly may lend the <hi>Fact</hi> a higher consequence: not only, in that such vilde Transactions pass usually under the Authority of such <hi>Publick</hi> Forms should guide us to a true Distinction in every thing transacted, but also, in regard the Infringement of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>trust</hi> becometh Introduced by assuming something proper to another, not intrusting, as their own; wherein, although the Party not intrusting seems to lose nothing really: yet in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, it possibly may engage his Honour, Goods, and Person in

               <p>HAving formerly searched into the Nature of this <hi>Principle,</hi> in Reference to the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Natural Union,</hi> we will here Reflect on <hi>It</hi> in Relation only to the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Civil Property;</hi> wherein we may first generally observe, that no <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass whatever more highly infringeth the order of a <hi>Civil Society,</hi> then <hi>Violence,</hi> however figured, being as it were, a private Insurrection against the <hi>Civil</hi> Power; In which regard, 'tis probable our Laws do interdict, that any one in such a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure</hi> should become reinvested in his <hi>Property,</hi> though visibly never so injuriously detain'd: And on this Consideration only have possibly formed the severity of their Penal Statutes against Acts of Felony, which seldom are specifically committed, but under some degree of <hi>Violence,</hi> though frequently the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise may finde no Opposition: for whether such Goods assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med were under safeguard of <hi>House, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As to Goods <hi>Immaniable</hi> or <hi>Wilde,</hi> to which no one can properly lay a just claim of Right, but as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidents to the Prescription of their own Possessions. The



<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100123:82"/>
matter of their taking, though within compass of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bounds, can questionless extend but to a <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass, unless in opposition of their Keeper, if forth their Limits ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they justly pay the Forfeit of their Dammage.</p>
               <p>What other Circumstance in Particular, with Reference to <hi>Place, Matter, Motive, Manner,</hi> or <hi>Measure,</hi> may either aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or lenefie the Matter or Nature of the Offence, we farther will endeavour to discover.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Place</hi> can lend no other weight to the offence, then what may thereto be appropriated, in Reference to the person damnified; which not extending any farther Detriment, then barely the privation of his <hi>Goods,</hi> may yet be weighed in a higher Consequence, either taken violently from his Person, wheresoever encountered, or from his House, the place of his security: Insomuch, as Nature prompting every one to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, either in Opposition or Persuit; both equally adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd by the Injured, with hazzard of his life, may equally be ballanced with the Forfeiture of his, shall wrongfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Issue.</p>
               <p>The Quality of the materials may sometime amplifie the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Offence; as Goods consecrated to a holy use, where the Malefactor not only makes an hostile Incursion upon <hi>Civil</hi> Rights, but in contempt of his Creator's Ordinance; yet farther seems to violate and cast off the Rites of his Exterior Worship, should binde us in one common Union by his impious Sacriledge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Motive</hi> may sometime not only vary the measure of the Crime, but also change the nature of the Fact, when every Circumstance therein shall tend but to support the present ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of Nature; it being but a Reproach unto a <hi>Civil Society.</hi> to qualifie that with the Distinction of anothers Trespass, was properly their own, either in Remisness of their Circumspection; or of Relief unto an useless or languishing Member of their Frame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> also frequently may leniate the Nature of the offence, where the negligence of the safeguard may Minister oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the attempters practise, and instigate a facile Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Design, not formed in his purpose: In which Respect perhaps our Laws reflect on the depriving of our Goods by slight, when under personal Tuition, with no more severity then a petty Larcin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>measure</hi> or value of the Trespass can lend us but a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inspection into the weight thereof to moderate or aggravate the Nature of the Attempt: For as a small matter may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time prove an evidence to a high necessity or Indigence, so may It often be an Argument of an habitual inclination to a vitious



<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100123:82"/>
Custome, which may yet probably be further distinguished in the frequency of the Fact.</p>
               <p>Having thus enlightned the Nature of our <hi>Subject</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with some material Circumstances <hi>therein.</hi> We will insist to agitate <hi>thereon</hi> with more peculiar Reference to the <hi>Civil Property.</hi> Every <hi>Personal violence</hi> tending to Alienation, under what Relation soever, <hi>Wife, Child, Servant</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> is without doubt a <hi>Criminel Trespass:</hi> not only, in that a private Person is thereby usually reduced into Bondage, and the whole Family suffer under the calamity of the Outrage. But the <hi>Civil Society</hi> becomes thereby dismember'd of a Branch belonging to their <hi>Common union,</hi> in an hostile Insurrection against the <hi>Publique</hi> Peace. In which respect alone, 'tis probable the Crime should meet so high a penalty, wherein, as in other Criminel <hi>Trespasses,</hi> the Dignity of the <hi>Civil</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature would yet become more illustrated in the Reflection also of the Interest of Collaterals therein damnified</p>
               <p>A <hi>Personal Violence</hi> to <hi>Wife, Child,</hi> or <hi>Servant</hi> without an Alienation, may sometime fall under the distinction of a <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minel Trespass,</hi> as in matter of Rape, where not only the <hi>Civil</hi> but the Natural Order becomes barbarously perverted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>House</hi> may also suffer actual <hi>violence,</hi> as in Acts of <hi>Burglary,</hi> which Outrage is justly censured as a <hi>Criminel Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass</hi> without any regard to the Materials, or strength of the structure; Insomuch as ev'ry mans Habitation is to the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of his Goods and Person a fortress of Defence. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Letter</hi> prescribes hereto a certain Limitation, in reference to the Time. <hi>If the Sun be risen on him, his bloud shall not be spilt.</hi> Whether it were that his Person were with the Light become distinguishable, or that the People, then roused from their slumbers, were in a capacity to pursue or attache him, is not clearly manifest, neither being necessarily inherent to the exception, which in the ground of the Interdiction annexed, seems explicitely thereby to have changed the Nature of the Trespass. <hi>For he should make Restitution,</hi> lending it no other weight in such a Circumstance, than a <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein the general Distinction of a <hi>Theft</hi> according to the Sacred <hi>Letter,</hi> from whence we may collect new Matter to an Argument Material to a farther Discussion. Whether it were more Consonant to Reason and the <hi>Civil</hi> welfare to pass sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Larcins</hi> under the distinction of a <hi>Civil</hi> or a <hi>Criminel</hi> Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass. The prementioned Authority might seem to silence the pretence of an Objection, had not the spreading corruption of Mans depraved Nature daily required a more Rigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. In which respect, we will decline the Luster of so eminent a Light, (though it more plausibly might be our



<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100123:83"/>
guide,) more clearly to disclose the weight <hi>thereof</hi> in every Circumstance, hath reference to our Frailty in a <hi>Civil</hi> Practice.</p>
               <p>In order to the proposition we may inferr, where general Acts of <hi>Theft</hi> fall under a <hi>Criminel</hi> distinction, the manner of the Fact is more mischievously prosecuted, on the least jealousie of Surprize, or a Discovery. And the Attempters life once visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attainted, anothers Life becomes too slight a consideration to lend restraint to farther Insolence: So that the Rights of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture often urge to perpetrate an Evil not intended. In persuit of their safety to destroy Another; Nor is there Matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, when as the pilfering Circumstance is with the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique Issue held equivalent. Whereas the Fact extending but unto a <hi>Civil</hi> Trespass, no rational Man would wilfully incurr a greater Hazard to avoid a less. Where the <hi>Trespass</hi> is ballanc'd with the forfeit of <hi>a Life,</hi> the Injured prosecuteth the Offender to his farther Damage, without any hope to be restored to his <hi>Property.</hi> Where <hi>Reparation</hi> only is the Penalty to the Fact, the <hi>Trespassee</hi> becomes not only reinvested in his <hi>Property,</hi> but makes a considerble advantage of the Injury. <hi>The Restitution reaching to a double Retribution, when the Property was taken in the custody of the Trespassor, when alienated extending to a Quadruple or a Quintuple</hi> compensation, So that every Member of a <hi>Civil</hi> Society is not only hereby animated to a vigilant Circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Preservation, but the Improvement also of his Property, which intentive Caution becomes remissly abated in a supine neglect, where the possession seems fortified under the severity of a Criminel Infliction.</p>
               <p>To which conclusion may possibly be alledg'd; that Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes of this Nature are seldome perpetrated but by persons of a desperate Fortune, who are incapable of other Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than a Corporal Infliction.</p>
               <p>The Objection passing for Receivable, may probably on a more exact Inquisition, fortifie the former Assention. When we shall duely consider, that who flie from a certain existence by Industry, to acquire an uncertain Livelihood by the daily hazard of their Lives, will, questionless with greater Terror, resent the rigorous Imposition of their Hands, then the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Interception of their Breath. They only become indulgent to Life, who daily taste of the indulgences of Life. It being frequently observed among Licencious, desperate, and deboist People, that the Innocent, for a petty Salary, will cast the fatal Lot imposed on the Criminel.</p>
               <p>Perhaps in the Propriety of the Rule may yet appear a farther difficulty. How restitution should really be exacted, where nothing can visibly be Leavied. The <hi>Sacred</hi> Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the Objection, <hi>He shall be sold for his Theft;</hi> but



<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100123:83"/>
such Impropriety may be alledg'd in <hi>Christian</hi> Practice not so warrantable: Nor was it so under the former Institution, but with limitation of time, which not reaching the value of the Trespass, in the Term prescribed, might probably become renewed, though not explicitely implyed in the Letter. It may also fall under some Ambiguity; what advantage should be acquir'd from the imployment of Persons so improper for a <hi>Trust,</hi> and so unapt for Labor. As to the <hi>former</hi> Instance, we may grant them utterly excluded such capacity; and the <hi>Latter</hi> may be concluded Fruitless, without the high severity of their Keepers, which aggravated either by the Avarice of the One, or the stubborn remissness of the Other, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time probably extend unto a Breach in our Humanity. In which respect alone tis probable the use of slaves have so long been ('mong civiliz'd Nations) quite abolished. But the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equally remitted to the vigilance of the <hi>Iusticiary</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may probably meet an Institution more approveable, which being appropriated to the advantage of our Foreign Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

to guide him perfectly in the Decision of his Rights, yet few men have Integrity to follow it. Avarice and Animosity, both furiously persue and passionately embrace the heaviest Imposition can be warranted by Authority; so that it will be very material to the useful <hi>Ministry</hi> of a <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction, not to yield up Her sword without Reserve to any, though the ground exacting It, be never so considerable, lest a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Fury should press the Consequence to the Subversion of a joynt Associate.

               </p>
               <p>Subsequent to this Distinction in a Civil <hi>Trespass,</hi> is that infrequent usage, which our Practitioners reduce under <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Personal</hi> Actions.

the fraudulent mixtures of sundry Interests collaterally consistant with the Trespassors.

               <p>A <hi>Personal</hi> Trespass may sometime possibly fall under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of a <hi>special</hi> Contract, where usually the Letter lends a Rule unto the Law; but falling under the omission of a verbal Covenant, the weight thereof may reach too high a Consequence, to lend <hi>it</hi> an exact Decision from auricular proof; Insomuch, as the Principles have not waded into so mature a consideration, as to become exactly understood to one another, much less unto an unadvising Auditory, who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily become diverted from a Subject, wherein they totally should be disinteressed, to render thereof an Authentique Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

               <p>The Dignity of a Family materially consisting in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Wife,</hi> we properly may <hi>First</hi> reflect on such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions as tend unjustly to defame her Conjugal Fidelity. Not only in respect of future blemishes, may thereby be transferr'd on her succession, to a lasting prejudice: but also in Regard the present welfare of <hi>this Civil</hi> unity, chiefly depending on their mutual Love, is thereby shoke, if not subverted in the ensueing breaches of undermining Jealousies, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times break forth in Tragique Issues; so that it will become highly material to the safeguard of a <hi>Civil</hi> union, that the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Iudicature</hi> should make a considerable defence against so important a Disorder: not to the suppressing of such scandals as are implyed only under the strict Notes of their Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but such licencious Imputations also as become shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with artificial and disguised Glosses, extending to oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious terms of Infamy, though such general Notes of Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, may pass as unimpeachable, seeming but to figure an unadvised passion; no purposed design of Malice, in respect, that if ev'ry such momentary distemper of the Mind might lend our Frailty such a Priviledge, no mischief but would find a shelter under such Protection: and though the <hi>Civil</hi> Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature should impute it but an Act of Passion; the common Auditory will scarcely so interpret it, in whose censure alone, the Fact becomes injurious and impeachable.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100123:85"/>Farthermore, the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction declining in the Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the protection of the innocent in a plausible satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exasperates the fury of incensed Parties to prosecute a Reparation of their own Election, which frequently extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a deplorable Issue, reverts the Guilt upon the <hi>Civil</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; whose remiss Institution had lent Licenciousness to the fomenting of so high Disorders.</p>
               <p>This scandalous <hi>Imputation</hi> extending to a <hi>Criminel</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment (according to the Constitution of divers <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdictions) may farther justly meet an Attribute of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nature then a <hi>Civil Trespass:</hi> although most <hi>Laws</hi> have (under such a Reference in their censure, not visibly implyed such Distinction. Where the Charge is so invectively insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, that the Life of the Innocent becomes cast into a doubtful ballance. To warrant the assertion Regular; we shall need to insert no farther proof, then what we may collect from Sacred Practises, as the Prophets Imposition on <hi>Susanna</hi>'s malicious Prosecutors. So likewise other <hi>Trespasses</hi> of Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation reaching to a Criminel Impeachment (though inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualy succeeding in the Prosecution) incurr equivalent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, though perhaps it may be instanced, that Laws have in the weight of each Transaction, no other Object to direct their course, then the Result of those occurrents onely fall in Act, without reflection on the Intentional, which rarely are discoverable.</p>
               <p>In answer to the Objection is reply'd. That every general <hi>Axiome</hi> of such Dignity, to become proper to so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a <hi>Structure,</hi> ought to have such <hi>Solidity</hi> in the Position, that every Branch <hi>Thereof</hi> should also thereto become Regular. But the true Efficacie of this Rule hath but uncertain Tenure. As we may visibly inferr on Acts of <hi>Slaughter.</hi> Where the Fact becomes distinguishable in her Nature, only by such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as may give Light to the Intention. And in matter of <hi>Treason,</hi> where the intention only (without any reference to the Fact) becomes impeachable.</p>
               <p>But where such <hi>Defamation</hi> extending to a <hi>Criminel</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment is legally not prosecuted. The Nature thereof que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless, may properly be distinguished within the Limits of a <hi>Civil Trespass.</hi>

               <p>Whether a <hi>Customary</hi> Right extending to a <hi>Civil</hi> Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should bear an equal weight in our <hi>Distinction,</hi> may meet a high perplexity in the Decision, since every <hi>Customary Right</hi> within their Circumscription becomes equivolent to a <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance, under Tuition of the <hi>Civil</hi> Suffrage, though total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to the Constitution of <hi>her</hi> general Order. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety scarce receivable in a <hi>Civil</hi> usage. That the Influence of a Decree should neither move equally nor universally to every part of like Capacity, to discover the ground of such a Priviledge, were not of little moment to the rational Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Civil</hi> Institution. In persuit of the enlightning may be inferr'd, that <hi>her</hi> admittance to a <hi>Civil</hi> Allowance may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly meet divers Occurrents scarce obvious to the nicest obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, involv'd in the obscurity of many Circumstances are lost in the Elapse of Time, and sundry changes.

               <p>The two <hi>Latter</hi> Inducements may plead a more plausible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to their Establishment, pretending only to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Civil Frame:</hi> As in the <hi>Publick</hi> Devastations of <hi>Towns, Cities,</hi> or <hi>Harbours,</hi> by eminent Disaster. The <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction sometime is enforced to invite Recourse of <hi>Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> to re-edifie and re-populate such Scituations, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of some new <hi>Immunities,</hi> peculiar to their Habitations. So on urgency of Affairs, where Receipts of Commerce, <hi>Ports, Harbours,</hi> Places of Defence, are on the Borders of a <hi>Civil</hi> Circumscription, peculiarly erected for the common Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Encouragement of Trade. <hi>Immunities</hi> are often granted by the <hi>Civil</hi> Power for the Advantage of the <hi>Common</hi> Welfare in a plausible Institution. But where the cause of such Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall cease, or where no Ground for such a Priviledge can be suggested; but the Inherents of equivolent Capacity with any other of their joynt Associates in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. Such <hi>Graces</hi> are unequally enlarged or continued under Allowance of a <hi>Civil</hi> Institution, in that those singular Advantages may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently impeach a <hi>common</hi> Interest, either in Opposition, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, Interception, Obstruction, or Impediment in a common Procedure or Commerce, or other <hi>Civil</hi> Transaction.</p>
               <p>Having made Inspection into some Parts of our <hi>Distinction,</hi> we will assume the overture of the <hi>Sequel,</hi> to which alone the Induction holdeth Reference; since whatsoever is <hi>Exacted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Form of Right, and beyond the Prescription of Right,</hi> must also be extended <hi>to the Prejudice of our Existence.</hi> To intimate the Nature proper to our Subject, the burden must be heavy, under whose support a man is forc't to stagger. Nor is the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den judged by the weight. but by their Faculty on whom It is imposed, which yet more clearly to discover, it will be requisite here farther to imply how far the Bounds of such a <hi>Difficulty in Existence,</hi> as is figured may really extend. In order to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,



<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100123:89"/>
we may infer a double <hi>Faculty</hi> inherent to <hi>Existence,</hi> the <hi>Natural</hi> and the <hi>Civil;</hi> and though there may appear too vast a Latitude between their Exigents, to cast them <hi>Both</hi> into one common consequence: yet since they have so inseparable a Dependence on each other, that the continued Breaches in the one, are but infallible Progressions to the Ruine of the other. We may admit them to an equal Perpensation in their several Distinctions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Natural</hi> Existence falls under a prescription of Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only, not to impair, but to secure. And though the <hi>Civil</hi> Power seem frequently to cast restraint upon her Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in reference to the Incapacity of our <hi>primitive</hi> support, (whereon <hi>her</hi> Fabrick is erected) without reflection on the <hi>Latter,</hi> plac't in the Constitution of <hi>Her</hi> Frame. Yet the Concession is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues at so wilde a Distance, that the relief may rather figure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies applied to a dying man, then timely Comforts to secure the living, desisting rather to exact from whence naught can be levied, then at a farther Distance to forbear in Apprehension of a future Exigence. To form the Institution more considerably adjutive to our frail Composure, such Exigents fall under the Tuition of the <hi>Civil Ministry,</hi> as passive Breaches in <hi>her</hi> proper structure, who should fore-run the Incidents in a timely Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in an useful Imployment, or in a considerable sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, agreeing to their proper and distinct capacities. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>civil</hi> Institution being to improve our Natural Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to abandon us in such Extreams, might thrust us on a Savage Procedure, but to sustain our Frailty, when Natures Store becomes sequestred from our use by <hi>Her</hi> Prescription; so that the urgency of our Being must now of Necessity, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Civil</hi> Distinction, which may properly be limited in <hi>Order, Decency,</hi> and <hi>Sufficience:</hi> Under the Prescription of the <hi>First,</hi> to avoid Confusion; under the <hi>Second,</hi> Reproach; under the <hi>Third,</hi> Indigence: And though the two <hi>Former</hi> Dimensions appear of little Moment in Competition with the <hi>Latter,</hi> yet duly examin'd from their Dependents only are deriv'd the very Essence of a <hi>Civil Constitution,</hi> which is not plac't in those osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Investures, that seem to claim the Homages of Honour from a vulgar Sense: But what may free us from the insulting scorn of others, and our own dejecting Inconveniences; Improprieties are truly inconsistent with the Nature of a <hi>Civil</hi> Association, which requireth a due concinety of Parts to the Establishment of an exact <hi>Community:</hi> So that the <hi>Civil</hi> Indulgence will be of little Efficacy to the Security of our common <hi>Properties,</hi> if to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally abandoned to the unequal Advantages of one another, when <hi>necessity</hi> shall urge submission: The highest <hi>Tyrant</hi> in a <hi>Civil</hi> Transaction, which the <hi>Civil Iurisdiction</hi> weigheth not,

                  <hi>Publick</hi> Exigents may sometime possibly require high Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for our common safety, beyond the visible Prescription of the <hi>Civil</hi> Institution, either in <hi>Measure, Matter,</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of their Levies, which closing in a more advantagious Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then any <hi>Civil</hi> Commerce can pretend to.

               <p>To the Restraint of such attempts may possibly be inferr'd, The Ordinance of the <hi>Civil</hi> Jurisdiction in Reference to such a Procedure, under Distinction of <hi>Extortion;</hi> in which the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Institution might probably attain an useful Remedy, were the <hi>Procedure</hi> more clear, the <hi>Penalty</hi> and the <hi>Reparation</hi> more considerable.

               <p>
                  <hi>Commerciants</hi> pass usually all Rules of Circumscription in this Licentiousness, meeting no Arbitration but the Will: Nor is the manner subject to a scruple, where all Advantages are held allowable, as a plausible Faculty to the improvement of their Interest.

               <p>Having thus Briefly searcht into the general Nature of our <hi>Subject,</hi> order requires, that we should next reflect particularly

on the extent <hi>Thereof,</hi> in Reference to our several <hi>Properties,</hi> whose <hi>Security</hi> may likewise meet a useful Regulation under the same Advertisements, either as an <hi>Incident to Publick Order,</hi> or our <hi>own mutual Occurrents with one another.</hi> But since the <hi>Civil</hi> Ministry hath an Interest in the distinct Advantages of all her Parts; we may proceed to visit their Support, under the mannage of their proper Owners.</p>
               <p>In which persuit, though It may seem an Impropriety in <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> use, to take more care of us then we do of our selves: Yet in Respect the common good consisteth in the welfare of each Part, and that a Private Family is constituted of sundry Parts, not soly, nor yet alwayes, (in reference to each other) inherent only to the present owner. We may here farther weigh the use of such an Institution, not only <hi>exclusively,</hi> in Reference to the <hi>Subordinates,</hi> but <hi>Inclusively,</hi> in reference to our selves. Stating the Question under the Authority of Divine Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as an Indulgence to <hi>Nature,</hi> which Avarice might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise o'rethrow, insisting to exact beyond <hi>her</hi> Faculty. <hi>The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day thou shalt do no labour, nor thy Sons, nor thy Daughters, nor thy Man—Servant, nor thy Maid-Servant, nor thy Oxe, nor thy Ass,</hi> &amp;c. Which Injunction had not only Reference to a vacancy for Holy Duties, as visibly appeareth in the Nature of the <hi>Coherents</hi> improper and Incapable of such Intention; but was establish't to a <hi>Civil</hi> use, as more authentickly is prov'd in the exposition of the Institutor. <hi>Man was not made for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but the Sabbath was made for Man.</hi> Nor did the Institution extend only to the rational and sensible Adherents, but likewise to the irrational and sensless. The <hi>Earth</hi> had her Sabbaths, and times of Rest. Nor yet in Reason can it be conjectur'd, that such Restraint on <hi>Civil</hi> Rights, should only have a Reference unto time. Many Occurrents happen in a <hi>Civil</hi> Transaction, to which we may allow an equal Priviledge, either in regard of the Indisposition of the Agent, the Impropriety of the Season, the Inaptitude of Materials, or the like: so that It may evidently appear, as necessary to the Establishment of our <hi>Common</hi> Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that every part of the <hi>Civil</hi> Body should, in their several Constitutions, hold the same <hi>Analogy</hi> with the <hi>whole,</hi> as the <hi>whole</hi> should with <hi>Her Parts.</hi> The Regulation of the <hi>Civil</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry will otherwise prove but of little Moment to our <hi>common</hi> Security, if <hi>her</hi> Influence be retracted or obstructed from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Distribution to the smallest and remotest Vessels of <hi>her Frame.</hi> No man in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules hath o're himself so absolute a Power, as to dispose of his own person to the <hi>Publick</hi> Prejudice. A man may under the distinction of our Law prove <hi>Felone de Soy,</hi> as well as <hi>d'antry.</hi> And to a like capacity pass in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of an equal Penalty, much more may prove a <hi>Trespassor</hi> in

the infringement of his proper Interest, where those of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence collaterally are concern'd. The consequence may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly meet an opposition, in that none, under the distinction of a <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity, can be conjectur'd of so little sence, intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to prejudice, what visibly can only minister unto their support.</p>
               <p>To which may be return'd, had every man the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son free, as well in Act, as in Distinction, <hi>Civil</hi> Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were of little weight. But sundry passions so eclipse that Light, that we distinguish least in what concerns our selves, declining to insert the Allurements of the sense, as a Distemper subject to intermission and relax, but proper to the change and season of our Age. Other accidents, whose momentary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, nevertheless, doth often make such Breaches in our <hi>Civil</hi> Constitution, that time nor industry can scarce repair: What may we then impute to the effects of those continual Feavors of the minde, <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Ambition;</hi> whose Objects finde not a Prescription, but are increast and multiplyed in Fruition: In which our Faculties not suffering Lascitude, because unsatisfied, move by continuance more impetuously to the subversion of all Rights, <hi>Civil, Natural,</hi> or <hi>Divine:</hi> and though they seem to take on a Pretence to the Improvement of our <hi>Civil</hi> Interests; yet the Progressions are too violent and irregular to meet a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py issue, which frequently (on the necessity of Accidents) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us to attempt beyond our Faculty unto our proper Ruine: So that the Circumspection of the <hi>Civil</hi> Power in our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, may prove as necessary to our proper safeguard, as the security of theirs depends on us. Nor can we properly pretend to a support from Institution of the <hi>Civil Ministry,</hi> on the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of our purposes, if her Authority extend not to preside the regulation: Which Procedure may possibly seem to tye up our Actions in too strict a rule, usefully to agitate thereinto our Advantages or others. To take away the Ground to such a scruple, we may imply, the Intention of such Institution we propound, is only form'd to regulate Extreams, and keep the Current of the <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty from such extravagant Deborde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, might leave their Channel dry.</p>

And though the event may be concluded to have been a Judgement sent from Heav'n; yet are the causes thereby no less manifest. His Providence that had so long restrain'd the effect, could have made void the Issue, under the like Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and probably from like materials, though of a Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Quality, may be derived those Eruptions from the Entrails of the Earth, which undermine the Continent to the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those <hi>Structures</hi> are thereon erected. The Causes of such Accidents not falling in Capacity of a <hi>Civil</hi> Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more then in Removal of the Scituations, or Restraint of Licenciousness, we will not here insist upon.

               <p>The most usual Causes and more proper to a <hi>Civil</hi> Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are those coincident to our General Affairs, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Voluntary</hi> or <hi>Casual.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Voluntary</hi> are either <hi>Hostile</hi> or <hi>Criminel.</hi> The <hi>Hostile</hi> may also meet a double Distinction, being either <hi>Foreign</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine.</hi> The <hi>Foreign</hi> have more properly a Reference to the Exterior Object of our <hi>Ministry.</hi> And under the Intention of such Order, may meet a happier Discussion.

Yet nevertheless, though the Litigious Multitude break forth the Limits of a <hi>Civil</hi> Power; yet are they no less subject to her Ordinance, which take Restraint from Execution, when Reduc'd; in reference only to the publique Detrement, which might ensue a Legal Prosecution, not from the due Demerrit of the Offenders; concluding, where the Criminels are more numerous, then the Innocents; It far more safe is to Remit then Prosecute.

               <p>The Prevention consisteth chiefly in <hi>Position of the Fabrick.</hi> The <hi>Materials of the structure.</hi> The <hi>Separation of Coincidents.</hi> Or <hi>vigilance of the Familists.</hi>

               <p>What this Order should require in the Composure and Transaction of each Part to form a <hi>Civil</hi> Harmony, may clearly be collected from the Distinction of the use, to which they are design'd.

               <p>As to the Fashion of the <hi>Garment,</hi> most Commonwealths have in all Ages held their several Distinctions proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the order of their Ministry in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had their <hi>Plaebean</hi> and their <hi>Noble</hi> Vesture: which Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was elsewhere essentially in use, till Wealth had justled Vertue out of Action. Now generally regarded but as a trivial Formality: under which License probably the <hi>Vulgar</hi> have with us assum'd their Insolence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their</hi> Difference in <hi>Materials</hi> is not in usage of so great a Moment, especially in such Climates, where they take their primitive extraction: yet hath the <hi>Garniture</hi> met often such Extravagance (ev'n where assected Vanity had won Her highest Priviledge) that the <hi>Civil</hi> Power, (not only in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Dammage of Particulars, but in security to the Publick Interest) hath oftentimes been forced to restrain the Prodigality, in a general Inhibition of the use of <hi>Cut-Works, Embroydery,</hi> and <hi>Clinkant</hi> under Imposition of a Penal Law.</p>
               <p>The Ornaments of our <hi>Habitation</hi> may in their Structure justly claim a higher Priviledge in Expence, in that they are with <hi>Ours</hi> directed to a <hi>Publick</hi> use, contributing effectually unto the Lustre and Dignity of the Place or City, and bear the last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marks of Honour to a Private Family: yet with such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that the Fabrick not extend either the use or Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Founder.

                  <hi>Special Entertainments</hi> have a prodigious Latitude in expence, not seldom prejudicial to a <hi>Common</hi> Interest, and usually are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, either as the <hi>Rites of Ceremony, The Pledges of Amity, The Proofs of Hospitality,</hi> or else <hi>The Masks of Furbery.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> Transaction is exacted, as a National Association in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, to Gratulate, or to Consolate, to Mourn, or to Rejoyce together; as in Funeral or Nuptial Solemnities: which, rarely falling in a <hi>Civil</hi> Practise, may be allowed greater Liberty. The <hi>Second</hi> improperly o'reshadowed with such ostentive Proofs, may justly be excluded such a Procedure, whose nature rather is expressed in the mutual Freedom of a voluntary Congression, then of a sumptuous and singular Invitation. The <hi>Third</hi> worn out of use, had yet their Improprieties, Inconvenients, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, not only to the Practiser, but to the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame; in that the order of Munificence did never reach the object of so specious a pretence. The true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Hospitality</hi> consisting in the Relief of the Indigent, not in the Indulgence of the Slothful: Or in Recourse of Jollity, forming rather a Harbour to Necessity, then a Receipt to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, or a Shelter to Neglect. The Lustre of so high an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi> must bear a more distinct Appropriation to the use, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the very appearance of any other Collateral Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whatever. The source must not only be free from Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Materials from Indecency. Not the Refuse of Riot, but the choice of Fertility: Nor can the Dispensation meet Excess, where all may be requir'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latter Object</hi> of Entertainment is most frequently but the secret Train to the Advancement of a private Interest. A Courtly kinde of <hi>Commerce,</hi> where the engaged Guest becomes designed to defray the expences of the Feast. But singularity and experience have made so nigh discoveries on the Ambush, that usually the Adventure must be ensured in a plainer Style, delivered in more visible and currant Characters; so that in such enlargements, the casualty of success may possibly in time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the urgency of the Publick Regulation to a Private Caution.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Domestick Equipage</hi> may be implyed either in Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Quality of <hi>Servants,</hi> or in Appendents to our <hi>Service,</hi> whether for Use or Pleasure.

                  <hi>XLVIII.</hi> Oeconomical Order.</head>
               <p>TO preside the <hi>Domestique</hi> Mannage is a Priviledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to the Practice of a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Relation; though Custom hath, with us ('mongst those are most materially therein concern'd) lent <hi>It</hi> too mean an Estimate to own the <hi>Ministry,</hi> casting the Trust thereof on Fraudulent, Negligent, and Licencious Servants, to no small Prejudice in a Private Oeconomy. On what ground the usage took Original, is not so easie to discover, whether <hi>Delicacy, State</hi> or <hi>Indulgency</hi> to <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi> the two <hi>Former</hi> Pretences can hardly find Admission, since <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Eminence</hi> afford us in our Neighbouring Nations, most authentique Patterns. Nor are the most extravagant in Feminine Affeteries much less assiduous in their Circumspecion, though thereto but enduced by irregular Motives, as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Dispensitory to their Vanity and Riot. The Consequence of either Practice may visibly be disclosed in the unequal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that welfare, is inherent to those Families with whom this Order finds a due Reception, compared unto <hi>Theirs</hi> have quite abandon'd It.</p>
               <p>How the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Charge should be distinguished, or to what Objects visibly design'd, we will endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>undertaking</hi> falls (without question) under the Distinction of a <hi>Trust,</hi> though the Trustee seem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually interessed in the mannaging. But usually the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is assumed only under colour of Purloining for supply to some sinister Purposes, unequal Inclinations, Secret, frivulous or superfluous expences, which Practice is fomented under shelter of an <hi>Interest,</hi> or under shelter of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Interest,</hi> rightly understood, is but a <hi>Potential</hi> or collatereal Adherence, under the Distinction of <hi>our</hi> Rules. The <hi>Civil</hi> Law admits the same <hi>Relation</hi> to an equal Partage in the <hi>Acquisition</hi> with the <hi>Principle,</hi> in what Nature soever transacted; which Priviledge may possibly be the Cause, why the Institution meets a happy Issue, under so favourable a Prescription; though the engagement hath a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Object, where the Act is free from any such Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
               <p>The Law extendeth not her Influence to the Miscarriage of



<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100123:97"/>
                  <hi>This Trust,</hi> in Respect the Consequence is involved in a joynt Commission, under <hi>One</hi> present <hi>Interest;</hi> though possibly the <hi>Trustee</hi> may totally in Future be secluded from the Benefit. Or in that, the Authority not passeth under a necessary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but under a voluntary plausible and endearing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Object</hi> of the Exercise, plac'd under <hi>Circumscription</hi> of the Family, seems totally inherent to <hi>That</hi> use, whither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in a <hi>timely Provision</hi> or a <hi>prudent Dispensation. Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> derives her Affluence from too many and too remote sources to exact <hi>Her</hi> vigilance, whose Action only is so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seated onely in the Center of Receipt. The <hi>First</hi> Inference of <hi>Devoyr</hi> may seem to approach the Nature of the <hi>Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In that, to make <hi>Provision,</hi> is properly but to <hi>acquire</hi> for store, but the Intention confined to the use, can really not extend to so general a Distinction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objects</hi> thus designed to their distinct Ballances, we have to <hi>Either</hi> here annexed a Dependent might lend them equal Counterpoise; in that they held a mutual Reference to One Another. The <hi>Provision</hi> must be <hi>Timely</hi> to attain the use to which it was directed; when Plenty crowns the Season with Success, and sets a lower Rate on the Materials, while yet occasion presseth not. Not when Necessity shall urge sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply on any Terms. Prevoyance often reaps the fruit of others Industry. Nor can their force united be but requisite. In that, the Latitude of a <hi>Civil</hi> existence falls totally not under sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a <hi>Private Frame. Civility</hi> and <hi>Hospitality</hi> will challenge a supply in Rights of <hi>Decency;</hi> so that where <hi>Either</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, the Consequence must of Necessity, be prejudicial to a <hi>Civil</hi> Fadulty. The Counter-Ballance must to <hi>This</hi> be fram'd equivalent, to lend Them an agreeing Motion. The <hi>Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> must <hi>prudential</hi> be to form a timely Providence materially successful. <hi>Excess</hi> meets no Prescription where <hi>Riot</hi> tends to <hi>Dissipation;</hi> nor <hi>Penury</hi> attains the Honour of <hi>Frugality;</hi> where <hi>gripple</hi> hands becomes the Mannagers. <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> crown Nature with Delight, while <hi>Lux</hi> but hastens to extinguish <hi>It.</hi> The scatter'd fragments had their due Reserve in his Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lent them Affluence by a Miracle.</p>
               <p>But how the <hi>Civil</hi> Power should lend an Influence to this Circumspection, where Love and Duty are not prevalent, is yet a Mistery. <hi>Honour</hi> may attract, and <hi>Infamy</hi> deterr, in Minds that are thereof susceptable; but where the Inclination hath attain'd that Sense; <hi>Both</hi> needless are to guide the Will to what is Regular. Or if <hi>They</hi> might, the Rule is yet too singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be extended to a General usage, when Vice finds no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint in Punishment.

The <hi>Civil</hi> Power seems yet more nighly Interessed in the Consequence, to lend the Partiality and Endearment of a Parent soly such a Priviledge, the weight hereof they visibly expressed in their Caution, when as the insulting Foe, would have exacted an engagement of their <hi>Youth</hi> for Hostages. Nor was the progress of their Industry visited, directed or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by a Private Institution.
