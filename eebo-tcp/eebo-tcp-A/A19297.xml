         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in our best beloued <hi>Christ
Iesus:</hi> Vouchsafe, I pray you, the
reuiew of these Meditations: which
as they were conceiued, especially
for your sakes, so they are of all other most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for the well ordering, and comfort of
those Callings, wherein God hath placed you.
For seeing man consists of a reasonable soule
and body, both which must be so prouided for
<pb facs="tcp:28450:3"/>
in their order and measure; as may tend to the
well being of either in this life, and to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happines of both in the life, to come. What
so necessarie, as that one thing which indeed is
onely necessarie, euen by the iudgement of him
that must saue or condemne the same, namely,
the welfare &amp; safetie of the precions soule? And
yet seeing that God hath placed vs on the earth
and that wisely, in seuerall Callings<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
that so by our holy managing thereof, we
may lay vp a good foundation against the life
to come.</p>
            <p>How necessarie is that knowledge, which
may enforme vs rightly herein? most vsefull,
and so acceptable that skill must needes bee,
whereby we shall be so enabled to commerce
with worldly things, as not thereby to hazard
our eternall happinesse. Yea, so much the more
is the direction necessary; because, as it is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
concealed from Nature, which knows not
the things of God, neither indeede can know
them, because they are spiritually discerned,
when as its chiefest wisedome is enemy against
God and it owne happinesse: as appeareth by
the ordinary ship-wrake of the most, through
the ignorance thereof: So it is the speciall gift
of God to reueale the same vnto vs, as without
which, it is not possible to secure our future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
in passing through such manifolde and
slipperie occasions of our present Callings.
And surely if wee consider that Axiome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb facs="tcp:28450:3"/>
truth; that we cannot serue God &amp; Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and compare therewith that damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conclusion of the world, as subscribing to
the trueth of God out of the conscience, of it
owne vtter inabilitie, and sottish dotage on it
owne shadowes: that conscionable Seruice of
God, is an hinderance to worldly thrift; impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to get riches, and keepe a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as implying a contradiction in those
things, which by right vse are subordinate to
each other. Is it not then, more then necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to know such a way, whereby wee may so
thriue in the world, as that withall wee may
thriue to heauen, that we may find out and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
an holy subiection to the worde of God,
and so discerne that to be possible with God,
which is impossible to men. Oh, how true is it
which our blessed Sauiour speakes in this case,
that it is impossible for a rich man to enter into
heauen; meaning, such a rich man, as wanting
this heauenly wisdome, to vse the world aright;
sets his confidence in riches, and rests on such
slipperie foundations, forsaking the God of his
strength, and rock of his saluation. And it is also
most true for our eternall comfort: that though
these things are snares to the wicked, to enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gle
and drowne them in euerlasting perdition: yet
we may take such a curse in the gayning and
vse of these dangerous Wares, that if we first
seeke the Kingdome of heauen, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
thereof, these shall be cast vpon vs
<pb facs="tcp:28450:4"/>
without any great care or labour, if we make
purchase of the great gaine, which is Godlines,
we shall finde it profitable as well for this life,
both to order our worldly affaires, and also to
prosper them vnto vs; as for the life which is to
come. And therefore as it is a brand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse,
to renounce our birth-right in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for a Messe of pottage, or any earthly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
whatsoeuer: as if these could not well
sort together; so on the other side, it is a marke
of vnbeliefe to distrust God for the well being
of our bodies, seeing we haue trusted him for
the happinesse of our soules. Here then is wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to bring both ends together; so to learne
worldly thrift, as that withall we may thriue to
heauen. This wisedome is best attained by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
&amp; Experience, which is the Mistresse
of Fooles, is then most comfortably gained,
when we can be warned by others harmes.</p>
            <p>This is my purpose in the ensuing Treatise.
Wherein I endeauour to set before the eies of
your minds, as in a cleare and true Mirrour, the
fearefull estate of <hi>Worldlings;</hi> aduenturing, and
working out their owne damnation, by their
vnsatiable and deceitfull hunting after worldly
profit. Here you may take notice of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bargaine, betweene the god of this world,
&amp; earthly minds; as willingly exchanging their
eternal soules, for the enioying of the pleasures
and profits of sinne for a season. Here you may
see, that our destruction is of our selues, in that
<pb facs="tcp:28450:4"/>
our corrupt, and greedy desires do entice Satan
to chaffer with vs, and to preuaile for this Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Here you haue the policies of Satan
liuely discouered, whereby he drawes vs on to
the Bargaine, and holdeth vs to the same; that
so we may preuent his subtill snares and delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Lastly, you haue here the censure of the
Bargaine, euen by our Lord Iesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
who onely can truely iudge of it, and shall
most righteously iudge for the same; that you
may wisely looke before hand into the yssue
thereof, and so fore-warned not to enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such couenant. This is the summe of these
Meditations, which I doe most zealously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vnto your best considerations, as those
that by your Callings may make good vse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Which that you may vnfeignedly doe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
promise what here you haue not; That my
requests shall be dayly manifest, at the Throane
of Grace for your Worshipfull Societie: Yea,
whatsoeuer I am, or may be, shall be deuoted
to the good of your Companie: that the Lord
would mercifully make vp the Breach among
you; or sanctifie it more graciously, to your
more sure vniting to his Maiestie: that hauing
experience of the ficklenesse, and contentious
spirits of men; you may be carefull to builde
your foundation vpon the Rocke, which may
endure all counter-blasts. Labouring your
peace with God, by the attonement of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sonne, blessed for euer: That so seeking
<pb facs="tcp:28450:5"/>
first, the kingdome of heauen, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
thereof, these outward things may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and be sanctified vnto you; that so you
may continue without offence, as you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
&amp; proceeded hitherto, in all fruitfull boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and mercifulnesse to the Houshold of faith:
to the happy fealing vp of your saluation in this
life, and to the hastening and accomplishing of
the same in the life to come. And thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

this liuely Touch-stone to try your Estates, by

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:28450:6"/>
confound carnall wisdome, and exercise the

of his suffering gaue occasion of offence to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
as dreaming in his carnall reach, of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

from the particular doctrine of his owne suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
to gather a generall conclusion: That
whosoeuer will be his disciple, must also deny

him; which bitter pill that it might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

the loue of life, and that by a strange paradox
to the confounding of reason, &amp; triall of faith:
affirming that the sauing of life for a time,
by auoyding the Crosse, was the next way to
lose it eternally: and so to encourage the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the vndergoing of afflictions, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
contrarily, that the enduring of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for his sake, though it were to the losse of
life temporall, was the meanes to procure the
life eternall, if not also for the preseruation of
this present life. Now because life were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
of the carnall man, but for those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and profits sake which the world supplies
thereto; for otherwise these fayling, life is but
a burden, and death a most desired hauen:
therefore the spirit of God proceedeth in this
verse to root out of our hearts this loue of the
world; and that by propounding the danger
that accompanies the same; namely, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

discouered that Roote of al mischiefe; namely,
a couetous and vnreasonable desire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
all, to be satisfied with nothing, but the
whole world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we haue heere the driuing of the
Bargaine; namely, this couetous desire is that
which giues way to Satan, to fetch ouer the
soule.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, heere is the Bargaine it selfe; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the soule is lost for the gaining of the

And first, of the ground or occasion of the
bargaine. This the holy Ghost discouers to be
an vnsatiable desire of earthly things, teaching
vs thereby, that naturally the minde of man, as
it is immortall and not to be fadomed; so it is
restles and neuer satisfied.</p>
            <p>And therefore affecteth vnmeasurably the
things of the world:<note place="margin">1 Obseruation in vnsatiable earthly desires.</note> gladly would engrosse and
appropriate all things to it selfe. It cannot
brooke a share in it happines, it endures not to

the minde.<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 8.</note> So is the practise hereof discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
They ioyne houses to houses, and land to

with the place and calling wherein God

his name in building of Cities, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
the world. Who would not enioy the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:28450:7"/>
most of all those things, that he may haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
happines? Can there be a greater plague to
the wicked then still to be desiring,<note place="margin">6</note> what they
compasse? And may not this turne about to
turne them home againe, that as the Doue whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
she found no rest for the sole of her foote in
the world, returned againe to the Arke from
whence she was sent forth: so the poore soule
being tyred in the compassing of these earthly
things, and confounded in the pursuit thereof,
may be forced to turne the current of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to the true obiect, and to seeke for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in her God onely.</p>
            <p>Oh that we were wise to discerne the euill
sicknes,<note place="margin">Vse</note> and therein to take notice of the power
of corruption.<note place="margin">To conince natures cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and desperate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</note> Are we sick of the world, and
neuer satisfied therewith? How doth this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
our barrennes of grace, how doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
our bondage vnto sinne? Where grace
hath taken roote, we dye vnto the world; where
God is preferred, there Mammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hath no place.
How doth this discouer an impossibility in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to obtaine grace by it owne power, seeing
the glory and wisdome of nature is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God: exalting the world and it sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
aboue the true substance of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
happines; making the wedge of gold it
hope, and it belly it God? Why do worldings
engrosse and compasse the earth, but that they
haue no hope of heauen? but that their maine
happines is to enioy the pleasures of sin for a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:28450:8"/>
season: and that they may enioy them more
freely, they plot for greatnes, that none may
controule them, they heape vp aboundance of
treasures, that they may haue continuall matter
to nourish and encrease sin. Doth not afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bridle sinne, and withdraw many encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragments
there-from? doth not troubles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
the conscence, and at least breed some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
&amp; outward abstinence from euill? Then
well fare fulnesse to fatte the heart in sin, that
it may be sencelesse thereof, and so commit it
more greedily; wel fare prosperity to drown the
heart with a vaine conceite of Gods fauour, as
if he loued vs, because he bestoweth such a
large portion vpon vs: that so though the
minde be sensible of sinne, yet it may swell
with presumption, &amp; prophanesse; that though
we liue so, yet God approues thereof, we pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and growe in greatnes, therefore all is well.
And doth not this make way at length to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
atheisme, that because we are spared, nay
we prosper, and thriue in sinne, therefore the
Lord is like vnto vs,<note place="margin">Psa. 50. 19.</note> he likes of our sinne? And
so the conclusion heereupon followeth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,<note place="margin">Psa. 41. 1.</note>
that the foole saith in his heart, as hee
hath proued it by his waies;<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15. 16.</note> that there is no
God at all, but to prosper in the world, to doe
what we list: nay hence it followes in the end,
that seeing we doe what we list, therefore wee
are gods, knowing good and euill. This was the
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d of that grosse idolatry in deifying others
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:28450:8"/>
and this not vnwillingly induced great ones
to assume this diuine power vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,<note place="margin">Ground of i<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dolatry.</note>
by there transcendent power and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
not onely to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>troule their owne lawes,
but euen to encroach vpon and iustle out the
law of God, and so to seate themselues in the
place of the most Highest.<note place="margin">Meanes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists rising.</note> Thus Antichrist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
by degrees from earthly happines, to a
concept of diuine power, exalting himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all that is called God, because hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a surfet of worldly pompe and fulnesse, hee
thereby established a visible monarchie, not
only aboue Emperours &amp; the potentates of the
world, but euen aboue heauen, and ouer hell it
selfe, encroaching into the prerogatiue of the
most Highest: and making and changing
the eternall decrees at his pleasure, presuming
with his fained, and vsurped keyes, to shut and
open heauen and hell at his will, and by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuable
miracles and presumed perfection
exalting himselfe in the hearts of all beleeuers
aboue all that was called God. And the maine

vpon the Whore, whom as he had appointed
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> all eternity to euerlasting perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, so to this

of the earth, by whom being cherrished and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
to bee Queene and Empresse of the

and said she sate as a Queene, and should see no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:28450:9"/>

&amp; therby committed the same more greedily;
and so being deceiued by sinne, grewe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
others, that shee might the better excuse
her selfe, and make prey of the blinded world:
whereby as shee executed the wrath of God
vpon the vtter Court, and reprobates of the
visible Church; so by her oppression and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wickednesse, by her vnsatiable ambition,
and couetousnesse, by her diuellish treacheries
and bloody cruelties, she is now growne hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to those that were her owne, being enuied
for her greatnesse, hated for her wickednesse,
and detested for her treacheries; so that her
owne greatnesse hath begun and will certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accomplish her iust ouerthrow, and fatall
destruction: her owne Louers that formerly
aduanced her, being bewitched with the Cup
of her fornications, as they haue hitherto, so
still they shall leaue her, for her odious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
yea, they shall not cease to spoile, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
roote her out, that so her destruction may
be their safetie; and the Lord may be glorified
in his righteous iudgements. Euen so, O Lord,
hasten thy worke, for the comfort of thy
Church, and glorie of thy great Name. And
let this in the meane time admonish the wise,
that they be not partakers with her of her sines,
lest they partake with her of her plagues. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all: let it aduise vs, especially to take heed
of these two capitall sinnes, of pride, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:28450:9"/>
the one being the meanes to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the other, and yet couetousnesse being the
meanes to confound pride, in that it cannot be
satisfied,<note place="margin">Ierem. 45. 6.</note> cannot attaine it desire. Let <hi>Ieremies</hi>
counsell to <hi>Baruch,</hi> be seasonable in these daies;
Seeke not after great things. If our hearts bee
right, we haue an higher ayme; and if they bee
not, wee cannot wish a greater plague, still to
be desiring what we cannot haue; and when we
haue the most, making our burthen the greater,
and our account more heauy, at that great day.
Let this teach vs to labour contentednesse in
our estates, by acknowledging our vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the best, and the sufficiency of the least,
with the blessing of God, by dayly resigning
our selues into the hands of our God:</p>
            <p>And imploying our talents faithfully to his
glory, not considering so much what wee are
short in of others, aboue vs; but how many
there are, that are short of our measure: labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to supply what is wanting in out-ward
things, by storing vp inward graces, which the
more we heape vp, the lesse we shall desire and
esteeme the others; and the more we haue, the
more we shall receiue: considering still of the
shortnes of our liues, and suddainnesse of our
account, that so still we may be rather carefull
how to vse well, and so to account comfortably
for what we haue, because we know not how
soone we may leaue it: then to be desiring and
caring for to morrow, because we know not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:28450:10"/>
what to morrow may bring. Labour we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to rectifie our iudgements,<note place="margin">Note.</note> concerning
our ambirious desires, as if these did argue an
ingenuous and free spirit: seeing, as there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a greater marke of a degenerate minde,
then to doate, and hunt greedily after earthly
riches; because where our treasure is, there also
are our hearts: what we doate vpon, that wee
make our God. So hereby shall wee approoue
that we are risen with Christ,<note place="margin">Coloss. 3. 1</note> if our affections
be set vpon things that are aboue, and not on
things below; and the lesse care we haue of
earthly things, the more are our hearts enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the Law of God: the more enliued
with the hope of a better life.</p>
            <p>Thus an vnsatiable desire of earthly things,
possesseth euery man naturally: this conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the obliquity and desperate state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
this as it argueth it subiect to Sathan, who
is the Prince of this world, so by this baite of
the world he easily ensnareth vs to ineuitable
destruction; for so it followeth in the second
place, had not Satan matter to worke vpon
from vs, he could neuer preuaile to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
were we not as Tinder, apt to receiue
the fire; nay, had we not an whorish corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in vs, alluring him to attempt vs, though
he were neuer so instant, yet should he be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.
But behold now, the <hi>Driuing of the
Bargaine;</hi> what is it, that encourageth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth
Sathan to preuaile for our destruction?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:28450:10"/>
there is a traytour within the citie, to open the

            <p>Where these are,<note place="margin">Obseruation. An vnsatiable minde, lies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Satans snares.</note> he easily fetcheth ouer the

earthly things, is an easie and sure prey to
Sathans malice. The desire of riches is the
roote of all euill, exposing to tentation and
snare of Sathan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And no maruaile.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Because as this argues <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> of vnbeliefe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which hath renounced confidence in God,<note place="margin">Psa. 52.</note> and
so being iustly forsaken of God, is thereby left
to the malice of Satan.<note place="margin">Matt. 19.</note> So these endlesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
exclude and chase all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> good motions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the Spirit; yea, all law of common equitie, and
so the rather expose to Satans allurements:
yea, where such desire hath taken hold, it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
greedily to any desperate wickednesse, for
the accomplishment thereof, whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
becomes obdurate and senslesse, not
onely of euill, but also the danger thereof: and
so is the rather suppressed by the enemie; yea,
which is the worst of all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> this thirst of earthly
things puffeth vp, and bewitcheth the minde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
with a false conceit of happinesse, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie.
As if this were the onely happinesse to
engrosse and compasse all, that we may liue a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lone
vpon the earth; that none may share with
vs; none may controule vs: and so thereby
layeth it most desperately open to Satans mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:28450:11"/>
as making the delusion effectuall, and so
smiting the hand, for the confirmation of the
bargaine. If happinesse consist in enioying the
world, then what need we feare to venture the
soule;<note place="margin">Genes. 3 4.</note> vnlesse we enuie our owne happinesse?
Thus did Satan fetcht ouer our first Parents,
abusing first their iudgements with a conceit of
happinesse, in which (indeed) was their baine:
suggesting, that if they did eate of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
tree, they should be so farre from death, as
that they should bee as gods; knowing good
and euill: and so by this slight easily brought
them to his lure. Lastly, if we consider what
followes thereupon: Namely, that though
<hi>Worldlings</hi> conceit of happinesse in these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, yet they are confounded in their
hopes, and fall short of their compasse; though
they desire all, yet many times they attaine not
any such measure, as may satisfie their desires.
How can this choose but breed despaire, and
fearefull confusion? And is not this now Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
time to make prey of the soule?<note place="margin">Iob 2. 11.</note> Now
curse God and die, because we cannot haue
our will. I cannot be worse (saith the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
soule) and therefore the foole rageth and
is carelesse; nay, Satan is not so ready to make
prey of the soule, as he is to hasten the worke:
<hi>Achitophel</hi> now hath no helpe,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.</note> but to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
I cannot endure this disgrace, my credite
is gone, and therefore I am weary of my life;
and heere-upon I will be couragious, to let it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:28450:11"/>
out my selfe. Behold the issue of worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
they first puffe vp with pride, and then
sinke in despaire, and so expose to Sathans but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
            <p>Who so is wise let him vnderstand these
things,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and to whom the Arme of the Lord
shall reueale them, let him cleare and iustifie
the Lord, seeing his condemnation is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>If wretched man doth make the wedge of
gold his hope, and sets light by his soule for the
obtaining of this trash, renouncing the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the life to come, for the enioying of this
present; is he not then the executioner of Gods
righteous iudgement vpon him; doth he not
subscribe to his owne condemnation? The
waies of God are equall and righteous altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but our wicked waies and desires do iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
light vpon our owne pates, and our owne
wisdome is our confusion.</p>
            <p>Take notice therefore in the feare of God, of

be thou wise to discerne the power and growth

Thus maiest thou captiuate thy carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,

            <p>But alas, he will not be shut out so: his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
are too apparent, his delusions too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible:
how many are content for these things

            <p>They liue by Sense, and not by Faith,

1. <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 9.<note place="margin">Reasons. 1.</note> and therefore no maruaile if they
dote vpon the present: and so not long able
to liue by faith in the speciall prouidence of
God, and hope of better things, no maruaile if
they make a contradiction betweene these
things which are indeede onely subordinate,
concluding that they must liue; and therefore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:28450:14"/>
they must deceiue, breake Saboth, what not? As
if conscience to God, and care of this life,
were contradictions; we could not thriue and
liue in the world; and thriue to heauen also<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
whereas indeede if we could trust God, &amp; waite
vpon him,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.</note> we might finde that godlines hath
the promise of this life as well as of that which
is to come. Indeed if we could trust in God, &amp;
waite vpon him,<note place="margin">Psa. 3. 42</note> in well doing, we should veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be saued: we shold want nothing that is good.
As worldlings want faith, so they want pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and therefore seeing they cannot tary the
Lords leasure for the blessing of their labours,
therefore they will take what is at hand, what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soeuer
it cost them:<note place="margin">Esau.</note> what is this birth-right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

I must be receiued when I am put out
of my stewardship, and therefore I see no way
but to deceiue and so to prouide for my selfe.
Thus want of patience breeds resolued wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
and this exposeth the soule as a prey
vnto Satan.</p>
            <p>Adde we hereunto that fearefull condition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
whereunto worldlings are subiect: that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they account their conscience as their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemy, and their credit and estimation as
their chiefe friend, nay as the onely Idoll
whom they worship: therefore seeing their
thriuing in the world is that which may both
maintain their credit, on the one side, and also
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:28450:15"/>
either lull the conscience asleep, or flatter it on
the other side: if prosper in the world, either they
haue no sence of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ger; or els all is well, because
they prosper.<note place="margin">Osea 12. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Ephraim</hi> saith, I am rich &amp; encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

iniquity in me, that were wickednes; either I am
senceles of euill, because my heart is fatted vp
with prosperty, or if I am priuie of my selfe of
any, yet God is at peace with me: I haue more
then my heart can desire. Is it any maruaile if
now hands be strucken, the bargain is made vp;
either I haue no leasure to thinke on my soule,
because the world comes so fast vpon me; or
my soule is safe enough, seeing I haue my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:
or, which is common with <hi>worldlings</hi> to
wish in this case, so I may enioy this happines,
let them take heauen who list,<note place="margin">Psa. 17. 14.</note> I haue my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
already, and therfore I looke for no other.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The iustice of God is admirable herein, who
giuing the wicked now their hearts desire;<note place="margin">Psa. 7 3.</note> nay,
more indeed then they would desire: doth not
this encrease the delusion by lulling them in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,
and flattering them in a vaine conceit,
of present happinesse, that they may willingly
renounce the happinesse of the life to come?
that so they may not repent of their bargaine,
but euen sticke vnto it, and so harden their
necks against all contrary blasts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lastly, the policie of Satan is herein also no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
that though there should be some huc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at the bargaine, by reason of some crosses
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:28450:15"/>
which may befall them in the world; or some
reckonings of conscience within, to confound
the sin: yet herein also are they supplyed with
meanes to make them sticke to their bargaine.
Either they haue beene too scrupulous in their
dealings with men; which may arise from the
light of common equitie and selfe loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they expect like dealing themselues: and
therefore now they must mend the matter, by
letting loose the conscience to greater euils of
oppression, and such like grosse wickednesse;
that so they may quiet the conscience, by
deading the sence: or else, they haue beene
crossed in the world, to see whether they will
be daunted with a little, to try their homage
thereto; or because they haue not been carefull
enough: and therefore now they must redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their cares, and more intend the mayne;
they must now be more industrious to recouer
their losses, more abiect and slauish to make vp
their mouthes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Oh, how common are these
courses with <hi>Worldlings!</hi> How fearefully
heereby doe they enthrall themselues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, that God may bee
iustified, and Satan excusable in comparison
of our selues, that our destruction may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
principally to be contriued by our selues:
May we not obserue in worldly men, as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
desire in these things, excluding all
heauenly obiects, and so drawing on Satan to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:28450:16"/>
chaffer with them, so many such desperate fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
both in the compassing of these things, as
also in the enioying of them, which doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
auouch the making vp of this bargain.</p>
            <p>Consider,<note place="margin">Meanes and Markes of this Bargaine.</note> I pray you with me, their ground,
and meanes in compassing these things; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
now wisely their ende, in labouring for
the same.</p>
            <p>Touching their ground; is it not plaine Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
and deifying of these things, by putting
their confidence in them, as if these were the
God that they onely must adore; as if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
did onely consist in these? <hi>Iob</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>And doth not hence follow another feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ground; that as these are counted <hi>the true
happinesse,</hi> so they are able to make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
happie, that enioy them: and therefore
he that enioyes them most, hath most happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and so as God, may rule and doe what
he list. And what neede he then take care for
any other happines? What need he feare what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
Bug-beares of heauen or hell, that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Giue me the present, take the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
who list.</p>
            <p>Such are the grounds to compasse these
things, and are not the meanes suteable? yea

or Figges of thistles? As these are perswaded,
so they practise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:28450:16"/>
No God in comparison of these, &amp; therfore
no god to the compassings of them. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is too nice a rule to guide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> herein. The
Word too precise, and enuious against their
happines. And yet that they may haue some
colour to deceiue, and be deceiued, heere the
Law of man, nay the abuse rather of the Law,
and custome of the time, comes in to be their
warrant. Thus it hath passed, and therefore it
is currant. Nay, is not the present Euent vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a warrant herein? it hath sorted well; and
therefore it is well: what should I say? A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
heart hath seduced them, and a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
world hath bewitched them; they must not
be like No body, they shall lose their custome,
if they will not buy and sell on the Sabboth;
they shall be deceiued, if they studie not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:
Conscience goes a begging, and craft
is the way to thriue; if man see not, God will
forgiue: and that man may not see, we will haue
darke lights, and false waights; the Epha shall
be made great, and the shekle small; we will be
at a word when we deale with Professors, that
we may deceiue the sooner.</p>
            <p>And we will haue three wordes to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
rating our Wares at treble the value;
that we may fetch off the Ideot, if not at the
first, yet at the second or third rebound. Is not
euery Trade a Mysterie forsooth? and is not
this Mysterie abused commonly to deceiue,
and be deceiued? My skill faileth me to diue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:28450:17"/>
this Mysterie; onely I desire, that into their
secrets my soule may not enter; my glorie may
not be ioyned with their assemblies. Let this
suffice, happy man that so toucheth Pitch, as
not to be defiled with it; that so seeketh these
things, as that he hazardeth not his precious
soule. Too manifest it is, that the most take this
libertie, and which is most fearefull, they sinne
euen by licence. The Vsurer hath his warrant,
the deuils Factor (I meane) the Stage-player,
his colour to owne him to his Maister. The best
calling not without it snare to enthrall the
soule. This shall appeare the better, if we now
consider the ende of compassing these things:
which what is it vsually else, but either that we
may liue vncontrouled, that the soule may take
it ease, and eternize it name ouer the earth, that
it may out-face and dare heauen, that it may fat
vp it selfe to the day of slaughter? Where
Church maintenance for our faithfull labour,
must discharge the same, as if it were onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preferment
of learning, and not an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to painefulnesse; where <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
must enter in, and poore <hi>Simon Peter</hi> liue vpon
almes; where <hi>Diotrephes</hi> that loues the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
must engrosse all, and <hi>Gallio</hi> cares not
for these things: whose God is their belly, there
end must needes be damnation; who thus sow
to the flesh, shalll they not of the flesh reape
corruption? Thus the ende of <hi>Worldlings</hi> in
heaping vp riches, discouers their deceit, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:28450:17"/>
so their desperate case.</p>
            <p>And can we looke for a better haruest of such
fearfull seedings? Consider we a little, how they
vse these things: are they not vsually in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames
and so bode extremity? Either the loue
of these so besotte them, that for feare of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with them, they cannot affoord themselues
any comfortable part thereof: it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
them to behold them, that they may haue
the credite and possession thereof, then to take
their part of them cheerefully for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
Who so poore in this case, as they that
are vsually most rich? who lesse enioy that they
haue, then they that haue most? so righteous is
God to make them Purueyers for others,<note place="margin">Iob 27.</note> They
shall hoord vp siluer as the dust, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
shall diuide it: so shall the rust of what
they haue hoorded vp, bee a witnesse against
them, and consume them with fire: so shall the
cry of the poore whom they haue oppressed
in scraping,<note place="margin">Iames 5. 1, 2.</note> and defrauded in detaining from
them, pull downe vengeance vpon their heads
and hasten their owne comfort, in their iust
confusion. Doe they not in distrust of Gods
prouidence, vsually make Idols of these things,
and so are giuen vp to make Idols of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues?
hauing mouthes and yet dare not taste,
hauing bellies, and yet pine themselues? As
they vse their goods as Babies, onely to gaze
and play withall; so they make babies and sots
of themselues, fit onely to be gazed at, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:28450:18"/>
scorned of the world. Loe, this is the man that
boasted of his riches, and put his confidence
in the multitude of his treasures.<note place="margin">Psa. 52. 6.</note> Thus they
which haue oppressed others in gathering
goods, are iustly left to oppresse and defraude
themselues of the lawfull vse of them, feeding
themselues chiefly with the winde of credite,
and vaine estimation, and so they iustly reape
the whirle-winde of Gods righteous venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
And thus are many caried <hi>with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame;</hi>
others that thinke to hit it, by taking
their portion, yet doe they not as fooles fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other extreame, by prodigalitie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse?
Witnesse their fat paunches, and leane
soules; their whorish attire, and barren posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
where a paire of slippers shall deuoure a
whole Lordship; and a cast at dice, cast the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
out of all hee hath; when the Harlot shall
bring another to a morsell of bread, when the
contentious spirite of some, shall make them
foote-stooles to set the Lawyer aloft: and the
idle braine of many shall make my gentleman
a Begger; when the Broker shall fleece him,
and the Vsurer flea my yong Master, for his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
and gaudery: who will not say that
this wealth was disposed for the owners destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
that plenty hath brought forth vanitie,
and the daughter hath deuoured the mother?
Thus by the gathering and abusing of these
earthly things, it is more manifest that World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
engage their soules for them, and so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:28450:18"/>
and honouring Satan, herein doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
themselues to be his, to whom they doe
homage.</p>
            <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that we were wise to try our selues here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
Is it not now a ruled Case among World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
that there is no hell but to be in debt?
that it is madnesse to thinke that there is any
such couenant with Satan? Haue not the
worldly wise condemned the whole doctrine
and practize of Witch-craft, which is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
with Satan, because they would be sure
of their couenants with him? and is not the
ground thereof, that roote of Atheisme, that
they account of no God but <hi>Mammon,</hi> no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
but worldly happinesse? Tell a World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that he is ruled by the god of this World,
that his loue of money argues him to bee his
slaue, and he will boldly reply; That he defies
the diuel, he hopes to blesse himselfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> him as
well as the best.<note place="margin">Psa. 49. 12.</note> And yet his way vtters his folly
and desperate estate; he hath made the wedge
of gold his hope: and therefore his hope and
foundation is built vpon the sandes, his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is worldly, and therefore sensuall, and so
conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly diuellish. Deceiue not therfore thy
selfe in the feare of God; thou mayest be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into an outward couenant with God, &amp; yet
make a secret compact with Satan, for the vn
doing of thy soule. Oh, how many Demi-asses
may bee found among vs, that howsoeuer they
haue giuen their names vnto Christ, yet they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:28450:19"/>
haue giuen their hearts to the diuell; and all by
embracing this present world. Shall we for our
better informing take a view of some of them?
Doth <hi>Cain</hi> build Cities, &amp; seeke to nestle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
surely on the earth, to auoid the storme
of heauen? This plainely doth auouch his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
from God. If <hi>Balaam</hi> for promotion,
will bring God to his wicked bent: doth he not
loue the wages of iniquitie, and expose his
soule to the rage of Sathan? If <hi>Saul</hi> to cloake
his sinne, will be hindered of the people, shall
he not be reiected of God, and hasten his own
confusion? Doth <hi>Iudas</hi> sell his Maister for the
wages of vnrighteousnesse, and doth he not set
his soule to sale to the deuill? As by these, and
the like examples of <hi>Diotrephes, Hymenius, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,
&amp;c,</hi> wee may take some scantling of
our estates, whether wee haue made this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
or no: so yet to make a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
search hereof,<note place="margin">Rules of faith</note> let vs examine our hearts by
these Rules; Do we first seeke the world, and
not the Kingdom of heauen? Will wee make
sure of thriuing first, before wee labour for
knowledge, and the feare of God? And if it
come to the iumpe, that either we must straine
our conscience, or lose our profit; because we
cannot bee contented with a meane, wee
cannot waite vpon the blessing of God in the
way hee hath commanded, wee will venture a
ioynt whatsoeuer come of it. Is the Sabboth
no barre to hinder our vnsatiable desires, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:28450:19"/>
either we wish it were gone, that wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to our vomit, or we cannot stay so long
but euen on the Lords day we will serue our
lusts in buying and selling, in tossing and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
vp and downe, making that day of rest
restlesse, by our worldly thoughts and carnall
pursuites, by our prophane pleasures and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
liberty? Haue we begun in the spirit, and
haue quickly enough thereof? and so we can
easily limite our selues in heauenly things, we
haue knowledge enough; nay, we may be too
zealous, too holy, more precise then wise, too
much learning may make vs madde, or fooles:
to leaue a bird in hand for that in the bush, that
so we may enlarge our desires with hell, and stil
cry with the daughters of the horseleech, Giue,
giue. And haue we no leasure for religion, our
thrift comes in so fast, al time is too little, either
to husband wel that we haue, or to better our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state?
Lastly, for the better iustifying of our selus
in our temporising and hypocrisie: do we now
labour to stint others to our measure, both by
traducing such as are before vs in grace, as
vnreasonable and madde fellowes, that know
no compasse, as by alluring them with our
glorious shewes, to curse where they will
blesse, to call light darknes, and darknes light?
Surely these are more then probable coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that our soules are engaged to the world,
that our heauen is on earth, and our happines
in hell. In a word, where credit is the guide
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:28450:20"/>
and bridle of conscience, and profit the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
and square of religion; where conscience
is the Broker to colour deceite, and religion
the factor and handmaide for profit; where ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
honestie goes currant for substantiall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,
and bodily seruice is a sufficient coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for secret wickednes; where the fruite of
the body must satisfie for the sinne of the soule,
and the mercy of God must be the cloake to
cruelty against our selues and others; will the
Lord be mercifull to presumptuous sinners, can
there be hope of mercy without the bonds
thereof,<note place="margin">Psa. 130. 7.</note> seeing there is mercy onely with him
that he may be feared?</p>
            <p>And is there any feare of God, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse
is iustified, &amp; that by abusing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting
the straight waies of God? and can
these be but abused where credit is made the
head, and conscience the tayle? can the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be free where profit limits religion, and
ciuility is the iudge thereof? and can wee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any Iudge then ciuill honestie? must we
not make the best of what we haue, seeing wee
will haue no better? This serues the turne for
the present, and what neede we any more? And
is not now bodily seruice made an Idoll, and
will worship set in the seate of the scorners? We
despise all others that make conscience of their
waies,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> they are but a base and beggerly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that know not the law; if they cannot liue
by their religion, they haue a bad master. And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:28450:20"/>
therefore welfare worldly wisdome, that hath
two strings to it bow; if God will not helpe, yet
wel fare <hi>Mammon</hi> to helpe at a pinch. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Mammon</hi> serues our present turne,<note place="margin">Iob. 21. 15.</note> what
more profit shall we haue in the seruice of
God? nay, may not our precisenesse hinder our
profit? And therefore religion must be cast off
as an enemy to our owne profit, or else submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the compasse thereof.</p>
            <p>Behold the power of delusion preuailing
with worldlings, and let vs wisely trie our
selues hereby. To conclude this point: seeing
this bargaine is a mysterie rather performed in
deedes then in words, not without it glorious
pretences to ensnare vs more easily, &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with dangerous sophistrie, whereby we
hope to come out thereof: learne we then in
the feare of God,<note place="margin">Pretences to colour the Bargaine, with their delusion and confusion.</note> first what these vizers and
pretences are, and how we may disclaime them.</p>
            <p>The vizers vnder which this fearefull bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
is concealed; are first, that the blessing of
God maketh rich; to thriue and encrease in the
world is the gift of God, and recompence of
our labours, and therefore who would not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for aboundance, seeing the Lord giues
time thereto what neede we feare danger in
that which is a blessing?<note place="margin">That riches are the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, how and to whom</note> Which though it bee
true to those that be sanctified, yet neither any
childe of God must looke for this blessing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it seemeth good to our God to giue
some more, that they may be stewards for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:28450:21"/>
so also to giue some lesse,<note place="margin">All haue them outwardly.</note> that there may
be a maintenance of the holy fellowship, by
this mutuall communication of each others
gifts?<note place="margin">May be a meames to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces.</note> And so this diuersitie of outward gifts,
that the rich may ease the poore of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of want by communicating of their store
vnto them, and the poore may also ease the rich
of their burthen of riches, and further their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
against the day of the Lord by their
thankfulnes and prayers, thus the rich and the
poore meete together; the Lord is the maker of
them both.</p>
            <p>And the Lord may haue the onely glory of
his wise prouidence, though in giuing to each
as pleaseth him, yea in satisfying each in this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
measure here with thankfulnes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
And so either of them may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
to hunger after durable riches, the rich
in that they are but tennants at will, and ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for others, and therefore must giue vp
their account: and the poor also hereby prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to hunger after heauenly treasures, in that
they are wisely stinted &amp; dieted of the present.
And therefore as neither the Saints must
reckon of these blessings, so neither must they
measure the worth of their labours hereby, as if
they did not serue God aright if they were not
recompenced with aboundance; because as our
seruice of God deserueth not the least, so to
serue God for these things, is to serue our
selues aboue him: and so though we haue our
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:28450:21"/>
reward heere, yet we may misse of it in a better
life. And therefore that <hi>Iob</hi> may not be iustly
challenged to serue God for these things, they
shalbe taken from him,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 9.</note> that his secret corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be purged out, &amp; sincerity approued.
And on the contrary, many an hypocrite and
earthworme shal haue his portion in this life,<note place="margin">Wicked how they haue them.</note> &amp;
be glutted in these things more then his heart
can desire, that so he may be iustly deceiued,
in what he desires to be flattered, namely, an
opinion of goodnes; and may also deceiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hereby, that measure righteousnes by
outward prosperitie; &amp; yet most fearefully also
deceiue himselfe, not onely in finding no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in this his supposed happines, but on
the contrary, being giuen vp by one delusion to
another. That as he accounts it a seale of his
vprightnes to be crowned with aboundance, so
he shal esteeme this his happines; either on the
one side, to abuse these things by putting them
to no vse but vsury, and so defrauding himselfe
and others of the comfort of them; or else on
the other side,<note place="margin">How they vse man.</note> imagining this his happines to
crowne his head with roses, &amp; fare deliciously
euery day, he shall be giuen vp to the abuse of
these things by riot and excesse: not onely to
the iust shame and confusion of all his ciuill
honestie, and conceited goodnes; but to the
iust ouerthrow of his conceited happines in
them; as by his ryot and superfluity, bringing
himselfe ofttimes to a morsell of bread, and yet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:28450:22"/>
cannot haue so much as the huskes which the
Swine fed on, to satisfie his necessitie; and so
hereby plunging himselfe into fearefull shifts,
and wofull despaire. Behold here the power of
his delusion. And conclude we iustly hence,
that the aboundance of outward things, as they
are but common blessings, so they are often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the wicked as curses, to hasten their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
And they are often denyed to the
godly in mercy, to try their sincerity, their faith,
and patience; and also to prouoke their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to more heauenly treasures.<note place="margin">Not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but the right vse makes the Blessing.</note> So that, it is
not the hauing of aboundance, but the right
vse thereof, which is the blessing of God, 1.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18, 19. whereby wee shall lay vp a good
Foundation against the life to come.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And therefore it is but a delusion to imagine
that the more we haue, the more we are blessed,
as being the colour whereby Satan drawes vs
on to this Bargaine; laying hereupon this false
ground in our hearts, that wee must abound in
these things, or else we cannot be blessed.</p>
            <p>And so vpon this sandy foundation,<note place="margin">How these prooue curses to the wicked.</note> raysing
vp this Towre of Babell by diuers stones: As
first, to take vp our hearts especially, to the
compassing hereof, and so to preuent them of
the true riches: Next to plunge vs into any base
and carnal courses for the enioying of the
same, and so harden the conscience in sinne.
And lastly, to exclude repentance euer, by the
enioying hereof; as if this were our happinesse,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:28450:22"/>
to be secure of our Estates: and why may we
not be secure, seeing we sit as a Queene, and
shall see no euill? we say in our prosperitie, we
shall neuer bee remooued; we haue feathered
our neasts on high, and our habitations shall
continue for euer. And so securitie makes way
to sudden destruction; Thou foole, this night
shall they fetch away thy soule: euen when
thon sayest vnto thy soule; Take thine ease,
thou hast goods laid vp for many years. Learne
we hence therefore in the feare of God, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
this da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gerous colour, &amp; so be we wise to
preuent the same,<note place="margin">2. Colours of worldlings.</note>
as heretofore hath beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
The second colour wherby Satan draws
vs on to this desperate Bargaine, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of our Callings: some wherof are such,
as cannot be managed without aboundance;
and herein the delusion is more forcible, for
the enthralling of the soule; both in that aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
beeing an inseparable companion to
greatnes, doth hereby puffe vp the heart, and so
exalts it against the Lord,<note place="margin">Danger of High Callings.</note> as if this great Babel
were attained by our own wit and industrie, but
vsually that we come to that fulnes without
our owne labour and endeauours. Hereupon
we grow carelesse in the vse of what wee came
so lightly by, and either vpon vaine pretence
of Munificence, we lauish out on such as wee
purpose to honour, that so we may be as Gods;
in bestowing where we will: or, we supply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie,
by oppression of others; and so affect
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:28450:23"/>
a kinde of deitie, in taking from whom we list;
and so on either side, doe willingly endanger
our precious soules, either by putting confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in that which daily we confound in our
abuse; or els by abusing the trust that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto vs, as beeing but Stewards for
others, and seruants to the common good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
here then the delusion in high callings;
and learne we thus in the feare of God, to auoid
the snare thereof.</p>
            <p>Consider we that high callings,<note place="margin">How to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die this euill.</note> though they
require necessarie supply of aboundance, yet
it is not so much for their owne, as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good: so to keepe their owne estate
therewith, as that withall they remember, that
they are subordinate to the Highest; who as he
gaue them these things, so hee will require an
account of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. And secondly, that they are also
herein but seruants to the publique; so to carie
their state, as the Common-wealth may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
flourish. And therefore they must euer bare
of their fulnesse, to comfort the emptie soules:
As good <hi>Nehemias</hi> did not take their set allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Gouernour,<note place="margin">Nehe. 5. 13.</note> for the reliefe of the
distressed. And in this most absolute libertie,
they must be confined within the boundes of
best deseruing.</p>
            <p>For the casting of courtesies vpon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that is otherwise meritorious, is as seede
that is cast into good ground: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
yeelds returne with much comfort; so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:28450:23"/>
that our, care and paines is so farre from being
cast away, as that wee reioyce therein. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
be they carefull to honour God with
their fulnesse, in emptying of themselues, for
the good of the Church and common benefit;
that so they may giue vp their account with
ioy. <hi>This concerning high Callings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other ordinary, and inferiour
condition, though each through pride and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
be ayming at the highest; yet let him
here obserue the rules before set downe; and
so shall he auoid the snare which lyes therein.
And thus of the second Colour, drawing on
to this Bargaine.</p>
            <p>A third Colour there yet remaines hereto;<note place="margin">3. Colour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of doing good.</note>
Namely, the conceit of doing the most good:
which seeing we then can lest do, when we haue
most; therefore each desireth aboundance,
vpon pretence hereof: and so, either vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of doing good, swalloweth vp many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
in the gayning of these things, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
euill that good may come thereof,<note place="margin">The snare herein.</note>
whose damnation is iust; or else, which is worse,
and yet a common case, though he hath got
much wickedly, yet by doing of good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,<note place="margin">Worldly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>
he hopeth to make amends; and so is iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
met withall by diuine vengeance: either he
is taken away in his euill getting, and so depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of his hope of doing good, or making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
thereby; or else, if he bee spared to try
his charitie, is it vsually any other, then either
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:28450:24"/>
to giue somewhat at his death, when he can
keepe his <hi>Mammon</hi> no longer? and so it is not
thankes-worthy; or if any come from him while
he liues, what is it else, but either to grease a
fat Sow, and cast water into the Sea? or else, he
parts with a Godgin to catch a Pike, his table is
a snare, and his wealth a nette to make him
friends therewith, or bridle his enemies: either
he must haue a trumpet to bring him in present
reward, and depriue him of the future; or hee
giues with one hand, and kils with the other;
the body must be relieued to enthrall the soule,
or the soule is neglected; so the poore carkesse
may be refreshed, and that rather sparingly to
kill it often with a lingring consumption; or
glutted once a yeere, to fat it vp to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Behold the ordinary charitie of <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
and iudge whether they proue good to
themselues or others.<note place="margin">Remedy hereof.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Learne we therefore</hi> in the name of God; thus
to preuent this delusion. As first, by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that as the holy God hath appointed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes for the obtaining of his owne bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,<note place="margin">Euill not to be done that good may come thereof.</note>
so that we may not doe euill that good
may come thereof; so he requireth no more of
vs, then accordingly as he giueth: the widows
mite is accepted, when we haue no more; and
the pound of the Vaine glorious is reiected,
where lesse will serue the turne. Neither the
fruite of the body will procure any satisfaction
for the sinne of the soule, but to do righteously
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:28450:24"/>
and walke with God, this is acceptable with
him.<note place="margin">Matt. 6. 7, 8.</note> No other sacrifice of distributing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">True charitie, the Markes.</note>
is so pleasing vnto God, but what is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the Houshold of Faith; what may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our owne and others saluation. Aboue all
know we that God loueth a cheerefull giuer:
and therefore while we liue, and haue time,
let vs be doing of good, lest to morrow bee too
late; and let vs send our goods before vs to
make vs friends of them, not leaue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
vs, lest wee lose the comfort of them:
and whatsoeuer we doe, let vs ayme at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, and doe it for his sake, who thought
not his life to be deare for vs: that so casting
our bread vpon the waters we may finde it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
And thus of these delusions, which
draw men to this Bargaine.</p>
            <p>There followeth another sorte of deceits,<note place="margin">Discouerie of deceits, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the hope of vndoing the Bargaine.</note>
which giues vs hope that though we haue ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
on the Bargaine, yet we may be free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
of which we shall haue fitter occasion to
speake in the last place. And so we come to the
last place of obseruation; namely the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Bargaine, which if our Sauour
may be iudge, will profit vs nothing; for so his
words imply:</p>
            <p>What shall it profit a man?<note place="margin">Obseruation 4 The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bargaine, no profite.</note> that is as much to
say, he shall profit nothing thereby.</p>
            <p>It is a very hard match to hazard the soule,
though it were for the gaining of the whole world.</p>
            <p>The reasons<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> hereof lie couched in the words
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:28450:25"/>
themselues, which do imply two things. First,
a comparison of the price with the thing
bought; the price is amplified, first by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thereof, which is the soule. Secondly, by
the appropriation, it is our owne, as being our
best part, yea indeed al in al; that which is the life
of our life, that which must continue for euer
with vs, when these things perish with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
that which eternally shall rue this bargain,
when we haue no other benefit thereof. Out of
which two circumstances, the holy Ghost doth
inferre the iniquitie of the bargaine: as that first
the immortall and diuine soule being made a
price for these fading and earthly things,<note place="margin">1 Price too decre.</note> this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
that we haue paied more for them then
they are worth; and so withall haue made a bad
market.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that when as in other bargaines
though we haue lost at one time,<note place="margin">2 No hope of recouery.</note> yet we may
helpe our selues in another, yet this losse is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable,
because our soules once thus lost
can neuer be recouered againe; if Sathan haue
once got hold on vs by this bond, we are like
neuer to get out againe:<note place="margin">Because the soule thus lost cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</note> because it is a bargain
made willingly, and with great aduice and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
abusing religion and conscience to the
driuing thereof, and reiecting all sence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and common honestie for the enioying
thereof: what sacrifice now is left for sinne, to
such that haue thus made a mock of the Sonne
of God, and esteemed basely of his bloud, in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:28450:25"/>
comparison of the world. And therefore let no
man deceiue himselfe with vaine conceits, as if
hell would be satisfied,<note place="margin">Answer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</note> or God mocked. Doth
he thinke to winde out of the bargaine by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
the Deuill with this tricke, that his
soule was not his owne, and therefore he could
not sell that which was none of his? The holy
Ghost here contradicts him:<note place="margin">It is not our owne.</note> It is his own soule.
Indeede it is not his owne to saue the same,<note place="margin">how.</note> he
must be bought with a price, and so is not his
owne; but yet with this condition, that not as
his owne, he may glorifie God therewith in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and spirit. To destroy and vndoe the same,
so it is his owne, he hath this by inheritance, to
be his owne destruction; our destruction is of
our selues, &amp; that it may appeare so, what God
hath decreed, we willingly execute in our
conuersing with the world: we will haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t
payment whatsoeuer it cost vs, &amp; so that we
may enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season;
we haue no respect to that great recompense of
the reward.<note place="margin">1 Deceit. hope of doing good with these things.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. Oh but we hope to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe

and haply to our selues for a season.</p>
            <p>But yet withall more confirme the Bargain,<note place="margin">This reiected.</note>
in that our doing good to our selues, doth but
harden the heart the more in sinne, and lull it in
securitie, to expose it thereby to suddaine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance:
and our well doing to others may bee
the vndoing of their soules: or though they fare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:28450:26"/>
the better euery way hereby, yet this doth not
hinder, but that we may still fare the worse: as
enioying more at their thriuing vnder vs, or
boasting &amp; contenting our selues with others
thriuing, as hoping to make them our trumpes,
or sponges in time of neede: howsoeuer, for

deceiued; they part with the happines of
their soules, which was none of theirs to giue,

this.<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 56.</note> 2. Hee bindes them by their words, all
their talke is of the world, and how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
the same: the Saboath is no other wayes
sanctified, but to conferre therof, either abroad
as occasion serues, or at home in their closet.</p>
            <p>Here they blesse their soules in what they
haue, or may compasse: euery day too little to
fetch in profit by lying or flattery, by detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or wispering; their very tongues are set on
fire of hell, to owne them to their Maister.</p>
            <p>Especially, their way vttereth their foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and slauerie to Satan; he is not so readie
to offer, as they to execute: what by deceite
in Bargaining, and fraude in selling; what by
crueltie in oppressing, and cunning in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining;
what by engrossing to themselues,
and encroaching vpon others. He is not wise,
that hath not a tricke to deceiue the Law, and
so his owne soule.</p>
            <p>Their purpose is well knowne to Satan by
their words and actions, and so hereby he sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bindes them to performance of the Bargain.
But now on the other side,<note place="margin">Satan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes not with vs.</note> doth hee performe
with them? Nothing lesse. The holy Ghost sets
out his performance, which he cannot; yet if,
or though, supposing what may be, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it cannot be. And indeed how can it be,
that Satan should performe with them? Alas,
the earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof;
and he giues it to whom he please. But Satan is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:28450:27"/>
the god of this world,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and Prince that ruleth
in the Ayre.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> True, but so onely reputed of the
wicked, that adore no other thing; so onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
vnder God, to deceiue and plague them
therewith. He offereth to Christ; All these will
I giue thee:<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 6, 7.</note> Alas, they were none of his to
giue; he cannot so much as take an haire of our
head from vs, without the dispensation of the
most High; much lesse can he giue vs the least
crumbe, but by leaue from God. And see here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
also his notable treacherie, he offers these of
gift freely, which are none of his to giue: and
yet wee must exchange our soules for them,
which are infinitely inualuable.</p>
            <p>Thus is not Satan able to giue vs these
things,<note place="margin">2. We not capable of them.</note> neither indeed are we capable of what
hee so largely offers. What should wee doe
with a whole world, whereof nothing is our

at the least as <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour, too heauy a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
for vs? And when we haue the most there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at the best, will it not prooue too heauie a
reckoning without the blessing of God? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
here then, the conclusion in the Bargaine.
Neither can Satan giue what he proffers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we receiue the same:<note place="margin">3. Satan would not performe if he could.</note> and indeed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would Satan, if he could, performe with vs,
to keepe our desires afoote, and so thereby our
subiection to him, to any base courses for the
attayning thereof. He enuies our present hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse:
and were he not bridled by the wise
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:28450:28"/>
and mightie Lord, so vnquencheable is his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
against the power and gouernment of our
God; that if there were no other reason but to
disgrace the prouidence of God, he would dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breed combustions, and desolations among
men. No man should enioy a day of present
happinesse, he would be tormenting before his
time, and make hell euen with the earth by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnuall
butcheries and Massacres. But he is wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restrained by the Lord, for the honour of
his generall prouidence, and for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his righteous iudgements against the
wicked who serue him; they shall not obtaine
what they desire, to the iust confusion of their
hellish homage, and yet to the hastening of
their finall vengeance, by this disappointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t of
their hopes; which either breed more griedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in sin to compasse the same, or els bring
forth fearefull despaire, to thrust them violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon damnation: and all this, as righteously
by the Lord, vpon these that forsake him, so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
by Satan and themselues: who haue
made faslhood their refuge, and are hid vnder
vanitie, and so no maruaile if they reape what
they haue sowen; euen of the flesh corruption,
and vtter confusion.<note place="margin">Vse hereof, casting before hand.</note> Obserue here wisely, the
treacherie of the Bargaine, and sit downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and so hasten thy vengeance; or els to part with
it then, when thou most depends thereon. Will
Satan play thus false with thee, and cheate thee
in thy Bargaine?</p>
            <p>Oh then,<note place="margin">How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent him.</note> be wise in the feare of God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
his treacherie. Admire not these Gallants
that reauell in these things, neither enuie their
happines that haue payed so deare for them,
lest this doating admiration, dazle and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the eye of thy iudgement, that so thou
mayest wish to be like vnto them; and enuie of
their happines leaue thee to Satans malice, to
be ensnared in such wayes which haue set them
aloft. Looke into the Sanctuary of thy God,
to the ende of these men, that their present
lustre may not bewitch thee: and be alwayes
thinking of that life which is without end; that
so thy heart may bee satisfied with the hope
thereof. Build thy foundation by Faith, vpon
the Rocke, that no stormes may split thee; and
let the load-starre of hope guide thee through
the surges, that the billowes may carie thee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
safely, to thy desired Hauen: let patience sit
at the Helme, to keepe thee in a setled course,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:28450:29"/>
and so shall experience be thy Steere-man, to
stablish thee in present stormes. So experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shall giue contentment, whatsoeuer doth
befall thee, and contentment shall prouoke
thankfulnes, for what thou hast vndeseruedly.
Thankfulnesse shall prooue an holy venture, to
returne thee with Vsurie; either with a greater
measure of these things, as shall be fittest for
thee, or with what shall be farre better: euen a
supply of spirituall pouertie, to hunger after
durable riches; happy pouertie, that will make
thee rich for euer, and blessed hunger that shall
be thus satisfied. Oh, that we were wise thus to
deceiue Satan! What roome could there bee
for him, if the heart were so employed? What
hope of preuailing, where the soule is thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
Oh, that we could be thus wise for our
latter end! If we could daily renewe our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
how should we preuent, or reiect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
assaults? If we could be humbled dayly
in the sence of our vnworthynesse, how should
we be thankfull for the least? How could wee
enuie and fret at the prosperity of others? We
should now finde too much to doe at home, to
haue any leasure to looke abroad; or if we looke
abroad wisely, it will returne vs home againe,
either to examine our selues whether we are
such, or else to be carefull and circumspect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
our selues that we may not be such. What
can we see abroad which may not more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vs vnder the hand of God? and shall not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:28450:29"/>
our abasing in the presence of God, be the
meanes of our exalting and acceptance with
him. And what need wee desire the wine and
the corne, when our God is at peace with vs?
Is not he our sufficient portion, and shall we
not with him haue all things else? Oh, let vs
then make still sure of him, by seeking all from
him, by renouncing all for him, and vsing all to
him; resting in him onely, and not our selues,
when we are at greatest worldly ease, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him our refuge when we finde no rest else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
How shall this tryall of our Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the worke by patience, that we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and entire, wanting nothing, enioying all
things,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6, 7.</note> euen when we haue nothing, and being
rich in content, though wee are base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
of the world? Happy contempt, to
keepe vs from the loue thereof, and make vs
long the more after heauen; yea most happy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing
of man, that casts vs vpon our God, to
haue experience of his fauour, and euerlasting
compassions. Let them make the wedge of
golde their hope, that haue no repose in God;
and let their glory be their shame, whose belly
is their God.</p>
            <p>Let them take their fill of dalliance, till a dart
be strucke through their Liuer; and let them be
contented with the leprosie, that will needs run
after the talents of deceit. Miserable foole, that
will be thus led to the stockes, and as an Oxe to
the shambles; wretched <hi>Gehezi</hi> that to receiue
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:28450:30"/>
that which his Maister refused, partakes of that
plague which his Maister cured.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, a Bargaine you see is a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and our vnsatiable hearts driue the same.
A match is made vp, and we see the danger of
it: wee are deceiued therein, and yet cannot
helpe our selues. Let vs therefore bee wise to
set bounds to our restlesse desires, and let vs
turne the currant contrary, that so wee may
wade safely and enioy our endeauours; vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
they, that so desire, as that they can be soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
wearied, then satisfied with their labours.
Miserable men that seeke for happinesse in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vanitie and changeablenesse, and can finde
this their onely content to be restlesse in the
pursuit of what they cannot compasse; or what
they compasse, increaseth their miserie: most
desperate their estate that haue no hope but in
this life, wherein (notwithstanding) they are
iustly deceiued and confounded. Oh then, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
they that haue the God of gods for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
who sweetens vnto them all their bitter
pilles, and hereby preuents surfaiting of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excesse: happy they that haue their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
set vpon heauenly things, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be taken from them, though they are from
them; and so being from them doe encrease
their spirituall appetite, that so they may neuer
cease longing, till they be satisfyed with him.
Oh happy are they that can be contented with
their estates! because what the Lord disposeth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:28450:30"/>
is best and fittest for them; and yet by faith can
still be restlesse after what is promised: that
so God may fulfill the desires of them that feare
him. Yea they are happy, and euer more blessed
are they that vse the world as strangers and as
strangers are entertained thereof; that so they
may approue themselues to belong to another
countrey, and may hasten to that Countrie and
Citie which is aboue. This happinesse of the
way, he which is the Way grant vnto vs, euen
for his trueth sake; that so by him we may be
conducted to the happinesse of our Countrey.
To whom with God the Father, and the blessed
Spirit, three glorious Persons and one God in
vnitie, might and maiesty be ascribed of vs and
all Saints, as it is most due; all glory, power,
dominion, and thanksgiuing, with all feare and
obedience, both now and for euer. Amen.</p>

                  </gap>oident hereunto.</head>
               <p>THus hast thou gentle <hi>Reader</hi> a Briefe of such
Meditations, which by obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
courses I haue conceiued, concerning the
desperate estate of Worldlings, endangering
their soules for the gayning of worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.
And for thy further satisfaction
herein, that thou mayest preuent deceit in thy
Christian libertie, lest it be an occasion to the
flesh; and follow thy earthly plough so that the
better Plough still goe forward, I haue thought
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:28450:31"/>
it necessarie to adioyne hereunto certaine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Conscience, whereby thou mayest be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
in such difficulties, and seeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
as appeare betweene thy generall and
ciuill calling; that so thou mayest wisely subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
the one vnto the other: and make thy
ciuill calling, a furtherance to the perfection of
thy generall. To this end, seeing, as the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the Sabboath is a speciall tryall and
furtherance of synceritie in all other occasion;
so the maine quarrell of Worldlings is against
the same: either they would vtterly abolish the
same that it may not be kept at all, or else they
would delude and frustrate the power thereof
vnder pretence of Christian libertie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first Quaere,<note place="margin">1. Quaere.</note> shal be concerning the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
which the Sabboath allowes.</p>
               <p>What vse of our ciuill callings, and other
accedents thereto, may bee allowed vpon the
Lords day.</p>
               <p>To which we answer briefly, that such liberty
hereto is onely allowed herein, as the word and
equitie therof doth confine vnto vs. Namely.</p>
               <p>1. That in case of necessitie for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life, so that without present helpe it
may be certainly endangered, wee may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
exercise our ciuill callings, but neither in
the same manner as at other times, or to the
same ends. First, I say,</p>
               <p>Not in the same manner, that is; not with
the same intention of the minde, which on this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:28450:31"/>
day must be more abstracted from earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
then another day: not so much our
loue to the person, as our loue vnto God, must
now beare sway in doing the thing with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
respect to God commanding the same,
that he may haue the glory of our simple obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that man may receiue benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
which though I acknowledge is to guide
vs at all times, yet specially the Saboth requires
this retired obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce. And in our releeuing the
person, though his body or state be in present
danger, yet our principall ayme must be the
reliefe of the soule by exhortation, reproof, &amp;c.
as occasion serues: and that without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of refreshing the minde or body by any
such labour, which is lawfull at other times.</p>
               <p>Thus is the different manner in regard of the
minde; and so also there must be a difference in
the vse of the body: as so to exercise the body
as specially to humble and abase it by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of our labour; whereas at other times wee
may more respect the ease thereof.</p>
               <p>And yet so farre onely to exercise it as not
to tire &amp; weary it, if vrgent occasion donot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
lest wearisomenesse require some such
recreation thereof as is not meete.</p>
               <p>And if any vrgent occasion may bring wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risomenes,
yet now insteed of such bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
the minde may be enlarged to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
meditations and thankesgiuing, thereby
to refresh the wearied carcase.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:28450:32"/>
Whence it followeth that all bodily recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that do not further vs to diuine worship,
are vnlawfull on the Lords day: Because they
serue onely to refresh the body after labour;
which is restrained therefro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>; otherwise I say, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
they shal make vs fitter to serue God, when we
haue any liberty to labour vpon case of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though we may vse that liberty to wearisom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
yet this is to be releeued specially with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
recreation.</p>
               <p>2 This inferreth that the vse of our Ciuil cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
on this day, is not as they are Ciuill, but
rather as they are abstracted from all Ciuill
respects.</p>
               <p>And this shall appeare the better, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the different Ends of imployment on this
day from the other.</p>
               <p>Our End on ordinary dayes, may be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to our selues, for the encrease of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes and maintenance in the world;
so may we not do on the Lords day. Here wee
must labour freely without hire or see, our
paines must be a free will offering without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of recompence, to approue the sincerity
of our obedience, wholy for Gods sake, and
not our owne.</p>
               <p>And that our labour must now be seuered
from al respect or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tentment of the body, but
rather to the humiliation both of soule and
body. The like must be resolued concerning
such other workes as are allowed this day. As.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:28450:32"/>
2. Workes of Charitie, which though they
may now bee performed, (as relieuing the
poore, visiting the sicke and afflicted) yet here
they must be limited by the former circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
as after a diuers Nature and to diuers
Endes then at other times.</p>
               <p>1. Now they are to be performed more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
then at other times, in regard of the
matter we giue; because this day requires a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning
of our selues herein, that we may be
more enlarged to others; both in that our lesse
bodily labour hath need thereof; and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
labour of the mind, requires the lesse, lest
it be hindred and dulled hereby. And yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the manner, they are to be performed
more sparingly: lesse time bestowed thereon,
lesse wearying of the body; and all this that
both bodie and soule may bee more free and
ready in the worship of God.</p>
               <p>The like may be concluded of that other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
worke allowed on the Sabboath; namely,
the view of the creature: Now the minde must
be abstracted from all delight in them, as they
serue for present vse, which may be allowed at
other times; and onely inflamed hereby to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God, in the wonderfull varietie and vse to
them, for the aduancement of his power and
prouidence in their creation and gouernment,
without any respect of right or vse of them to
our selues.</p>
               <p>Whence it followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:28450:33"/>
1. That all liberall vse of the Creatures in
prodigall Feasting, &amp;c, is now forbidden, but
onely such as may serue necessitie, and bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
vnto good reason.</p>
               <p>2. Generally no other bodily labour is now
admitted, but what is confined within the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
bounds of necessitie and charitie, and the
like, together with such other circumstances
of different manner and end, as before are laid
downe.</p>
               <p>And thus of the first Case and Resolution thereof.</p>
               <p>A second case ariseth;<note place="margin">2. Case.</note> That seeing the Lord
hath set apart but one day for his Seruice, and
left vs sixe for our ciuill callings: Whether it
be not lawfull to spend more time in following
the world, then seeking after heauen? And so
whether though our thoughts runne more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
present occasions of this life, then vpon
those of a better, we may not yet haue comfort
that our estate is secure, our interest good in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happinesse.</p>
               <p>The Resolution hereof consists, First, in the
Consideration of the right vse and intent of
the Sabboath, which is principally to confine
and employ our thoughts wholie vpon heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things and such occasions, as that day are
publikely offered to further the same, and that
for two ends. One, that this heauenly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our thoughts on this day, and so of our
words and actions sutable thereto, may be both
a resemblance of our pure and perfect estate in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:28450:33"/>
heauen, when all our thoughts, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall be thus wholy exercised, and also on
euidence of our right in that happinesse, and
withall may prouoke vs to sigh and hasten to
that perfect estate; by how much our experience
of fayling in these things on this day argues our
shortnes and abertation from that perfection.</p>
               <p>And hereupon followes another vse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Sabboath; Namely, that by restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and setting our thoughts now onely vpon
heauen, he obiects wee may at all other times
keepe them better in order, that though they
may haue libertie on the other dayes to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occasions: yet by the former imployment of
them on the Sabboath, they may now be so
bridled and seasoned with holy grounds and
Spirituall ends: as that we may so vse the world
as if we vsed it not, our hearts may not bee set
vpon the same, though we must conuerse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
but both lifted vp to God for the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of our businesse, and kept still euer with
God in the prosecuting thereof, and so returne
vnto God for the blessing of the same, and relie
again vpon God in waiting on his prouidence,
and meditating of the heauenly riches: making
still these worldly occasions daily matter to
humble vs hereby, in that we cannot be without
what in some sort hinders our intire fellowship
with God: to exercise our Faith and patience;
in that our labour is nothing without the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of God: to try our synceritie, that we can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:28450:34"/>
spare time for heauenly occasions, and season
our earthly affaires with Spirituall Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And so to prepare vs by a daily viewing of
our reckonings, and making euen with God, to
our great account; and so hereby to fit vs the
better to the next Sabboath, and so to prouoke
vs to hunger after the eternall Sabboath.</p>
               <p>Thus doth the right vse and entent of the
Sabboath extend to the holy ordering of our
ciuill Callings.</p>
               <p>And surely if we consider rightly in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, the right vse and ende of our ciuill
Callings. Which is not so much for present
maintenance of life, or to thriue thereby, as
to humble vs vnder the mightie hand of God,
in that we haue need of such meanes, which,
had not sinne entred into the world, we should
not haue had; and so daily to renew repentance
and thereby to prouoke to loue and compassion
towards others; that so we may lay vp a good
foundation against the life to come. The wise
consideration and comparing of both these
together; both the right vse and ende of the
Sabboath and our ciuill Callings, will happily
further the resolution of these doubts, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Conscience, in any scruples that may
arise there-from.</p>
               <p>For out of this comparison will arise these
conclusions. First though the Lord hath allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vs sixe dayes for our ciuill Callings, and but
one for the generall, yet from this proportion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:28450:34"/>
it doth not follow, that though more time be
allowed for our worldly occasions then for our
spirituall, therefore wee may enlarge our
thoughts so much the more after worldly
things, then after those of a better life: seeing as
our ciuill Callings are ordained, not so much
for the maintenance of this present, as that life
which is to come; so our managing of them
must bee Spirituall, with thoughts and actions
deriued from that Fountaine, guided by the
same Rule, and ayming at the same End.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the Sabboath doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
vs altogether from these carnall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoughts, as being simply euill on that day:
so neither doe the other dayes otherwise allow
them, then as they proceed from a spirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to glorifie God in obedience to him in
our Calling, rather then to enrich our selues,
and so ayme at a Spirituall end, euen the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of vs to a better life.</p>
               <p>The Summe of all is:</p>
               <p>1. Our ciuill Callings one the Lords day
must wholly cease, but vpon the former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p>2. On the weeke dayes they must be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not with worldly but with heauenly minds.
They must be begun with Prayer, both priuate,
and if it may be, with the Familie: they must be
continued with spirituall Meditations, tending
to weane vs from the loue of them; by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the manifold distractions, the basenes,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:28450:35"/>
and corruption incident thereto, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking
to raise vp the minde to heauenly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects;
and they must bee ended with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thankefulnesse, with prayer, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
submitting to the will of God, and waiting
by Faith his glorious Blessing.</p>
               <p>Thus if we doe, our thoughts (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant
with the world, yet) shall haue sweet
commerce with heauen; our time, though
more dayes spent in our ciuil Callings, yet
now thus employed, shall sanctifie them vnto
vs, and sanctifie vs more and more by them,
and so make euery day a spirituall Sabboath.
Thus we shall walke with God, while we haue
dealing in the world, &amp; haue our conuersation
in heauen, while wee are thus strangers on the
earth: Our thoughts though imployed vpon
the world, yet shall not rest thereon, but retire
againe to their true Center of heauen; and our
wayes, though trauailing in the world, yet
shall stil be ayming and hastening to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which is aboue. So that, though we liue in
the flesh, we shall not liue after the flesh: and
though we may take care for the flesh, yet wee
shall not care to satisfie the same, nor vse our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
as occasion thereto. In a word, we shall
hereby so vse the world, as that we may not loue
it; we shall so desire to liue, and seeke meanes
for the maintenance thereof; as that still wee
shall bee ready to die, and to leaue all for
Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:28450:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And this may serue for answere to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Question.</p>
               <p>Hence ariseth a third scruple: Whether it be
not lawfull to desire riches and aboundance.</p>
               <p>To which we answere: 1. By a distinction
of riches, which may be considered. 1 As they
are necessary and sufficient, and so a small thing
may be counted riches, as contenting Nature
and being sufficient for vs. 2. They may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as they are in the estimation of the world,
and in their own Nature, and so aboundance is
to be deemed riches, &amp; so they are vnnecessary.</p>
               <p>A 2. Difference, now to be considered, is
of the persons which may desire them, which
are of two sorts. First, publike; such whose Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
cannot be well executed without aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
as that of the Magistrate, and such other
publike Callings. Secondly, some persons are
priuate, and these also in regard of their charge
and such like occasion, may lawfully desire
more or lesse.</p>
               <p>A 3. Difference is in respect of our desires,
which are either absolute, such as require sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the performance of what we desire; such as
are all desires for Spirituall graces, which for
the grace simply must be absolute, though for
the measure thereof they may be conditionall:</p>
               <p>2. Our desires are conditionall, with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
to Gods will, as may make most for his
glorie and our good; and so ought all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
be for earthly things: because that God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:28450:36"/>
hath so onely promised them, as they shalbe
for our good. And so must we onely desire
them. Out of these distinctions arise these
conclusions.</p>
               <p>1 First we may generally desire riches, as they
are in the first sence necessary and sufficient, not
as they are lesse necessary &amp; aboundant. <hi>Genes.
28. Deuter. 17. 16. 17. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, we may desire what may aswell
fit our callings as persons; though this may be
satisfyed with lesse, yet the calling may desire
more, and so such callings as require state and
maiestie, may require abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dance: yet so as that,</p>
               <p>3 All our desires for these things must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
submitting to Gods pleasure, both for
the thing, as also for the meanes to obtaine the
same; and so for the measure and continuance
thereof vnto vs, and so not enlarged by our
owne couetous minde, but confined to the
iudgement and example of the most sober and
frugall persons. And therefore,</p>
               <p>4 All our desires for these things must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with prayers vnto God, both for
the thing we desire, as also for the measure and
blessing thereon.</p>
               <p>Thus may we lawfully desire Riches.</p>
               <p>A fourth question ariseth hereupon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may vse such meanes for the gathering
of riches as mans law doth tollerate,<note place="margin">4 Quaere</note> and come
not within the compasse of the Penalty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
As vsury, Monopolies, letters of mart, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:28450:36"/>
with Infidels and Idolaters; tentering and
burnishing our wares, by pressing, sliking, and
keeping in and storing our commodities;
changing of our callings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which we answer, first by some generall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
rules to all. 1. That whatsoeuer is not against
the law of equitie and charitie, without intent
to deceiue, as we would be done vnto, that
may lawfully be done herein.</p>
               <p>That wherein the law of man is subordinate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to the law of God, we may safely venture.</p>
               <p>That the law of man may dispense with some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
things which yet it allowes not simply, but so
only tollerates as to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t a worse mischief; so
confines in the tolleration, as indeed in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
implyes the impossiblitie of what it tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
or condemnes the same<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Of this nature is
vsury, which though it be tollerated by mans
law, yet is restrained within such straight limits,
as if the law were straightly executed, it might
easily restraine what it seemes to tollerate. My
purpose is not to enter into the mystery and
sleights of this dangerous Trade. I leaue this
to that worthy treasure of Maister Doctor <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
who hath very profitably waded heerein.
Only my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>clusion is, that though couetousnes
is vsually the ground and Broker hereto, yet
there may be some vse therof, vpon some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
occasions &amp; extreamities in these barren
times, wherein so few will lend freely, and few
make conscience to repay what they borrow; as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:28450:37"/>
may tollerate the same, and that rather for the
borrowers sake, then the lenders: so that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
be hereby avoyded, and the rules of
equitie be obserued: which, because each mans
vpright conscience must be the iudge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I leaue the discussing and ordering thereof
to that soueraigne arbiterment touching Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,
&amp; engrossing of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modities though
they be somewhat of diuerse nature, and being
abused, may tend to the oppression of the
subiect, enriching of priuate men: yet seeing the
Prince hath his prorogatiue, and may lawfully
aduance whom it please him, seeing heereby
there may be a speedier vent for the inning of
commodities from abroad, if few buy vp the
same, that they may not lye vpon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
hands, and so he hindred from his sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and occasions of venture; and hereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
there may be a speedier communicating of
them to the subiect, that is to retaile them: I
see not but that these courses may be lawfull, so
that,</p>
               <p>1 Priuate gaine eate not out the Publique.</p>
               <p>2 The subiect be not oppressed.</p>
               <p>3 The Magistrate defrauded, &amp; scandalized.</p>
               <p>4 And so the peace and welfare of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
preserued concerning Letters of
mart. These howsoeuer in time of peace with
forrain nations, I hold them vtterly vnlawfull,
because they tend to the violation of leagues:
yet in time of hostilitie, I imagine they may
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:28450:37"/>
haue some vse, especially with the enemies of
God &amp; true religion; because we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to roote them out, and heereby wee may
both discouer their designes against vs, and also
wisely curbe, and defeate the same, by weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their forces, and ouertaking them in their
mischieuous intents. And therefore,</p>
               <p>1 So that priuate gaine be not principally ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at.</p>
               <p>2 Cruelty and extreamity herein be avoyded.</p>

               <p>4 And only the ruine of Gods enemies be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
I hold also that these may in some
measure be tollerated.</p>
               <p>As for trading with Infidels and Idolaters,
this howsoeuer it be generally forbidden in the
word,<note place="margin">2. Cl<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Yet seeing we haue presidents in the word of

These in some Cases, with some special

               <p>As when we haue no other to commerce

we cannot be supplied with necessaries, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

that we be not drawne heereby, to any

               <p>1. Touching those ordinary sleights of tente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

of our wares; though there be much deceit in
them: yet there may bee also some lawfull vse
thereof, with these conditions.</p>
               <p>2. That hereby only our Wares may be made
more saleable, and yet so as the glosse and stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

goodnesse thereof.</p>
               <p>3. Be not a meanes to enhance the price, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the worth thereof: by making them seeme
hereby finer and sounder then they are indeed.</p>
               <p>4. That we propound the common rule of
Equitie; to doe to others, as we would be done
to our selues.</p>
               <p>The like may bee sayde, concerning our
keeping in,<note place="margin">Keeping in of wares.</note> and storing vp our Wares, wherein
though we may aime at a priuate gaine, to raise
the present prises, or else to expect a deerer
rate, &amp;c: to defraud the Common wealth of it
present necessitie: yet herein also there may be
some allowance, both in times of plentie, and in
time of scarcitie, especially for all kinde of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:28450:38"/>
In time of plentie, that so excesse may
be preuented for the present; and extremitie
may be relieued in time of distresse: and to this
end our Garners and Store-houses in the Citie
and elsewhere haue speciall vse, to plucke
downe the prises in time of dearth, and so to
refresh the hearts of the poore; as also to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide,
if supply should not come in abroad.
And so also in times of penurie, that neuer there
may be no extreame want.<note place="margin">Genes. 42.</note> So <hi>Ioseph</hi> by diuine
warrant stored vp, that the Church might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued
in extremitie. So haue we relieued our
neighbours, and they vs.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, for those tending onely to orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and superfluitie, I hold, that we may not
keepe in our Commodities, especially if it tend
to the spoyling and corrupting of them; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we cannot sell them, that we may bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
thereby: and yet in case of returning the
price, or for the common good, we must vtter
them though it be to our losse, because in such
cases we are bound to giue freely, rather then
our Commoditie should be lost, or the poore
lost for want of them; and so to depend vpon
the Prouidence of God. As for changing of
our Callings,<note place="margin">Changing of Callings.</note> though this may serue to argue
discontent and want of Faith, in depending on
the prouidence of God; yet seeing some Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
depend vpon the custome and fashion of
the time,<note place="margin">Cappes, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuer, Hoods.</note> which is alterable, as of kindes of
apparell: some depend vpon casualties which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:28450:39"/>
may ouerthrow the same: many things haue
beene vsed in Poperie, which now are antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
many things may be currant occasions of
commerce with such and such forraine Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where the cause being taken away, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
must cease. And the Lord furnishing his
children with wisedome and insight into all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
occasions, necessitie may force and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them, if one will not serue for maintenance,
that another may be followed: yea, it may so
fall out, that our aptnesse to one may bee more
then to another, to which notwithstanding we
haue been bound. Especially, seeing it fals out
that some Callings may haue for the most
their ground from custome and vanity, and not
from conscience; as generally of tyring, and
such like, and tend to the satisfying of the flesh:
I see not but in such Cases, it is not only lawfull
but necessarie euen to change our Callings,
lest otherwise wee make ship-wracke of good
conscience, and defraud our selues of that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
which God and Nature allowes, and limit
the prouidence of God to our meanes, which
extends it selfe to all lawfull. Prouided that still
we keepe the distinction betweene Authoritie
and subiection; remembring that wee may so
change our Callings, as still to keepe our selues
within the compasse of our generall bounds,
which are, still to be subiect to gouernment, and
so onely vnto them, as to serue them in the
Lord. Not encroaching vpon the Calling of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:28450:39"/>
the Magistrate; nor by our libertie, aduancing
the Magistrate aboue what is meet; but still ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
one another in loue, and all studying to
serue the Lord Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether one man may haue diuers Callings? As, the Minister may be also a Magistate? One Trades-man may exercise diuers ciuill
Callings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the former we answer generally, that where
Callings are subordinate to each other, there in
case of necessitie, one may supply diuers Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as his abilitie is thereto: so the Minister
may in some Cases and degrees, execute the
office of a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>2. Magistrates are of two sorts: 1. supreame,
and soueraigne, as the King: and 2. Inferior and
subordinate, as such as are appointed vnder
him, for the easing of his burthen, and better
seruing the publike good: so a Minister may be
a Magistrate, though he may not encroach vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the supreame authoritie. I say hee may not
vsurpe soueraigne Gouernment; because this is
a marke of Antichrist, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9, 10. This is
contrary to the Word, which commands all
both Priests and people, to be subiect to the
higher Powers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. This cannot be for
the preseruation of the common Peace, which
is by Vnitie, and Reformation of all abuses
which tend to the disturbance thereof. And
how shall the faults of Ministers bee corrected
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:28450:40"/>
but by the supreame Magistrate? how shall their
wrongs be righted but by him?</p>
               <p>Yet I hold that a Minister may be an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Gouernour; because it is lawfull for the
Magistrate to bestow honour and authoritie, as
it pleaseth him for the publike good.</p>
               <p>And this authoritie giuen to the Ministerie,
may tend to the publike good; and the glory of
God, as hereby,</p>
               <p>1. Their Persons may be better accepted,
and preserued from contempt.</p>
               <p>2. Their Callings be executed more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
when they haue some power to restraine
open and grosse euils, and compell the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man to conformation in Religion.</p>
               <p>3. Their constancie and courage herein, as
it may ease of a burthen, so it may confirme
and encourage the supreame Magistrate in the
loue and maintenance of the Trueth: so that
still the holy Order of subiection bee kept, that
all this bee done with direction from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Power, and returne thereto: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
be auoyded; that we so execute these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
Callings, as that still we reserue a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betweene them, and oppose not those
things, which are wisely to bee subordinated,
which we may doe.</p>
               <p>1. If we consider that there are some speciall
actions particular to each Callings, which on
either side may not be encroached vpon. As,
the Magistrate may not preach, minister the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:28450:40"/>
Sacraments, &amp;c, because this is peculiar to the
Minister. So the Minister (I meane as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
may not prescribe Lawes, execute the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
of them, Determine of the persons, and
goods of the subiect, &amp;c, because these are the
Magistrates Prerogatiue.</p>
               <p>2. That all things bee done with direction
from the royall Canon, &amp; ayme at Gods glory.</p>
               <p>3. So is it in the reformed Churches, where
the Consistorie doth as well medle in Ciuill, as
Ecclesiasticall occasions. And is it any other in
our Honourable Court of the High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in other Consistories of our Clergie?</p>
               <p>As for the other; That one man may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
diuers ciuill Callings: As this is apparent
by the practise of our Land, where some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
euer vse other Trades: Mercers abroad
sell things belonging to many Trades; so I see
not but that it may be warrantable by the word,
which so enioyneth vs to be contented with
the Calling that God hath placed vs in; as the
seruant, while he is a seruant, is not to encroach
vpon the Calling of the Maister; as that it deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, but when we are for our selues, we may
follow what Calling we please, though we bee
not bound thereto; so wee haue skill therein,
and respect the publike good, hinder not our
Spirituall Calling: and obserue the Sacred
Lawes and Customes of the Countrey where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in
we liue: because one Calling will not serue
to redeeme the time, and maintaine our charge
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:28450:41"/>
and therefore in these respects we may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imploy our selues in diuers.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>To conclude this point, and resolue all in one Case,

               <p>That we may liue and thriue with a good
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>science is manifest, 1. Because it is promised
as a blessing and fruit of godlinesse, <hi>Psa. 112:</hi> so

               <p>2 Our ciuill Callings in the world are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
not contrarie to our Christian Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
and so,</p>
               <p>3 We cannot keepe a good conscience if we
liue not in a calling, &amp; perhaps thriue not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
Except in case of triall, when God wil exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
our Faith and patience, in keeping vs
from hand to mouth; or exercise our sincerity
in not answering our endeuours for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
lest we should seeme to serue God, that
we may thriue: or finally, by some casualtie.</p>
               <p>Of our Calling may be mean, such as yeeld
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:28450:41"/>
only so much exercise daily, as may serue neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and so cannot promise aboundance, but
onely yeeld competency and sufficiency, for
necessarie maintenance, which may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thriuing, though we attaine not to great
riches; and yet euen in these the blessing of
God is admirable, where Religious wisedome
teacheth parsimony and diligence to better
our estates.</p>
               <p>Or our callings may be vpon aduenture, such
as depend vpon diuine prouidence, in blessing
our going out, and comming home: which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is arbitrary as may make most for Gods
glory, and our chiefest good; therefore if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we attaine not to great matters, yet herein
shall appeare the blessing of godlinesse, that we
shall be content with whatsoeuer our wise
and gracious God shall dispose, and whether
it be much or little, it shalbe but sufficient. He
that gathered more Manna had but to serue his
turne, and he that gathered lesse had no want.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 19. 20. To conclude all,</p>
               <p>1 Labour we first for grace, and these things
shalbe castvpon vs. <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 33.</p>
               <p>2 If not in aboundance, yet in what shalbe
best for vs, to further to a better life.</p>
               <p>3 It is good that still we should finde some
want in these things, that we may not set our
harts vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but hunger after durable riches.</p>
               <p>4 And therefore let vs liue by Faith, &amp; not by
sence, waiting vpon the blessing of God in what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:28450:42"/>
we haue, that it may be sanctified vnto vs, and
waiting vpon the power and prouidence of
God in what we haue not, that wee may bee
suffised in the needfull and fittest occasion: or
recompensed with what shalbe better for vs.
And when we haue canuased and studied all,
remember we that some corruption must fall
out in these things, to humble the flesh, and
cast vs vpon Christ our sufficient riches. And
that a good conscience, as it shall guide vs
through each particular occasion, that wee
make not ship-wrack thereof, so it shall also
abase vs in our greatest sincerity, that though
we know nothing by our selues, yet herein wee
may not be iustified, but still labour to be found
in Christ, not hauing our owne righteousnesse,
and endeuour to be found of him in peace, at
his glorious appearance.</p>
               <p>And if this shall not sufficiently satisfie thee
in whatsoeuer scruples may fall out herein: I
aduise thee to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mend thee particular doubts
in humble prayers vnto thy God, who will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the desires of them that feare him, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
thy carefull soule that waits vpon him.
And so I hartily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mend thee to the word of his
grace, whereby thou shalt be enformed suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in whatsoeuer may hinder the pece of thy
conscience, and build it vp further in all wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and spirutuall vnderstanding, that thou
maiest be able to discerne of things that differ,
and so trying all things, maiest hold that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:28450:42"/>
which is good, and grow vp thereby in all
power and conscience of sinceritie and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
that so thou mayest be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and intire wanting nothing,
vnto the full measure of the
age of Iesus Christ,</p>
