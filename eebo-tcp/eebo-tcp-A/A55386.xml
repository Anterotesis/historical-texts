         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>more conducing than another to the attainment of that
great end, that way is most eligible, by wise and pious
Christians; And although it is a laudable and necessary
work to exercise Charity towards the bodies of distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
persons, yet those must needs be the most noble acts
of Charity which concern the souls of men, seeing both
the object of them is more excellent, and the effects more
durable. And as the means instituted by Christ for the
good of souls, is the erection and maintenance of his
Church, and the supplying of it with an able and pious
Ministry: So it hath been in all ages the care of those
whose hearts have been touched with a sense of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and a fervent desire of the Churches enlargement,
to afford such liberall supplies and encouragements as
might both prepare men for, and support them in the
work of the Ministry. And these are the ends which
have been principally aimed at by all, but all have not
used the same means to those ends, nor are all means
equally effectual: It is therefore our desire in this
Model to make choice of such waies as to us seem
most usefull for the forementioned purposes: And
because the foundation of the Work lies in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the natural parts of such as are designed
that way (a few such being more worth than a farre
greater proportion of other men) it is therefore of
great use, and we shall endeavour that it may be our
great care, to single out such persons to whom God
hath given the most high and promising abilities:
Who, if they be placed under the most learned and
godly Tutors we can finde, and obliged as farre as
possibly we can, to a diligent and eminent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in knowledge of all sorts and solid piety, we
conceive it will be no arrogance humbly to expect a
more then ordinary advantage to the poor Church,
<pb facs="tcp:106184:2"/>
which now, if ever, cals for Teachers of exquisite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;
And because there are some Church-works
of great concernment, which cannot be conveniently
managed by such as are overwhelmed with preaching
work (such as the resolution of weighty doubts
and cases of conscience, the stopping of the mouthes
of gain-sayers, and the like) it must needs be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of great advantage to have some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
exquisitely fit for such works, both in regard of
natural and acquired endowments, who should be set
apart for them, and attend upon them without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction.
The rather, because there are divers men,
peradventure not eminent for preaching gifts, who
being wisely improved, may be very serviceable to
other of the Churches necessities: And these are
the chief intendments of the following Model: Yet,
for as much as there may be divers towardly youths,
of competent parts (though short of the eminency
that some others attain to) and mean condition, who
may be of good use in the Ministerial work, and
seeing the ordinary necessities of the Church are not
to be neglected, especially the condition of <hi>Ireland</hi>
and <hi>Wales,</hi> and some dark parts of <hi>England,</hi> being
so dolefull and dismall, we hope it will be an acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
work to lay in provision in this Model,
whereby fit persons may be sent into those places,
which by reason of their d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stance, many cannot, and
others do not go into: We confesse, as we shall not
be wanting in our prayers and endeavours, as farre
as God shall enable us sincerely and impartially to
look to these ends and waies propounded; so we
cannot but hope in God that the bowels of many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
souls will be refreshed by these means. And
we are confident whoever shall engage their hearts
<pb facs="tcp:106184:3"/>
in this free-will-offering to God, will have no cause
to repent of it, nor shall it be a grief of heart to any
at the last day (when the rust of other mens silver
shall rise up against them to their everlasting confusion)
to have been the happy instruments of enlarging the
Church, and propagating the Gospel, and saving of
souls; and in this life also the generations to come shall
call them blessed.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have here a happy opportunity to offer you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
benefit, by inviting you to an excellent duty.
If receiving be unpleasant to you, how came you to
be rich? If you like it, come while the Market lasts.
Come before Thieves, or Fire, or Souldiers have
seized upon your perishing wealth, come before death hath taken you
from all. You see here that Christ is contented to be your Debtour, at
the usury of a hundred for one, in this world, and in the world to come,
eternal life. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 29. If you are covetous, take this bargain,
for all the world cannot help you to the like for your Commodity: If
you are not <hi>covetous,</hi> you will not be tenacious of your money: The
offer is so fair, and so unmatchable, that I know not what can keep you
from accepting it, unless it be that you dare not trust the word, the
Promise, the Covenant of Christ. And whom then will you trust?
who shall keep your wealth? will you? But who shall keep you then?
will you undertake to keep your selves? Alas, how long? Is God to
be trusted with the sustentation of the whole Creation, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the world, and with the lives of you and all the living,
and with the prospering of your labours, and your daily preservation
and provision? and yet is he not to be trusted with your money? you'l
say you trust God? let us see now that you do not play the Hypocrites?
If you are friends to Christ, you may see in the work here offered to
you, your Masters name, and interest, and honour: It's certainly his
voice that cals you to this adventure, and therefore never make questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your call. If you are friends to your Countrey, now let it be seen:
If you live an hundred years, perhaps you will never have a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to shew it. If you are Protestants and love the Gospel, shew
it by helping to plant and water the Seminaries of the Lord. Perhaps
you cannot dispute for the Truth, or preach for it your selves: But
you can contribute for the maintenance of some to do it: This then is
<pb facs="tcp:106184:4"/>
your work, know it and perform it. You may have a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
without being your selves Prophets. <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. 41. At
least therefore, shew that you love your selves, and that you love your
money better than to lose it, by casting it away upon the flesh, and
leaving it in the world behind you. If you can stay here alwaies with
it, then keep it: I speak to none but those that must die, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
such should be glad to learn the art of sending their wealth to
meet them in another world. If you understand not that giving is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
and that the giver is more beholden, than the beggar, and
that it is for your selves that God commandeth you to give, and that
the more you thus lose, the more you save and gain, you are then unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the reasons of Christianity, and the life of faith. I
hope you are sensible of <hi>Englands</hi> priviledges, above the dark Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans
or Indians, in the freedome of Ordinances, and plenty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
opportunities. And know you not that an opportunity of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
may be as great a mercy to you, as of hearing or praying, and
should be as forwardly and thankefully accepted. He was never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Christian life of doing good, that finds it not the most
sweet and pleasant life. Though we must snatch no unsound consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from our works, but detest the thoughts of making God beholden to
us; yet we must walk in them as his way, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. in which
we are likeliest to meet him: he is likest to God, that doth most good,
and that would do most. This is such an improvement of time and
stock, that you may omit a Prayer, a Sermon, or a Sacrament for it,
rather than omit it: you may violate the rest of a Sabbath to shew
mercy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 4, 5. Your Lord and Master with a special remark
hath set you all this lesson for to study. <hi>Mat. 9. 13. But go ye and
learn, what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice</hi>
And yet such is here the happy combination, that it is mercy and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
because it is mercy for sacrifice, that you are called to. And
doubt not but <hi>with such sacrifice God is well pleased,</hi> Heb. 13. 16.
<hi>Forget not</hi> therefore <hi>to communicate and do good. It is
more blessed to give, than to receive,</hi> Acts 20. 35. For
the nature of the work before you, consider, First, Is it not pity
that so good a breed of wits as <hi>England</hi> is renowned for, should be
starved for want of culture and encouragement? Secondly, Is it not pity
that so many thousands of souls should starve in ignorance, or be poysoned
by seducements, for want of cost to procure a remedy? And what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb facs="tcp:106184:4"/>
that may be saved by the Ministry of such as you maintain, may
blesse God for you as the helpers of their salvation. Thirdly, The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of the Church have of late called Students so young into the
Ministry, that eminent Proficients in Languages, Sciences, Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
&amp;c. grow thin, and are in danger of being worn out, if there be not
some extraordinary helps for chosenwits addicted to these studies. And
what a dishonour, what a losse that would be to us, the Papists would
quickly understand. Fourthly, The barbarous face of the Greek and
other Eastern Churches tels us, what need there is of Learned Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the maintenance and propagation of the Truth. Fifthly,
what abundance of Colledges and Monasteries can the Romanists
maintain, to fill the World with Missionaries of all sorts, which is the
very strength of their Kingdome. And is it not pity that a better
work should be starved through our want of pious charity? and
that Papists should dare us, and we be unfurnished with Champions to
resist them, when we are furnished with so much evidence of truth,
which yet may easily be lost by ill managing! Sixthly, If you are the
servants of Christ, above all, you must now look about you for his
Church and Ministry. For the Devil hath given you so strong an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme,
that he that now sits still, and runs not to his Armes, to help the
Church, is a Traytor, and no true Souldier of Christ. Papists are up,
and Atheists and Infidels and Iewes are up, and abundance of secret
Apostates are up openly reproaching the Ministry, that privately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
Christ and the Scripture, and the life to come, (I know what I
say to be too true) Quakers are up, and all the prophane as far as
they dare: And shall not we be up to further that Gospel and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Church of Christ, which so many bands of the Prince of
darknesse, are armed to assault. Let us discourage the Devil; by
making an advantage of his assaults. Let him see that we never
do so much for Christ and the Church, as when he assaulteth
them with the fiercest or cunningest malignity. He that hath
not so publick a spirit, as to value the welfare of the Church,
and the souls of men, before the fulnesse of his own estate, may go
away sorrowfull from Christ (as <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 23, 24.) but a true Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
he cannot be. It would make a mans heart ake to think of the
dark state of the world, for want of Preachers. Were it but the state
of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> it should move us to compassion. And now
I offer it to your sober thoughts, as to men that are going to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb facs="tcp:106184:5"/>
for their Talents, whether you have a better way to dispose
of your money, and a way that will be more comfortable to you at
death and judgement. I would not have you unmercifull to your
children: but if you think you may not lawfully alienate any of your
Estates from them, you are far from the mind of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that sold all and laid it at the Apostles feet. If you ask, why
we leave you not to your selves to be charitable where you see cause;
I answer, First, there is so much difficulty in every good work, even
in giving so as to make the best of it, that you should be thankefull
to those that will help to facilitate it. Secondly, Great works must
have many hands. Thirdly, Conjunction engageth and encourageth,
and draws on those in the company, that else would lag behind. What
need we else associate for our Ministerial works of Instruction, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
&amp;c. and leave not every Minister to himself: In company we
go more chearfully, easily, regularly and prevalently. And should
you not associate also in your duties?</p>
            <p>Well Gentlemen, seeing it is undoubted that the work before you is
of great importance to the honour of Christ, to the welfare of the
Church, to the Protestant Religion, to the souls of thousands, and
to your own everlasting benefit, take heed how you refuse to do your
best, lest God distrain on you before you are aware, and then hold it
or your souls if you can. And say not but you were warned by a
friend that would have had you have saved your money and your souls,

               <p>§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat they, who through their affection to Gods
glory and the Churches good, in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

contribute to this work, be intreited to signifie
their desires by way of subscription, that so it
may be more certain in it self, and more visible and exemplary
to others.</p>
               <p>§ 2. And because subscriptions of this nature, though happily
begun, have heretofore failed, lest it should happen so in this
case (whereby the whole design would be frustrated, and Youth<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of excellent parts, hopefully planted at the University, forced to
remove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> besides many other inconveniencies) we do earnestly
desire that God would stir up the hearts of those, whose: Estates
will bear it, to subscribe for eight years or for more, or for ever,
which we shall look on as a noble and eminent act of charity,
and which present and future ages may have cause to blesse God
for, and as the most proper and only certain course to promote
the intended design, and to prevent the forementioned mischiefs:
Yet if any shall contribute any thing upon other terms, we judge
it a very acceptable service, and we hope it will occasion thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to God on their behalf.</p>
               <p>§. 3. That the Name of every Contributer be fairly written
in a Book of Velume appointed for the purpose, together with
the summe which it shall please him to contribute to his Work.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Trustees.</head>
               <p>§. 1. THat the mony collected be disposed of, and the election
of Schollars made by sixty Trustees, whereof 36 to be
Gentlemen or Citizens of eminency, and 24 to be Ministers in
or within five miles of the City of <hi>London,</hi> of which number any
seven shall make a Quorum, in ordinary cases, whereof three to
be Ministers.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And because it is of great importance to the good of the
work, that there be a special inspection into it upon the place, it
is thought fit that there be seven Trustees chosen for each Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
who shall be intreated to take notice of the proficiency
and deportment of the exhibitioners in the University.</p>
               <p>§. 3. That the Trustees proceed in all things without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as they shall judge best for the publick good, and suffer not
themselves to be byassed from it by any favours or recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whatsoever: And particularly that in the election of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
or Trustees, when there are any vacancies, the Trustees
declare themselves, that they will according to their Trust proceed
therein with all fidelity and integrity: And that the Clerk put
the Chairman in mind of it.</p>
               <p>§. 4. That when any one of the Trustees dies, or refuseth to
act further in the businesse, or removeth ten miles from <hi>London,</hi>
or by the rest of the Trustees is judged to deserve dismission from
his Trust, the rest of the Trustees, or any 7 of them, whereof
3 shall be Ministers (notice being given to the Trustees of the
meeting, and of the end of it) being met together, proceed to
chuse another: And that no Trustee be compleatly chosen at one
meeting, but that he be nominated one meeting, and (if they
see fit) chosen the next meeting: And that they chuse one whom
for wisdom, candor, activity, publick-spiritednesse, integrity,
affection to Religion and Learning, and other necessary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
they judge fit for the work: And that they chuse a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
in the room of a Minister; and upon the vacancy of one
who is no Minister, that they chuse one who is no Minister.</p>

one of themselves being a Minister, who shall be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from time to time for the year ensuing, to appoint meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

Treasurer (being a person of unquestionable fidelity) from year
to year: And that the Treasurers or Collectors discharge shall
be sufficient to any that shall pay the money: And that the
Treasurer be accountable once a quarter to the Trustees, or any
seven of them (a meeting being called) whereof three to be
Ministers: And that the Treasurer shall not dispose of any of
the monies, but according to the direction of the Trustees or any
seven of them (three being Ministers) at a general meeting
assembled.</p>
               <p>§. 3. That a Clerk be chosen to be present at all meetings, to
draw and enter all Orders made by the Trustees, and keep the
Books, and write such things as are necessary, as also a Collector
to gather in the monies, and to call meetings and do other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

granted, be chosen out of the University, or out of
Schools, as the Trustees from time to time shall judge most fit,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106184:7"/>
and that strict enquiry and diligent examination be made, and
all possible care used that fit persons be chosen, and that the
Election be made by seven of the Trustees at the least, whereof
three to be Ministers, notice being given to the Trustees of the
meeting, and of the end of it. And that no Schollers hereafter
shall be chosen, but such as have been personally and diligently
examined by three at least, being either of the Trustees in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
(who are Schollers) or of the University Trustees, or of
such as shall be chosen and desired by the Trustees to examine
Candidates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and attested by their hands. And that no
Certificate be owned from the Universities, but such as comes
from known persons, or from such persons as some of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
Trustees shall attest to.</p>
               <p>§. 2. That the Schollers to be chosen, be of Godly life, or at
the least, hopeful for Godlinesse, of eminent parts, of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
disposition, and such as are poor, or have not a sufficient
maintenance any other way: That not only the pregnancy, but
the solidity of their parts be observed. And that a speciall regard
be had to Godlinesse.</p>
               <p>§. 3. And, although our great aim in this work be, the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of Schollers of eminent parts and learning, and the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the Church with choyce Ministers, and such, as through
Gods blessing may be pillars of the Church; yet because the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
necessities of the Church also are to be provided for, and
the sad condition of dark corners, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and
several parts of <hi>England</hi> cries loud for out assistance; the Trustees
therefore may (after provision made for the fore-mentioned
ends, as far as they shall think fit) chuse some Schollers of
Godly life, and good parts (though it may be their parts rise not
to that eminency which some others attain to) in order to the
supply of such desolate and necessitous places and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>§. 4. That the exhibitions be generally given to such as intend
the Ministry, and direct their studies that way; yet so, as that
the Trustees may upon weighty reasons and sparingly dispose of
some of them, to such, as, though not intending the Ministry,
may be other waies eminently serviceable to the Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <p>

§. 5. And whereas divers Schollers after four years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the Universitie, being raised to an higher degree, which
they cannot support, are forced to remove and betake themselves
to Schools or to enter into the Ministry, through necessity,
raw and unfurnished, to their own perpetual discouragement,
and to the great mischief of the Church; that a special regard be
had to such of them as during their continuance, have given
the best proof of their parts, learning and godlinesse, and they
be enabled to continue four years after their degree of Batchelor,
whereby they may be solemnly prepared and well fitted for that
weighty work.</p>

they be tied to special exercises in those things as shall be

with. And that when the Trustees shall think fit, two or three
be picked out of the Students to come up to <hi>London</hi> (their charges

another the Civilian, another the Polemical Divine (one
or more if need be) another the practical and casuisticall Divine,
another well vers'd in all parts of Learning: And that each of
these employ themselves (when occasion shall require, and the
Trustees, reasonably desire) in such works as shall be usefull and
necessary: And that they have such allowances as the Trustees
shall judge fit, and as the excellency of their parts and the nature
of their work shall require. Or, if it be not thought expedient
to maintain persons constantly for each of these, that any person
or persons, be employed in any work which shall appear to be of
great concernment and usefulnesse to the publick good, and for
which he or they are eminently fit, who shall have such encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement

            <head>A word to the Rich, that desire to give up
their Account with comfort.</head>
            <p>SUffer I beseech you one word of exhortation, and with
attention read a few lines which may be of everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to you. I will suppose I speak not to <hi>Atheists,</hi> but
to such as are possest with a belief of an eternal estate of infinite
happinesse or misery: not to fools, but to wise men who would
not wilfully neglect any thing, which is necessary to secure
them from the wrath to come. It is also notoriously known,
that the wilful continuance in the neglect of any one evident
duty; or the commission of any manifest sin is sufficient to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a man to damnation, notwithstanding any professions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or practises whatsoever: You cannot but know that many
perish eternally, not for any grosse wickednesse visible to the
world, but for slie and secret and unobserved omission sins,
and that these are the only sins which our Saviour formes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
against in that famous representation of the last judgment,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. And amongst those duties which men are most prone
to neglect, are those which are difficult and costly and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
which made Christ pronounce it so hard for a rich man
to enter into the Kingdome of heaven: And therefore you that
are rich had need double your diligence to make your calling
and election sure. And truly it is an unspeakable happinesse
(if the Lord give you hearts to consider it) that your riches
wisely managed, may afford you a special and eminent evidence
and assurance of Gods love, and your own future happinesse;
forasmuch as if you freely lay out those riches that God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
given you, for his glory, and the Churches good, it may
be a notable and sound discovery of a lively faith, (which can
part with present comforts in hopes of those future and unseen
consolations) a fervent love to God and the brethren, a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to part with all for Christ, and a serious and true desire of
salvation: As on the other side, it is a token of perdition, when
a mans heart is glued to his riches, and the present evil world,
when a man is so destitute of charity, that rather than part with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106184:10"/>
his riches, he will suffer, bodies and soules to perish, and the
glory of God to be turned into shame; I beseech you therefore
by the bowels of God have compassion upon your immortal
souls, make you friends of the Mammon of unrighteousnesse,
throw not your selves overboard to preserve your riches, from
which you can expect no other requital, but this, that the rust
of them shall rise up in judgment against you at the last day: and
this duty I may the more boldly exhort you to, because, if you
make use of your reason, you will find the performance of it
is no way disadvantageous to you: for, as you will gain this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
advantage, besides eternal salvation, that, that portion of
your estates which you lay out for God, will be a means to sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
and secure all the rest to you and your posterity, so, by the
doing of it you will lose nothing of substance, seeing that is most
true and evident by daily experience which our Saviour saith;
That the comfort of a mans life consisteth not in the abundance
of what he possesseth. For what are riches, but for use, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which a mans chest hath as much good by his riches as he;
and how can a man use them, but for his pleasure or credit, or
posterity, or the like? and who knowes not that many discreet
men of competent estates between want and affluence enjoy
more real pleasure in their estates, than they that have ten times
a larger portion? and if a man look to his credit, let any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
man judge, whether it more advanceth a mans reputation,
sordidly to hoard up his riches to the dishonour of Religion, his
own shame and contempt (whereby he live; lamented, and dies
desired) or generously to lay them out in such waies as not only
procure him favour with God, but respect from men here, and
at last a Crown of glory that fades not away? and if a man aims
at posterity, methinks this City hath afforded sufficient experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to convince any ingenuous man, that the leaving of vast
estates to children, doth commonly betray them not onely to
the greatest wickednesses, but also to manifold miseries, which
they that carry their sailes lower, and whose estates are
nearer the golden Mediocrity are preserved from: I may added
to all this that divers of you in this City may say with <hi>Iacob,</hi> with
may staffe I came over <hi>Iordan,</hi> and now God hath made me two
bands. That God that hath brought down others, hath exalted
you, that God that hath impoverished others, hath enriched you,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106184:11"/>
and therefore, if others owe their thousands to God, surely you
owe your ten thousands. Remember I beseech you, that hand
that gave you your estates, can recal them when he pleaseth, and
if you deny him the interest, he can revoke the principal. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you will not alwaies have such opportunities: Ere long you
and the poorest wretch must be upon the same terms, now you
have an advantage over them, and a means to do God more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
service: I shall trouble you no further, but only this, lay out
your estates, but do it freely, not grudgingly, do it liberally, not
sparingly: I shall not here determine that Question, whether
God expects a tenth part of your estates to be employed in his
service, and for publick good. But thus much I may safely say,
that where God sows liberally, he expects to reap liberally. And
as Gods Ministration to us under the Gospel doth exceed the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Ministration, so I know no reason why our Ministration to
God from our superfluities should not exceed theirs under the
Law: And however men can easily deceive themselves here in
things which concern their profit, yet I doubt not when men
shall at last come to make a review of all their actions, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
will justly condemn them, not only for the total neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of such duties, but also for the not doing of them in a fit
and full proportion: For this particular occasion, I shall say
nothing more than what is said in the Preface, and in these
other annexed Papers: Consider what hath been said, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it comes from one whose design is not his own profit,
(nor to lay a yoke upon you which he will not take upon his
own shoulders) but meerly that God may be glorified, and
that, at that last day, fruit may abound to your account.</p>

            <head>An Answer to some Objections which
may be raised against this Work.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>OBject.</hi> 1. This Designe is needlesse: Universities
are for this purpose, What is all that meanes given
there for, but to fit men for the Ministry?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. So great is the scarcity of able and godly
Ministers in the Nation, comparatively to the many places
which are destitute of such (as all judicious persons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve)
that it is a vain thing to expect a supply of the
Churches necessities in an ordinary way: We see by
experience, that although of late years the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have sent forth divers very hopefull persons into the
Ministry, and although besides the ordinary allowances
for Students there, divers exhibitions have been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by wel-willers to Religion and Learning, yet, all
this not withstanding, there is still a great famine of the
Word in divers places; especially in <hi>Ireland, Wales,
&amp;c.</hi> which are not so likely to be supplied, and which
are here in a special manner provided for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The main design of this <hi>Model</hi> is not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to send forth Ministers, but to endeavour to send
forth eminent Ministers; and whereas Universities are
and must needs be (nor doth it in the least reflect dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
upon them) like Lotteries, whither Students
of all sorts come, some of good parts, and some of
mean parts, and from whence (through the negligence
of Students, and their forwardnesse in entring into the
Ministry) divers come into the Ministry much unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
to the grief and scandal of their University-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106184:12"/>
here is a more certain course, care being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
1. To select choice wits. 2. To oblige them to
a sufficient continuance, as also to extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Good designes are generally perverted
and abused to other ends than they were intended, and so
will this in all probability degenerate into a businesse of
faction and partiality, and favour and friendship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We can neither foresee nor prevent all
possible abuses, and much lesse all jealous surmises; but
thus much is plain, that we are to do our duty, and to
referre events to Gods Providence, and however mens
benevolences may be abused hereafter, contrary to their
desires and intentions, yet God will accept of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
ends, and no lesse reward them than if they hid been
never so religiously used.</p>
            <p>2. Here is abundant care taken to prevent partiality:
The execution of it is committed to divers persons of
different perswasions, of known integrity, wisdome and
godlinesse; and care is also taken that when any die,
there be a substitution of such other men in their places,
and the Trustees are engaged, not onely by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
but by their judgements and interect to choose such
men as themselves.</p>
            <p>3. The Feoffees, as they now are, so they will for
ever be obliged to manage this businesse with all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
for the encouragement of lads of all parties (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be true to the interests of Learning and real piety)
not onely because they are conscientiously enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to it, but also, because their interest and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the work will constantly oblige them to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
seeing if once partiality be observed in it, it will not only
reflect upon the Trustees, but also bring the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
into disrepute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106184:12"/>
4. This objection strikes at all lasting good works,
for how can a man settle any thing for any good work,
but it may be abused; so that the effect of this objection
should be not to prevent the doing of good works, but
to make men cautelous how to do them in as safe a way
as may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. It is better for a man to see with his own
eyes, and to do with his own hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But then there is one doubt whether he can
get any to put in good security that he shall enjoy his
eyes and hands for ever, or else (if he be able and willing
to settle something for ever) it must come into other
mens hands, and therefore it is better to commit it to
other mens hands while he lives, and may observe how
they use it, than to commit it to them after his decease,
of whom he had not experience in that kind.</p>
            <p>2. For the generality of Contributers to such works
it may be said without arrogancie, it is likely to be farre
better managed by a conjunction of heads and hands of
wise, and honest, and learned men for the glory of God,
and the good of the Church, than can be expected from
one man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plus vident oculi quam oculus,</hi> and as those small
sprinklings of water which signifie little when they are
asunder, being united together into one River are very
considerable and effectuall to divers excellent uses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so those Contributions which being managed singly
and dividedly are not so eminently useful, when they are
united together, prove of great influence for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
good: and moreover, he that contributes in such a
common way as this, doth not onely an excellent piece
of service himself, but also drawes others along with
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106184:13"/>
FOr those Gentlemen or others in the Countrey who
shal be pleased to contribute, although we shall whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave them to themselves to give what they please, and
in what way they please, and shall thankfully accept any
thing given upon any termes, nor do we desire this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
should be burthensome to any, yet we humbly offer
to their consideration, that it will be a most excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and most rarely useful for any (who can do it) to
settle what they give, for ever, though it be in a lesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
both because it is in it self likely to bring forth
more fruit, and because it will be a good encouragement
to others to contribute when they see a solid foundation
laid which is likely to continue: And we hope they will
not think it a wrong to their children to alienate some
small proportion from them to the more immediate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, but rather a special meanes to procure a
blessing from God upon the rest of their estates both to
them and to their posterity.</p>
            <p>If it shall please God to put it into the mind of any to
contribute, if they signify their desires to any of the
Trustees, especially to any of the Ministers, they may
receive further information and direction as to any of the
particulars.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONIAL from some
Oxford DOCTORS.</head>
            <p>THE great usefulnesse of humane Learning and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
education for the Ministers of the Gospel
hath been abundantly evidenced, both from the powerful
and happy influence of Ministers so qualified, in the
Reformation of Religion, from the bondage and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Popery, and also from the miserable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the want and neglect thereof in persons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the work of the Ministry: Besides those more
noble infusions of Grace, there are two things of great
necessity for the profitable discharge of the Ministerial
work; to wit, a sufficiency of natural endowments,
and acquired abilities. And it is the conjunction of these
which throughly furnish the man of God unto every
good work. We cannot therefore, but exceedingly
approve of, and heartily blesse God for that late design
undertaken, and so considerably carried on through
Gods blessing by divers persons, for the encouragement
of poor Scholars of greatest abilities and piety in the
Universities: The rather, because we have frequently,
with sad hearts, observed the miscarriage of persons of
great hopes and eminent parts, through want of those
means and helps which are necessary: And we heartily
recommend it unto all the lovers of Learning and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
as that which (by Gods blessing) is likely
to prove of singular use, for the quickning of diligence,
and provoking of emulation, and the growth of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106184:14"/>
and piety: Nor do we know, how any, whom
God hath enriched with talents for such a service, can
lay them out to better advantage, than in such a way
as this: And for the better encouragement of those
whose hearts God shall encline to this pious work, we,
whose names are here under-written, having knowledge
of divers of the Trustees, and having had experience of
the management thereof, hold our selves bound in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to give this testimony, unto those Gentlemen, to
whose trust it is committed; that to the best of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
it hath been faithfully discharged according
to the real worth of persons, without respect to parties:
And it is sufficiently known, that there are divers Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
already chosen by them in the Universities, who
are persons of singular abilities, and of pious inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whose poverty had exposed them to many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
and deprived the Church of that great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
(which we comfortably hope for from them) if they
had not been relieved by such seasonable succours. And
we are further considently perswaded, that as it hath been
for the time past, so it will be for the future, the care of
the Trustees, to discharge that trust reposed in them,
with all fidelity and conformably to their proposals and
Declarations.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONIAL from some Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
DOCTORS and others.</head>
            <p>AS we cannot but sadly resent and lay to heart the
many and great mischiefs, which have befallen the
Church of God, through the miscarriage of such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
crude and unfurnished for so weighty an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
have engaged themselves in the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry:
So we cannot but impute them in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to the want of meanes for subsistence at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities;
whereby such persons have been untimely taken
from those breasts and fountaines, whence by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
use of the helps there afforded, they might have
been stored with sound and well-digested knowledge,
and thereby have not only prevented those difficulties
and temptations, which their own ungroundednesse doth
often expose them to, but also become eminently ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in the Church of Christ, The consideration
whereof affords us abundant occasion of blessing and
praising God, for his goodnesse to his Church, as in
continuing these Schooles of Learning, heretofore found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and established, so also in these late supplies by men
of publick Spirits conferred in way of exhibition, for the
further encouragement and support of hopeful Students
in the Universities. Which good and pious design, we
do with thankfulnesse rejoyce to see so far already put in
execution, as that divers hopeful plants are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
and made to flourish in these fruitful Nurseries,
who else for want of so seasonable a supply, might soon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106184:15"/>
have been withered and parched up, or constrained to
an unseasonable remove, to their own and the Churches
exceeding prejudice and disadvantage.</p>
            <p>But although there be a considerable number already
chosen, and made participants of this beneficence, yet
are there also many others still among us, truly deserving
and really needing the like encouragement; which we
doubt not but many will be the more ready and willing
to promote, when they shall together with us, observe
these hopeful beginnings, which promise (through the
blessing of God upon them) a plentiful harvest to be reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in due season. For we can truly testifie that (according
to the best of our observation) this matter hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to managed, &amp; the election of Scholars made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their parts, piety and poverty, with much faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and impartiality; as we hope also it will be carried
on for the time to come.</p>

            <p>IF it shall please any to settle somthing for ever they
may conveniently do it in this way which hath been
propounded to, and approved by skilful Lawyers. They
may single out three or four of the Trustees whom they
can most confide in, and make them special Trustees,
and when any one of them dies, appoint the other three
to chuse another in his place, and may make all the rest
of the Trustees overseers, and in case those four Trustees
fail, that then it shall fall to all the rest of the Trustees,
and in case they fail, then it shall fall to any Colledge or
Company (whom the Doner shall please to nominate)
to be disposed of, according to the Modell: And in
case it be perverted or alienated to any other use, then
it revert to his heirs, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>VVHereas it hath been suggested by divers &amp; was
supposed by some of the Trustees, that the
present settlement of this trust was not Legal (not being
by way of Corporation) nor perpetual, it was agreed by
the Trustees that some very able Lawyers should be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with; which accordingly was done, and the result
of their discourse was this: That there were two waies
for the selting of such a trust, frequently practised among
us, and both unquestionably Legal; the one by way of
Corporation, the other by way of Feofment, in which
latter way we are for the present setled, and in which
way some Hospitals, &amp;c, are setled. This being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Principle in Law and Reason, that it is lawful
for any man to give what he will, to whom he will, for
what uses he will, unlesse it be to an use prohibited by
Law, such as this is confessed not to be.</p>

            <head>An Account of the Scholars already Chosen.</head>
            <p>IN order to the practise of the things proposed in the
Modell, three of the Trustees, to wit, Mr. <hi>Manton;</hi>
Mr. <hi>Thomas Iacomb,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> were by the rest of
the Trustees sent to the two Universities, to advise with
the Doctors the Trustees there, and to settle the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which was done, and divers persons of known
ability and fidelity were desired, and did willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to take upon them the businesse of examination of
all such poor Scholar as did propose themselves to trial:
Upon which, divers persons of great hopes, were then
and have been since examined: And out of them, such
as gave the best satisfaction for Parts and Learning, and
had the best report for Piety, were selected: And two
and twenty are already chosen in each University; It
being resolved to carry an equal respect to both Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities:
Of whom some were through necessity already
gone from the University, and now to their great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and (we hope) the Churches great good, are setled
again: Others were about to leave it, others forced
much to discontinue, and all much discouraged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
by those pressing wants and difficulties they were
overwhelmed with.</p>
