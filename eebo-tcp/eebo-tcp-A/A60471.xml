         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DESIGNED END
TO THE
Socinian Controverſy.</head>
         <div type="part">
            <head>That there is a God.</head>
            <p>THAT there is ſuch a Being as God,
(by which is meant one Eternal
Mind, Eſſence or ſpiritual Power,
who is the Original and firſt Cauſe
of all other Beings beſides) is manifeſt; for 'tis
not poſſible that any other Being whatſoever
could give a Being to it ſelf: Certainly nothing
can be more abſurd than to imagine that a thing
can act any ways towards its own Production
before it is.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows, that every one of theſe
Beings is but the real Effect of this firſt Cauſe
that had a Being before it; and this firſt Cauſe
of neceſſity muſt have been Eternal, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Beginning: ſince had there been once no
kind of Being at all, there then could never
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58644:4"/>
have been ſuch a Being as God, no nor any other
Being beſides; for doubtleſs, of nothing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be produc'd.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>That this God is but one in Nature
or Eſſence.</head>
            <p>And as 'tis thus plain that there is a God, ſo
'tis utterly impoſſible that there can be any more
than one God: for whoever is truly God,
muſt be abſolutely Infinite or Immenſe; that is,
<hi>His Divine Eſſence muſt be boundleſs, and fill
all that endleſs and inconceivable Space that is
without or beyond the Limits of this World, as
well as this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 'tis impoſſible that any Being whatever
can <hi>in any reſpect be greater than God is, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him;</hi> for then he himſelf could not be truly
Infinite, nor excel in all Perfections. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Eſſence therefore of God is Infinite, and
in Extent is without Bounds; and <hi>'tis ſelf-evidently
impoſſible for two or more infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Beings to ſubſiſt together:</hi> which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
by Conſequence, that God can be but
one as to his Divine Eſſence or Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as right Reaſon does plainly teach this
Truth, ſo do the Scriptures as evidently declare
the ſame: to inſtance in a few,</hi>—The Lord he is
God, there is none elſe beſides him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 35.
See now that I, even I am he, and there is no God
with me, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39. There is none like thee,
neither is there any God beſides thee, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58644:4"/>
20. I am the firſt, and I am the laſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
methere is no God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 6. We know that
an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is
none other God but one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4.—To us
there is but one God, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 6. I might add
a great Number of other Texts that ſpeak to
the very ſame purpoſe, but I think 'tis needleſs
in a Caſe ſo plain.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>That this one true God is but one
in Perſon.</head>
            <p>Now as 'tis thus plain, that God is but one,
as to his Nature or Eſſence; ſo 'tis evident like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that he can in no Senſe be any more than
<hi>one in Perſon:</hi> for if, as ſome affirm, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature did contain in it ſeveral Perſons, as
does the humane Nature, then each of thoſe
muſt be <hi>truly Immenſe, truly Almighty,</hi> and <hi>truly
moſt Wiſe,</hi> elſe they could not each of them be
truly God, <hi>(as ſome have unwarily aſſerted, and
the Trinitarian Notion ſuppoſes);</hi> for whoever is
truly God, muſt be every way thus qualified in
all Reſpects.</p>
            <p>For if that Perſon that is ſuppoſed to be God,
<hi>be not truly immenſe,</hi> then ſome other Being of
neceſſity muſt be greater than he; for whoever
is not Infinite, muſt be bounded by ſome other
Being, which in that reſpect does truly ſurpaſs
that bounded Being in Greatneſs: But (as I
ſaid before) <hi>nothing can in any kind or reſpect
whatſoever be greater than God is,</hi> or contain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58644:5"/>
him; and by Conſequence he alone is truly
Immenſe.</p>
            <p>The Perſon that is truly God, muſt be alſo
<hi>Almighty;</hi> that is, he muſt be able to do more
than any, or than all other Beings together can
do: for doubtleſs none is the moſt High, but he
that in Might and Strength does tranſcend all
others. <hi>Touching the Almighty,</hi> ſays <hi>Job, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
in Power,</hi> ch. 37. 28.</p>
            <p>The Perſon alſo that is truly God, muſt be
moſt wiſe and knowing: 'Tis doubtleſs a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
eſſential to the true God, to know more
than any other Being beſides can know: <hi>Of that
Day and Hour,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>knoweth no
Man, no not the Angels which are in Heaven,
neither the Son, but the Father only;</hi> Matth. 24.
36. Mar. 13. 32.</p>
            <p>Now if that Perſon who is truly God, muſt
be thus Immenſe in his Perſon, Almighty in
his Power, and moſt Wiſe in his Knowledg;
then it follows by direct Conſequence, that 'tis
impoſſible for more than one Perſon to be truly
God: for nothing can be more abſurd, than to
believe or affirm, that two or three diſtinct Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſuch as all perſonal Beings are, can be each
of them unlimited, as to the extent of their
personal Beings; can be each of them able to
do more than the reſt can do, or that each of
them can know more than the others know.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe, for Inſtance, two ſuch Beings as <hi>A</hi>
and <hi>B:</hi> Now if the Perſon of <hi>A</hi> can do more
than the Perſon of <hi>B,</hi> then the Perſon of <hi>B</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58644:5"/>
do more than the Perſon of <hi>A;</hi> for if he
could, then would not <hi>A</hi> be able to do more
than <hi>B,</hi> and by Conſequence he could not be
Almighty.</p>
            <p>Again, if the Perſon of <hi>A</hi> be moſt wiſe, and
knows more than the Perſon of <hi>B,</hi> then <hi>B</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know more than <hi>A;</hi> for if he did, then
would not <hi>A</hi> know more than <hi>B,</hi> and ſo by
Conſequence would not be moſt wiſe: which
evidently demonſtrates, that no more than one
Perſon can be truly God, ſince no more than
one can be truly Infinite in all theſe afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Divine Perfections.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>That this one Perſon who is truly God,
is him only who is the Father of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis undeniably evident from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that</hi> the God of <hi>Iſrael, or</hi> the Lord of
Hoſts, <hi>is the only true God: for thus it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
Thou art God, and thou alone, of all the
Kingdoms of the Earth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 15. There
is none like thee, neither is there any God beſides
thee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 20. Thou art God alone,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 10. Beſides me there is no God, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
44. 6. I am God, and there is none elſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.
9. Thou ſhalt know no other God but me, <hi>Hoſ.
13. 4. Now as this is plain beyond Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
ſo do all Chriſtians generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
that the God here mentioned was him</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58644:6"/>
only who afterwards was called the Father of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the New Teſtament no Truth is more
fully and plainly expreſs'd than this is: thus
ſays our Lord himſelf,</hi> Father,—This is Life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
to know thee the only true God, <hi>Joh. 17.
1, 3. The ſame do his Apoſtles affirm;</hi> Bleſſed
be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. Bleſſed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. With one
Mind and one Mouth glorify God, even the Father
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 6. We give
Thanks to God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 3. He ſhall deliver up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to God, even the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24.
Therewith bleſs we God, even the Father, <hi>Jam.</hi>
3. 9. To us there is but one God, the Father,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
            <p>Now it is impoſſible that any one Article of
the Chriſtian Faith can be more fully and plainly
expreſs'd in Scripture than this is; the Words
can be underſtood in no other Senſe than what
at the firſt ſight they do plainly ſignify, and they
give the moſt ſatisfying Anſwer that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any one that ſhall ask who God is, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he is only that moſt Divine Perſon
who is the Father of Jeſus Chriſt: And if in
this caſe plain Scripture is not to be relied on,
I ſee not of what great Uſe our Bibles can be
to us.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58644:6"/>
            <head>Yet this ſo plain and evident Truth is
commonly denied.</head>
            <p>For a very great Number of profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
do notwithſtanding believe, that in the
Godhead there be indeed more Perſons than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one; and that Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God,
is God alſo as well as his Father. But of this
Error the former Arguments are ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them: for if <hi>none be God but the Father of
Chriſt,</hi> then cannot the Son be truly God alſo,
<hi>ſince he in no Senſe whatever can be ſaid to be the
Father of Chriſt,</hi> that is, of himſelf.</p>
            <p>And certainly if Men would reſolve faithfully
to make uſe but of common Senſe and common
Honeſty, they could not but be convinced of the
Abſurdity of this Opinion, by only reading ſo
often as they do in the New Teſtament of Jeſus
Chriſt his being <hi>the Son of God:</hi> for how can
he be God himſelf, who truly is no other than
the Son of God? If he be the Son only, then
'tis plain that he is not the Father alſo, who
alone is God: for 'tis impoſſible, according to
the Notion we have of Sons, for any Being
whatever to be the Son of himſelf. No under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Man, when at any time he hears men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is, God moſt high.</p>

         <div type="part">
            <head>Chriſt not God, becauſe what he does is

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58644:7"/>
Joh. 5. 30. <hi>All Power is given unto me both in

all kind of Divine Dignity and Excellency,

be in any Senſe ſaid to receive them of another.</p>
            <p>But of our Lord it is recorded, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>
               <hi>Is he able to ſave the World? To this Power
he was raiſed by God:</hi> Him hath God exalted to
be a Prince and a Saviour, <hi>Acts 5. 31. Can he
give Power to Believers to become the Sons of
God? This Power he alſo has received:</hi> Thou

given him, <hi>Joh. 17. 2. Has he Power to raiſe
from the dead? Even this Power alſo he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:</hi>
As the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo
hath he given to the Son to have Life in himſelf,
<hi>Joh. 5. 26. Has he Power to judg the World?
'Tis God that does enable him to do this:</hi> This

            <p>Moreover, 'tis thus ſaid, <hi>The Glory which thou
haſt given me, I have given them,</hi> Joh. 17. 22.
<hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath
appointed unto me,</hi> Luke 22. 29. <hi>The God of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath put all things under his

ſtrangely upon their own Underſtandings, that
can (unrequired by the Goſpel) believe him to

         <div type="part">
            <head>Chriſt not God, becauſe God and He are

            <p>This Conſideration alone of it ſelf is a very
ſtrong Argument, to prove our Lord Chriſt not
to be really and truly God, ſince he is every
where ſpoken of as a Perſon that differs as much
from God, as a noble Subject differs from his
Prince or King. Thus 'tis ſaid of him, that
<hi>God anointed him,</hi> Acts 10. 38. That he <hi>offered

him from the Dead,</hi> Acts 2. 24. That he was

God,</hi> Joh. 20. 17. That he <hi>ſits at God's right

            <p>I might collect a very great Number of other
Places that ſpeak to the very ſame purpoſe, all
which do evidently demonſtrate, that the true
God is not Jeſus Chriſt: for if Jeſus were <hi>ſent
of God,</hi> and <hi>raiſed up from the Dead by God,</hi> and
<hi>ſits now at God's right Hand,</hi> &amp;c. then 'tis
plain, that there is as great a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

            <head>Of that Account which the Scriptures
give of the Perſon of Chriſt.</head>
            <p>As from what has been ſaid before, it appears
very plainly what kind of Perſon Chriſt our
Lord is not; ſo 'twill be likewiſe neceſſary to
ſhew what the Scriptures do declare concerning
him as to what he is. Now if we conſider
well the general Scope and Tendency of thoſe
ſacred Writings, we ſhall perceive very plainly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58644:9"/>
that Chriſt, or the Meſſiah, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
was really to be of the ſame Nature with
them, which he came to redeem; that as <hi>by
Man came Death,</hi> ſo <hi>by Man might come alſo
the Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 'Twas
by the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> that the <hi>Serpent's
Head was bruiſed,</hi> Gen. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To</hi> Abraham <hi>the Promiſe was made, that</hi> in
him and in his Seed all the Nations of the Earth
ſhould be bleſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 14. Moſes <hi>tells the
Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that</hi> the Lord their God ſhould
raiſe up unto them a Prophet like unto him, <hi>Deut.</hi>
8. 15. Of this Man's Seed, <hi>(namely</hi> David<hi>'s)
saith St.</hi> Paul, hath God raiſed up unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> a
Saviour, Jeſus; <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 23. In the Fulneſs of
time God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman,
<hi>Gal. 4. 4. From all which Places 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that as to the perſonal Nature of Chriſt,
he is the ſame as were thoſe humane Anceſtors
from whom he did lineally deſcend;</hi> In all
things he was like unto his Brethren, except in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sinner; <hi>Heb. 2. 17. Heb.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And accordingly we find him almoſt every
where mentioned by that plain Denomination
and Term of</hi> A MAN; Ye ſeek <hi>(ſaith he
himſelf)</hi> to kill me, A MAN who hath told you
the Truth which I have heard of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 40.
After me cometh A MAN that is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 30. Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> A MAN
approved of God by Wonders and Signs which God
did by him, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38. He hath appointed a
Day in the which he will judg the World in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58644:9"/>
by THAT MAN whom he hath ordained,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. There is one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
between God and Men, THE MAN Chriſt
Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. But THIS MAN, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 7. But THIS MAN, after
he had once offered one Sacrifice for Sins for ever,
ſat down at the right Hand of God, <hi>Heb. 10. 12.
I could name a Multitude of others, but I think
it is needleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to me 'tis ſtrange that any ſhould ſo
much as imagine that the believing and aſſerting
of Chriſt to be truly an humane Perſon, ſhould
derogate from his true Honour and Dignity,
when the Goſpel does ſo frequently aſſert him
to be ſuch; whereas on the contrary, 'tis not
ſaid ſo much as once, that he is God moſt high,
or that he is one of that ſacred Three which do
conſtitute or make up the true Godhead: Theſe
Unſcriptural Titles are derived only from the

            <head>The Primitive Confeſſions concerning

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58644:10"/>
as ſome have taught in after-times. All
that thoſe firſt Confeſſions do contain was this,
that <hi>he was the Chriſt, the Son of God, and the
Saviour of the World,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was the Faith of</hi> Martha; She ſaid unto
him, Yea Lord, I believe that thou art the Chriſt,
the Son of God, that ſhould come into the World,
<hi>John 11. 27. This was St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Faith,</hi> Thou
art Chriſt the Son of the living God, <hi>Mat. 16. 16.
This was the Eunuch's Faith,</hi> I believe that
Chriſt is the Son of God, <hi>Acts 8. 37. This was
the Faith of the Mariners;</hi> Of a Truth thou art
the Son of God, <hi>Mat. 14. 33. And the Faith of</hi>

<hi>John</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> is alſo ſaid to preach Chriſt in the
Synagogues, that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> Acts
9. 20. He is ſaid alſo to teſtify to the Jews, <hi>not
that Jeſus was God,</hi> but that <hi>Jeſus was the Chriſt,</hi>
Acts 18. 5. <hi>We have ſeen and do teſtify</hi> (ſaith
St. <hi>John) that the Father ſent the Son to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

of all Chriſtians does depend,</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Is no other than this:</hi> Theſe things, <hi>ſaith St.
John,</hi> are written, that ye might believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
that Jeſus is the Son of God? 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 5.
Theſe are a plain Account of that Faith which
now is indiſpenſably required of every Chriſtian
in relation to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture <hi>no where</hi> injoins us to believe,
on pain of Damnation, either that Jeſus is God
moſt High, or that he is indeed both God and
Man, or that he was Eternally begotten of the
Father. It only teaches us thus much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, that <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between God and Men,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 5. That
<hi>he is the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole
World,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 2. That <hi>it pleaſed the Father
by him to reconcile all things to himſelf,</hi> Col. 1. 20.
That <hi>there is no Salvation in any other,</hi> Acts 4.

Quick and Dead,</hi> at the latter Day, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58644:11"/>
42. Theſe are Fundamentals ſo plain, and ſo
undoubted, that all Chriſtians do univerſally
agree in the Profeſſion of them, as they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would do in all other Truths, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is really ſuch impoſed on the
Faith of Believers.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Of the tranſcendent Dignity of Jeſus
Chriſt.</head>
            <p>And now although from what has been ſaid
hitherto, it be plainly evident, <hi>that the Godhead
does conſiſt but of one Divine Perſon only, even
the Father of Chriſt;</hi> and that Jeſus, called
otherways in Scripture the Son of God, is no
other than an <hi>humane Perſon:</hi> yet 'tis plain alſo
that he is <hi>not a common Man,</hi> but the chief and
moſt tranſcendently Excellent of all humane
Beings, yea in Dignity above even the Angels.</p>
            <p>For as his Conception in the Womb of a
Virgin was miraculous, ſo were his Life and
Actions a Wonder: He made a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
both of Death and the Devil; and in that
great Inſtance of Magnanimity has out-done all
the renowned Heroes both of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
And <hi>unto which of the Angels ſaid God at any
time, Sit thou on my right hand?</hi> but to this Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is Jeſus exalted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13. God has
<hi>crowned him with Glory and Honour,</hi> Heb. 2. 9.
And <hi>anointed him with the Oil of Gladneſs above
his Fellows,</hi> Heb. 1. 9. <hi>Angels, and Authorities,
and Powers being made ſubject unto him,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 22.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58644:11"/>
He is aſcended into Heaven in a triumphant
manner: and as <hi>he now ſits there at God's right
Hand in Glory,</hi> ſo at the laſt Day ſhall he come
down from thence, <hi>to judg Mankind,</hi> with ſuch
a ſurprizing Majeſty as ſhall amaze and confound
the World. 'Tis doubtleſs impoſſible for any
humane Underſtanding to conceive, or Tongue
to expreſs this moſt excellent Man's tranſcendent
Dignity; his Greatneſs muſt needs be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
who is thus ſet even <hi>above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
is the Head of every Man, and the Prince of
the Kings of the Earth.</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 22. 1 Cor.
11. 3. Rev. 1. 5.</p>
            <p>And now if to thoſe foregoing Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we add that of his moſt admired Love to
us ſinful Mortals, <hi>in making Peace for us by the
Blood of his Croſs,</hi> Col. 1. 20. and in undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with invincible Patience all thoſe Indignities
and Miſeries which did befal him in this the
Courſe of that glorious Work of his, <hi>the opening
for Men a new and living way to the Regions of Bliſs:</hi>
The Conſideration of this, I ſay, added to that
other of his moſt tranſcendent Glory and Power,
ought evermore to raiſe up in us that Veneration
which is ſutable to ſuch moſt wonderful Inſtances
of unconceivable Majeſty and Heroick Affection.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Yet it is not any way juſtifiable to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

            <p>As the Glory of God is not to be advanc'd by
Falſhood, ſo neither can we truly honour Chriſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58644:12"/>
by Lies; he deſires no ſuch thing at our Hands,
neither at the laſt Day will he reward us for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
him to be that which indeed he is not:
they only give true Honour to Chriſt who own
him for the undoubted Meſſiah, or the Son of
God, and do ſtedfaſtly both believe and obey
his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>As for the other vain and ungrounded Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men concerning him, they no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the Glory of our Bleſſed Redeemer.
'Tis ſaid indeed that we ſhould <hi>honour the Son as
we honour the Father,</hi> Joh. 5. 23. But that word
<hi>AS</hi> does not import an equal Honour, no more
than it does import an equal Holineſs and Purity,
when we are commanded to purify our ſelves
AS he is pure, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. And <hi>AS he which
hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner
of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the word <hi>Honour</hi> is of a doubtful
Import, and doth often-times ſignify only Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as is evident from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1, 2. where
by <hi>honour thy Father and Mother</hi> is clearly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<hi>obey your Parents.</hi> And accordingly Dr.
<hi>Clagget,</hi> in his Paraphraſe on the Place, makes
it <hi>to be an honouring the Son with the ſame Faith
and Obedience;</hi> implying, that we are as much
bound to believe and obey the Goſpel of Chriſt
in the New Teſtament, as we are the Law of
God recorded in the Old; that ſince he is made
Judg of the World, to be certain he will not
ſuffer the Breach of his own Laws to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58644:12"/>
Doubtleſs we ought to be as careful of aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
to Chriſt thoſe Glories which are his, as
we are to give to God Almighty that Honour
which eſſentially belongs to himſelf: and no
Man can think or ſpeak too honourably of his
Redeemer, ſo long as he no ways does thereby
rob God the Father of that truly Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which is his indiſpenſible Due. Our Lord
who ſought not his own Glory, <hi>(John 8. 50.)</hi>
will give us no Thanks for ſuch Honours as do
naturally derogate from his Father's Dignity:
but ſuch is their Honour who make the Son to
be God; for then ſince but one Perſon can be
truly God, they do aſſert by Conſequence that
the Father is not ſo.</p>
            <p>God has indeed highly exalted Jeſus his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son, and has given him a Name above
every Name, and has put all things under his
Feet. But when all things are ſaid to be thus
put under him, <hi>'tis manifeſt that he himſelf is
excepted that did put all things under him,</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 27. So that notwithſtanding the great and
mighty Dignities to which God hath exalted
Chriſt, yet he has ſtill reſerv'd to himſelf this
moſt ſupreme Royalty of being <hi>the God and
Head of Chriſt.</hi> God hath given him indeed a
Kingdom; but when the Intent of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his is accompliſh'd, he ſhall again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
it back, that ſo God in that after-ſtate of
Eternity may be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25,

            <p>When the Jews did accuſe him for making

<hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are called Gods to whom the

Word of God came—Say ye of him whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath ſanctified, and ſent into the World, Thou
blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?
John</hi> 10. 35, 36. Chriſt had as good a Right
to this Title as any of the reſt, if not a better;
and therefore it could be no Blaſphemy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
the ſame to himſelf, had he done ſo:
but they lied, for he did not do it, he only ſaid,
that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> calling God his Father.</p>

            <head>Of the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>Others object, that if Chriſt were not God
as well as Man, he could not have been a fit
Mediator between God and Man, ſince in ſuch
a Caſe, ſay they, he ought no way to be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Perſon concern'd. A fit Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man muſt neither be only God,
nor only Man, but one who by Nature is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two, even God as well as Man.</p>
            <p>I anſwer; 'Tis not neceſſary that a Mediator
ſhould be of ſuch a middle Nature, nor does the
Scripture any where aſſert it: There is always
ſuppoſed in the Work of Reconciliation, one
offended, another offending, and a third not
concern'd in the Quarrel, interpoſing to make
Peace between them. Now in this Senſe Chriſt,
though but a Man, was a very fit and proper
Mediator: Had he been God, he had been the
Party offended; had he been a ſinful Man, he
had been one of that Party that gave the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
but being a Man perfectly righteous, he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58644:14"/>
therefore was fit to intercede between God and
Sinners.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt is our Mediator, is plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and 'tis as plain that he is only a Man,
and not both God and Man, as ſome aſſert:
<hi>There is,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>one God, and one
Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 5. And 'tis moſt wonderful,
that in a Matter ſo manifeſtly evident, Men
ſhould dare to impoſe upon the World another
Faith, or be induc'd to believe contrary to ſo
plain and evident a part of God's Word.</p>

that bear Record—and theſe three are one,</hi> 1 Joh.
5. 7. To theſe I anſwer, that though 'tis ſaid

'tis not ſaid they are one God.</hi> This is only the
ungrounded Aſſertion either of ſome eaſy-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or elſe of ſome heedleſly bold and daring
Men.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs by that Paſſage, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. is
meant, that theſe three are one as to the Record
which they are there ſaid to bear; they perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

As for that other Paſſage, <hi>John</hi> 10. 30. 'tis
plain, that the Oneneſs there meant is a Myſtical
or Moral, and not a Natural Oneneſs: And 'tis
doubtleſs explained by <hi>John</hi> 17. 11. where our
Saviour prays that his Diſciples <hi>might be one as
he and his Father were one; that they,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in
thee, that they may be one in us,</hi> v. 21. which
denotes an Oneneſs only in the ſame mutual
Affection, for Believers can be one in no other
Senſe but this: and look what Oneneſs there
ought to be between one true Believer and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the ſame Oneneſs there is between Chriſt
and God, an inward Intimacy, like that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
real Friends, of whom 'tis uſual to ſay,
they are all one, one in Heart, and one in Mind;

it no Robbery to be equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2. 6.
To this I anſwer, that Chriſt himſelf hath told
us, that <hi>his Father is greater than he,</hi> John 14.
28. Hence 'tis plain, that if the Son be any
ways equal to the Father, yet 'tis really but in
ſome Particulars; for were the Son equal to the
Father in every Reſpect, then 'twere impoſſible
for the Father to be greater than he.</p>
            <p>Whence 'tis clear that the Son cannot be equal
to the Father in all things, though in ſome

Believers, ſo this alſo Chriſt can do; but this

are our Saviour's own Words; and 'tis plain,

I anſwer, many things are ſpoken of
Chriſt figuratively, as he is called a Way, a Door,
a Vine; and the Bread in the Sacrament is ſaid
to be his Body. Now theſe, as thoſe likewiſe
which affirm him to be the Maker of the World,
are Figurative or Myſtical Expreſſions, in which
one thing is ſaid to ſignify another, as the Old
Creation to ſet forth the New.</p>
            <p>There are in the Scripture many dark and
difficult Paſſages, hard to be underſtood, as
St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſes it, 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. 16. which
are doubtleſs true in ſome Senſe or other, could
we be ſo happy as to hit upon the right: But
in the mean time, till this can be done, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58644:15"/>
that that can never be the right Senſe which
contradicts the cleareſt and the plaineſt parts of
the Bible, as well as the greateſt and moſt certain
Evidences of humane Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The general Current of the Scripture declares
plainly, that <hi>Chriſt, or the Meſſiah, was derived
from the Seed of,</hi> Abraham; <hi>that he was the Son
of</hi> David; <hi>that he was made of a Woman.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis ſelf-evident that in a literal Senſe he
could never be the Maker of the World, whoſe
true Anceſtors were humane Perſons, and who
was born, or whoſe Being did firſt begin to be,
ſome thouſands of Years after the World was
made. All Scriptures therefore that affirm
Chriſt to be <hi>the Maker of the World,</hi> and to be
<hi>the Maker of all things,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to <hi>ſpeak

            <p>I anſwer; If Chriſt had really two Natures
in him, ſo that thereby he had been truly God
as well as Man, the Perſon thus conſtituted or
made up of two ſuch Natures, could never
have died according to his humane Nature, if
by his Divine Nature he had been truly God
too: for how could he in Perſon have been
mortal in one Capacity, if he had been on the

not poſſibly have been ignorant in one Capacity
of what he knew in another; nor could he have
wanted any kind of Power, if in any of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities

            <p>'Tis objected, that as Chriſt Jeſus our Lord
was begotten by God on the Body of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
ſo he muſt neceſſarily be God of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Father, as he was Man of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Mother. In Anſwer to this I ſay,
that when the Angel ſaluted the Virgin with the
Glad-tidings of her being deſigned to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>not of God,</hi> but of the promiſed Meſſiah,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58644:17"/>
he told her, <hi>that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould come upon
her, and the Power of the Higheſt ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow
her;</hi> and that <hi>therefore that holy thing
which ſhould be born of her, ſhould be called the
Son of God,</hi> Luke 1. 31, 35.</p>
            <p>Now in the Relation of this Meſſage theſe
following Particulars are remarkable:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> That Jeſus our Lord is the Son of
God's Power only, and not of his Perſon; <hi>the
Power of the Higheſt ſhall over ſhadow thee.</hi> 'T was
of the Woman only that he was made, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.
(He was not generated, as ſome think, out of
his Father's Subſtance) and ſo by Conſequence
was the Son only of his miraculous and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> It is not ſaid that therefore he ſhall
be the natural Son of God in that Senſe, as one
Man is the natural Son of another; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſhall be called the Son of God, or he
ſhall ſo be, and be ſo reputed, becauſe in this
one particular Inſtance God was to him inſtead
of a Father, not a Father in the way that Men
are Fathers to their Children, but a Father in
reſpect of the Virgin's receiving a Power from
God; thus in an uncommon manner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in her ſelf a Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>David,
Ver.</hi> 31, 32.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid I think it appears
plainly, that Chriſt his being God of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Father, is an ungrounded Conceit.
The Generation of our Lord Jeſus may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accounted for another way: for God the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58644:18"/>
Architect, and moſt-wiſe Contriver of
the Creation, has reſerv'd to himſelf a Power
to alter the Courſe of Nature whenſoever he
pleaſes; and as of a Rib taken out from the ſide

omnipotent Power he did enable a Virgin Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to conceive a Son. If God had Power out
of mere Stones to raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Mat. 3. 9. we ought not to think it incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
that in this miraculous manner he ſhould

Miracles.</head>
            <p>Some I find are ſtrongly perſwaded that none
but a Perſon truly God could do thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Works that Chriſt did. To ſuch I anſwer,
that a Man who is no God can do things that
are miraculous, when God gives him a Power
to perform them. This is evident in thoſe
which <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and in thoſe alſo which were
wrought by the Apoſtles. The Works of Chriſt
indeed were extraordinary, yet not done by a
Power inherent in himſelf, but by a Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from God: for himſelf tells us, that <hi>all
Power was given unto him both in Heaven and in
Earth,</hi> Mat. 28. 18. He was <hi>a Man approved of
God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by Miracles, Wonders,

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58644:18"/>
This Power God did beſtow on Chriſt, to be
only an Evidence of his being the true Meſſiah:
<hi>Rabbi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nicodemus, We know that thou art a
Teacher come from God; for no Man can do theſe
things that thou doſt, except God be with him,</hi>
Joh. 3. 2. <hi>The Works,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>which the
Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame Works
that I do, bear witneſs of me,</hi> Joh. 5. 36. His
Works were an evident Proof that he was no
Impoſtor, but a true and moſt wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
yet ſtill he is ſaid <hi>to be but a Man, a
Man</hi> whom God was with, <hi>a Man</hi> by whom

fully every Particular that does relate to his
Divine Perfections; for God is Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and may for ought we know be that which
yet we cannot plainly underſtand him to be,
namely, three in Perſon, though but one in
Eſſence.</p>
            <p>I anſwer; Some of God's Divine Perfections
are ſelf-evident, and 'tis impoſſible that we can
be miſtaken therein: We are infallibly certain
that he muſt be Immenſe in Perſon, Almighty
in Power, and moſt Wise in Knowledg. And
although we cannot know what God is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Reſpect, yet at the ſame time we may know
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58644:19"/>
certainly what indeed he is not; we know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that <hi>he is not a Man,</hi> or that he was made
of a Woman, as Chriſt was: We know certainly
that <hi>he is not mortal,</hi> or that he cannot die, as
Chriſt did; and we know certainly that <hi>he has not
a God above him,</hi> as Chriſt had; and we know
certainly that <hi>he has not received any kind of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from another,</hi> as Chriſt Jeſus is ſaid to do.</p>
            <p>And as one Truth naturally infers another, ſo
we do from hence aſſuredly conclude that the
Perſon of Jeſus our Lord is not truly God; for
<hi>he was made of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. <hi>He died
to redeem us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>He had a God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3. And <hi>he did receive all
the Power he had of another,</hi> Joh. 5. 30. Mat.
28. 18.</p>
            <p>We alſo know certainly that if the Divine
Godhead did conſiſt of three Perſons, that then
neither of the three Perſons ſingly can be God.
If all three be but that one God together (as
the Trinitarians aſſert) then no one of them can
be the true God by himſelf: for the ſame Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
cannot properly fit each Perſon ſingly,
as does fit them when conjoined in one mutual
Relation; for then they might be ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
three ſupreme Godheads, which is utterly
impoſſible.</p>
            <p>We alſo know certainly that if any of the
three Perſons, ſaid to be in the Godhead, be God
by himſelf, as we have proved God the Father
undoubtedly is, then all the reſt are but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
and unneceſſary, as to the Conſtitution
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58644:19"/>
of a Godhead: for one Infinite, Almighty,
and moſt Wiſe Perſon, is as ſufficient to all the
Purpoſes of a Godhead, as ten thouſand Deities:
but if three be but the one true God together,
then no one of them can be that one true God
by himſelf alone.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we may be infallibly certain that if
Doctrines grounded on ſo many numerous and
great Evidences both of Scripture and ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Reaſon, as theſe are, <hi>That God is but one in
Perſon; That the Perſon who is truly God, is no

the moſt excellent of Men, even Jeſus Chriſt, was
only a Man,</hi> be falſe; Then we cannot be certain
of the Truth of any other Principle in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
If the Evidences here collected do deceive

<hi>He came down from Heaven; came forth from
the Father, and aſcended up where he was before.</hi>
To which I anſwer, that theſe prove not that
for which they are intended, ſince 'tis plainly
inferred from other Scriptures, that Chriſt, ſome
time before he was ſent to declare the Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings
of the Goſpel, was aſſumed or taken up
from the Earth into his Father's more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58644:20"/>
Preſence, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſome time after
into the third Heaven) there to be inſtructed in
the Mind and Will of God, and to be inveſted
with that great Dignity and Power of being a
Prince and a Saviour.</p>
            <p>To this the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Viſion plainly
alludes; <hi>I ſaw,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Night Viſions,
and behold one like the Son of Man came to the
Antient of Days, and they brought him before him;
and there was given him Dominion and Glory, and
a Kingdom, that all People, and Nations, and
Languages ſhould ſerve him,</hi> Dan. 7. 13. And
from the Words of our Saviour himſelf 'tis
plain, that he aſcended up into Heaven before
he came down to declare his Father's Will to
Men; <hi>No Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath aſcended into
Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven,
Joh.</hi> 3. 13. But no Man but Chriſt ever came
down from thence, which he never could have
done had he not firſt aſcended up thither. And
that he was taken up to be inſtructed in the
Doctrine he was to publiſh to the World, is plain
alſo; <hi>The Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that ſent me, he
gave me a Commandment what I ſhould ſay, and
what I ſhould ſpeak,</hi> Joh. 12. 49.</p>
            <p>The Redemption or Reſtoration of Mankind

that Reaſon muſt by Interpretation be brought
to ſuch a Senſe as is agreeable to the Analogy of
Faith, and the moſt general Scope and Deſign
of the Holy Scriptures: that is to ſay, that
Chriſt was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and before the
World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Fore-ordination, Decree
and Counſel of God, as in very Deed St. <hi>Peter</hi>
interprets them, when he ſaith thus of Chriſt,
that <hi>he verily was fore-ordained before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <head>Of the Satisfaction that Chriſt made
to God.</head>
            <p>Some argue thus; That if Chriſt had not
been God, the Sacrifice he offered, or the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
he made for Sinners, would not have
been of that Infinite Worth which was neceſſary
to ſatisfy the Infinite Juſtice of an offended God.
I anſwer. The Holy Scriptures do not any where
declare this Doctrine, but on the contrary they
tell us, that <hi>as by the Offence of one, Judgment
came upon all Men to Condemnation; ſo by the
Righteouſneſs of one, the free Gift came upon all
Men to Juſtification of Life.</hi> Rom. 5. 18.</p>
            <p>In which Words are contained the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Satisfaction of Chriſt; and they
imply thus much only, that God was ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
well pleaſed with the unſpotted Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of his Son, that for his ſake he entred
into a new Covenant of Grace and Mercy with
Mankind, wherein he did engage himſelf to be
ſtill their God, and to afford them new Means
of becoming his People.</p>
            <p>Thus did God in Infinite Mercy take all Men
again into Favour for the ſake of one perfectly
righteous Perſon, as in infinite Juſtice he had
before included all Men under Suffering for their
firſt Father's Sin and Tranſgreſſion: So that <hi>as
by Man came Death,</hi> the Puniſhment due to the
Breach of the firſt Covenant, <hi>ſo by Man came
alſo the Reſurrection from the Dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58644:22"/>
21. All which was not the Effect of any equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
Price which by Chriſt was given to God,
but of the Righteouſneſs or Obedience, which
he perform'd to his Father's Command: for
<hi>as by one Man's Diſobedience many were made
Sinners; ſo by the Obedience of one ſhall many be
made Righteous.</hi> Rom. 5. 19.</p>
            <p>Had Chriſt given to God, or made in our
ſtead ſuch a Satisfaction as had been equivalent
to the Tranſgreſſions of all Men, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
them, how then could Eternal Life be the
free Gift of God? How then could we be ſaved
by Free Grace? and how could our Sins be ſaid
to be forgiven? for Gift, and Grace, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
are not proper terms where an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
hath been received.</p>
            <p>In the Scripture 'tis ſaid indeed, that Chriſt
hath <hi>obtained Eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 9.
12. That our <hi>Peace is made through the Blood of
his Croſs,</hi> Col. 1. 20. That we were <hi>reconciled
unto God by the Death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.
But it ſpeaks not ſo much as one Word of an
Equivalent.</p>
            <p>But is it not ſaid, ſay ſome, that <hi>we are bought
with a Price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. And that <hi>the Son
of Man has given his Life a Ranſom for many?
Mat.</hi> 20. 28. I anſwer, Theſe are but impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Expreſſions, and are of the ſame Nature
with thoſe which attribute Hands, and Eyes,
and Ears to God, which only imply that ſuch
Acts are done by God which Men uſually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
by theſe bodily Parts: Even ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58644:22"/>
ſaid to ranſom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us, and to buy us with a Price,
becauſe by his Means we do receive Benefits
equivalent to what they do who are ſet free from
any kind of Miſery and Bondage, by the Payment
of a Price to them in whoſe Bondage they are.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, as a Cloſe to what I have to ſay on
this Head, add, that the Juſtice of God ſpoken
of is ſatisfied in a manner different from that
which the Adverſary ſuppoſes: that is to ſay,
the Juſtice of God is ſatisfied in the certain Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion. <hi>Adam</hi> was
commanded not to eat of the forbidden Fruit
on pain of Death. This Command he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed;
and 'tis evident that the Puniſhment
was accordingly inflicted, for <hi>Adam</hi> died, and
all his Poſterity do die likewiſe. Now when the
Penalty is thus inflicted, 'tis plain that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
is ſatisfied, and God in Equity can require
no more: but had not Chriſt obtained the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to reſtore us to Life after the Puniſhment
was thus inflicted, there had then been an End of
Mankind for ever.</p>
            <p>From hence 'tis apparent how idle their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is who imagine Chriſt ſuffered what all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ſhould have ſuffered, in order to free them
for ever from ſuffering the ſame. For 'tis plain
beyond Contradiction, that we are not freed
from Death, the Puniſhment due to that firſt
Tranſgreſſion, for we all die; God does exact
the Forfeiture of every one of us, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
his Juſtice, as to that Offence, is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in all its Demands. But this, ſay ſome,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58644:23"/>
is falſe, for Hell was our Due as well as Death;
and from that Chriſt has freed every one that
will believe. I anſwer, 'Tis ſtrange that Chriſt
ſhould free Believers from one part of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and not from the other: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
no where reveal this Secret, and for that
Reaſon we need not believe it.</p>
            <p>Hell is the Puniſhment which is due to the
Breach of the ſecond Covenant, and not of the
firſt; now neither has Chriſt freed us from this
by any thing that he has done and ſuffered for
us. He by his Righteouſneſs did indeed procure
for us a new Covenant, and this new Covenant
of Grace propoſes Life and Pardon on condition
that we will believe its Promiſes, ſincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to obey its Precepts, and repent of Sin;
and they are truly the Breakers of this Covenant
who live in a continued Courſe of Diſobedience
thereunto, and die at laſt in final Impenitence.
Now for ſuch Sinners as theſe there does remain
no Sacrifice; Chriſt never died for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of ſuch, and by Conſequence can no
ways be ſaid to ſuffer in their ſtead.</p>

            <p>Some object, that Jeſus muſt be God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis recorded that his Name, in the moſt
Primitive Times of the Goſpel, was called upon;
ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 14. and 22. 16. I anſwer; 'Tis
difficult to underſtand rightly what is there
meant by Calling on his Name: This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58644:23"/>
that the Scripture no where injoins us to
make Chriſt the Object of Divine Worſhip;
it does rather expreſly intimate the contrary. Our
Lord forewarns his Diſciples not to ask any
thing of him after his Aſcenſion, but bids them
ask the Father in his Name, <hi>Job.</hi> 16. 23, 24, 26.</p>
            <p>And when our Lord taught his own Diſciples
to pray, he bids them ſay, <hi>Our Father which art
in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 6. 9. He does not direct them
to ſay, O Chriſt hear us: He tells the Samaritan
Woman, that in the following times the <hi>true
Worſhippers ſhould worſhip the Father,</hi> Joh. 4. 23.
'Twas the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that in every
thing by Prayer and Supplication we ſhould let
our Requeſts be made known unto God, <hi>Phil.</hi>
4. 6. And his own Practice was according to
his Doctrine, <hi>I bow my Knee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the
Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3. 14. and
in many other Places, God or the Father, not
Chriſt, is mentioned as the alone Object of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Adoration and Petition: And 'tis worth
nothing, that Chriſt himſelf, whoſe Example
and Footſteps we ſhould follow, prayed always
to his Father, and never did ſo much as once
petition any other Perſon of the ſuppoſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And as to Thankſgiving, 'tis plainly ſaid to
be the Will of God that we ſhould do all in the
Name of the Lord Jeſus, giving Thanks to God
and the Father by him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Place we are commanded to give <hi>Thanks
always unto God and the Father, in the Name of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58644:24"/>
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 5. 20. And accordingly we
read in a great number of Places in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
how the Apoſtles gave God Thanks
through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Jeſus our Lord is ſaid in Scripture <hi>to appear in
the Preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. to be <hi>an
Advocate for Sinners,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. <hi>To make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
for the Saints,</hi> Rom. 3. 34. To be <hi>the
Mediator between God and Men,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5.
<hi>The Miniſter of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8. 6.
All which proves him to be the Perſon that
pleads our Cauſe, that ſolicites our Acceptance,
the great Tranſactor and Manager of all Affairs
between God and us; but it no ways intimates
any Divine Worship due to himſelf.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſhould we put Chriſt inſtead of
the true God, and make him the alone Object
of Divine Prayer and Thankſgiving, in whoſe
Name then ſhall we approach the Throne of
Grace? and by whom ſhall we render Thanks
to God? who ſhall be our Interceſſor, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
our Mediator? For my part I know but
of one Mediator, and that's the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. and he only is the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us Men and the one true God, whom I
before have proved to be only the Father of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To make our Lord Chriſt therefore the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Divine Addreſſes is as much as in us
lies to deprive him of his Mediatory Office,
which alſo by Conſequence is to deny him to be
the Son of God, even the Beloved in whom
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58644:24"/>
alone we are accepted, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. Yea, and
by this we deny alſo the Godhead of the Father,
in whoſe ſtead we do by this Means place Chriſt,
than which there can be nothing in this World
that is more truly Antichriſtian: See 1 <hi>John</hi>
2. 22.</p>
            <p>Now from the aforegoing Arguments 'tis
evident, that whatever the Senſe of the objected
Places are, yet they cannot mean that which
the Objector intends, ſince in vaſtly more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous

that 'tis but of Yeſterday in compariſon to that

that the Objector is greatly miſtaken: for can
that be a new Doctrine which has the greateſt

The long Continuance of the contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
if it were as antient as the Objectors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
is yet no Argument of its real Truth. We
read that ſoon after the good Wheat was ſown,
the Enemy began to ſprinkle Tares in the Field;
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 25. And the Myſtery of Iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to work even in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
2. 7. So that 'tis no wonder that ſome Errors,
as ſuppoſe this of the Trinity, be almoſt of equal
ſtanding to the greateſt Truths: for where God
has a Church, the Devil always has a Chappel.
'Tis not the long or ſhort Continuance of any
Doctrine, as to its Profeſſion, that makes it
authentick, but that Foundation of Reaſon and
Scripture on which it is built: A Tenet is not
therefore true becauſe of its long or general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
if at the ſame time it contradicts Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the general Current of the ſacred
Scriptures.</p>

         <div type="part">
            <head>Of Scripture-Myſteries.</head>
            <p>Some object, that much of the Scripture is
mere Myſtery; and therefore ſince all Scripture
is the Object of our Faith, we muſt ſometimes
believe things which we cannot comprehend.
I anſwer, if we are to believe Myſteries when
clearly revealed, yet it does not from thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that therefore we muſt believe Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Contradictions. A juſt God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lay on us a neceſſity of ſubmitting to thoſe
Terms and Conditions of Salvation which we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58644:26"/>
cannot poſſibly underſtand. Hence it follows
that ſuch obſcure Myſteries as evidently do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
other plain Truths, do no ways concern
us, ſo long as we are in the dark as to their
true Senſe and Meaning.</p>
            <p>When a Myſtery is plainly expreſs'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as when 'tis ſaid, a Virgin did conceive a
Son, or that all Men ſhall riſe again, or that
Chriſt ſhall judg the World, and no other plain
Scripture contradicts it, neither is it contrary to
humane Reaſon; we are then to believe it, tho
it may be above our Underſtanding to conceive
which way the Power of God ſhould enable a
Virgin to conceive, or in what manner our ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
Duſt ſhall be recollected and revived, or
how our bleſſed Saviour can be made fit for ſo
great a Work as an Univerſal Judg.</p>
            <p>But if ſome Places in Scripture had ſaid theſe
things, but others more numerous and plain
had affirmed the contrary, or had it contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any ſelf-evident Principle of Reaſon, we
might then have rejected the Belief thereof as
ſafely and with as good Authority as we now do
that of the Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation, which by
the way is as expreſly contain'd in Scripture as
is that of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>But for Myſteries of a more doubtful Nature,
ſuch as want the Qualifications before expreſs'd,
they can no ways oblige our Faith, ſo long as
their true Meaning lies hid in Obſcurity of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
There will be a time when all ſecret
things ſhall be revealed, and all hidden things
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58644:27"/>
ſhall be brought to light, for which we muſt
wait with Patience, and not pretend, as ſome
do, to explain even what is moſt hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
by ſuch Notions as are purely unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for this is but the more to confound their
Minds which were at a loſs before.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, if any Man can rationally explain
a Myſtery, he then does good Service both to
God and Man; but this we are infallibly certain
is never done, when the Senſe that is given of a
doubtful Place of Scripture is contrary not only
to the general Current of the reſt of the Word
of God, but is alſo a Contradiction to the moſt
ſelf-evident Sentiments of humane Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, If ſuch Paſſages as theſe
are ſo generally to be overlook'd in the Buſineſs
of Religion, why then did God cauſe them to
be recorded in the ſacred Scripture? I anſwer,
that it may as well be asked, why God made
ſo many ſorts of ſmall, and as we think, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Inſects to live upon the Earth, ſince we know
not what Benefit they are of to the World?
Doubtleſs God, who does nothing in vain,
made them for ſome great Ends, though our
ſhort-ſighted Underſtanding cannot perceive
what thoſe excellent Ends of his are: Even ſo
likewiſe will his Wiſdom be manifeſted ſome
way or other, by what to us is yet hard to be
underſtood in Scripture. And though we are
ignorant of the true meaning of many of the
moſt obſcure and doubtful Parts thereof, yet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58644:27"/>
the Ends and Purpoſes of God in cauſing them
to be written, either are or ſhall in due time be
accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we ought to magnify that
manifeſt Goodneſs of God, who hath commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to Mankind ſuch a number of plain and
evident Precepts as will be fully ſufficient for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
if we carefully obſerve them. All are
concern'd in the Buſineſs of Life Eternal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>There are a ſort of People in the World of

            <p>To this I anſwer, That Faith indeed is the

'tis the Belief of God's Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
that does ingage Mankind to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his Precepts: Few, I doubt, would be

how great ſoever, ſhall be able to ſtop
them in their Chriſtian Race: And in this Senſe
it only is, that Faith is ſaid to be the Victory
that overcometh the World.</p>
            <p>But though 'tis only a firm Perſwaſion of the
Truth of God's Promiſes and Threatnings that
inſpires the Faithful with Courage to overcome
and conquer the Temptations not only of the
Devil, but of the Luſts of this World too; <hi>yet
this is no Argument that therefore we muſt aſſent
to that which we ſee no Reaſon to believe;</hi> for
then we might be every whit as liable to believe
things falſe as things that are true.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it behoves us to be very watchful
and circumſpect in avoiding falſe Principles; for
Error of any kind will rather make us Slaves to
the Devil, than enable us to overcome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
him. As therefore thou oughtſt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Truth whereſoever thou doſt find it, ſo be
as ready to relinquiſh Errors, when by carefully
examining into Religion thou haſt diſcovered
them to be ſuch: for <hi>'tis in every reſpect as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick

            </p>
            <p>Know then that no kind of Faith can be true
that is certainly unreaſonable, for the Light of
Nature is as much God's Law as Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;

and none muſt ever think that God's

Reaſon is the only Touchſtone that Men have to

            <p>'Tis certain that the Laws of Religion are
deſign'd by God for the only Good of Mankind;
he forbids ſome things and commands others,
only becauſe the one is prejudicial to Man's Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being,
and the other is abſolutely neceſſary to
his Peace and Happineſs. In order then to the
true Happineſs of this Life there is required a
ſutable way of living, even ſuch as reſpects the
Univerſal Good of the whole Kind; which,
in ſhort, is that which Men call a Life of
Holineſs, or a Life perfectly free from every

kind of Injuſtice or Miſchief both to one's ſelf
and others.</p>
            <p>And as for the Heavenly State, that is a
State of perfect Goodneſs and Purity; and 'tis
impoſſible that any one can take delight in that
Divine kind of Life hereafter which he hated
here: And for that Reaſon could the Wicked be
admitted into Heaven, yet then would they be
unhappy, by reaſon that <hi>there</hi> none of thoſe
baſe and ignoble Pleaſures would be found
which their corrupted Minds on Earth did love

Earth that can fit us for the Heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Now this Goodneſs of Life, ſo neceſſary to
Man's both preſent and future Bliſs, does not
conſiſt in Speculation but in Practice. Belief is
of no other Uſe than as it enacts Obedience;
and that's the Reaſon that the Day of Judgment
is repreſented as taking no notice of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
but of the Practices of Men. Have you
fed the Hungry? Have you clothed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked?
Have you viſited the Sick? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
36. At that great Solemnity the Inquiry
will not be, What had you in the World? or
what did you profeſs? but what good Deeds
have you done therein? how has your Care
been to promote the Univerſal Good of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings? Have you renounced the Luſt of
the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride
of Life? 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 26. and lived <hi>ſoberly, and
righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent World?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58644:29"/>
Tit.</hi> 2. 12. and done <hi>juſtly, and loved Mercy, and
walked humbly with God?</hi> Mich. 6. 8.</p>
            <p>Now if 'tis the Goodneſs of our Practice
that is the one thing neceſſary to Salvation, then
the disbelieving either a few doubtful, or elſe a
few unreaſonable Opinions, can never be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
Let us then (as to the Point now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Examination) ask our ſelves but this one
Queſtion, Will the Belief of the Doctrine of a
Trinity make me a more merciful and righteous
Man than I ſhall be if I did profeſs the contrary?
Will it make me love and honour God better?
Will it make the Service which I render to his
Divine Majeſty a more reaſonable Service? And
if on ſerious Conſideration you find it will
not, then 'tis plain that the Unitarian Faith,
which denies a Trinity of Perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
is much to be preferr'd, ſince 'tis not
perplex'd with ſuch Contradictions to humane
Underſtanding, but depends on more plain and
noble Evidences, and does alſo in all Reſpects
whatſoever effectually ſecure a good Life;
which, when all is done, is the very Soul and
Life of Religion, and will ſtand by a Man when
<hi>Hypoſtatical Vnions,</hi> and <hi>Mutual Conſciouſneſs,</hi>
and <hi>Somewhats,</hi> will prove but poor things to
depend upon for Salvation.</p>
            <p>There can be no Danger of Damnation for
not aſſenting to ſuch myſterious Notions as Men
can at no tolerable rate underſtand, ſuch as is
that of the Doctrine of a Trinity, <hi>(which makes
the Divine Power of the Godhead to reſide in three
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58644:30"/>
diſtinct Perſons, whoſe Conſtitution is like that of
a free State, rather than the more Divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a ſingle Monarchy)</hi> if in the mean time
they believe heartily the plain Doctrine revealed
in God's Word, and live up truly to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Precepts which the Chriſtian Religion
commands, which I am certain does no where
ſay, that unleſs ye believe that three Perſons are
truly God, ye ſhall certainly be damn'd.</p>

            <head>Salvation and the Belief of the Trinity
not inconſiſtent.</head>
            <p>'Tis objected as dangerous to believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of God's being but one in Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſhould hereby, as much as in us lies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from Salvation all thoſe pious and juſt Men
who in former Ages have liv'd and died in the
Belief of a Trinity. I anſwer; The Wiſdom
of the Unitarian Doctrine never was ſo uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
as to ſuppoſe this; yet doubtleſs the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a Trinity muſt needs much leſſen their
future Happineſs, though not wholly debar
them of Salvation: And therefore to perſiſt
therein, after due Admonition eſpecially, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
imprudent and dangerous.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain, that though thoſe who believe a
Trinity do believe more than either God or
Chriſt do require as neceſſary to Salvation, yet
together or therewith many Perſons do alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all the chief Fundamentals in Religion that
are requiſite to ſave them; and therefore their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58644:30"/>
Hope and Truſt in God's Mercy on one Hand,
may out-ballance their Error on the other. If
God winked at the Ignorance of the vertuous
Gentiles, how can we imagine that he ſhould
not be gracious to the heedleſs and unwitting
Errors of the humble and contrite-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?</p>
            <p>If any Man <hi>(ſaith the Apoſtle)</hi> build on the
Foundation Hay, and Straw, and Stubble, <hi>that
is, Doctrine that will not ſtand the Teſt of
Truth,</hi> he ſhall ſuffer Loſs; yet he himſelf ſhall
be ſaved, but ſo as by Fire, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 15. that
is, with great Difficulty he ſhall eſcape Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If God ſhould be extream to mark what
is done amiſs, no Man could ſtand in Judgment
before him; as it is in</hi> Pſal. 143. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 130. 3.
All Salvation is of the free Grace and Mercy of
God, who pardons Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin,
Exod. 34. 7. <hi>A good Life will make great
Abatements upon the account of a bad Faith;</hi>
Mercy rejoiceth againſt Judgment, <hi>Jam. 2. 13.
and</hi> Charity ſhall cover a multitude of Sins,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>But though 'tis poſſible for a Man to be ſaved
in this Faith, who otherwiſe has lived well, yet
'twill doubtleſs much leſſen his future Happineſs,
for Error of any kind is the fruitful Parent of
many Miſchiefs; it betrays us into Abſurdities,
and involves us in many unwarrantable Words
and Actions. As our Faith is, ſo will our Practice
be apt to be, and conſequently Error in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
or other will be apt to make Mens Lives
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58644:31"/>
leſs innocent; and the leſs innocent our Actions
are, the leſs doubtleſs will our Reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be: For the eternal Glories, <hi>compar'd to
that of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars,</hi> 1 Cor.
15. will be in proportion to the Degrees of our
Chriſtian Perfection. They therefore whoſe
Religion is ſuch only as will but juſt preſerve
them from Damnation, muſt not expect ſo
large a ſhare of the Divine Recompences, as by
God's Grace is due to the inlarged Capacity of
the more exactly knowing and undefiled Soul.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding what has been ſaid on
the Behalf of thoſe otherwiſe good Livers who
have not been ignorant of the Truth merely
out of Malice and Deſign, I add, that in caſe
Men of <hi>falſe Principles</hi> are told plainly that they
are in the wrong, and yet they ſtill do obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſiſt therein, and refuſe to conſider ſeriouſly
the Arguments both of Scripture and Reaſon
that are offered to convince them; I ſee not
how in any caſe 'tis poſſible for ſuch to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
for this is truly and plainly to reject the
Counſel of God, and to do Deſpite to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

            <head>By what Nature the World was redeemed.</head>
            <p>When Men have argued whatever they can
about the Neceſſity of Chriſt his being truly
God, that ſo the Sacrifice he offered might be
of Merit ſufficient to anſwer the Demands of
God's moſt Infinite Juſtice; yet after all it muſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58644:31"/>
be acknowledged, that our Peace was made
with God, only by the holy Life and Death of
an humane Perſon: for nothing that is truly
God can die or ſhed Blood, but <hi>'tis by Blood,
even the Blood of a dying Jeſus, that we are cleanſed
from all Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. And this his Death
for our Redemption is an undeniable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to prove, that his Perſon was truly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
            <p>Chriſt Jeſus our Lord was undoubtedly filled
with the Divine Spirit, for in him dwelt the
Fulneſs of the Godhead; but this did not
make him God, any more than a Believer ſhall
be made God by <hi>receiving of his Fulneſs,</hi> Joh. 1.
16. or by being <hi>Partaker of the Divine Nature</hi>
promiſed to ſuch, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. It only fitted
him for the Work of Redemption: he by that
eminent Inhabitation of the Divine Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
able to ſurmount all Temptations to Sin;
and 'twas only the underfiled Obedience of his
Life, even unto Death, that made the Sacrifice
which he offered unto God acceptable.</p>
            <p>The Blood that was ſhed to manifeſt the intire
Obedience of Jeſus unto God, was no other
than the Blood of a moſt holy and excellent
Man; 'twas not the Blood of God, as ſome Men
raſhly do affirm: On the Croſs he that thus died
cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
me?</hi> Now for him to be God that thus
prayed to God, is, I think, impoſſible. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis evident, that he who thus died was not
a true Deity; and yet 'twas by him that died
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58644:32"/>
that the World was redeemed; for which
<hi>bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who hath thus
viſited and redeemed his People, and hath raiſed
up a mighty Salvation for us, out of the Houſe of
his Servant</hi> David, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68, 69.</p>

            <head>A general Rule for anſwering all
Objections.</head>
            <p>Having conſidered and anſwered the principal
Objections urged in favour of the Doctrine
which aſſerts Jeſus Chriſt to be truly God, in
oppoſition to that of his being only <hi>the Man who
is the Mediator between God and Men,</hi> 1 Tim.
2. 5. or that which aſſerts that none is God but
the Father of Chriſt, 'twill be needleſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
thoſe other little Objections which ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
ſince when the chiefeſt Strength that does
uphold an Error is overthrown, 'tis not in the
Power of ſome little Props to maintain and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it: nevertheleſs, leſt the Minds of ſome
ſhould thereby be perplex'd, I here lay down one
general Rule, by which all other Objections
may be eaſily refuted, and that is this:</p>
            <p>If any Principle in Religion be true, by the
greater and by the plainer Number of Evidences,
it can never be falſe by a few in number, or by
them that are dark and doubtful.</p>
            <p>If then the Arguments to prove the true God
to be only the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, are more in
number, and plainer to be underſtood, than
thoſe are which are objected in favour of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58644:32"/>
you need then only to reply thus, that
the Proofs that make for it, are more both in
Number and Weight, than thoſe that are againſt
it; and that therefore 'twould be unpardonable
to ſuffer ſuch Trifles to unſettle and ſhake your
Faith.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Man objects againſt the Doctrine of
God's being but one in Perſon, this Text, <hi>Let
us make Man,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. and endeavour to
prove from thence, that God is more than one
in Perſon, is it reaſonable to ſuffer this to alter
your Judgment, when for that one Paſſage, <hi>Vs,</hi>
urged in favour of the Belief of more Perſons
than one, you have ten thouſand that mention
God to be but only one, in ſuch Terms as theſe,
<hi>I, thou, me, he, his?</hi> And as for the Terms of
<hi>we, they, them,</hi> &amp;c. they are not mentioned in
Scripture ſo much as once, as applied to God
alone.</p>
            <p>If every ſingle Objection that is ſtarted ſhould
be admitted to be of Authority ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate
the beſt and cleareſt Proofs; or if every
hard and doubtful Paſſage in Scripture were
enough to overthrow all them that are clear and
plain, then all true Religion would ſoon be at
an end: for ſome plauſible Exceptions may be
made againſt the chiefeſt and plaineſt Truths in
Religion, otherwiſe ſo many falſe and erroneous
Opinions would not have obtained that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that they have in the World.</p>
            <p>Indeed when we are told plainly, that we are
in an Error, and Arguments truly conſiderable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58644:33"/>
are at the ſame time offered to undeceive us,
we ought then to ſuffer our ſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd:
for if what is thus urged carries with
it ſo much clear Evidence as makes it undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the changing then of our Opinions will
not only be reaſonable, but very honourable
too, ſince nothing is more ignoble and baſe
than to be a Slave to Error, from which not
any thing in this World but Truth can free us.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Of the true Notion of the Holy Ghoſt.</head>
            <p>'Tis plain from the general Analogy of true
Faith, grounded on Scripture-Evidence, that
the Holy Ghoſt is no diſtinct Perſon ſubſiſting of
himſelf; for then 'tis clear, that our Lord could
not be the Son of him who is now called God
the Father, or the firſt Perſon in the ſuppoſed
Trinity, ſince 'tis plain that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s
Conception was occaſioned by the <hi>overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Luke 1. 35. which all
Trinitarians acknowledg to be the third Perſon,
and not the firſt: 'Tis expreſly ſaid, that <hi>that
which was conceived in her was of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
Mat. 1. 20. <hi>And that ſhe was with Child by
him,</hi> Mat. 1. 18. Wherefore 'tis evident from
theſe additional Words, <hi>and the Power of the
Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee,</hi> Luke 1. 35. that
the Holy Ghoſt is only that Divine and Inviſible
Power of God, by which he works his Will and
Pleaſure in the World; and by Conſequence,
that God, and the Spirit of God, are no more
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58644:33"/>
two diſtinct Perſons than Man and the Spirit of
Man are; for to the one the other is compared
in the ſacred Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. And as
the Members of Man's Body do ſecretly and
wonderfully obey the Dictates of his Will or
Mind, ſo, and much more ſo, do all Creatures
act, and are commanded by the Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God's Divine and moſt Wiſe Will and
Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>When therefore all the elect People of God
are ſaid to be ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, it
muſt be underſtood of that new Temper and
Inclination of Mind which God by his Divine
and Inviſible Power does work or cauſe in Men.
When he powerfully raiſes up in them holy
Thoughts, and excites in their Minds new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
he is then truly ſaid to ſanctify them by
his Spirit: And when Men wilfully reject thoſe
Motions to Goodneſs, which God by his Power
does raiſe up in them, they are then truly ſaid
to reſiſt, and grieve, and quench his Spirit.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Spirit is ſaid to receive, and
to be ſent, from whence ſome would infer its
diſtinct Perſonality: 'tis replied, that theſe are
but improper Expreſſions, ſuch as are before
noted to be ſpoken of God and Chriſt; they
are Words fitted to our dull Apprehenſions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to the true Nature of the Spirit it ſelf,
even as God is repreſented as having the Actions
and Paſſions of a Man, and to come down
from Heaven, when yet we know that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
every where, though our mortal Eyes have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58644:34"/>
not Powers fitted to perceive him: He that
filleth all things can no ways be capable of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out of his Place. Such Expreſſions as
theſe therefore are plainly improper, and muſt
not be underſtood literally, or as at firſt ſight
they ſeem to expreſs.</p>

            <head>The CONCLVSION.</head>
            <p>TO what has been ſaid on this Subject, I
will only add this one ſolemn Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that as what I here offer is grounded on the
Dictates only of plain and poſitive Scripture,
and the moſt evident and perfect Reaſon, as I
humbly judg: So the Deſign of this its Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is the alone Glory of God Almighty,
and the Church's Peace, which no ways can be
eſtabliſh'd firmly but on the Foundations of
Truth.</p>
            <p>And though I am ſenſible the Work is not
perform'd with that Exactneſs as to be in every
part without Reproof, yet I am ſatisfied that in
the main I have therein managed the true Cauſe
of God and Religion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I have a ſecret Diſtruſt within
me, that what I here offer will not be kindly
received: for my beſt Indeavours muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to find better Succeſs than did thoſe of my
bleſſed Lord and Maſter; who, though <hi>he ſpake
as never Man ſpake,</hi> and confirmed his Doctrine
with ſuch Miracles as did demonſtrate him to be
a Teacher <hi>ſent of God,</hi> yet was believed on but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58644:34"/>
by a few: The Praiſe of Men was then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
much more belov'd than the Praiſe of God;
<hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 43.</p>
            <p>And I doubt the Caſe is ſtill the ſame; Men
now ſeek their own and not the things of Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. They that love Riches
will hardly run the hazard of loſing any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Preferment for the ſake of Truth. Others
will be averſe from acknowledging themſelves in
a Miſtake, who before have been honoured with
the Repute both of Orthodox and Learned Men;
and thoſe who have been long prepoſſeſs'd with
the contrary Perſwaſion, will hardly relinquiſh
it, though the beſt of Reaſons be offered to
convince them of their Error.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Religion of Mankind generally
is but a Self-righteouſneſs, a Law rather of their
own making than of God's appointing. There
are but very few that in all things do either live
or believe as the Goſpel directs them: the whole
World does for the moſt part prefer ſome ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Humour before ſacred Truth, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Bliſs to which it would conduct them.</p>
