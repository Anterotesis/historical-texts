            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conjectures, and direct it to conceive (but pardon
me good Sir, if I mistake you, as you seem to
have mistaken me) that you took a small appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a doubt, rather to initiate my notice of
you with a Scholasticall Treatise (for which I
thank you) then that you need any satisfaction

That is more considerable (me thinks) which
you have said by way of doubt, concerning some
conformity betwixt the Oath of the sixt Canon,
and the late Protestation framed in the Commons
House of Parliament; wherof you make a Quere,
and to which I will first give answer; and then
clear the case of Conscience from just cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I choose to begin with that, though you
end with it. Because,</p>
            <p>1. It is meet in good manners, that I give that
Honourable Assembly precedence of Apology be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my self.</p>
            <p>2. Because my doubts of the Oath are placed, in
order of my tractates, before the case of conscience,
where you have either found, or made an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>
               <hi>Touching the former, your words are these,</hi> See

the true reformed Protestant Religion expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

The lawfull Rights and Liberties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,

the same. And to my power, and as farre as lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I may, I will oppose, and by all good wayes and
means endeavour to bring to condigne punishment all
such as shall either by force, practice, counsels, plots,

of any thing in this present Protestation contained:
And further that I shall in all iust and honourable

            <p>Wheras some doubts have been raised by severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
out of this House, concerning the meaning of
these words, contained in the Protestation lately made
by the members of this House; [viz. <hi>the true refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

                  </gap>otestant Religion, expressed in the Doctrin
of the Church of England, against all Popery and
Popish Innovations within this Realm, contrary
to the same Doctrine</hi>] This House doth declare that
by those words, was, and is meant, only the publike
Doctrine professed in the said Church, so farre as it is
opposite to Popery and Popish Innovations: and that
the said words are not to be extended to the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of any firme of worship, discipline or Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor of any Rites or Ceremonies of the said Church
of England.</p>
            <p>If it were so, that the doubts of the Oath stood
up (as your Quere hath it) against the Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or that they were an invitation of scruples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, it were not my fault; for my book of
doubts was made (though not printed) before
there was any intimation or expectation of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
especially by those whose mansion is so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94344:5"/>
remote from the mysteries of State, so farre below
the orbe of the highest Intelligence as mine is.</p>
            <p>2. I doubt not to make it plain, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencies
betwixt the Parliamentary Protestation,
and the Canonicall Oath are so many and so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that a man may with good conscience and
discretion suspect much perill in taking the Oath,
and be well assured of the safety in taking the
Protestation composed in the Parliament.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reall differencies betwixt the Protestation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

               <p>THe differences betwixt the Protestation of the

               <p>The Reall are such as concern the matter and

and that which is peculiar to either.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which is common to both is,</hi> the asserting

               </p>
               <p>And in what sence we may well understand
these words in the printed Protestation (though
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94344:6"/>
I will not take upon me to interpret it, except for
satisfaction to my self, and to such as require my
Judgement of it) in my conceipt is very clear,
especially by the Declaration annexed to many
printed copies of that Protestation (though that
which you sent me came forth without it) in
this tenour; by these words: <hi>[The true reformed
Protestant Religion, expressed in the Doctrine of the
church of England against all Popery and Popish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
within this Realme, contrary to the same
Doctrine, was and is meant only the publike Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
professed in the church of</hi> England; <hi>so farre
as it is opposite to Popery and Popish Innovations]</hi>
And that is (as I take it without taking upon
me the Authority of an Interpreter of it, save as
before I have said) the Doctrin contained in the
39. Articles. For,</p>
               <p>First, that is the most publick Doctrin of the
Church; because in the Church of every Parish,
all that are admitted into Benefices must publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read the 39. Articles unto the people within
the first month of their admission to them, upon
perill of loosing their livings by falling into
lapse.</p>
               <p>2. That Doctrin is most professedly the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for all Doctours
and teachers of the Church are bound, so farre to
professe it, as to subscribe unto those Articles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which subscription, they are not to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for publike Preachers, or teachers, at least not
admitted into pastorall charges, in the Church of
England.</p>
               <p>3. The Doctrin of those Articles is most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to Popery, and popish Innovations; for
they were framed and tempered of purpose for an
Antidote to Popery, in the Raign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>

TO these particulars, I might adde other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
tenets of our Church, out of the Books of
Homilies, wherin, though there be some things
doubtfull, there are many very true and Orthodox
Doctrines, very soundly stated and proved, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
pressed against the Heresies of Popery; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these thirty-nine Articles there are some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
opposite to Popery, which I have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
as the tenth of Freewill; and the thirteenth
of workes done before Justification, because the
Antithesis betwixt the Protestant and Popish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
by the subtile and ambiguous formes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
(on the Popish-side) is made more intricate
and problematicall, then in the rest, and in these

from it (which was the most dangerous part

<hi>as the Power and Priviledges of</hi> Parliaments, <hi>the

He gave him one hand, and laying the other

               <p>The manner of an Oath among us is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>A man may be willing to promise, vow and
protest, and he is bound in conscience to make
good his word, whether it be promise, vow or

of what he so saith, with a pawn or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture

comfort) and to be whipt, or hang'd, or burnt, or

undertaketh: and yet all this is nothing, to lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jesus Christ and his merits to pawne, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
all right and interest to him and them: and
imprecating all the curses and comminations in

he doth who taketh it, if his sincerity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy

               <p>They who sent forth the Protestation were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly

               <p>3. For <hi>Integrity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Integrity.</note> the Protestation came from
those, who give undoubted evidence of their dislike
of all, both black and blanched Popery, opposing,
not only the <hi>grosser Tenets</hi> and superstitions of the
<hi>Romish-Religion,</hi> but the <hi>Arminian-fallacies</hi> which
are devised to ensnare the subtler, as the other to
deceive the simpler sort, and they shew therin a
sincere and uniforme affection and fore-cast to the
welfare of the King and his Subjects of all sorts,
and to the establishment of Religion, Justice and
Peace, throughout all the Kingdomes of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Dominions. I am sorry we cannot say nor
thinke so of some, who had too great a sway in
composing of the Canons; and who are probably
suspected of a partiall intent to maintain their own
interests, and to support their Ecclesiasticall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
with little regard of the good of the inferiour
Clergy, how good soever, or of the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their particular charges.</p>
               <p>4. For <hi>Benignity;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> our Protestant leaders of the
Commons-House, give leave to private persons out
of their House, to make doubts concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of some words, contained in their Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But some of our Canonicall Lords (who would
have us rather their sworne-men, then the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
free Ministers; and would have us give our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to their dictates, with an implicite faith) much
disliked our doubting of their new devised Oath,
notwithstanding it be of much more perillous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to us, then this Protestation can be to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and therfore some have bin called in question,
and strictly examined (as if they had been suspected
of some haynous crime) concerning the shewing or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94344:21"/>
communicating of the London Ministers Quaeries of
the Oath to the reading of others.</p>
               <p>2. The Composers of this Protestation were so
facile and favourable to those that doubted of it, that
what did scruple them, they expresly discharged and
excluded out of the compasse of their Protestation,
and that with such readinesse and expedition, that
to many, if not to most, the doubt was rather
prevented then removed, the Protestation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
comming both at once unto their hands.</p>
               <p>But the doubts of the Oath were not so tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken to heart by some of our Ecclesiasticall
Governours, though their title Fathers obliged them
to more mildenesse and pitty to their perplexed
sonnes: for some were so farre from a compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
complying with us, by with-drawment of
that which was so full of ambiguity and danger
in our apprehension, that for moving doubts unto
them (though with as much meeknesse and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of spirit as the cause would well beare) some
of us were noted as adversaries to them, and so
accompted not onely uncapable of their fatherly
indulgence, but unworthy the good will and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of our Bretheren: And if they had still
been as predominant as of late they were, wee
might have expected rather punishment,<note n="b" place="margin">See the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, p. 162.</note> as for
some high presumption against our Superiours, then
any satisfaction of our scruples, or removall of the
scandals that did offend us.</p>
               <p>This may suffice to manifest such disparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Oath and Protestation, that he that is
afraid to take the one, may have a good heart to
take the other. By that which hath bin said you
will well perceive that the doubts in my booke
are blocks lying at the doore of the Convocation
house (where the Oath was framed) none of them
will be found in the way of the House of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

that the whole benefit may be received by one; and
that Christ is no lesse present to the faithfull in the
one element then in the other, or in both together; then
me thinks it is not well done by any of our side, to
foment or cherish so great a controversie, as is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
betwixt us Protestants and the Papists, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the obolition of the Communion Cup.</p>

he would perhaps have taxed you for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>andering
his Church; since though the Communion Cup
be with-held from the Laity, it is not <hi>abolished:</hi>
for you know (and you shew it afterwards out of

so just, as to give the Divell his due, and therfore
would not make any point of Popery (which is
bad enough) worse then it is) I answer for my
selfe touching your conceipt of my conformity
with the Seminary Priest, that we differ in two
main Points (which are noted by your self) besides
divers others.</p>
               <p>First, that the Seminary equals one Element with
both, I comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re the one with the other, the Cup
with the bread, and say there is no more necessity
of the one then of the other: neither <hi>necessitate med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
(for the one is not either more or lesse needfull to a
Christian then the other) nor <hi>necessitate precepti</hi> (for
both were alike, and together prescribed by the same
precept) if you hold otherwise, you must shew that
the bread is more necessary then the Cup, or the Cup
more necessary then the bread; and that the one was
prescribed, the other but permitted, or wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Christs institution.</p>
               <p>2. The Seminary holds one as sufficient as both,
both for efficacy, and for signification. I compare the
one with the other, but for efficacy (as your self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94344:23"/>
and if you hold that the faithfull receiving of
the one is not as effectuall as the faithfull recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the other, shew which of the two hath
the preheminence of efficacy, and your reason
why.</p>
               <p>3. Your Seminary Priest (especially if commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
at Rome (as you note he was, and it may be
yet is) holds himselfe bound to beliefe and pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise
of the decrees of the Councels of <hi>Constance,
Basil</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> (as I have set them down in the Popish
contradiction to our 30. Article) which not onely
forbid the use of the Communion Cup to the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in common, but excommunicateth and anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizeth
those that contradict their decree: I
hold it is most soundly determined (in our thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth)
<hi>That the Cup of the Lord is not to be denied
to the Lay-people, for both parts of the Lords Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(by Christs ordinance and commandement) ought
to be administred to all Christian men alike;</hi> and I
take it for no lesse then<note n="h" place="margin">I ranke the Papists with grosse Heretiks for taking the Communion Cup from the Laity. In my case of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, p. 15, 16.</note> Heresie and a most impious

which his beneficence bequeathed to them
when he left this world.</p>
               <p>Therefore (Sir) there is certainly very good cause
(though you seeme to doubt of it) why you and
I should contest in this controversie against the
Seminaries Tenet; Yea why the Protestant Church
should be for ever at unreconcilable odds and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

me, touching the manner of the presence of Christ in
the Sacrament: since,</p>
               <p>First, my words gave you no cause to suspect
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94344:24"/>
me, as either unsound or ambiguous in that point:
For they are these <hi>[nor is Christ lesse present to the
faithfull in the one then in the other]</hi> whereby you
may well enough perceive, I meane (as a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
should doe) such a presence as is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the 15. Article of our Religion, <hi>viz. the
body of Christ</hi> (and the same must necessarily bee
conceived of his blood) <hi>is given, taken and eaten in
the Supper onely after an heavenly and spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the means whereby it is received and eaten in
the Supper is faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And supposing your Seminary Priest (as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
of reason you must) to be a Papist, you need
not doubt but he holds such a presence as you set
downe, for the<note n="k" place="margin">Ibid.</note> second member of your four-fold
distinction of presence, a corporeall presence by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
which (according to the 38. Article
of our Church) I condemne, as repugnant to the
plaine words of Scripture, and destructive of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>This is enough to make me an Hereticke to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and that Papists for their Sacramentall Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               </p>
               <p>If I have pusled you in that I have said, you
have cryed quittance with me in your distinction
of <hi>[comparatively for dimension or number]</hi> for I
cannot understand with any congruity to the point
in hand, what you meane by the difference betwixt
<hi>dimension</hi> and <hi>number,</hi> if you had said [for <hi>degree</hi>
or <hi>number</hi>] the termes of your distinction (being
lodged in divers predicaments) might have been
more easily conceived, and then I should have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
your doubt to be, <hi>whether the necessity be as

               <p>If you enquire of the comparison of one single
Element with the other, I have answered you to
that already: if of one with both, my words

give you none occasion of such a doubt: for I
compare but one with one, not one with both,

two reasons, which have had the approbation of
as learned and judicious Divines as any I know.
The one is that <hi>by receiving the one kinde</hi> [re] <hi>the

desire (when it cannot really be had, or not so recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
the party receiveth Christ, and with Christ both
his body and blood.</hi> The other is, <hi>that it seemes hard
measure to debarre any from both parts of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because God hath enabled them to partake but
of one, especially if they much desire it, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to scruples and discomforts if they should want it.</hi>

Sacramentall signes or elements, and the thing of the
Sacrament, that is, Christ which is signified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented

               <p>In application of which distinction, I say first, that
on both sides it is held, as<note n="*" place="margin">At the letter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. For <hi>res Sacramentalis,</hi> or the Sacramentall
signes, there is no difference for the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but on both sides it is held that Christ is no
lesse present to the faithfull receiver, when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the one signe then when he receiveth the other,
which is all one as if we should say, that the bread
hath no preheminence over the wine, nor the wine
over the bread, as to a Sacramentall either ordinance
or operation, and therfore,<note n="z" place="margin">D. Willet Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops Papis. 13. Gen. controv. q. 8. p. 644.</note> as Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> rightly

the bread, and have given the Cup without bread, as

               </p>
               <p>But if the Sacrament be received but in one kind,
though in such a case as that I discussed, you seem
to deny participation of Christ and Sacramentall
efficacy; otherwise your professed pleading against
mine assertion were very impertinent, and if that
be your mind, I shall desire your further considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

But of the spirituall concomitance, that is of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
whole Christ in spirituall manner, though
but one element be received, as in the case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
fore-mentioned and presupposed in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the case of conscience, there is good
reason very agreeable to Orthodox Doctrine; as</p>
               <p>First, because the means of receiving Christ spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
is by faith, according to our fifteenth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and faith so layeth hold upon Christ, as to be
partaker of whole Christ, according to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
concomitancy fore-mentioned, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by our Protestant Authours.</p>
               <p>2. Though the manner of signification of Christ
be divers betwixt the Sacrament of Baptisme and
the Lords Supper, yet Christ the thing signified is
as fully exhibited to those that are fit to receive
it by the use of one element (though but water)
as by the use of both those of the Eucharist, bread
and wine; and therfore it is true which<note n="f" place="margin">In baptism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3. Then if one have received the bread (faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
beleeving that he receiveth whole Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Protestant concomitancy fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
should by some extraordinary hap be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of the other part of the Sacrament (as
sometimes it hath, and too oft may fall out in
Congregations of the Country, where there may
be an unexpected failing of wine, and no timely

supply from Vintners to be expected, doth that
failing which was none of the receivers fault, make
his faith to faile, which was his duty and vertue
rightly exercised upon the right object, if it doe
not in a case of such necessity, as I discussed, the
faithfull receiver may receive whole Christ, though
