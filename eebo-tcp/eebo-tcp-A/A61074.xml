            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>A Prison is a Cage of certain Cares,</l>
               <l>Whose Birds sing tunes of Discords and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs.</l>
               <l>So fares it in this fickle world;</l>
               <l>Man's like a Foot-ball toss'd and hurl'd.</l>
               <l>Even the poor and honest Prisoners lie,</l>
               <l>Like silver Swans, to sing their last, and die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But what's a Prison, when the Soul is free!</l>
               <l>A Jayl is but the worlds Epitome:</l>
               <l>There ye contemplate how to lie</l>
               <l>I'th' Grave, before ye come to die;</l>
               <l>VVhilst others heaping up their stores of Pelf,</l>
               <l>Have no more Land, when dead, then you your self.</l>

               <l>That they'd be glad to be as ye are now.</l>
               <l>Your want of liberty's a Rod,</l>
               <l>To scourge you nearer to your God.</l>
               <l>Thus Providence to Pris'ners is most kinde,</l>

               <l>Let Reason be your vertue, and your Guide:</l>

               <l>Laugh at those Sorrows come to day;</l>
               <l>To morrow they may pass away.</l>

               <l>Happie's that Pris'ner, that can live above</l>
               <l>The reach of Fate, or the Intrigues of Love:</l>
               <l>There's no light object to pervert</l>
               <l>The Candour of an upright heart.</l>
               <l>Those Iron-bars that do your bodies hold,</l>
               <l>Are far less burthen some then Chains of Gold.</l>

               <l>Where Care will help, there have a careful heart;</l>
               <l>Where Care will not, ne'r act a foolish part:</l>
               <l>For all the help that Care can do,</l>
               <l>Is but to make One Sorrow Two.</l>
               <l>Then take no Care but onely to be Jolly.</l>
               <l>To be more wretched then ye need, is folly.</l>
