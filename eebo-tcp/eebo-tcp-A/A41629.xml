         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

INTRODUCTION
To the enſuing
ANSVVER.</head>
            <p>SOme have wondred, whilſt others Triumph't,
and a late Writer particularly hath vainly
boaſted, in a certain<note n="*" place="margin">Publiſht at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </note> Letter to a Friend, that
Two great Doctors of the Engliſh Church,
had <hi>baffled their Adverſaries of</hi> Rome <hi>even to the
ſilencing of that Party,</hi> and all this was becauſe the
Diſcourſe againſt Tranſubſtantiation lay ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwer'd.
The beſt account, that I can give of the ſo
long ſilence, is, that the more conſiderate knew, that
the ſaid Diſcourſe contained no new matter, but only
what had been very often objected againſt us ſince the
Pretended Reformation of the Engliſh Church, and
as often fully Anſwered, as alſo, that there have been

Author, and<note n="b" place="margin">Pa. 42. Of the Diſcourſe againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</note> cited by the Diſcourſer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
wherein the Objections againſt Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are put much further than this late Diſcourſe
urges them, and all clear'd beyond the Power of any
ſolid Anſwer; and we find none for many Years laſt
<pb facs="tcp:58171:3"/>
paſt ſo much as offer'd at againſt the ſaid Treatiſes,
nor yet to a more compendious one Entitled, <hi>A Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Diſcourſe concerning Tranſubſtantiation</hi>
Publiſh't 1676. In which the chief Objections repeated
ſince by the Diſcourſer are fully clear'd. Moreover,
the Doctrin of the Engliſh Church concerning the Real
Preſence being no leſs vigorouſly attacqu't by the late
Diſcourſer, than that of the Roman Catholic, it was
thought more proper, that ſome of them ſhould have
firſt return'd an Anſwer to it, becauſe they had the
greater Reaſon to reſent the injury done them, ſince
a wound from a pretended Friend is more grievous
than from a profeſt Adverſary.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I would not have the Genuin Sons of the
Engliſh Church to think, that we differ ſo much with
them in this Point, as ſome by Miſrepreſenting the
thing, would make us to do, ſeeing that they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <hi>praeſentiam non minus
quam nos veram; no leſs True Preſence of Chriſts
Body in the Sacrament, than we do,</hi> and I am
ſure that is True enough; our difference with them,
(who deny Conſubſtantiation, as is manifeſt from
their Writings,) being only about the not admitting
the Word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> whereas they have ſo
long freely acknowledged the thing. For if the Body
of Chriſt be Really preſent in the Sacrament, and not
with the ſubſtance of Bread, it muſt be there without
it, under the External Species only of Bread, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
ſuch a change of ſubſtance as the Catholic
Church calls Tranſubſtantiation, muſt certainly be
made; and there can be no other Senſe given of that
Real Preſence which hath been received in their
Church.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:58171:3"/>

the weak endeavor of an imperfect Anſwerer
to the Animadverſions upon the Alterations of their
Rubrick lately Publiſht, to ſhew the contrary. Which
that it may the more plainly appear, I ſhall add one
Obſervation made by a Famed Doctor of their Church,
which will be the more Authentick, becauſe it was drawn
from their Records.</p>
            <p>It was propoſed, <hi>ſaith this</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Part 2. p. 390. Of the Reign of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> See alſo Dr. <hi>Heylins Cypria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Anglicus,</hi> p. 22. in the Introduction.</note> 
               <hi>Doctor,</hi> to have
the Communion Book, <hi>viz. That put forth in the
beginning of Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Reign,</hi> ſo contriv'd,
that it might not exclude the Belief of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Preſence: (<hi>I doubt not, but they meant after a
Spiritual manner, as Catholics do ſuitably to St.</hi> Paul
<hi>who uſes the words</hi> Spiritual Body <hi>to ſignifie a</hi> Real
<hi>Body exiſting after a Spiritual manner</hi>) For the
chief Deſign of the Queens Council was to unite
the Nation in one Faith, and the Greater part of
the Nation continued to believe ſuch a Preſence;
(<hi>which however ſeems to have been determin'd againſt
in their former Articles and Rubrick.</hi>) Thereupon,
the Rubrick that explain'd the reaſon for kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Sacrament, that thereby no Adoration
is intended to any Corporal Preſence of Chriſts
Natural Fleſh and Blood, becauſe that is only in
Heaven, which had been in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
is left out—<note n="*" place="margin">Part 2. of Hiſt. Reform. p. 405.</note> 
               <hi>And</hi> in the Article about the
Lords Supper <hi>the</hi> Refutation of the Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<hi>was by</hi> Common conſent left out. —And in
the next Convocation the Articles were ſubſcribed
<pb facs="tcp:58171:4"/>
without them, of which, <hi>he tells us,</hi> he had ſeen
the Original. <hi>Now, whatſoever this Doctor (whoſe
uſual Practice it hath been, like the Snake in the Fable,
to bite and betray thoſe that have cheriſht him) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to know of a</hi> Secret <hi>concerning this matter,
(for which he doth not bring the leaſt proof or Authority,
whereas he had ſeen the Original to be an evidence of
what he had before ſaid,) yet for my part I have more
Deference for the Engliſh Church, than to believe that
the Real Preſence of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament
was, after ſo much conſideration about the matter,
(now behold the ſecret comes out,</hi>) left as a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Opinion, <hi>as he ſaith,</hi> and not determin'd, but
every Man left to the freedom of his own mind,
becauſe an expreſs Definition againſt the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
might drive from the Church many who
were ſtill of that perſwaſion. <hi>For then thoſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
alter'd Articles and Rubrick had only been made
as a Trap to draw Men into Idolatry, and keep them in
it, if you will believe ſome of the great Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
who live in Communion, at preſent, with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Church, and yet deny that Real Preſence, which
was both in Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>time, and ever ſince
believed in that Church, and tax thoſe with Idolatry
who Worſhip Chriſt thus preſent. Therefore we have
good Reaſon to allow, what he tells us afterwards, that</hi>
ſome (<hi>we are ſure that many of the moſt Learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them</hi>) have ſince truly inferr'd, that the
Chief Paſtors of the Church did then diſapprove
of the Definition made in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and
that they were for a Real Preſence.</p>
            <p>And of this we can make no doubt, when we peruſe
the Writings of thoſe Paſtors, who ſucceeding them till
<pb facs="tcp:58171:4"/>
this very time, have given ſo full an account of their
Faith in this weighty inſtance, and yet have paſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſur'd,
nay, have been of greateſt eſteem in their
Church. And how indeed can we imagin, that Men of
the leaſt ſincerity would leave an Article of infinite
concern to Mens Immortal Souls in ſo undeterminat a
Senſe, that Chriſtians might believe, which they pleas'd,
either that Chriſts Body was thus Really preſent in
the Sacrament, which, if it were not, they incurr'd
the guilt of groſs Idolatry, or that it was not ſo, which
if Really it was, they were guilty of Infidelity, in not
believing Our Lord upon his Word; and a breach of
the firſt Commandment, in not Worſhipping the ſecond
Perſon in the Trinity, preſenting himſelf to us in this
Sacrament; according to that ſaying, of the Great
<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.</note> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> concerning this matter; <hi>Peccamus
non adorando,</hi> We ſin in not Worſhipping? Such an
Equivocation as this, in an Aſſembly of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
upon the propoſal of ſo great a Point, muſt needs
have been of far more dangerous conſequence to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
than the Ambiguous Anſwers of the <hi>Delphic</hi>
Oracle, were to the Heathen World. This far then the
buſineſs is clear'd, that the Real, and not Virtual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
only of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament, was the
Doctrin of the Engliſh Church; for what ſome Men
amongſt them of great Latitude in Belief have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to the contrary, doth not prejudice the truth, which
the more ſound of that Communion have generally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding, that their Late Clergy in the
Year, 1661. in compliance to the Diſſenting Party,
by the chief management of the late Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s
Politic Spirit, were induced after hard ſolliciting
<pb facs="tcp:58171:5"/>
to receive an Additional Declaration, (tho' not Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Rubrick Letter,) at the end of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Service, yet, ſince they would not by any means
be brought to receive the former Declaration of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, without the change of thoſe
words [<hi>It is here declared that no Adoration is here
intended or ought to be done unto any Real and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
Preſence of Chriſts Natural Fleſh and Blood</hi>]
into theſe which follow [<hi>It is here declared, that no
Adoration is here intended or ought to be done,
either unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine there
Bodily Received, or unto any Corporal Preſence
of Chriſts Natural Fleſh and Blood</hi>] the words

            <p>For indeed Tranſubſtantiation is a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of Chriſtian Religion, ſo is the Doctrin
of the Trinity, ſo is the Incarnation of our Lord, to
which the Primitive Fathers do ſo often compare the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
<pb facs="tcp:58171:8"/>
change made in the Sacrament; ſo is the
Reſurrection of our Bodies; yet theſe Articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith are to be believed upon the Authority of the
Revealer, and not too curiouſly to be pried into.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt only upon the Reſurrection at preſent,
to ſhew how little ground they have to believe this, upon
the account of natural Reaſon, who reject the belief of
Tranſubſtantiation, by Vertue of which we receive the
Inſtrument and pledge of our Reſurrection Chriſts
Real Body in the Sacrament: Both theſe indeed may
ſeem contrary to Reaſon, before enlightned by Faith:
For how can that convince us, that the ſame Body
which dies ſhall riſe again; ſince ſome that eat Mans
Fleſh in the extremity of Famin, or, as the Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,
out of luxury, have the ſubſtance of the Bodies,
that they eat, converted into the ſubſtance of their
own Bodies by the way of nouriſhment: And ſeveral
other ways there be, by which the reduced parts of our
Dead Bodies are changed into the ſubſtance of other
Human Bodies, even ſo, that the ſame Bodies may be
claimed by many at the Reſurrection? Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
we believe, that we ſhall riſe with the ſame Bodies
we had, whilſt living. Dim ſighted Reaſon will ask,
how this can be, ſince it is againſt the Nature of a Body
to be in two places at the ſame time? Yet Nature and
experience prepare us for the belief of the Reſurrection,
which ſeems to be againſt Nature, by the example of
thoſe things, which are obvious to Senſe. Seed, as the
Apoſtle inſtanceth, is caſt into the ground, it corrupts,
and yet riſeth again,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 38.</note> for <hi>God giveth it a Body, and
to every Seed it's own Body.</hi> So to diſpoſe us to
the belief of the ſupernatural change made in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nothing is more familiar than Natural Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
<pb facs="tcp:58171:8"/>
for our life is ſuſtained by a dayly change
of the ſubſtance of other Creatures into that of our
Bodies; we ſhould ſoon die without this: Nay we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
breath, but the ſubſtance of our Bodies is converted
into Air; and he that denies this Tranſubſtantiation,
confutes himſelf while he ſpeaks. Thus Bread alſo
was dayly Tranſubſtantiated into our Lords Body,
whilſt he fed upon it here on Earth. All which may
diſpoſe us to believe, that <hi>the Bread</hi> in the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

nouriſhment, but being ſuddainly transform'd
into the Body of the Word, as is ſaid by the
Word, This is my Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if our curious Inquirers ſhall further ask; how
this can be, ſince the accidents or outward ſpecies of
Bread ſtill remain? I deſire them to reſolve theſe
Queſtions: How a thouſand ſpecies can be reflected
from the ſame Glaſs at once, to a thouſand Eyes at the
ſame time? How the ſame Glaſs being whole, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmits
one intire ſpecies, and yet broken into many ſmall
pieces, every piece reflects the ſame whole and intire
ſpecies, there being all the while but one ſubject, and
what that ſubject is wherein theſe ſpecies do ſubſiſt?
Or let them but give a true account of the nature of
any ſmall Particle of that matter, which compoſeth the
Vniverſe, before they pry too far into the ſecrets of
Divine and ſupernatural Myſteries, and think that
God can do nothing, but in ſuch a manner as they can

that, which was before <hi>Bread,</hi> at the beginning of
the Enunciation, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> being now made
to be his <hi>Body</hi> at its Concluſion, becauſe in Practical
Propoſitions as this is, with God to ſay, and to do, are
the ſame thing; and thus you ſee, what is meant by

               <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Veteres Vindicati.</hi> in an Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Letter to Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> of <hi>Putney,</hi> pa. 57.</note> Expoſtulator
<hi>hath ſaid againſt this Explication. He undertakes to</hi>
prove, that the Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi>
cannot be taken in a literal, (<hi>I conceive he means
proper, in oppoſition to Figurative</hi>) Senſe, <hi>which
he ſuppoſes</hi> his Enemies themſelves of our
Party will grant, if he proves that the,
<hi>This,</hi> here mentioned is Bread; <hi>which he thus
undertakes to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> which our Saviour took into
his Hands, (when he was about the Inſtitution)
<pb facs="tcp:58171:10"/>
was Bread; that which he bleſſed was the ſame
thing that he had taken into his hands; that which
he brake was the ſame thing that he had bleſſed;
that which he gave them when he ſaid it was his
Body, was that which he had broken; But that
which he broke, which he bleſſed, which he took
into his hands was Bread: Therefore it was Bread,
which he gave his Diſciples, and by This, is meant
This Bread.</p>
            <p>This<note n="*" place="margin">Obſerve that this is no Induction but rather a Sori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, altho' the Author knew not how to put the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate in their right places. See any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Logic.</note> Induction, <hi>ſaith the Expoſtulator,</hi> is ſo fair
and ſo clear, that I am ſure you cannot evade it.</p>
            <p>But what, Sir, if after all your mighty boaſting,
This prove to be neither a fair Induction, nor any
<hi>Argument</hi> at all, but a mere <hi>Fallacy</hi> or <hi>Illuſion</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from what Logicians call, <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi>
Ignorance of Argument or proof? And juſt ſuch a
one as This would be, if propoſed to you: That which
the Butcher expoſed to Sale was raw Fleſh; that which
you bought was the ſame thing, that the Butcher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Sale; that which you Eat was the ſame thing
that you bought; But that which you bought, which
the Butcher expos'd to Sale was raw Fleſh, therefore
you Eat raw Fleſh. The Kitchin-Boy will tell you
where the Fallacy lies, and help you out at a dead lift.</p>
            <p>But to make the matter yet more plain, I ſhall give
you ſome other inſtances in your way of Sophiſtry,
which the moſt ignorant at the firſt hearing will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to be Fallacies. That which the Servants at the
Marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galiee,</hi> took from the Fountain,
was Water; that which they poured into the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots
was the ſame, that they took from the Fountain;
that which the Gueſts drank was the ſame, that the
Servants put into the Water-pots; But that which
<pb facs="tcp:58171:11"/>
the Servants took from the Fountain, which they pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the Pots was Water; therefore it was Water
which the Gueſts drank. Or your Argument may in
a ſhorter way be turn'd againſt you thus: That which
Chriſt took into his hands, he gave: But, that which he
took into his hands was not Sacramental Bread, nor
virtually Chriſts Body, therefore that which he gave was
not Sacramental Bread, nor virtually Chriſts Body.</p>
            <p>And now repeating your Argument truly, tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all your heap of words, I ſhall expoſe it's Fallacy
plainly. That, you ſay, which Chriſt took, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he
gave; but he took Bread; therefore he gave Bread. I
diſtinguiſh the Major. That he took, he gave; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
or in the ſame manner he took it, I deny:
What he took, he gave, changed and made his Body I
grant, and ſo agreeing he took Bread, I deny your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
Look into your Logic again, obſerve it well,
and you will find, that to make a Propoſition contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to ours, <hi>viz.</hi> That, <hi>that which Chriſt gave
was his Real Body,</hi> you muſt obſerve the Rules of
your Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſo as to ſpeak, <hi>de eodem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,

known how to do. Yet you for all this, would be eſteemed
the <hi>Great Champion</hi> for the Proteſtant cauſe, and
boaſt, that <hi>this</hi> your <hi>matter and Argument is ſo
Demonſtrative, that you cannot but ſtand amazed
that Men, who pretend to reaſon, can refuſe it.</hi>

doth not <hi>fully determin,</hi> that, by <hi>This is my Body</hi>
is meant <hi>This Bread is my Body:</hi> For the word, <hi>This,</hi>
in the Propoſition, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament

ſo that the word <hi>This</hi> ſtill, altho' joyned to Cup, hath
no other kind of ſignification than it hath in the Words,
<hi>This is my Body,</hi> as I have before explained them:
Alſo if it had the Senſe which the Author of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulatory

would be, <hi>This Wine is the New Teſtament in my

words in the Senſe that our Adverſaries put upon them,

two <hi>Bodies of Chriſt,</hi>

               </gap>, Life or Spirit, which
goes along with the Divine Body of this Life or Spirit of
Chriſt, and conſequently is rightly call'd his Body. <hi>For
this, he grounds himſelf upon</hi> that earneſt lofty and ſublime
Diſcourſe (<hi>as he calls it</hi>) of our Saviour <hi>in the 6th. Chapter
of St.</hi> John, confeſſing ingenuouſly, that it ſeems to him
incredible, that under ſo lofty, myſterious a ſtyle, and
earneſt aſſeverations of what he affirms, tho' to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
both of the Jews, and his own Diſciples, there
ſhould not be couched ſome moſt weighty and profound
Truth concerning ſome Real Fleſh and Blood of his, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which this vehement and ſublime Diſcourſe is framed.
<hi>pa. 40. And than again, pa. 42. and</hi> 43. It is plain, <hi>ſays
he,</hi> that our Saviours Diſcourſe in that Chapter, has for
its Object or Subject, not the manner or way of receiving
his Body and Blood, as if meant of that very Body and
Blood on the Croſs, to be receiv'd in a Spiritual manner,
which Interpreters ſeveral of them (<hi>meaning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>)
drive at, and which he thinks would be a very dilute
and frigid Senſe of ſuch high and fervid aſſeverations of our
Saviour; but the Object of his Diſcourſe, <hi>ſays he,</hi> is his
very Fleſh and Blood it ſelf, to be taken (as the Fiſh and
Loaves were wherewith he lately fed them;) or it is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in reference to his Fleſh and Blood, which belongs to
him as he is the Eternal Logos. <hi>Thus evidently did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſeem to this Learned Man,</hi> to ſpeak all along to the
very end of his Diſcourſe, of a Really Eating his Fleſh and
Drinking his Blood; and not of the manner of Eating, as
if it never came nigh them, but only they thought of Fleſh
and Blood, God knows how far diſtant from them, and ſo
Eat the human Fleſh of Chriſt by meer thinking of it, and
Drank his Blood after the ſame imaginary manner. <hi>Thus
to avoid the Catholic Tenent of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation (<hi>which he
could bear no more than the Jews) and yet verifie the Words
of</hi> Chriſts Bodies <hi>being</hi> receiv'd verily and indeed, <hi>and ſuch
other Expreſſions found in the</hi> Catechiſm <hi>and</hi> Homelies <hi>of the
<pb facs="tcp:58171:13"/>
Church of</hi> England (<hi>which he thought himſelf bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
he was driven to diſtinguiſh a</hi> double Body <hi>of Chriſt, the</hi>
one Human and Natural, <hi>the other</hi> Spiritual and Divine, <hi>but</hi>
both Real, <hi>as has been ſaid before. Good God, what Chimera's
will not a mind preoccupated with Error, frame to it ſelf rather
than ſubmit to the Truth!</hi>

               <hi>Luther</hi> indeed tells us of about ten Opinions of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians

in which were reckon'd no leſs than 200 ſeveral Expoſitions of

whom we have now to deal, is, which of theſe (now two hundred
and one) Opinions, it is that they maintain, or whether they
have any other yet in store (for Error hath no End) different
from all theſe. For ſurely after all, they muſt be forc'd to allow,
that there is but one <hi>True Senſe</hi> of our Saviours Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
either that it is his very <hi>true Subſtantial Body,</hi> which is taken

               <p>Concerning the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> one of
the two great poſitive Inſtitutions of the Chriſtian Religion,
there are two main Points of difference between <hi>Us</hi> and the
Church of <hi>Rome. One,</hi> about the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi>
in which they think, but are not certain, that they
have the Scripture and the words of our Saviour on their ſide:
The <hi>other,</hi> about the adminiſtration of this Sacrament to the
People, in both kinds; in which we are ſure that we have the
Scripture and our Saviour's Inſtitution on our ſide; and that
ſo plainly, that our Adverſaries themſelves do not deny it.</p>

               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>COncerning the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Union,<note place="margin">Our Adverſary doth not rightly State the Point.</note> the <hi>Lord's
Supper;</hi> which is the chief of thoſe ſeveral poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Inſtitutions of Religion which Chriſt hath
Ordained in his Church, there are many great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58171:14"/>
even between Proteſtants themſelves; it is no
wonder therefore if there are as many between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
and Catholics: Of theſe the Author gives
two inſtances, the one about the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
the other about the Adminiſtration of
this Sacrament to the People in both kinds: As for that of
Tranſubſtantiation, he would have done well to have told
us, in what ſuppoſition he means to take the Word in his
Diſcourſe. If he ſuppoſe the True, Real and Subſtantial
Preſence of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament, and take the
Word Tranſubſtantiation preciſely, as it ſignifies that
Preſence, not with the Bread, but by it's being chang'd into
his Body, this is a difference indeed, and the only proper
one in this ſuppoſition, between him and Catholics, in
this matter: But then if he would have proceeded ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and as one that was really Maſter of ſo much ſenſe as
he talks of in this Treatiſe, he ſhould have held to his Point,
and not impugned what he ſuppoſes; but if he ſuppoſe
no ſuch Real or Subſtantial Preſence of Chriſts Body, and
under the name of Tranſubſtantiation fight expreſly againſt
the Real Preſence, through his whole Diſcourſe, as it is
evident he doth, (and therefore ought to have call'd it <hi>a
Diſcourſe againſt the Real Preſence, and it's conſequence
Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and not <hi>a Diſcourſe</hi> only, <hi>againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation;</hi>)
then the difference is not only as he would
make it with the Catholics, but with the <hi>Lutherans</hi> alſo,
and thoſe of his own Communion,<note place="margin">See two Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning the Adoration of our B. Saviour in the Sacrament Printed at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> 1687.</note> as King <hi>James,</hi> Biſhop
<hi>Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and many others who profeſs'd
to believe the <hi>Body of Chriſt to be preſent in the Sacrament
no leſs truly than Catholics do.</hi> But however he compoſe
this difference with them, yet the Catholics, as for their
Tenent, do not <hi>think</hi> only, as he ſays, but are <hi>certain,</hi> as
I ſhall ſhew in the Proceſs of this Diſcourſe, that they <hi>have
the Words of our Saviour,</hi> which they do not doubt to be
<hi>Scripture,</hi> on their ſide. And for the other Point, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Adminiſtration of the Sacrament in both kinds, they are
ſure that neither he, nor any of his party have, or ever can
prove from the Scripture and our Saviours Inſtitution,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58171:14"/>
that he laid a Command upon all the Faithful to receive it
always in both kinds, and this they conſtantly affirm. But
before I leave this Paragraph, I cannot but deſire the
Reader to take notice of two things, firſt, That how <hi>ſure</hi>
ſoever the Author makes himſelf, that he hath the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and our Saviours Inſtitution on his ſide,</hi> yet his good
friend Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> in his Rule of Faith,<note place="margin">Pag. 1. 8.</note> which he makes
Scripture only to be, ſpeaking in his own Name, and that
of his Party, ſaith: <hi>We are not Infallibly certain, that any
Book</hi> (for example S. <hi>Matthew</hi> or any other of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,)
<hi>is ſo Ancient as it pretends to be, or that it was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by him whoſe Name it bears, or that this is the ſenſe of ſuch
and ſuch paſſages in it, it is poſſible all this may be otherwiſe.</hi>
The ſecond is, how high ſoever he talk of the Catholics <hi>not</hi>
being <hi>certain,</hi> and his own being <hi>ſure,</hi> of having the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
for them, yet he doth not vouchſafe to tell us what he
means by that <hi>Word, viz.</hi> whether <hi>expreſs Texts,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi>
only. If expreſs Texts: Let him produce one,
if he can, for that new Article of his Creed, (a Creed much

but to Anſwer all the abſurdities, which the Author
is engaged in by eſpouſing falſe principles, and among the
reſt as the chief, that Senſe can judge of the internal nature
or ſubſtance of things: For, all that is the proper object of
Senſe, that is, the ſpecies, or outward accidents of Bread
and Wine, are allowed to be preſent in the Sacrament by all
Catholics as well as Separatiſts: And we ſtrangely admire,
that he ſhould not remember that Rule of his Maſter
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which every young Scholar learns, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Logick, that <hi>Subſtantia non incurrit in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58171:15"/>
ſenſus; Subſtance is not the object of ſenſe.</hi> From whence it
is apparent to all Men that have the uſe of their Reaſon,
that all the Authors cracking confidence upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is founded upon a vulgar Error ſlily inſinuated, that
Catholics believe that which they<note n="*" place="margin">Quod vidiſtis panis eſt &amp; calix, quod vobis etiam oculi veſtri re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciant, quod au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem fides veſtra poſtulat inſtruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, panis eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chriſti, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix Sanguis ejus. <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> Serm ad infant.</note> 
                  <hi>ſee</hi> in the Sacrament of
the Euchariſt, to be the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood
of Chriſt. But leſt any ſhould be deceived with this
popular Argument, and take up a prejudice againſt us as in
good reaſon they may, ſince they are made to believe that
we would perſwade them out of their Senſes; I ſhall be
ſo far from endeavouring to do this, as the Author fondly
imagins all Catholics do; that rather out of a deep ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of gratitude to the great God of Nature, who hath
ſo fearfully and wonderfully made theſe Bodies of ours,
I ſhall freely acknowledge that the Senſes do not deceive
us at all. For the deception doth not lie, at any time,
in the Senſes, but in the Judgment, and the Senſes do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
give true hints to the mind, when their Organs and
the Medium are rightly diſpoſed, and they are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about their proper and adequate Objects. What we
may certainly conclude from the goodneſs and veracity of
God, is, that he will not deceive Man, the Creature that
he loves, and therefore uſually thoſe objects which are
repreſented to him by his Senſes, as having relation to the
conſervation of his Body, are of ſuch and ſuch a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſubſtance, as the outward and ſenſible accidents do
hint them to be of. So that he is not miſtaken in them,
unleſs he judge raſhly, and then too there are means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by which he may correct his Error. Thus the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Fire is generally repreſented under the ſpecies or
uſual form of Fire: Of a Dove under the uſual form or lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Dove: (So that we may allow in this manner, that
ordinarily the ſubſtance doth incur into the mind through
the Senſes, by means of the accidents, but it is certain that
the Senſes cannot judge either of the ſubſtance or accidents.)
Therefore God who is the Author of Nature, and can
change it, when he pleaſeth, that Man may not be deceived
in this kind, doth uſually inform him, when he maketh any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58171:16"/>
ſubſtantial change, of this Nature, in his Creatures,
which is above the reaſon of Man to comprehend, from
any hints made by his ſenſes, as being truly Miraculous.
Thus, when the Holy Ghoſt appeared in the form of
a Dove, Man was informed by God, that it was really the
Holy Ghoſt in ſubſtance of Nature, and not a Dove. When
the ſame Holy Spirit deſcended upon the Apoſtles in the
Viſible appearance of Cloven Tongues of Fire; they had
notice from Heaven, that this was truly that Holy Spirit
which came in this Viſible ſhape. When Angels appeared
in the forms of Men; they had it revealed to them, that
they were, notwithſtanding, Angels. When our Lord
preſented himſelf to his Diſciples under the ſpecies of
Bread, he told them plainly, that it was his Body. To
ſhew which Revelation to have been made, from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Holy Scripture and Fathers, will be the ſubject
of the enſuing Diſcourſe: This which I have here ſaid, being
fully concluſive againſt the Argument of ſenſe's being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the Judge of ſubſtance. And now who is it that
abuſeth the ſenſes, the Author, or Catholics? He, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
them to judge of ſubſtance, which is an object that
is no way adequate to them, would make them to deceive
Men. We, employing them about their proper objects,
which are here the accidents, or outward ſpecies of Bread
and Wine, which, as by them we are convinced, do ſtill
remain after Conſecration, prove the Miracle from ſenſe;
becauſe at the ſame time that theſe appear, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
being inlightened by Faith, diſcerns the true and
real ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, to be veiled under them,
which makes the thing truly Miraculous. To employ
therefore the ſenſes about their true and adequate objects,
and the mind about thoſe which are proper to it, is ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:
But to advance ſenſe above reaſon, and even Faith it
ſelf; the Beaſt above the Man, and the Chriſtian too, as
the Author doth, is ſuch a piece of ſtupidity, as is not to
be parallel'd.</p>

to follow him in ſuch dirty way as he takes. It is
not at all ſuitable to the retiredneſs, wherein our Devout
minds ſhould be entertained, when we conceive of a thing ſo
truly Divine, to ſpeak ſlightly. I muſt intreat therefore
the Candid Reader, to abſtract his thoughts wholly from
the Bleſſed Sacrament, at ſuch time as any of this froth is
caſt back again upon the Author, which I heartily wiſh he
had ſpared me the pains of doing; and that he had kept
his <hi>Egg</hi> and his <hi>Elephant</hi> to himſelf: The Analogy would
have been more eaſily made out by thoſe, who maintain
that Grace, and Vertue are <hi>the Body and Blood of Chriſt
verily and indeed received</hi> (for ſo an Egg is vertually at leaſt

generated out of an Egg) then by ſuch as hold with the

Blood of Chriſt. Now, how to change a <hi>Musket-bullet</hi> into
a <hi>Pike,</hi> I confeſs I know not; The Dragoons better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

that any Man ſhould write a Book, to prove that an Egg is not
an Elephant, and that a Musket-bullet is not a Pike;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a thouſand pities, that ſo curious a Wit as his,
ſhould be concern'd in ſo abſurd an enterpriſe as he believes
his to be. And yet, Good God, what will not the confident
preſumption of ſome Men put them upon! he undertakes a
task fully as impoſſible to be performed as that; and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more dangerous conſequence, to prove that not
to be, which by the power of God, is really made to be
in the Sacrament. The Author knows, that the Catholic
Church grounds this wonderful change, made in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
upon <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> which depends upon the
Veracity of God: So that it will not be ſo very hard a caſe,
to maintain by a diſcourſe much ſhorter than this of the
Author, even our Lords Words of Inſtitution, that what
we ſee, and handle, and taſte as Bread, is not Bread in
ſubſtance, but the Body of Chriſt; and what we ſee and
taſte as Wine, is not Wine in ſubſtance, but the Blood
of our Saviour. <hi>And if this evidence may not paſs for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
without any further proof, I do not ſee why any Man,
that hath confidence enough to do ſo, may not deny any thing to
be what all the World ſees it is, or affirm any thing to be what

Infallible than our ſenſes) <hi>and this without all poſſibility of

God, can no ways conclude his ſenſes to be veracious.
The denial then of the Real Preſence, or <hi>Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The neceſſity of underſtanding our Lords words in the Senſe of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is a neceſſity of underſtanding thoſe words
of our Saviour in the Senſe of the</hi> Real Preſence or <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi>
For theſe <hi>two Reaſons.</hi> 1. Becauſe although there
be many <hi>figurative expreſſions in Scripture,</hi> which all men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
yet this, in relation to the Caſe in hand, is not ſuch.
2. Although <hi>a Sacrament admits of Figures,</hi> which no man
is ſo <hi>abſurd</hi> as to deny, <hi>ſince it is of the very nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
to repreſent and exhibit ſome inviſible grace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by an outward Sign and Figure;</hi> Yet the Figure doth not
lie where the Author pretends it doth. The Rule which
men ought to obſerve in their diſcourſe in relation to Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
is this, That a Figure ſhould not be uſed which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
doth not eaſily apprehend to be ſo. To compare,
therefore, a Figure, which all the World can eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
to be ſo, with an expreſſion which no man can Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue
to be a Figure, according to the Rules of human
Diſcourſe, is very abſurd: Yet ſuch is the Authors inſtance
from Scripture. From whence he alledgeth, that when
our Saviour gave the Cup, he ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the New
Teſtament in my Blood, which is ſhed,</hi> (or more properly pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out) <hi>for you, and for many, for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Did
not our Lord plainly read in the minds of his Diſciples,
that, by the <hi>Cup,</hi> they would underſtand, that which was
contained in the Cup? If any one ſhould adviſe the Author,
when he is thirſty, to drink off his Glaſs, would he be ſo
inconſiderate as to ſwallow it together with the Wine?
Nay further, ſo unhappy is the Author, as to urge this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of holy Scripture in the firſt place, which alone is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58171:20"/>
enough fully to clear the Point againſt him. Neither the
Apoſtles, nor any men elſe could be ſo ignorant of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of human diſcourſe, as not to apprehend, that our
Saviour, by the <hi>Cup,</hi> meant what was contained in it, which
was moſt certainly Chriſts Blood; for otherwiſe it could
not be ſaid of it, as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. that it was then <hi>poured
out for</hi> the Apoſtles, and <hi>for many, for the remiſſion of Sins:</hi>
it is ſaid, <hi>is poured out,</hi> in the Preſent Tenſe; not, <hi>ſhall be
poured out,</hi> in the Future; therefore here can be meant,
only the Blood of Chriſt, as now poured out in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
for them, not as it was afterwards ſhed from his
Crucified Body upon the ground.<note place="margin">Luke 22. 20.</note> The Original runs thus,

effected in this Sacrament, which is ſignified by the form

urg'd by him from Scripture for Tranſubſtantiation, is a

poſitively from Scripture, <hi>that both theſe things are made
to be in this Sacrament,</hi> viz. <hi>The Exiſtence of the Body of

this but Tranſubſtantiation? Therefore what the Authors

indeed, ſpeaking of the words of Inſtitution, ſaith:

But this good Martyr doth not ſay, that Chriſts words of

the Power of Prieſts, NOW, to Conſecrate in our Maſs

of the Bread his Fleſh, and of the Wine his Blood, it doth not

                  <hi>If the Subſtance,</hi> ſaith

to have ſaid otherwiſe than he hath ſaid:</hi> And again, <hi>If the
ſubſtance of Bread remain, then Chriſt ought to have ſpoke
otherwiſe.</hi> We muſt take notice, that this Pious Biſhop was
defending Tradition as neceſſary for the Interpretation
of ſome places of Scripture, and particularly ſuch which
relate to the Power that thoſe who ſucceed the Apoſtles
have to Conſecrate, and upon very good Grounds, ſince
without Tradition, we cannot conclude the Scripture it
ſelf to be the Word of God; and no Church can prove
the Succeſſion of her Paſtors to this high Function, which
is without doubt a Fundamental Point. Since therefore
the Proteſtants hold, that there is a lawful Succeſſion
of Paſtors in Gods Church, as neceſſary to the Salvation of
Mankind, as evidently deduced from Scripture, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Tradition, tho' not from the bare words of the
Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, no leſs than Catholics; and
that they have as full a Right to Conſecrate as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
themſelves, they muſt therefore allow that they do
do ſo: And then there can be no doubt rais'd from the
words of this holy Biſhop, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and
Blood are truly in the Sacrament by way of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
which Doctrin he allows to have a certain Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in Scripture. But the Author here would rather
pull down the Pillars on which the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſtands, by interrupting the Epiſcopal Succeſſion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
its very Foundation, than not ſet a Face upon his
Argument, that he may thereby delude unwary Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Upon the whole matter, it is plain from what hath
been ſaid; 1. That not any of theſe Catholic Authors,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58171:24"/>
which are cited, held that there was <hi>no neceſſity</hi> to
underſtand our Saviours words in the Senſe of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
but the contrary. 2. That they indeed
differed only about ſome curious Speculations concerning
the Dependences and Circumſtances of this Doctrin of
Tranſubſtantiation, which they Diſcours'd of in a Proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
way; as for inſtance; Whether this Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
is a Mutation and Tranſubſtantiation Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive,
that is to ſay, by vertue of which the Subſtance
of the Body is produc'd from the Subſtance of Bread; or
a Mutation and Tranſubſtantiation Adductive, that is to
ſay, by vertue of which the Subſtance of Bread ceaſes to
be; and that of the Body be Introdu'd in it's place: And
whether in this Adductive. Tranſubſtantiation, the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, is to be call'd
Annihilation; or whether it ought to be exempt from this
Name, for as much as, altho' it ceaſe to be, nevertheleſs
this Ceſſation of it's Eſſence hath not Non entity for it's
final Term, but the Subſtitution of the Eſſence of the Body
of Chriſt, or the like; and ſuch kind of diſputes which
did not at all relate to the Eſſence of the Article of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
but only to ſome conſequences, and modes
of it; for all the School-men agree, That the Bread and
Wine are chang'd and Tranſubſtantiated into the Body
and Blood of Chriſt, by vertue of Conſecration, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Bread and Wine ceaſing to be, and thoſe of the
Body and Blood being ſubſtituted in their place. 3. They
evidently deduce the Eſſential part of the Doctrin of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
from Scripture; and altho ſome few of them
do ſometimes ſay, that the bare words of Scripture do
not <hi>compell us</hi> to believe the leſs material conſequences of
it, yet they do not deny that theſe alſo may be rationally
deduc'd. 4. The Author doth not pretend to prove from
theſe Authorities, that theſe Writers did not hold the
Real Preſence of Chriſts Body here, but only a ſign and
vertue of it, as Proteſtants do, ſince it is clear from all
their Writings, that they did hold it, as proved from
Scripture. Altho I might have ſaved my ſelf the trouble
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58171:25"/>
of clearing this point ſo largely, had I not thought it
convenient rather for the vindication of theſe Writers,
whom the Author hath ſo groſly abuſed, than for the
defending the Doctrin of the Real Preſence or Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.
For what if ſeven Authors ſhould before the
Solemn Declaration of the Church have denied it to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
proved from Scripture, tho' really they have
not; Are there not ſeventy times ſeven of another mind?
Were not the <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops, the <hi>Semi-Pelagians</hi> and other
Heretics, who at ſeveral times oppos'd the Articles of
the Chriſtian Faith, vaſtly more numerous? And the
Author knows, that Catholic Chriſtians are not to rely
upon the Judgment of any inconſiderable number of private
Doctors Opinions concerning the Senſe of an Article of
Religion, but upon the Judgment of the generality of
Catholic Fathers, which is diſcerned in their Writings,
and in the Deciſions of the moſt General Councils, and
in the conſtant and general Tradition of the Church.</p>

which and innumerable more like Expreſſions in Scripture every

Language things are commonly ſaid to be that which they
do ſignifie and repreſent; and there is not in that Language a
more proper and uſual way of expreſſing a thing to ſignifie ſo

3. When the Senſe of the words which Chriſt ſpeaks,
if taken properly, is not contradictory to Right Reaſon,
tho' above it, and the Rules of human Diſcourſe oblige
us to take theſe words in the proper Senſe, then we are
not to doubt of the Truth of them as ſo taken.</p>
               <p>That we may the better apply theſe Principles,<note place="margin">How Catholics Interpret the words of Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how Proteſtants.</note> and the
enſuing Diſcourſe to the Caſe in hand, I ſhall endeavor to
State it as preciſely as may be, and draw it into as narrow
a compaſs as I can. Chriſt in the Inſtitution of the Bleſſed
Sacrament ſaid, <hi>THIS IS MY BODY:</hi> Which
words Thoſe of the Engliſh Church, that do not believe
the Preſence of Chriſts Real Body in the Sacrament, yet
Attribute the efficacy thereof to the due Reception of the
Sacramental Elements (and I will Charitably ſuppoſe the
Author to be one of theſe) interpret thus: This thing,
which you ſee to be Bread in Subſtance, is a Sign of my
Real Body, wherein the vertue of my Body, tho' it ſelf
be abſent, is contained; or whereunto this vertue is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
or together with which it is exhibited; which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts of expreſſions I am forc't to uſe, that I may by
ſome of them reach that Senſe which they have not yet
ſufficiently explained. Catholics thus: This thing, which
by the means of your Senſes, is repreſented to the mind
under the Species or Appearance of Bread, is my Body
in Subſtance.</p>
               <p>In theſe Explications, I ſay, that by, <hi>This,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
This is my Body, is meant, <hi>this thing;</hi> becauſe
<hi>this</hi> is a Pronoun Demonſtrative, that doth not expreſs
any particularly determinate, and diſtinct Nature or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
For it may be applied to any thing that is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Senſe, or of pure Underſtanding, when it is but
confuſedly repreſented to the mind: As we ſay pointing
to a perſon before us, <hi>This</hi> is <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>this</hi> is <hi>Thomas,</hi>
pointing to an Animal, we ſay, <hi>This</hi> is a Lamb, <hi>this</hi> is a
Dove; after we have diſcourſed of the nature of the Soul,
we may ſay of <hi>Cogitation,</hi> conceiving it in our minds, <hi>This</hi>
is the property of the Soul. But becauſe it would be great
raſhneſs of judgment, and that which is ſtrictly called
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58171:26"/>
prejudice, to conclude fully of the nature of any thing,
which another, that is preſumed to know it better than we
do, ſhould be ſhewing to us, before he hath fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
his Propoſition, by which he is to diſcover it's
nature: As for inſtance, if any one holding up a Gilt
Shilling, or a Counterfeit Guiny; ſhould be about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us truly, that <hi>this</hi> was but a Shilling, or a Counterfeit
piece of Gold, which notwithſtanding appeared to the
Senſes like Gold, we ſhould raſhly conclude, before he
tells us fully, what it is he ſhews us, that it is a true piece
of Gold: Or on the other hand, if any one ſhould hold up
a true piece of Gold, which is diſcoloured ſo by Sulphur,
that it looks but like Silver, and ſhould be informing us, that
<hi>this</hi> is a piece of true Gold, we ſhould, before he hath
ſpoke his words, conclude it was but Silver: So it would
have been prejudice in our Lord's Diſciples, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
of the determinate nature of that, which he held in
his Hands, when he was going to tell them, what it really
was, <hi>viz.</hi> his Body, before he had fully pronounced the
Propoſition, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> Which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians
and our Author do, raſhly determining the
thing which appears as Bread, to be ſo in Subſtance, upon
the exhibiting the Species, and ſaying, <hi>This,</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
when the Propoſition is finiſhed, is in the
Sacrament made and declared to be the Body of Chriſt:
<hi>This</hi> therefore being a Pronoun demonſtrative, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that it exhibits ſomething unto us, under a certain
outward appearance, without ſignifying diſtinctly and
clearly the whole nature of the thing, for it is the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Attribute or thing, that is affirmed of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to add clearneſs to the ſubject, or thing of which it
is affirmed, by explaining the nature of the thing, intended
to be demonſtrated in the Propoſition, more fully; otherwiſe
the Propoſition would be ridiculous; as if one ſhould ſay,
this Bread is Bread, or this my Body is my Body. <hi>This</hi>
therefore in the Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
ſome Real Thing which appears in ſuch a manner;
as for inſtance, the Species of Bread, to the Senſes, which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58171:27"/>
our Saviour, who was Truth it ſelf, who did know the
truth of all things, and could alter the nature of any Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
thing, by his Word, declares fully unto them to be
his Body, tho' under ſuch an appearance; ſo that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the change was made before, or at that very inſtant
of time, when our Lord ſpake the words, the latter of
which is the general opinion of Catholics; the Propoſition
is ſtrictly true in a proper Senſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only premiſe one thing more,<note place="margin">In what Senſe Catholics allow a Figure in the Sacrament.</note> before I examin
the Authors pretended proofs from Scripture, becauſe I
would by no means make the breach betwixt us wider
than it is, which is this, That Catholics acknowledge a
Figure in the Sacrament, no leſs than Proteſtants. Thus
the Bread and Wine, before Conſecration being diſtinct
things, and ſeparate one from the other, do reſemble
Chriſts Body and Blood ſeparated upon the Croſs, and
his Soul ſeparated from his Body, altho' they could not
do this in their own nature; and till, after the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
they were expoſed upon the Altar for
ſuch a uſe, as might make us conſider them as ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances,
ſince there is not ſo much of natural likeneſs,
as to call the Idea of the Paſſion into our mind. We
believe alſo, that after Conſecration, Chriſts Body in the
Sacrament under the Veils of the Species of Bread and
Wine, is a Figure, Similitude, or Examplar of the ſame
Body of Chriſt, as it ſuffer'd upon the Croſs, in like
manner as his Body when newly born, was a Reſemblance,
and Exemplar, and expreſs Image of his Body at full
growth: But this we conclude, not from thoſe words of
our Lord, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which muſt ſtill be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in a proper Senſe; but from the nature of the
thing it ſelf, after the Inſtitution known to be made.
From whence we firmly believe the Body of Chriſt to
be there; it being of the nature of a Sacrament to repreſent
and exhibit ſomthing more unto us, than what it outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears to be.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to conſider the Expreſſions which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
produceth out of Scripture, by which he would prove
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58171:27"/>
a Figurative Preſence of Chriſts Body, in oppoſition to a
Real one in the Catholic Senſe. And this being the main
Proof upon which thoſe, who have renounced the Authority
of the Church do pretend to build their Faith, ſince they
allow that nothing ought to be admitted as an Article of
Faith which is not clearly deduced from hence; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
nothing ought to be condemned as <hi>contrary</hi> to the
Chriſtian Faith, but what is manifeſtly repugnant to this.
From hence then it is, that he ſhould bring an evidence,
which is able to overthrow the Authority of ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and ſeveral of them General ones, as have determined
this Point againſt him, and to ſhew plainly that the whole
true viſible Church of Chriſt, which hath for near MDCC
years received the Doctrin of the Real Preſence of Chriſts
Body, hath erred in ſo neceſſary a Point of Faith, and been
guilty of Idolatry, even groſſer than that of the Heathen
World, as the Author pretends; notwithſtanding the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the ſame Holy Scripture, that the Holy Spirit ſhall
lead it into all Truth, and that the Gates of Hell ſhall not be
able to prevail againſt it. Let us ſee therefore how well
he acquits himſelf in this vaſt enterpriſe, of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to the Chriſtian World. His Argument from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is this; there are other <hi>expreſſions in Scripture</hi> which
are taken figuratively, therefore this muſt be ſo taken. Out
of the <hi>innumerable like expreſſions in Holy Scripture,</hi> as he is
pleaſed to term them, he citeth two very different ſorts:
The firſt are barely figurative, ſuch as are uſed in ordinary
human diſcourſe as well as Scripture, without preparing
of the mind of the Hearer beforehand, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. Then he compares the words of our Lords
Inſtitution to <hi>a Dream or Viſion of the Night,</hi> that was to
be interpreted, which indeed hath ſomething more of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
than the former expreſſions which he alledgeth;
becauſe it being known that the things which are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Dreams and Viſions are not real but imaginary; yet
ſince they are ſometimes conſidered as repreſenting real
things, that are to come to paſs, they are of the nature of
Signs of Inſtitution, and ſo may come nearer to the Caſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58171:28"/>
in hand. But he ſeems to be ſoon weary of theſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
which being ſo different in nature, one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are not like to agree to the ſame third thing, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
Then he flies from Scripture to <hi>Juſtin Martyr's</hi>
Teſtimony concerning the ancient <hi>form</hi> of the Paſſover uſed
by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Yet he knows not whether he ſhould ſtick to
this expreſſion, which is Sacrifical or Sacramental, and ſo
moſt likely to reſemble the Sacramental, about which he
argues; or the former, which are not ſo. For he begins
his Periods thus: <hi>Whether we conſider the like expreſſions
in Scripture, as where our Saviour ſaith, &amp;c.</hi> or, <hi>whether we
compare theſe words with the ancient form of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi>
And I am ſure theſe are not of a like nature with the
other. Surely there is no Man of common Senſe that can
admit of ſuch a ſort of Proof as this, from one Author that
ſo fluctuates in his judgment, ſince it hath the viſible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Falſhood in its very Front, and condemns the
Real Preſence of Chriſts Body, in a proper Senſe, which
was never openly conteſted in Chriſts Church till <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius's</hi>
time, (nor ſo much as privately, till the time of <hi>Paſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
unleſs by thoſe that denied the Incarnation of our Lord
it ſelf) as well as the more explicit Senſe, <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi>
againſt the Authority of all the Doctors of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Church and its conſtant Tradition for ſo many Ages.
But leſt any one ſhould be deceived with ſuch a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Evidence</hi> from Scripture; I ſhall ſhew plainly that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a one of theſe ſorts of expreſſions, ſuits with this of
our Saviours in Scripture, and that therefore moſt certainly
all of them do not.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that are mentioned, are barely figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
as where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>I am the Door, and the
true Vine</hi> (and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may triumph in this,
that our Lord ſaith, that <hi>his Fleſh is truly Meat</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 55.) <hi>the Church is ſaid to be Chriſts Body,</hi> and
Chriſt is termed a Rock in a Spiritual Senſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.
<hi>They drank of that Spiritual Rock which followed them,</hi> and
that which before is called a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Rock, without doubt
was Chriſt. Though the Author is pleas'd to leave out
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58171:28"/>
the word <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but I would adviſe him to have a care
of that Curſe which juſtly falls upon thoſe that diminiſh
from Holy Scripture, to favour a Party. That I may the
better demonſtrate the diſſimilitude of theſe, and the other
figurative expreſſions, which are by the Author alledged
out of Holy Scripture, to that proper one of our Lord,
<hi>This is my Body;</hi> I ſhall lay down theſe Rules to diſtinguiſh
them by.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Rules to judge of Metaphorical expreſſions by.</note> The deſire which Men have to make themſelves to be
underſtood, and to imprint lively Ideas of that which they
conceive themſelves, in the minds of others, and of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the better, doth naturally incline them to ſearch
for Compariſons and Reſemblances, which may render the
Idea that they would form, the more ſenſible. The reaſon
of which is, becauſe things of Senſe do moſt affect the
mind, and make the deepeſt and moſt laſting impreſſions;
and this Rule is the ground of moſt metaphorical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which are of ſo great uſe and ornament in human diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>2. Hence it follows, that the qualities of the thing,
which we affirm of another in this figurative way, ſhould be
more plain and familiar to us, or at leaſt fully as plain
as the thing of which we affirm it, otherwiſe it will not be
fit to work the effect before mentioned.</p>
               <p>3. The reſemblance lies uſually in but one, or but ſome
few, at the moſt, of thoſe qualities, wherein the thing that
is affirmed is like to that thing whereof it is affirmed.</p>
               <p>4. The inclination which Men naturally have to abridge
their diſcourſe, joined with the deſire of imprinting things
in the mind, by ſenſible Ideas, is the cauſe they ordinarily
include theſe compariſons in the ſame words that the things
they are compar'd to are expreſt by, ſuppreſſing all the
terms of relation, and expreſſing them, as if the things of
which they ſpeak, were really thoſe things which they uſe
as Images to expreſs them the more clearly by: Thus we
find it ſaid, Gen. 49. 9. <hi>Judah is a Lions Whelp.</hi> v. 22. <hi>Joſeph
is a fruitful Bough.</hi> Hoſ. 10. 1. <hi>Iſrael is an empty Vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The thing from which the reſemblance is taken is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58171:29"/>
generally more ignoble, and of an inferior order to that of
which it is affirmed, as being more ſenſible; for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Senſe are inferior to thoſe of pure Underſtanding;
and heavenly things are of that exalted nature, that they
cannot be compared to any thing that is above them.</p>
               <p>6. Therefore the terms are not convertible (for altho'
we call a Man of courage a Lion, by reaſon of the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the quality of boldneſs, yet we term not a Lion
a Man.) And the reaſon of this is, becauſe in the Subject is
underſtood the whole Idea of the thing expreſſed; but in the
Predicate but ſome qualities.</p>
               <p>7. Altho' for the explaining a barely metaphorical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
a Parable or a Dream, that which is properly the
Predicate be put in the place of the Subject, yet it is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo uſed but upon ſuch like occaſions as this; and then too it
doth not loſe its nature, but is the Predicate ſtill; for we
are not to mind the poſition of the words to find out the
Predicate, but the ſenſe of the Propoſition: As in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of our Lord, <hi>Joh. 6. 33. The Bread of God is he
which cometh down from Heaven,</hi> he which cometh down
from Heaven, is the Subject, altho' put in the place of the
Predicate, as is plain: So that, here the thing which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
or reſembled, is always the Subject, and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
or reſembling the Predicate.</p>
               <p>8. In Metaphors you cannot punctually deſign the thing
to which another is reſembled by pointing to it, or, uſing
a pronoun Demonſtrative; as for inſtance, tho' Chriſt in
Scripture be called a Way, and a Shepherd, yet you cannot
ſay, Chriſt is <hi>this</hi> Way, pointing to ſome particular Way,
nor Chriſt is <hi>this</hi> Shepherd, demonſtrating ſome particular
Man that is a Shepherd; nor on the other hand that <hi>this</hi> Way
is Chriſt, <hi>this</hi> Shepherd is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>9. None ever can pretend, that after a mere Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Alluſion in way of Doctrin, a real Vertue ſhould be
imparted by receiving that thing to which another is
compared: As when Chriſt calls himſelf a <hi>Vine</hi> in Scripture,
that the eating of the fruit of the Vine ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
Chriſts Bleſſing and Vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58171:29"/>
It will be eaſie to diſcern the great diſparity between the
expreſſion of our Lord,<note place="margin">The Application of the foregoing Rules: By which it appears, that thoſe merely Metaphorical expreſſions of our Saviours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Vine, &amp;c.</hi> are not at all like to the Form of Conſecration, <hi>This is my Body.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and thoſe Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical
ones which the Author here alledgeth, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them together, and examining them by the foregoing
Rules. Our Saviour calleth himſelf a <hi>Door,</hi> becauſe of the
natural reſemblance, which the Mind, caſting about for
the meaning of this expreſſion, immediatly, without any
difficulty finds, and he himſelf declares; for as by a <hi>Door</hi>
we enter into the Houſe, ſo by Chriſt we enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
for through him the way is opened: <hi>A Vine,</hi> in
like manner, becauſe from him all true Believers as Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
receive their nouriſhment and growth in Grace, by
which they are enabled to bear Fruit: <hi>A Rock,</hi> becauſe
from him the Fountain of Living Waters doth Spring:
The Church his <hi>Body,</hi> becauſe of the Union of the Members
of his Body one with another, and of all with the Head,
and the mutual aſſiſtance which they afford each to other,
in which the Spiritual Body Reſembles a Natural Body.
<note n="a" place="margin">See Rule 1.</note> By theſe ſenſible and eaſie compariſons the Idea of the
thing which our Saviour expreſſes, by them, is more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imprinted in our Minds, and by this means the Memory
the better retains them:<note n="b" place="margin">See Rule 2.</note> Theſe do explain the things of
which they are affirmed, and render them the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
to us;<note n="c" place="margin">See Rule 3.</note> and yet the Reſemblance lies in but one, or,
at the moſt but ſome few of the qualities;<note n="d" place="margin">See Rule 4.</note> the terms of
relation are ſuppreſſed in the firſt propoſal of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
altho' explained afterwards, and one word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Compariſon. It is otherwiſe in the expreſſion
of our Lord, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſuppoſing that by the Term,
<hi>This,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Contrary to R. r.</note> Bread is meant in the Sacramentarian Senſe; (1) for
the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt is not a fit thing to Reſemble <hi>Bread</hi>
by, the notion of <hi>Bread</hi> is not the more ſenſibly imprinted,
by comparing <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> with it, neither doth the
Memory by this means the better retain it; the applying
the Idea of <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> (2) to <hi>Bread</hi> doth not render the<note place="margin">R. 2.</note>
nature of <hi>Bread</hi> more familiar, but on the contrary more
abſtruſe and difficult to apprehend,<note place="margin">R. 3.</note> (3) the Reſemblance
lies in none of the viſible qualities,<note place="margin">R. 4.</note> (4) the Terms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58171:30"/>
are not ſuppreſſed, for no ſuch Relation can be
conceived. Now to proceed;<note n="e" place="margin">See Rules 5, 6:</note> In the former expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the things which are expreſſed, are of an Inferior
nature to the things of which they are expreſſed, yet
more ſenſible; therefore the Terms are not convertible:
<note n="f" place="margin">See Rules 7, 8.</note> For altho' it be ſaid <hi>Chriſt is the Door,</hi> yet we cannot
ſay of any particular <hi>Door,</hi> that it is <hi>Chriſt;</hi> altho' it is
affirmed that <hi>Chriſt is the true Vine,</hi> yet we cannot ſay of any
<hi>Vine,</hi> pointing to it, that it is <hi>Chriſt;</hi> altho' he be called
a <hi>Rock,</hi> yet we cannot ſay, deſigning ſome particular <hi>Rock,</hi>
that <hi>this Rock</hi> is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For in that Propoſition, <hi>the Rock
was Chriſt,</hi> we muſt not regard the order of the words, but
the Senſe of the Propoſition to find out the Subject and the
Predicate; ſo that when it was ſaid, <hi>the Rock was Chriſt,</hi>
the meaning is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Typified by that <hi>Rock,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi>
was like that <hi>Rock,</hi> unleſs we underſtand, as we ought to
do from the preceding words of the Apoſtle, by the Term
<hi>Rock,</hi> a <hi>Spiritual Rock,</hi> and ſo he was really ſuch a <hi>Rock,</hi>
and not Typically ſo; Altho' it be ſaid, that <hi>the Church
is the Body of Chriſt,</hi> yet we cannot affirm of the natural
<hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that it is his <hi>Church.</hi> It is<note n="g" place="margin">Contrary to R. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> otherwiſe
in the expreſſion of our Lord: For the Predicate is here
of the ſame nature with the Subject, if underſtood in the
Senſe of Catholics; it is of a Superior nature, if underſtood
in the Senſe of our Adverſaries; the Terms, if taken in
the former Senſe are convertible; for as it was ſaid by
Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> meaning the thing that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
under the viſible Species, ſo it might be affirmed
of the ſame Body, that it was, <hi>this;</hi> which was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
In the latter Senſe we may as well affirm, that
the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>Bread,</hi> as that <hi>Bread</hi> was the Body
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for indeed neither of theſe could be truly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
ſince theſe Propoſitions, in this Senſe, would be falſe,
and abſurd, there being no ſenſible Reſemblance, nor no
identity, for the Terms are incompatible: And therefore
we need not conſider of the Senſe of them, to find out which
is the Subject, and which the Predicate, for there is no
true Senſe here to be found, nor no ſuch relation, becauſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58171:30"/>
our Lord had not declared the <hi>Bread</hi> to be a ſign of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
before he ſpoke theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi>
and the <hi>Bread</hi> was not naturally a ſign of his <hi>Body;</hi> as
ſhall be ſhewed in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Well, but tho' the Propoſition ſeem ſo very abſurd in
this Senſe, where the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is taken for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
or thing by which Bread is reſembled; yet if <hi>This,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Bread</hi> ſhew'd in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Hands, according to
our Adverſaries, be taken for the Predicate, meaning by
the Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that This <hi>Bread</hi> is a
Reſemblance of <hi>my Body,</hi> they will ſay perhaps it is not
ſo: But I ſhall prove it to be ſo, for theſe Reaſons.
1.<note place="margin">See Rule 7.</note> Becauſe if the words were to be ſo underſtood, then if the
Predicate were reſtored to its proper place, the Senſe
would be clear and obvious, as in that Propoſition of our
Lord; Joh. 6. 33. <hi>The Bread of God is he which cometh
down from Heaven;</hi> when we change the poſition of the
words, and ſay, <hi>He which cometh down from Heaven is the
Bread of God;</hi> for now the Subject and Predicate have
their proper places; But it is otherwiſe in this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>This is my Body,</hi> meaning by, <hi>This,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> then
Demonſtrated; for you cannot ſay, without abſurdity,

is not put in the place of the Subject at the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of the Similitude, Parable, or the like; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when the Explanation is made, according to the
Sixth and Seventh Rules before mentioned. Thus it was
ſaid by our Lord, Matt. 13. 24. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
(That is, Chriſt the Son of Man ſetting forth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
this Kingdom for us) <hi>is likened to a Man that Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
good Seed in his Field;</hi> before he would ſay by way of
Explication, <hi>Ver. 37. He that Sowed the good Seed is the
Son of Man,</hi> and when he had propoſed the reſt of the
Parable unto them; then, by way of Explication, it alſo
follows; <hi>The Field is the World: The good Seed are the
Children of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the Children of
the wicked one:</hi> Which method is alſo uſed in the other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58171:31"/>
Parables of Scripture, that are Explained. 3. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
or thing Reſembling in theſe Metaphors, whether
it be put in the place of the Subject, or in it's own, is
never particulariſed by a Pronoun Demonſtrative:<note place="margin">See Rule 3.</note> For
our Lord doth not ſay, Pointing to any <hi>Husband-man,
This</hi> is the <hi>Son of Man;</hi> or of a <hi>Field</hi> that he was in, <hi>This</hi>
is the <hi>World;</hi> or of any <hi>good Grains of Corn,</hi> that he ſees
Sown, <hi>Theſe are the Children of the Kingdom:</hi> So likewiſe
it would have been improper to have ſaid, <hi>This my Body

               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">A Metaphor conveys no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual vertue. See Rule 9.</note> Thoſe of the Engliſh Church do pretend from

it ſelf be not there) annexed to the Elements, or their
Reception, which, if <hi>they</hi> were but a mere Metaphorical
expreſſion, like the reſt mentioned by the Author, it is
highly unreaſonable to conclude. Therefore for this
reaſon, as alſo for all the diſparities before ſhewed, we
may truly affirm, that there is no ſuch Reſemblance, as
the Author pretends, between the foregoing expreſſions
alledged out of Scripture, where our Saviour is call'd a
<hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Door, &amp;c.</hi> And that of our Lord's Inſtitution,
<hi>This is my Body.</hi> I ſhall now proceed to examin the next
that are Cited, which are of a very different nature from
the former.</p>
               <p>As when <hi>Joſeph</hi> Expounding <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dream to him,
Gen.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dream doth not reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Sacred words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, <hi>This is my Body.</hi>
                  </note> 41. 26. Says, <hi>the Seven good Kine are Seven Years,
and the Seven good Ears of Corn, are Seven Years:</hi> Which
expreſſions, as alſo that out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> that follows,
the Author compares to the words of Chriſts Inſtitution.
Now, that I may ſhew, that there is no reaſon that our
Lords words ſhould be taken in the Figurative Senſe of
theſe expreſſions, but contrarywiſe in a proper Senſe, I
ſhall lay down theſe diſtinctions and Rules to ſhew the
diſparity by.</p>
               <p>Signs are either Naturally ſo,<note place="margin">Diſtinctions and Rules for the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the nature of ſigns.</note> as black Clouds are a Sign
of Rain, Smoak is a Sign of Fire; or elſe ſo, only by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and agreement; concerning which latter, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58171:31"/>
diſtinguiſh. That of Signs of Inſtitution, ſome have
ſo much of Natural Reſemblance, as that they may fitly
be choſen to ſignifie and repreſent, altho' not enough to
exhibit the Idea of the thing upon the bare ſight or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning,
which afterwards by Inſtitution they are to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
unto us (Thus a living Creature Sacrificed Typifies,
or ſignifies Chriſt Crucified upon the Croſs;) and ſome
have not; Thus the word <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſignifie ſuch a Man;
where there is no Natural Reſemblance between theſe
Letters compounded into a word, and the perſon
Repreſented by them, but this depends upon mere
Inſtitution and compact amongſt Men.</p>
               <p>2. All rational Diſcourſe uſed amongſt Men is founded
upon the imperfect penetration, at leaſt, into the Minds
of thoſe with whom we diſcourſe, and the preſumed Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them. For we regulate our Speech, according to
the apprehenſion that we believe thoſe, with whom we
converſe, have of it. If we believe Mens Minds to be
prepared to underſtand our Diſcourſe, then we utter it
to them; if they are notable as yet to perceive what we
ſay, then we muſt either prepare them beforehand, or
elſe give a diſtinct and formal explication of our words,
ſoon after we have uttered them, otherwiſe we abuſe
our Auditors. From whence it follows,</p>
               <p>3. That that ſort of improper Diſcourſe, wherein we
give the Sign the name of the thing ſignified, or to the thing
ſignified the name of the Sign, being very rare, to make it
intelligible, it is required, 1. That the Sign be plainly
Inſtituted. 2. It muſt be juſtly preſumed, that thoſe to
whom we ſpeak, regard the thing as a Sign, or elſe we
ought to advertiſe them, that we intend to uſe it as ſo.
For there is no example either in Scripture or ordinary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Diſcourſe of a like expreſſion to this of our <hi>Lords,</hi>
by which, at the very firſt conſtituting any thing into a
Sign, it is called the thing ſignified, without preparing
the minds of the Auditors to underſtand it ſo.<note place="margin">Application of the foregoing Rules and Diſtinctions.</note> To apply
theſe Rules to the caſe in hand, we muſt obſerve, that
this Dream or Viſion of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> was a Sign of Inſtitution,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58171:32"/>
it having been appointed by God to ſignifie ſomething to
him: Again, indeed this Sign had ſome ſort of fitneſs, in
it's own nature, to be made a Sign of what it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
even more than <hi>Bread</hi> hath to repreſent <hi>Chriſts
Body,</hi> yet it could not exhibit to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Mind the thing
which it was to ſignifie without ſome explicit interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good Authority, and it was ſo obſcure a Sign, that
none of all his Magicians could give it. Therefore <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
propoſes this to <hi>Joſeph</hi> as a <hi>Dream,</hi> Gen. 41. <hi>v.</hi> 22. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing
him of what he ſaw in a <hi>Dream;</hi> which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
undertaking to Interpret, <hi>Pharoah</hi> could not
but conſider his words as an Interpretation of this Sign of
Inſtitution; therefore by the Second, and Third Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned,
it was very rational for him to put the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
in the place of the Subject, the Sign for the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
by ſaying, <hi>the Seven good Kine are Seven Years,
and the Seven good Ears of Corn are Seven Years, that is,
they ſignified or repreſented Seven Years of Plenty; ſince it
is very well known that in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Language things are
commonly ſaid to be that which they do ſignifie and repreſent:</hi>
But then it muſt be known beforehand, that they do <hi>only</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
and repreſent; otherwiſe it cannot be underſtood when
they only expreſs a Reſemblance, and when Identity. On
the contrary, if in the expreſſion of our Lord, <hi>This is my
Body,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> had been a Sign of Inſtitution, tho' it have
ſome remote reſemblance, yet ſince it could not of it ſelf,
before plain poſitive Inſtitution, bring the Idea of the thing,
ſuppoſed to be repreſented, to the Mind, therefore ſince
there was no ſuch foregoing Inſtitution, or action to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Minds of the Apoſtles to conſider it as ſo, and
theſe words of Chriſt are no explication of a Sign of
Inſtitution, but muſt be the Original Inſtitution it ſelf
of a Sign, if any had been here made, and the Apoſtles
were no ways advertiſed before-hand to conſider the
Bread as a Sign; ſince the Predicate therefore could not
rightly here be put in the place of the Subject, much leſs
a Pronoun Demonſtrative be uſed according to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Rule; therefore theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58171:32"/>
to the known Rules of human Diſcourſe, which it
were Blaſphemy to ſay our <hi>Lord</hi> would ſwerve from,
ſo as to ſpeak abſurdly, do ſignifie that, That was his
<hi>Real Body</hi> which he held in his hands, and not a <hi>Sign</hi> only of
his <hi>Body,</hi> as our Adverſaries falſly pretend. <hi>Neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that any ſenſible man, who had never heard</hi> before of this
figurative Senſe, which the Author and Sacramentarians
have ſo often inculcated into their Followers, as to make
them prejudiced in the Caſe, would upon reading the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Sacrament in the Goſpel, or if they had
heard Chriſt ſpeak the words, ever have imagined that by
theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> no more was to be underſtood,
than that, <hi>this,</hi> which Chriſt held in his hands was only a
<hi>Sign</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> any more than our Saviours Apoſtles and
Diſciples could be made to underſtand the like words, <hi>John</hi>
6. 51, 52. <hi>I am the living Bread that came down from Heaven.
And the Bread that I will give is my Fleſh, which I will give
for the life of the world (the Jews therefore ſtrove amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſaying, how can this Man give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi>) in that
Senſe: But would have underſtood his meaning to have been
thus: <hi>This</hi> which hath the outward appearance of <hi>Bread</hi>
is really my <hi>Body,</hi> This which hath the reſemblance of
<hi>Wine</hi> is my <hi>Blood.</hi> Not as the Author fallaciouſly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the meaning, <hi>This Bread ſignifies my Body, this Cup ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
my Blood,</hi> But that he ſhould enjoyn them to do that
which they then ſaw him do, That is, offer up, hereafter, his

an Ancient Father, and now he will either find one or

that our Saviour had juſt before this Inſtitution celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

that he ſhould now imitate that manner of ſpeaking which

ſo great a diſparity between it, as ſo conſidered, and that
of our Lords Inſtitution, as will plainly diſcover how
falſly it is urged here to prove, that our Lords words
are Metaphorical. For, 1. Theſe words were true in a
proper Senſe, which our Adverſaries will not allow
Chriſts to be: The, <hi>Paſſover was a Saviour or Salvation</hi>

and explained in the following word) <hi>and a Refuge</hi>
to the Jews, in a ſtrict Senſe, God having appointed it as
a means and Inſtrumental cauſe at leaſt of their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
at it's firſt Inſtitution, and it was a Salvation and
Refuge to thoſe who afterwards uſed it aright. Why
then may we not likewiſe conclude from hence, that, that
which Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, when he ſaid, <hi>This is
my Body,</hi> was really his <hi>Body?</hi> 2. All the Jews, who
had a right underſtanding of things, conſidered the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi>
that were offered as <hi>Types</hi> of Chriſt the Meſſias,
and this of the Paſſover more ſignally as ſo, as appears
from this Authority of <hi>Eſdras</hi> out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in
theſe words, <hi>If you think that we render him abject in this
Sign, and afterwards place our hope in him;</hi> Therefore it was
not at all unreaſonable to Attribute the thing ſignified to
that which they regarded in their minds as a <hi>Sign,</hi> by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>This Paſſover Sacrifice is our Saviour and our Refuge:</hi>
Not that they could have any ground from hence to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Paſchal Lamb to be ſubſtantially changed, either into
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58171:34"/>
God their Saviour, who delivered them out of the Land of</hi>
Egypt, <hi>or into the Meſſias the Saviour, whom they expected,
and who was ſignifyed by it: But this Lamb which they did
Eat,</hi> being known to be a Sign of Inſtitution, <hi>did repreſent
to them, and put them in mind of that Salvation which God
wrought for their Fathers in</hi> Egypt, <hi>when by the ſlaying of a
Lamb, and ſprinkling the Blood of it upon their Doors, their
firſt-born were paſſed over and ſpared; and did likewiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew
the Salvation of the Meſſias, the Lamb of God that was
to take away the ſins of the World.</hi> Now the <hi>Bread,</hi> and
<hi>Wine,</hi> not having been at all diſcovered to be ſuch Signs
of our Saviours <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> to the Diſciples, nor
conſequently conſidered as ſo, it was againſt the Rules of
human diſcourſe, to ſay they were his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi>
if no more was meant, than that they were <hi>Signs</hi> of them;
and as abſurd, as for <hi>Moſes</hi> before the formal Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Paſchal Sacrifice,</hi> recited at large in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.
to have ſaid to the People upon Sacrificing a Lamb,
<hi>This is the Lords Paſſover.</hi> Or <hi>This Paſſover is your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
For it was to be known and conſidered as a Paſſover
Sacrifice, and as a Type of the Meſſias, before he could
reaſonably have affirmed thus of it. 3. The Jewiſh Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover
was a Type of this Sacrament, and ſo it is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

which it ſelf was but a Type, Inſtituted by Chriſt, is very
unreaſonable to imagin; eſpecially ſince we do not now
live under a Law of Shadows and Figures, but of Verity
and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Since, therefore, the Paſchal Lamb was really, and in a

one another; much leſs of Divine Inſtitution, becauſe no
ſuch are uſed in Holy Scripture; ſince the Bread which
the Jews Eat, when they uſed that Phraſe, <hi>This is the

               <p>And nothing is more common in all Languages than to give
the name of the thing ſignified to the Sign. As the delivery
of a Deed or Writing under hand and Seal is call'd a conveyance
or making over of ſuch an Eſtate, and it is really ſo; not the
delivery of mere Wax and Parchment, but the conveyance of
a Real Eſtate; as truly and really to all effects and purpoſes of
Law, as if the very material Houſes and Lands themſelves
could be and were actually delivered into my Hands: In like
manner the names of the things themſelves made over to us in
the new Covenant of the Goſpel between God and Man, are
given to the Signs and Seals of that Covenant. By <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
Chriſtians are ſaid to be <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
Heb. 6. 4. And by the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper we
are ſaid to <hi>Communicate</hi> or to be made partakers <hi>of the
Body of Chriſt</hi> which was broken, and of his Blood which
was ſhed for us, that is, of the real benefits of his Death
and Paſſion. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of this Sacrament,
1 Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it
not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread
which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of
Chriſt?</hi> But ſtill it is Bread, and he ſtill calls it ſo, v. 17.
<hi>For we being many are one Bread and one Body; for we
are partakers of that one Bread.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
might, if they pleaſed, as well argue from hence, that all
Chriſtians are ſubſtantially changed, firſt into Bread, and
then into the natural Body of Chriſt by their participation of
the Sacrament, becauſe they are ſaid thereby to be <hi>one Bread</hi>
and <hi>one Body.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle in the next <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
after he had ſpoken of the Conſecration of the Elements,
ſtill calls them the <hi>Bread and the Cup,</hi> in three <hi>verſes</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>As often as ye Eat this Bread, and Drink this Cup,</hi>
v. 26. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall Eat this Bread, and Drink this
Cup of the Lord unworthily,</hi> v. 27. <hi>But let a Man examin
himſelf, and ſo let him Eat of this Bread and Drink of
that Cup,</hi> v. 28. And our Saviour himſelf when he had ſaid,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58171:36"/>
                  <hi>this is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> immediately adds,

                  <hi>but I ſay unto you, I will not henceforth Drink of this
fruit of the Vine, until I Drink it new with you in my
Father's Kingdom,</hi> that is, not till after his Reſurrection,
which was the firſt ſtep of his Exaltation into the Kingdom,
given him by his Father, when the Scripture tells us he did
Eat and Drink with his Diſciples. But that which I obſerve
from our Saviour's words is, that after the Conſecration of
the <hi>Cup</hi> and the delivering of it to his Diſciples to Drink of
it, he tells them that he would thenceforth Drink no more of
the fruit of the Vine, which he had now Drank with them, till
after his Reſurrection. From whence it is plain that it was
the fruit of the Vine, Real Wine, which our Saviour Drank
of and Communicated to his Diſciples in the Sacrament.</p>

the Word of God can afford the Authors cauſe any relief,
he at length flies to the Laws of Men, for it, where we
ſhall ſee him immediately caſt himſelf, and be non-ſuited
at the very beginning of his Trial. He tells us, that <hi>the
delivery of a Deed or Writing under Hand and Seal is called
a Conveyance or making over of ſuch an Eſtate,</hi> (that is, of a
Title to ſuch an Eſtate) <hi>and</hi> that <hi>it really is ſo;</hi> that we

words in the Sacrament, <hi>This is my Body which is given
for you, &amp;c.</hi> which we have, taken from his own
mouth by the <hi>Hands</hi> of inſpired Pen-men, <hi>Sealed</hi> by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with Miracles, and <hi>delivered</hi> to his Church, than that
they are a <hi>Conveyance, or making over</hi> of his Sacred Body
to us, and that they <hi>are ſo really,</hi> not only in Sign or
Figure? He proceeds to tell us, That this <hi>Delivery of a
Deed or Writing under Hand and Seal,</hi> is <hi>not the Delivery
of mere Wax, and Parchment, but the conveyance of a Real
Eſtate, as truly and really to all effects and purpoſes of Law,
as if the material Houſes and Lands themſelves could be,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58171:36"/>
and were actually delivered into my hands.</hi> Well, but we ſay
that a <hi>Deed</hi> of Feoffment takes not effect <hi>to all purpoſes
of Law,</hi> without Livery and Seiſin, neither doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
an Eſtate without that, nor a Deed of Releaſe neither,
unleſs the Purchaſer be put in Poſſeſſion, before hand, by a
Leaſe, and then too, not by the Common Law; but ſo
neceſſary is Poſſeſſion deemed for the through Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of an Eſtate, that in caſe of abſence from the Land
or the like, the Law-makers have by a particular Statute
neceſſarily provided to give Poſſeſſion otherwiſe, for it is
not neceſſary to the making a Man in Poſſeſſion of an
Eſtate, that he ſhould hold his Land and Houſe in his
Arms, or ſtand always upon the Premiſes. But I hope
the Author will not ſo far endeavor to invalidate the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Aſſurance of the Nation, as to maintain, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Man hath <hi>thus a Conveyance of a real Eſtate to all
effects, and purpoſes of Law,</hi> therefore he muſt not enter
upon it, dwell in the Houſe, Reap the Fruits of the ground,
and nouriſh himſelf therewith, I imagin the Purchaſer
will not be put off ſo. In like manner, the words of
Chriſt delivered, as his Act and Deed, by the Prieſt his
Subſtitute, in the Conſecration of the Sacrament for the
uſe of thoſe that are to Communicate, is not the <hi>bare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
of ſo many Words only, but the <hi>making over of a real
Title</hi> to them, to the thing which is meant by them, that
is, the Body of our Lord, <hi>as truly and really to all effects,
and purpoſes</hi> of the Goſpel, as if it actually hung upon the
Croſs before their Eyes, in that Form, and with the ſame
configuration, and quality of parts as it once did. Shall
they therefore be hindred from taking immediate Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of what is thus made over to them? No, this were
too great a Sacriledge againſt God, and violation of the
property of a Chriſtian. They ſhall receive Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Blood, that they may dwell in him and he in them.
They ſhall partake of the Fruits of the Sacrament, as of
a goodly Heritage of their own, ſince Chriſt hath given
them a juſt Right and Title to it, and ſhall cheriſh their
Souls and Bodies therewith to Immortality. Thoſe who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58171:37"/>
are contented only to hear of, or to ſee this goodly Land,
and not to go and poſſeſs it; Thoſe who will leave their
Fathers Houſe the Catholic Church, and go abroad to
feed upon Husks, and imaginary vertue, are the objects
of our pity. So indeed there is a ſort of a Fiction in Law,
in the Authors way of conveyance, of a Tenant by Deed
or Leaſe of poſſeſſion, who notwithſtanding hath nothing
to do to enter upon the Eſtate, or enjoy it; if the Author
be contented with ſuch a Title only in the Sacrament,
I am ſorry for him. And thus the Similitude is reaſonably
applied, as for our Adverſaries way, who ſaith, that
<hi>as the delivery of a Deed or Writing under Hand and Seal is
call'd a Conveyance or making over of ſuch an Eſtate,</hi> (he
ſhould have prov'd that the Deed is called the Eſtate it
ſelf, and not only the Conveyance of an Eſtate, if he
would have made this phraſe any thing ſuitable to that
of our Lord, <hi>This is my Body) in like manner the names of
the things themſelves made over to us in the New Covenant of
the Goſpel between God and Man, are given to the Signs and
Seals of the Covenant;</hi> whereas there is no Analogy
between theſe things, nor truth neither in this inſtance.
It is juſt as if one ſhould ſay, that <hi>Tenterden</hi> Steeple were
like the <hi>Goodwin</hi> Sands. I confeſs, I have often admired
with my ſelf at this ſort of Similitude, which Proteſtants
are mighty big with, pretending to Illuſtrate their fond
opinion about the Sacrament clearly hereby, which being
examined, proves as you ſee, but a mere Tympany of the
Brain.</p>
               <p>The Author having before told us,<note place="margin">Other Texts of Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, and prov'd, not at all to favor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Senſe.</note> that nothing is more
Common in all Languages than to give the name of the
thing ſignified to the Sign, proceeds now to give us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this out of Holy Scripture; <hi>by Baptiſm,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>Chriſtians are ſaid to be partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,
Heb.</hi> 6. 4. And ſo they really are, and their <hi>Bodies,</hi> are his
<hi>Temples:</hi> But ſince Baptiſm is the Sign, and the Holy Ghoſt
the thing ſignified, according to him, why doth he not
bring us one inſtance out of Scripture of <hi>Baptiſms</hi> being
called the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as they pretend that <hi>Bread</hi> in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58171:37"/>
the words of Inſtitution is called <hi>Chriſts Body?</hi> For this
which he hath brought of Baptiſm is no Example to his
<hi>Common Rule:</hi> We may reaſonably conclude, that if the
Sacrament of Baptiſm had been ſo very like this of the
Euchariſt, as they would have it, it would have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in a like Form, but it is quite otherwiſe: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Water, nor Baptiſm it ſelf are called in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Holy Ghoſt, neither is there any Form of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
of the Element, delivered. Indeed, <hi>by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lords Supper we are alſo ſaid to Communicate,
or to be made partakers of the Body of Chriſt which was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and his Blood that was ſhed for us;</hi> but that is his <hi>Real
Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> together with all the <hi>real benefits of his
Death and Paſſion,</hi> which do thereby accrue to us. <hi>And
thus St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks of this Sacrament,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The
Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the
Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we break, is it not the
Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> That is, after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it <hi>really</hi> is ſo; altho' the Apoſtle <hi>calls</hi> it Bread by a
Metaphor (that being to our Souls what the ordinary
Bread is to our Bodies, true nouriſhment) ſo alſo it is
ſaid that Aarons <hi>Rod devour'd the other Rods,</hi> Exod. 7. 12.
altho' it was then become a <hi>Serpent, v.</hi> 10. That <hi>Water</hi>
which was by our Lord converted into <hi>Wine</hi> is ſtill called
<hi>Water,</hi> Joh. 2. 9. The <hi>Angels</hi> are called <hi>Men, Gen.</hi> 19. 8.
becauſe they appeared in the ſhape of Men, according to
the uſual Language of Senſe, very many inſtances of
which are to be found: For our Saviour had fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
them before, that <hi>the Bread which he would give
them was his fleſh,</hi> Joh. 6. 51. The Apoſtle alſo ſaith
again, <hi>v. 17. For we being many are one Bread, and one
Body; for we are partakers of that one Bread, and that one
Bread</hi> can ſignifie nothing here but the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi>
which indeed is but <hi>one,</hi> altho' appearing in <hi>innumerable</hi>
place of the World at the ſame, and at ſeveral times,
becauſe it is ſtill animated by the ſame one Soul and
Divinity of Chriſt; which cannot be ſaid of the <hi>Bread</hi>
in the Sacrament, if but <hi>mere Bread,</hi> for then it would
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58171:38"/>
not be <hi>one Bread</hi> or Loaf, but <hi>many,</hi> and of ſeveral ſorts,
being received at very many places at the ſame time:
And the true reaſon here, why they are called <hi>one Bread</hi>
and <hi>one Body</hi> or Society of Chriſtians, is, becauſe they
are all partakers of that <hi>one Bread, viz.</hi> the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi>
and therefore alſo all inſpired with the ſame Spirit. But,
in the Authors Senſe, it would be no reaſon, but they
ſhould rather have been many <hi>Bodies,</hi> becauſe they did
Eat of ſo many <hi>Breads:</hi> So that we ſee he hath ſtill the
ſame ſucceſs, in bringing thoſe Texts of Scripture to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his cauſe, which are the moſt pregnant proofs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. He then proceeds to teach the Catholics
how they might argue in his new way, from a <hi>Sign</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Inſtituted and known as ſo, to an <hi>AEnigma,</hi> or dark
ſaying, taken from things of a diſparate and really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature, and of no acknowledg'd Reſemblance, that
is, from Chalk to Cheeſe; but they beg his Pardon for
that. Well, but the ſame <hi>Apoſtle, in the next Chapter,
after he had ſpoken of the Conſecration of the Elements, ſtill
calls them the Bread and the Cup in three verſes together, as
often as ye Eat THIS Bread, and Drink THIS Cup,</hi>
v. 26. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall Eat THIS Bread and Drink THIS
Cup of the Lord unworthily,</hi> v. 27. <hi>But let a Man Examin
himſelf, and ſo let him Eat of THAT Bread and Drink of
THAT Cup,</hi> v. 28. It is true it was <hi>Bread</hi> Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,
but it was ſtill <hi>this</hi> Bread with an Emphaſis, not
ſuch <hi>Bread</hi> as you ordinarily Eat, but the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi>
which he told us was truly Meat, or Meat indeed, the true
Bread from Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 6. 32. It was a <hi>Cup,</hi> but it
was <hi>this</hi> Cup, that is, his <hi>Blood,</hi> which was <hi>truly Drink,
or Drink indeed,</hi> as he alſo hath taught us, <hi>John</hi> 6. 55.
and after <hi>examination,</hi> let the true Chriſtian Eat of <hi>that</hi>
Bread and Drink of <hi>that</hi> Cup, which will ſtrengthen his
Body and Soul both, much more than the ordinary Bread
and Wine can his Body only. <hi>Our Saviour himſelf, when
he had ſaid, This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
adds, but I ſay unto you, I will not henceforth
Drink of</hi> this <hi>Fruit of the Vine</hi> (that is of the <hi>true</hi> Vine, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58171:38"/>
our Lord is pleaſed to call himſelf,) or of that Wine, which
by the Words of Benediction becomes my Blood, being
Originally the Fruit of the Vine; (or poſſibly it may refer
to the unconſecrated Wine that was left in the Veſſels) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
I drink it new,</hi> that is freſh and newly Conſecrated again
<hi>with you in my Fathers Kingdom,</hi> or after my Reſurrection,
as ſome, with the Author, interpret the place; but as
others more generally, till I drink of that <hi>new Wine</hi> of
another ſort and nature, <hi>in the Kingdom of my</hi> heavenly
<hi>Father,</hi> where <hi>we</hi> ſhall drink <hi>of the River of his pleaſures,
Pſal.</hi> 36. 8. and therefore the Authors following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>is</hi> nothing worth. For after the Apoſtles were ſatisfied
that they really drank the <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and fed upon his <hi>Real Body,</hi> it was an eaſy and
familiar Metaphor to call them Bread and Wine, becauſe
the outward Species gave a ſufficient hint, for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of this Figurative Speech, ſuitable to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Senſe in the inſtances above mentioned, out of
Scripture; and becauſe there was true Spiritual nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conveyed to the faithful by the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our
Saviour thus received, as there is Corporeal nouriſhment
received by the Natural Bread and Wine, which we take
for the refection of our Bodies.</p>

that periſheth not,</hi> to <hi>v.</hi> 51. 2. The Real Preſence of his
Body, and Manducation thereof, in the Sacrament (which
wonderful Preſence there, the Fathers did ever compare
to the <hi>Incarnation</hi> it ſelf) from <hi>v.</hi> 51, to <hi>v.</hi> 59. 3. The

<hi>v.</hi> 62.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour, having ſtyled himſelf the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi>
towards the beginning of the Diſcourſe of the <hi>Incarnation,
v.</hi> 33, and 35. after ſome Explication made of this, Repeats
it again twice, <hi>v.</hi> 49, and 51, to inculcate it the better
into his Diſciples minds: And then inſtructs them how
they ſhould be partakers of <hi>this Bread;</hi> not by believing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58171:40"/>
only, that the Son of God came down from Heaven, and
was made Man, taking upon him Human Fleſh, but by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his Fleſh in the Sacrament, which being a deep
Myſtery, that they might not doubt of the truth of it, he
explains to them what he meant, when he ſaid. <hi>v. 51. I am
the living Bread which came down from Heaven, if any man
eat of me, he ſhall live for ever;</hi> not by telling them, that
by <hi>this Bread</hi> is meant the Doctrin, which he taught, or
that by, <hi>eating this Bread,</hi> is to be underſtood, the believing
of this Doctrin, in a Metaphorical or parabolical Senſe, as
the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 24.</note> and <hi>Sacramentarians</hi> fondly imagin; or in
like manner as he Explained the Parable of the <hi>Sower that
Sowed good Seed,</hi> telling them that <hi>the Field is the World,
the good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom;</hi> or as when
he had ſaid, <hi>I have meat to eat which ye know not of,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
himſelf by ſaying, <hi>my Meat is to do the Will of him
that ſent me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 4. 32, 34.</note> putting the Predicate in the place of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in the manner before hinted, and ſaying, <hi>the Bread</hi>
is my Word or the Doctrin that I teach; but quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
he aſſures them,<note place="margin">John 6. 51.</note> that <hi>the Bread, that he will give
them, is his Fleſh, which he promiſeth</hi> to <hi>give for the life of
the world,</hi> and which, by an Elegant Metaphor, Chriſt
calleth <hi>Bread,</hi> becauſe it was to afford nouriſhment to the
Soul and Body both, in a Spiritual manner in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the ordinary Bread, was to nouriſh the Body,
in a carnal manner, by way of corporeal digeſtion, out of
the Sacrament: And there is no doubt but the Jews under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
our Lord in a proper Senſe, when they ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 52.
<hi>How can this Man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> Our Saviour did
not anſwer this doubt, by telling them, (as he eaſily might
have done in the Sacramentarian way) that no more was
meant but believing ſtedfaſtly in his Death, and applying
to themſelves the merits of it, and which Explication he
would have certainly given them, then, or afterwards, by
Himſelf or by his Diſciples, if no more had bin meant than
ſo; as he did in the caſe of Parables, leſs difficult to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
than this would have bin, if it had bin by our Lord
propoſed as one; but proceeds, to deliver this profound

                  <hi>Verily, verily
I ſay unto you, except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of man, and

                  <hi>truly meat, my

hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: So he that eateth me,
even he ſhall live by me: This is that Bread which came down
from Heaven; not as your Fathers did eat Manna, and are
Dead: He that eateth of this Bread ſhall live for ever:</hi> All
which words, being uſed by our Lord, to clear the doubt,
and anſwer that Queſtion of the Jews, <hi>How can this man
give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi> I cannot imagin, how the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſts Body, and its Manducation in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
could have bin more fully Aſſerted, in order to the
diſpoſing of his Diſciples to believe the Senſe of the Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he ſhould Inſtitute his bleſſed Sacrament: And
ſo the<note n="*" place="margin">See the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <hi>infra.</hi>
                  </note> Fathers interpret this place: And do not ſay, that
the Manna, mentioned in the 58 <hi>verſe,</hi> which was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
ſent from Heaven, was a Type of ordinary Bread,
made by the Hands of Men, and ſet upon the Table, which
is of a far more Ignoble Nature and leſs Significant, than
the Manna which thus came down from Heaven; but of
the Real Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, which was the
<hi>true Bread from Heaven,</hi> that nouriſhed to Immortality:
After our Saviour had ſpoke thus to them, many of the
Diſciples themſelves, to whom Chriſt did not think fit as
yet to reveal the manner of feeding upon his Body in the
Bleſſed Sacrament, thinking that he meant, that his Body
was to be eaten in a groſs manner, like the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> cried
out, <hi>this is a hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> To whom, as well
as to the Jews, who before are ſaid to murmur at him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaid,<note place="margin">v. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the Bread which came down from Heaven;
and that ask, how this Man could give them his Fleſh to eat?</hi> our
Lord replies, <hi>doth this offend you,</hi> and then clears the Doctrins
to them, as far as he judg'd convenient for the confirmation
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58171:41"/>
of ſuch high Myſteries, about which they were to exerciſe a
ſtrong and a lively Faith, by ſaying thus, <hi>v. 62. What and if
ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was before?</hi> As if
he ſhould have ſaid, if you do not yet believe, that the
Son of Man came down from Heaven, yet when you ſee
him aſcend thither again, you will be more ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that it was really God who came down, took Fleſh
and dwelt amongſt you; which Solution had relation
chiefly to the former of the Myſteries, <hi>viz.</hi> his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but withal inſinuates, that ſuch as believe not his
words touching the holy Sacrament, and think it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for him, to give his Body to be eaten in ſo many places
at once, being yet on Earth, would be much more Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
and Tempted after they ſaw or knew him to have
Aſcended into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to clear the latter Myſtery, and Solve their
doubt, who thought, like the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> that Chriſt
was to have <hi>cut pieces of fleſh from his body, and to have given
them to be eaten;</hi> or that thought his Body to be that of
a mere Man, he tells them, v. 63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
the Fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> that is, <hi>the Fleſh,</hi> which
he had told them before that they muſt eat, altho' not in
the groſs manner, without the Spirit <hi>profiteth nothing;</hi> not
but that by the Spirit quickning it, it profits very much;
Suitable to that of St. <hi>Paul. 1 Cor. 8. 1. Knowledge puffeth up,
but Charity edifieth,</hi> that is, <hi>Knowledge</hi> without <hi>Charity</hi>
puffeth up, altho' when <hi>Chariy</hi> is joyned with it to enliven
it, it <hi>edifies,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> it ſelf edifieth by <hi>Knowledge:</hi> For
if theſe words of Chriſt were to be taken in the Senſe of the
<hi>Sacramentarians,</hi> they would derogate no leſs from his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Manhood and Death, than from the <hi>Real Preſence</hi>
of his Body in the Sacrament, in all which, without doubt,
<hi>the fleſh profiteth</hi> very much: Wherefore, our Lord goes
on to tell them here, that, the words, <hi>which he ſpake unto
them, were Spirit and Life,</hi> therefore not to be underſtood
in the groſs carnal Senſe, before mentioned, which ſome
of his Diſciples took them in: For it is the uſe of the
Scripture, to call Mans natural Senſe, carnal Reaſoning,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58171:42"/>
and reſiſting, or not reaching to the belief of Supernatural
Truths, <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as, <hi>Matth. 16. 17. Fleſh and blood
revealed not this to thee,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>the words, that I ſpeak unto
you, they are Spirit and Life;</hi> therefore, not to be carnally
underſtood: But as by the Word of God, the World was
Created, and Nature hath been, ſince, often chang'd; ſo,
there is no doubt but Chriſt could, by it, change the
Bread into his Body, as he did daily, by ordinary Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Nutrition; but,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>V. d.</hi> Gregorium Nyſſen <hi>infra.</hi>
                  </note> here in a ſupernatural way. Our
Lord, therefore, ſaid unto them, that their <hi>Fathers did
Eat Manna, in the Wilderneſs,</hi> which was but a Type of
this Heavenly Manna in the Sacrament, and yet they did
<hi>Spiritually</hi> feed upon Chriſt the Meſſias; for it is ſaid,
1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. That, <hi>they did all eat the ſame Spiritual
Meat, and did all Drink the ſame Spiritual Drink; for they
Drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that
Rock was Chriſt, and yet they are Dead,</hi> all of them a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
ſome of them an Eternal Death alſo; and thoſe of
them which now live the Life Eternal, received this Life
from the Son of God, who hath now given us the Antitype
of that Manna which the Children of Iſrael did eat, <hi>viz.</hi>
his own Body in the Sacrament, ſomething of a far more
excellent nature to feed upon, which will be to our Bodies,
as well as to our Souls the Seed of Immortality, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
and Pledge of our Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,
and Glorification. Yet as our Lord ſaid to his Diſciples,
<hi>there are ſome of you which believe not,</hi> ſo we may ſay ſtill
of the Sacramentarians, who, notwithſtanding all that
Chriſt hath ſaid, will admit of nothing but Signs, and
Figures of imaginary vertue (whom nevertheleſs our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
hath no further inſtructed in any ſuch eaſie Senſe,
as this, which might certainly have prevented their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
as well as that of the Jews, his Diſciples, and which
if any ſuch Senſe had been to be admitted, would moſt
certainly have been given) that they will not <hi>believe</hi> our
Lord, and therefore they <hi>go away</hi> and will <hi>walk no more
with him</hi> in the Communion of his Church.</p>
               <p>Having, thus, made it to appear, that theſe words of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58171:42"/>
Chriſts Inſtitution,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The words,</hi> This do in remembrance of me, <hi>explained.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>This is my Body,</hi> according to the
Rules of human diſcourſe, ought to be taken in a <hi>proper</hi>
Senſe, not only if conſidered in themſelves, but eſpecially
if we regard what Chriſt hath ſaid before touching the
Sacrament, to diſpoſe his Apoſtles thus to believe them;
it will neceſſarily follow, that thoſe words alſo of the
Inſtitution, <hi>This do in remembrance of me</hi> (which relate
chiefly to the Prieſts <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> as the other did to
the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
explains in theſe words, <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread and
drink this Cup ye ſhew the Lords Death till he come,</hi>) ought
not to be conſidered as a determination of the former words
of the Inſtitution in a Figurative Senſe after the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian
way, but as a Declaration of one great end of the
Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> The calling to mind, and ſetting forth
of Chriſts Death till he comes, which is ſo far from being
a Reaſon to prove, that Chriſts Body is not <hi>Really</hi> there,
that on the contrary, this Commemoration and Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
is founded upon the Real Preſence of Chriſts Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
Body and Blood in this Sacrament; ſince without
this, it could not be done ſo effectually in Chriſts Church
as now it is. For, as the Jews, in eating the Peace-Offerings,
did remember that they were ſlain for them;
ſo by Offering here the Real Body of Chriſt, after the
manner of an unbloody Sacrifice, we commemorate, and
ſet forth, in this lively Exemplar, that Bloody Sacrifice,
which Chriſt himſelf offered in a different manner upon
the Croſs, and receive the benefit thereof; which we
need not to queſtion, ſince he gives us daily of this Victim
to feed upon in the Bleſſed Sacrament, tho' without the
horror of Blood. Shall Chriſtians, then, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Celebrating the Memory of the Paſſion in the
Euchariſt, evacuate Chriſts Inſtitution, by taking away,
from this pious Commemoration, that which, he out of
his tender love, hath given us as moſt efficacious in it,
for the good of our Bodies (into which this Sacrifice of
Chriſts Body being received, Sanctifies them, and
Conſecrates and prepares them for a Glorious Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58171:43"/>
as wells as for the good of our Souls? Ought we not to
conſider, that Jeſus Chriſt doth, not only Command
us to remember him, but likewiſe that we ſhould do
this by feeding upon his Sacramented Body and Blood,
ſince he doth not ſay, that Bread and Wine ſhould be a
Memorial of his Body and Blood, but that in doing what
he preſcribes us to do, which is, that in Receiving his
Body and Blood, we ſhould remember him? And what
more precious and lively Memorial could he give to his
Diſciples, and to all his beloved Children, what better
Legacy could he bequeath them, at his departure out of
the World, than this? If the the Primitive Chriſtians were
inflamed with Zeal and Devotion when they approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Monuments, where the Bodies only of Holy
Martyrs, lay Intombed; more eſpecially, if they could but
touch any of their precious Reliqus, being by this means
ſtirred up to a Pious Memorial, and imitation of their
Holy Lives and Deaths; and therefore, did Religiouſly
preſerve the ſmalleſt pieces, and even the Nails of that
Croſs, upon which Chriſt ſuffered, Commemorating
thereby his Holy Paſſion; how much more then ſhould
our Memory, and Love be excited, when we approach
to the Holy Altar, and know, that we Receive there,
tho' veiled under the Sacred Symbols, the very Body and
Blood of our Lord, who Sacrificed himſelf for us, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened
and quickened by his Grace and Spirit?</p>
               <p>I could now proceed to ſhew,<note place="margin">The Real vertue of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament, cannot be proved from Scripture unleſs the Real Preſence of the Body be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> for the further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what I have here alledged, from the Authority of
Holy Scripture, that unleſs the words of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel
above mentioned, as alſo the words of our Saviours Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
be taken in the Senſe of the Reality or Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
that there is no promiſe to be found, in Holy
Writ, of any Spiritual vertue to accompany this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſo that, our Adverſaries, whilſt they are ſo
eager to oppoſe the Reality, do, as much as in them lies,
deſtroy the nature, and end of this Bleſſed Inſtitution,
and have no argument at all to uſe againſt the <hi>Socinian,</hi>
who denies the Real Vertue, as well as the Real Preſence
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58171:43"/>
of Chriſts Body, in the Sacrament: Which is the reaſon,
why, I do ſometimes term this Vertue, (which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
without ground conceives to be in this Ordinance,
tho' ſeparate from Chriſts Real Body) Imaginary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is no reaſon to conclude the vertue of the
Body to be here, from Scripture, unleſs the Body be ſo
too; not that I would derogate at all from the vertue of
Chriſts Body, which by reaſon of the Hypoſtatical union
is Infinite. But this task is already performed by a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Modern<note n="*" place="margin">M. <hi>Arnaul</hi> de la perpetuite de la foy, <hi>&amp;c. Tom.</hi> 2.</note> Author: And the Reader may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Truth of what I have here aſſerted, by inſpecting
ſuch places of Holy Scripture as relate to this Sacrament,
into the number of which they will not allow the ſixth
Chapter of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel to be admitted.</p>
               <p>Having therefore thus explained thoſe places of Holy
Scripture which relate to the Bleſſed Sacrament, as alſo
thoſe other Forms of ſpeaking, both of Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Authority, which the Author is pleas'd to compare
with the Words of our Lords Inſtitution, and ſhew'd,
upon comparing them together, that they will not at
all fit his purpoſe, but prove the quite contrary to what
he would have them to do: I ſhall now ſum up ſuch of the
Reaſons and Arguments for the underſtanding the Words,
in which our Saviour Inſtituted this Bleſſed Sacrament,
in a proper Senſe (as the Catholic Church expounds
them) as are plainly deduced from the Nature and End
of this Holy Inſtitution, and the Manner of expreſſing it
in Holy Scripture (which I intreat the Chriſtian Reader
ſeriouſly to conſider of) and ſo conclude this Head of
Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Reaſons from Scripture for the proper ſenſe of the words of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</note> Becauſe Chriſt the great Lover of Souls never ſpake
to his Apoſtles and Diſciples in Figures and Parables which
had any obſcurity or difficult Senſe, (eſpecially, if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
related to the Practice of a neceſſary Duty) with an
intention to keep them in Ignorance; but<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in Matt. 13. 13.</note> that their
humble and well diſpoſed minds might be the more exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and inflamed with a deſire of inquiring into and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the true meaning of what he ſaid, and that they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58171:44"/>
might the better retain it: And becauſe in all ſuch caſes,
even of leſs difficulty than this of the Sacrament (as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the Parable of the Sower of Seed, altho'
the Myſtery, concerning the ſucceſs of the Goſpel which
was herein prefigured, was not neceſſary for every one
to know, as that of the Euchariſt was) Chriſt did fully
explain himſelf to his Diſciples, who were alſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
others. Therefore ſince the words of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Bleſſed Sacrament, if underſtood Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
as the Proteſtants, and particularly the Author,
would have them to be, muſt need be allow'd to be obſcure
and difficult, becauſe they differ ſo much among themſelves,
as well as from the Catholic Church, about the meaning of
them, and yet none of the Evangeliſts nor St. <hi>Paul,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
varying in expreſſing the Words of Inſtitution, have
inſerted any words which in the leaſt explain the Senſe to
be Figurative or Parabolical; hence it follows, That the
Church hath great reaſon to underſtand them proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe now, juſt upon our Lords Paſſion, it was
the Time for Figures and Shadows to vaniſh, and for Truth
and Reality to appear; And our Lord was Inſtituting the
Great Sacrament of Chriſtian Religion, he could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpeak with too much force and efficacy, eſpecially,
ſince he now ſpake to his Apoſtles in private, to whom he
was uſed, at ſuch times, to ſpeak very plainly.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe Chriſt was making his Laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was to be expreſſed in ſuch plain and diſtinct
Terms, that there might be no juſt reaſon for his Children
to contend about their Legacy: And can we be ſo unworthy
as to imagin, that in this his Laſt and Kindeſt Bequeſt,
he left us no more but a Morſel of Common dry Bread
to eat, and a little ordinary Wine and Water to drink,
in remembrance of him; whereas a kind and good natur'd
Man will leave his moſt precious Jewel to his dear Friend to
remember him by, when he departs from him to take a long
Journy and to make any conſiderable ſtay? A good Father
when he is to dye, thinks all his beſt Goods and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58171:44"/>
too little to leave his Children. He was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
a Commandment to obſerve, which that it might
be rightly executed, ought to be promulged in a manner
very intelligible.</p>
               <p>4. Our Lord was near his Death, and therefore it was
a time to avoid Obſcurity in Speech, ſince he was not to
continue any longer amongſt them to interpret it.</p>
               <p>5. Our Saviour in the choice of theſe words had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regard to the Apoſtles, but he likewiſe ſpake them to
all the Church in all ſucceeding Ages, and knew certainly,
when he pronounced them, how they would always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue
them; and yet, for the confirmation of the Senſe
of the Reality, did never ſuffer it to be call'd in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo much as privately, for almoſt a Thouſand Years,

               <p>Laſtly, if we conſider, as hath been now fully prov'd,

Forms of Human Diſcourſe which are alledged by our
Adverſaries, as like to this of our Lords Inſtitution, are
wholly different from it, ſhewing them the quite contrary to
what they pretend them for, and that our Saviour did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before, at, or after the Inſtitution any ways prepare
or diſpoſe his Diſciples to underſtand theſe words in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative
Sence, it muſt needs be very evident to any Man
that will impartially regard things, that becauſe Chriſt
ever ſpake reaſonably, and in a manner conformable to
good Senſe, and his Power infinitely exceeds the capacity
of our Minds; therefore there is <hi>no Reaſon to underſtand
thoſe words of our Saviours, THIS IS MY BODY,</hi>
