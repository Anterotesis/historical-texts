         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is manifeſt to all that have ſearched
Records, either in the Eccleſiaſticall
or Temporall Courts, or have read the
Chronicles of this Nation, that tithes
of Corn and Grain were paid to the
Clergy in the times of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> As alſo that the
tithes of more than the third part of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
in <hi>England,</hi> were, before the Conqueſt, and
within a few ages after, given, and appropriated
to Monaſteries and other Religious houſes,
who quietly enjoyed them till their diſſolution by
K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who aſwell by the ſeverall
Grants made unto him by the Heads of the ſaid
religious houſes, as alſo by an Act of Parliament
holden in 31. year of his reign (to which all the
Commons in <hi>England</hi> conſented). had all the

Manors, Lands, Tithes and Hereditaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the ſaid Religious houſes (being for the

and veſted in the ſaid King and his heires for ever.</p>
            <p>Which King, being thereof ſo lawfully ſeized,
He by his ſeverall letters Patents under the great
Seale of <hi>England,</hi> in conſideration of monies paid
him, tenths &amp; tenures by Knights ſervice reſerved,
and for rewards for ſervice, and other valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
did diſperſe the Sites of the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
&amp;c. their Manors, Lands, and tithes, &amp;c.
amongſt the Nobility, the Gentry, and others his
Subjects, well-neer of all degrees and profeſſions.</p>
            <p>All which Patentees, their heires and aſſignes,
have from that time to this preſent, quietly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame without diſpute, the infortunate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriators
of tithes excepted, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their more than 100 yeares quiet poſſeſſion,
ſeverall Deſcents caſt, Fines levied, Recoveries ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and thoſe upon valuable conſiderations;
And beſides the former act of Parliament, and one
other excellent Law made in the 21th year of K.
<hi>James,</hi> called the Statute of <hi>Limitations,</hi> made for
the quieting and ſetling of mens Eſtates; yet by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42589:3"/>
the clamorous importunities of the Petitioners,
their titles to their inheritances have bin blaſted,
their tithes ill payd, and which is worſe, by many
denied to be payd, though the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
have made ſeverall Acts and Ordinances
for the due payment thereof: And this the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
and others of their party have attempted
to do, without propoſing any recompence or due
ſatisfaction to be given to the Impropriators in
lieu therof.</p>
            <p>Now how unjuſt and unconſcionable their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
and attempts have bin herein, ſhall eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear to the underſtanding of the poor te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and farmers themſelves who are Petitioners,
by the reaſons and Arguments plainly expreſſed in
the Articles following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 FIrſt, many Impropriations are in the hands
of ſuch perſons as have faithfully ſerved this
Common-wealth, with their perſons and eſtates,
in the late troubles; And now if the Petitioners
might obtain their deſires, the Common-wealth
whom they have ſerved, ſhall deprive them of their
eſtates and livelihoods.</p>
            <p>2. The Parliament have had by way of ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42589:4"/>
the Revenues of many Impropriations,
the owners whereof have lately compounded for
their Delinquencies: And now that the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
have paid the Fines impoſed upon them for
their delinquencies, and ſued forth their pardons,
or by the Act of Oblivion have their offences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
they ſhall (thoſe excepted who gave to the
State their Impropriations in lieu of their Fines)
be now puniſhed in a farr higher degree than by a
review, even to the loſſe of the inheritance itſelf.</p>
            <p>3 Many Widdows have tithes for their Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which their parents did purchaſe for them,
with mariage portions; and Orphans, tithes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for the raiſing of their portions; and youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Sons have Annuities iſſuing out of tithes granted
unto them during their lives, and little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els to maintain them.</p>
            <p>4 Others have tithes extended for juſt debts
due unto them; others have tithes mortgaged unto
them for mony lent, and the mortgagers ſtand
bound, by Statutes or Recognizances, or in penall
Bonds, to pay the monies borrowed at the dayes
limited: In ſuch caſes the Mortgagers ſhall not
only loſe the tithes mortgaged, but the bonds for
collaterall ſecurity being layd upon them, they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42589:4"/>
ſhall (unles they have other eſtates) become ſtark
beggars, and perhaps ſtarve in priſon.</p>
            <p>5 Others have built fair houſes, out-houſes and
barnes upon their Rectories, and have held their
tithes inſtead of demeans for their proviſions,
which tithes being taken from them, their loſſes
(over and above their tithes) in their buildings
will be of conſiderable value.</p>
            <p>6 K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, to engage all degrees of men
and ſocieties in the ſharing of the lands belonging
to the Religious houſes, and of the Rectories to
them lately appropriated, did (amongſt other
things) by way of exchange, give to divers of the
Colleges in both the Univerſities, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Impropriations; and the Colleges in the
lieu of them gave to the King, fair Manors,
Farmes and Lands of the like yearly value, which
had bin given unto them by the Founders and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors
to the ſaid Colleges. Now if the tithes
be taken away from thoſe Colleges, then in all
juſtice and equity the Colleges ought to have all
their Manors and Lands reſtored back again
unto them, which in every exchange, is tacitly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd;
and though the mutuall aſſurances between
the King and the Colleges, were not in form of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42589:5"/>
law made by way of exchange, yet the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
appear to be ſo, both in the Kings letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
and alſo in the Grants made by the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to the King. Therfore in all equity, reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or ſatisfaction ought to be given unto them,
otherwiſe thoſe Colleges muſt in part be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>7. As the Colleges ſhall loſe their Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations,
ſo their Farmers therof ſhall loſe their
leaſes which they have purchaſed for Fines in hand
paid for one and twenty yeares, or for three lives,
and alſo all hopes of renewing their Leaſes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
which they and their predeceſſors have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
from time to time, at ſuch conſtant Rates
ſet to be payed for Fines at the renewing of their
Leaſes, as ſuch College leaſes have bin uſually
ſold for one third part more than Leaſes held of
private perſons.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42589:5"/>
            <head>The Petitioners by that which hath been already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
may eaſily diſcern, that there will be many ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
and ſad loſers, if tithes impropriate ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. In the next place it ſhall be diſcovered,
who they are that ſhall be the Gayners, when all
Lands are tithe-free.</head>
            <p>THe Petitions exhibited are in the behalf of the
poor Husband-men and Tenants; Alas poor
men! they ſhall have the leaſt ſhare of the profits of
<hi>tithes,</hi> if their Petitions ſhould be granted. For,</p>
            <p>1 Firſt, a great and conſiderable part of all the
Manors and beſt Farmes in <hi>England,</hi> and alſo of
petit Farmes, and parcells of land, have been
bought and ſold within this thirty years laſt paſt.
The ſeverall purchaſers wherof, have not paid one
penny for the <hi>tithes</hi> therof. For the <hi>tithes</hi> being an
inheritance ſeparate and diſtinct from the land,
was not in the power of the Vendors to ſell, nor
intended by the Purchaſers to be bought. Now it is
contrary to all juſtice and equity, that a purchaſer
ſhould have the profit of that he neither bought
nor paid for.</p>
            <p>2 The purchaſers of Manors and Farmes, for
the moſt part have been rich Merchants, wealthy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42589:6"/>
Citizens, great Practicers in the Law, Officers in
the Courts of juſtice, and other monied men; all
these, or the moſt of theſe, do let out their purchaſed
lands to Farmers at improoved rents, which Farmers,
when all lands are made <hi>tith-free,</hi> ſhall pay to their
landlords the Purchaſers, Rents as well for the value
of the <hi>tithes,</hi> as they ſhall for the arable land they
hire of them, either by ſetting the land at a higher
rate in regard it is <hi>tith-free,</hi> or els a Fine or Income
ſhall be paid in reſpect had therto. However the
rich Purchaſers when their lands ſhall be <hi>tith-free,</hi>
will in one way or other make their profit of
them. And thus the <hi>tithes</hi> ſhall be taken away
from the Impropriators, the rightfull owners of
them, and given to the rich purchaſers who have
no need of them., nor right unto them. Thus upon
the whole matter, whereas there was but one
Impropriator in a Pariſh, now there will be (if
the Petitioners may obtain their deſires) in effect,
as many Impropriators as Purchaſers.</p>
            <p>3 The like may be ſaid of Noblemen, of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Gentlemen, and of all others, who having
many Manors and good Farmes in ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
have their place of reſidence but in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and do let out to Farm the Sites of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
<pb facs="tcp:42589:6"/>
and the Demeanes therof, which commonly
in country Villages do amount to the third or
fourth part of the Revenue of the whole Pariſh,
and in many pariſhes well neer all the Farmes are
theirs; theſe great men, their lands being made
<hi>tith-free,</hi> ſhall have their Eſtates improoved to
their hands with the ruin of many poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Freeholders, who have litle els but <hi>tithes</hi>
to maintain them and their familyes.</p>
            <p>4 And in like maner alſo, ſuch Tenants as have
Eſtates for lives in their Farmes, and do upon every
change of a life renew their Leaſes (as generally
they do in the Weſt part <hi>England,</hi> and in divers
Counties elſwhere) all which tenants for lives
ſhall make Fines to their Lords, as well for the
profits of the <hi>tithes</hi> of the Farmes they hold, as for
the Farmes themſelves: So that however the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
may have ſome petty benefit, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie
by the hiring of their Farmes in outward
appearance <hi>tith-free,</hi> yet the main profits will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the Landlords, unles the Farmers can
procure, that no Landlord whatſoever ſhall let
his arable lands together with the <hi>tithes</hi> therof, at
above a certain rent <hi>per annum</hi> for every acre: which
was in effect one of the Articles which <hi>Wa. Tiler</hi> &amp;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42589:7"/>
his rabble demanded of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond.</p>
            <p>5 It hath been propounded by ſome, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans
and ſuch as have no other eſtate but <hi>tithes,</hi>
ſhall have ſome moderate ſatisfaction in mony,
and by others, that the Impropriators ſhall have 8.
or 10. years purchaſe for their <hi>tithes.</hi> Let ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that this is in effect to take from the Subjects
their inheritance againſt their wills for half the
value thereof. Such forget that golden Rule, <hi>of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they would be done unto.</hi> In caſe the Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators
titles were defective, it were a work of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to favour the widdows and the fatherles; but
if their titles be good and legall (which none yet
have queſtioned) and that the rich mans right
and title is the ſame with the Orphans, then the
one ought to have the benefit of the law (which
is the ſubjects birth-right) as well as the other.</p>
            <p>6 And as to a generall ſale to be made of <hi>tithes</hi> at a ſet rate of ſo many years purchaſe, many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and matters conſiderable will ariſe therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
For as ſome Manors or Farmes in ſome
Counties, are as well worth 20 years purchaſe, as
ſome others elſwhere are worth 15. So in like
maner of <hi>tithes,</hi> whether the inhabitants be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
to till the Earth, whether good or bad huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42589:7"/>
whether Sea-ſand, Lyme, Marle, or other
Compoſt may be eaſily procured to manure the
land, whether the Inhabitants be able owners, or
poor Farmers, whether the ſoil be fertile or barren,
whether lying in the incloſed Counties, or in the
Champaines, &amp;c. theſe and the like will raiſe or
abate the ſale of <hi>tithes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 Now concerning thoſe that are to be the
ſellers, Firſt by an Act of Parliament made <hi>Anno</hi> 13. <hi>Eliza.</hi> If the Maſters and the Fellows of Colleges
do alien their Lands or <hi>tithes,</hi> ſuch Grants are void, nor can they conſent to do it without ah horrible
breach of truſt, and if they ſhall be ſold for half
the value, then muſt the Colleges (as before was
obſerved) be in part, and ſome of the greateſt of
them be well-neer diſsolved. Some of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprietors
have their Eſtates ſo fettered by their
fathers, or by themſelves upon their marriages,
with Entailes called perpetuities, that they have
no power to dock them, but by compoſition
with them in remainder; they being in little better
condition than tenants for lives. Others are ſimply
tenants for lives, others for years; How ſhal the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys
upon ſuch ſales be divided between the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
tenants, and them in remainder or reverſion?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42589:8"/>
others have mortgaged their <hi>tithes,</hi> others, and not
afew, have their eſtates in the hands of Truſtees,
which truſts cannot be diſcharged but by the
chargeable Decrees in Chancery, Shall Orphans
have their portions, and Creditors their debts aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
Shall the annuities of younger brothers be in
part extinct? Or ſhall all the loſs fall upon thoſe
poor Gent, and Freeholders who have the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the <hi>tithes</hi> in reverſion, and none or little
preſent profit?</p>
            <p>8 Difficulties will alſo ariſe about the perſons
that are to Purchaſe; for, where there is one pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioner
that hath ſpare mony to buy his <hi>tithes,</hi>
there are four that are in debt, few of thoſe (well
adviſed) will purchaſe, becauſe he that buyes land
at ten years purchaſe, runns about the Country
to borrow mony, payes brokage and intereſt, and
the charges of aſſurance by mortgage to ſecure
either the lender or his ſureties, and the payment
of taxes (beſides the loſs of time and anguiſh of
mind) may put his Gains in his eyes and ſee never
the worſe. Particular tenants, and they in reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will hardly joyn in the purchaſe; and who
ſhall undertake for them that are in their minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
As the moſt part of men will want monies to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42589:8"/>
buy, ſo others will have no will to buy; ſhall an
Impropriator be compelled to fell the faireſt and
beſt portions of his Tithes and at under-rates, to
thoſe that will buy, and to keep the remain in
his hands? That were to adde another prejudice
to the Impropriator, who beſides other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
ſhall be well-neer at as great a charge to
inne ſuch parcels of ſcattered Tithes, as formerly
he was to inne the whole. But if ſtrangers ſhalbe
admitted to buy the tithes of thoſe lands, which
the owners are not able, or not willing to buy,
then it will follow, that there muſt be Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
and Tenants, and in effect, as many, or more
Impropriators, than are at this preſent. Laſtly,
who ſhall determine the yearly value of the tithes
to be ſold? if the anti-tithemongers, ſet the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
the purchace no doubt will be under ten
years.</p>
            <p>9. Some of the Petitioners, and namely thoſe
in the Eaſt-Riding in <hi>York</hi>-ſhire, pray to have the payment of tithes aboliſhed, becauſe they were at
the firſt given for the advancement of Popery,
and for the maintenance of ſuperſtitious and idle
perſons. For the like reaſon the Petitioners may
(in caſe they have good ſucceſs in this Petition)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42589:9"/>
pray that all the Sites of the Monaſteries, and
of all other the Religious houſes in <hi>England,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by <hi>K. Hen. 8.</hi> may, together with all their
Manors, Granges, Farms and Lands (which
amounted to the value of 161100. l. <hi>per annum,</hi>
of old Rents, and are worth at this day at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Rents, two millions of pounds <hi>per annum</hi>)
be taken from the preſent owners, becauſe they
were at the firſt given for the maintenance of idle
Monks and Chanting Cannons, who depended
upon the Popes, and were but the Kings half
Subjects; And beſtowed upon the Petitioners,
becauſe they are poor men, and take great pains
for their livings.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42589:9"/>
            <head>The Petitioners are alike grieved with
the Ministers of the Goſpell for their
maintenance by tithes, As they are with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriators,
all muſt be taken away from them. It
being an eaſy matter, ſay they, to order a more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
maintenance for them. But in what way they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
not. We ſhall not ſay any thing concerning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
divine right to tithes; Nor of the conveniencie
thereof for their maintenance. We ſhall proceed in the
ſame way as before, and ſhew to the Petitioners their miſtakes in the Clergies Revenue; And in their own expectations.</head>
            <p>1. ALL that which before hath bin decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
concerning the taking away of
tithes from the Impropriators, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them to great Landed-men, rich men, and to
purchaſors, wilbe the ſame to the Miniſters of the
Goſpell, who ſhall have the Rents and profits of
their tithes taken from them, and put into the
purſes of rich Land-lords, But with more diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42589:10"/>
to the Miniſter than to the Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
becauſe of the Miniſters conſtant pains in
Preaching, His care of the ſouls under his charge,
with the other duties incident to his calling. For
which our Anceſtors in former times held their
Miniſters ſo worthy of tithes, and were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious in the dew payment of them, That
they uſually gave their Miniſters a Legacie for
tithes forgotten to be paid; And Mortuaries were
paid to the parochiall Miniſters for the ſame
cauſe.</p>
            <p>2. It was in the times of Popery, one of the
juſt grievances which the Cannons had againſt
the Monaſteries, &amp;c. That they received the
Rents of the tithes, and yet lived 100. miles off,
and for that many Rectories were appropriated
to Religious houſes beyond the Seas, who gave
no relief nor aſſiſtance to the Pariſhes whence
they received the profits, nor ſcarce took notice
of them; whereas the Miniſters of the Goſpell are
reſident upon their Cures, and doe ſpend the
Revenues thereof amongſt their Pariſhioners;
They ſet the able poor on work, and relieve the
impotent according to their abilities.</p>
            <p>3. If the Miniſter doe let his tithes to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42589:10"/>
(as many of them doe, and more would
upon even tearms) then the Petitioners, the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
have as much privilege from their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
as they can expect from their rich Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords,
after ſuch time as all Lands are made tithe-free.
But if the Miniſter doe keep his tithes in
his own hands, then are they a magazin or ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
for all the poor people in the Pariſh. For
there the poor man hath ſtraw for his bed, for his
Cow, and to heat his Oven, and griſt-corn upon
truſt, till he have earned money to pay for it;
Thither alſo the pettie husband-man, the badger,
the waggonier, and the Carter that lives by doing
works and carriages for other men, reſort for
Chaff for their horſes, which is a commoditie
hard to be gotten in thoſe Counties where uſe is
made of it; And there they have for their money
horſe-corn ready at hand. But where the Farmers
doe inne their own tithes, together with their
Crops, they will not part with any of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
unleſs in a ſmall proportion to the
labourers that depend upon them.</p>
            <p>4. Whereas the Petitioners pretend that the
Impropriators and the Miniſters doe hot pay
Aſſeſſements anſwerable to the profits they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42589:11"/>
herein the Petitioners are much miſtaken.
For it is a known truth, that all the Judges in the
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> about <hi>Anno</hi> 1635. did reſolve
it, That tithes were not to be aſſeſſed at the tenth
part of the Aſſeſſement laid upon the Pariſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that way was incertain and unequall; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they reſolved, that 100. l. <hi>per annum</hi> in tithes,
ought to be equally taxed with 100. l. Lands <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
And the high Court of Parliament, <hi>anno</hi>
1649. did enact, That all Aſſeſſements from
thenceforth ſhould be by the pound rate: But as
for the ſtock upon the Land, that was ordered to
be taxed by it ſelf, which lawfull favour hath not in
many places bin allowed neither to the Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
Nor to the Miniſter, becauſe that Farmes, and
the ſtocks upon them, are in moſt places taxed
undividedly together.</p>
            <p>5. The Miniſter is equally taxed (in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
for one hundred pound tithes <hi>per annum,</hi> with
a forrain Land-lord, who receives one hundred
pounds Rent <hi>per annum</hi> of his Farmer in the ſame
Pariſh, which is not juſt: For, the Land-lord is
at liberty to live where he pleaſeth, and to follow
any calling he beſt liketh, without any deduction
of his Rents, ſave for taxes; Whereas the Miniſter
is tyed upon great penaltie to Reſidence, and in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42589:11"/>
case of ſickneſs, or of juſt cauſe of abſence, muſt at
his charges ſee the Cure ſerved, whereof reſpect
ought to be had in all Aſſeſſements laid upon the
Clergy. Thus it is plain, tithes are not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxed,
but rather over-taxed.</p>
            <p>6. The Petitioners doe farther pretend, That
they doe pay to the Tithe-mongers, the third or
fourth part of their whole eſtates. Herein though
the Petitioners tell the truth in part, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the whole truth. For howſoever it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
true, that if threeſcore acres of arable Land
be let to Farm for threeſcore nobles <hi>per annum,</hi> during That
then the tithe thereof is worth twenty nobles
<hi>per annum,</hi> the time the threeſcore acres are
wholy employed in tillage, not otherwiſe. But
as the whole Revenue of a Pariſh doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in arable Lands, ſo the ſame arable is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
plowed, and it may with confidence be
affirmed, That the Clergy who receive the tithes
of Corn and Grain, together with the ſmall tithes,
Have hardly throughout <hi>England</hi> the tenth part
of all the Rents and profits of the Lands in their
ſeverall Pariſhes; if ſome of them receive more than
the tenth, others doe receive much loſs. For in
all thoſe Pariſhes, where the richeſt paſtures doe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42589:12"/>
lye in ſeverall, and are employed in the ſeeding of
fat Oxen, as alſo in leſs fertile paſtures, where the profits are raiſed by the brooding up of horſes
and ſtore-cattle, nothing conſiderable is paid
thereout unto the miniſter.</p>
            <p>And where the paſtures are ſtocked with fat
ſheep, or with Cows for Dayries, the tenth of the
rent of ſuch paſtures, is the moſt that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a Forainer, but leſs from a Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
who alſo paies no tithes for all the paſtures
his plow-horſes and Oxen for draught do eat up;
nor for the Leyes and paſtures which the flocks
of ſheep do graze upon, which are folded to
manure the arable lands: Beſides the pariſhioners
do commonly blow away all the tithes due for
firewood with a ſmoak penny. And the owners
of uſuall or coppice Woods in many places do
not pay the tenth; and not a few do let their
Underwoods and Springs of woods grow till
they be above twenty years growth, purpoſely to
defraud the Miniſter of his tithe. And generally
in all places the ſpires or young timber trees
which are fallen, together with the under-wood
(which are a conſiderable part of the owners
profit) yield nothing to the Miniſter. Adde hereto
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42589:12"/>
that of late years much barren ground, formerly
employed in tillage, is converted to Warren for
Conies (and indeed can no waies be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for the benefit of the Common-wealth
and the owners profit.) And as for Forreſts,
Chaſes, Parkes for Deer, vaſt moores, great waſts
and Commons, (and under correction the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monable
Fens alſo, till of late drained and in hand
to be drained conteining 400000. acres.) As they
yield not much to the common good, ſo leaſt of
all to the Rector-miniſters. Furthermore, many
Manors and Granges in <hi>England</hi> antiently were,
and ſo continue to this day, totally exempted from
the payment of tithes, by Grants, Privileges and
preſcriptions, and not Farmes only, but whole
Pariſhes doe preſcribe <hi>de modo decimandi,</hi> by which
the miniſter doth hardly receive the fortieth part
in lieu of his tithe, in many places much leſs. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>7. To inſtance, that the Miniſter, hath but the
tenth. There have, upon complaints made in
Chancery, where Towns have been depopulated
and converted to paſture, Decrees made in that
Court, That the miniſter ſhould have in lieu of
his tithes, the tenth acre in the Pariſh, to hold in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42589:13"/>
ſeveralite, and to be laid neer adjoyning to the
Parſonage houſe, or in ſome other convenient
places to the Miniſters content. In which way
of exchange the Miniſter was no loſer (though
the Common-wealth bee, by ſuch conditions
accompanied with depopulations.) And the cauſe
why the Miniſters loſt nothing by ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was, becauſe before that time, about one fourth
or fifth part of all the lands in the Pariſhes, were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture grounds held in ſeveralty, or elſe were meadow
and paſture grounds lying in the Common-fields,
in the bottoms or low places thereof, and in
heidons, and in large drifts for cattle, and in the
commons and waſtes of the manor, which were
commonable all the year; In all which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter-rector,
before the commiſſion, had little or
no conſiderable profit, which by the ſeveraltie
for all the year were improoved.</p>
            <p>8. And whereas the Petitioners pretend much
ſlavery by the Statute made <hi>anno 2 Edw. 6.</hi> for the ſetting forth of tithes, and alſo by the Ordinances
made this Parliament for the dew payments ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
It is well known, that there were conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made in the Reign of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;
As alſo, in the Reign of King <hi>Edw.</hi> firſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42589:13"/>
the payment both of prediall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
tithes. And it is a known truth, that
for one action which hath for theſe ſeven years laſt
paſt, been commenced againſt any perſon for
Foul tithing, there have bin ten actions brought
againſt thoſe who have refuſed to ſet forth their
tithes, openly denying to pay the ſame, aſwell to
the Miniſter, as to the Impropriator, therefore
they have juſt cauſe humbly to Petition the high
Court of Parliament, that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to adde coſts of Suit to the dammages given
by that Statute, becauſe affected Juries will give as
little in Dammage as may be; As alſo that all
ſales made by the owners of Corn and Grain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground, to unknown perſons, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to defraud the Impropriators and Miniſters of
their tithes, and all ſuch like covenous and feigned
devices, may be made void, and the Contrivers
of them puniſhed according to their deſerts. And
becauſe that Statute doth concerne prediall tithes
only, therefore that ſome good Law might be
made in the behalf of poor Vicars, for the recovery
of ſmall tithes; which if the Vicar inſiſt upon to
have according to the value, he is clamoured to
be contentious, if he accept what is given, his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42589:14"/>
tithes are converted to Almes; And wofull is the
condition of thoſe Miniſters whoſe maintenance
depends upon the benevolence of the people, as alſo
of thoſe pariſhes who want fit maintenance for
their miniſters.</p>
            <p>9 There are in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Wales</hi> nine thouſand ſeven hundred and twenry five pariſhes,
and although the one half of thoſe Rectories
were not appropriated as to the number of them,
yet certainly as to the yearly values, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at this day have not the one halfe of the
profits of the tithes of corn and grain, becauſe
(except the Church of <hi>Cleve</hi> in the vale of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſham,</hi> and ſome others) the tithes of all the
richeſt and largeſt pariſhes were appropriated.
And if it be farther conſidered, that not only
many of the greateſt of them, but alſo the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſort have, by ſales, by partitions, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means been devided, and come into ſeverall
hands.</p>
            <p>Then it may be eaſily demonſtrated, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Patrons loſſes of their right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the preſentations of fit Miniſters to their
Churches) above the yearly Revennue of one
million of pounds at improoved Rates, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42589:14"/>
Eſtates of more than ten thouſand Families are
deeply concerned in this great mutation by the
Petitioners intended. Therfore,</p>
            <p>10 For the cauſes and reaſons above recited,
the Petitioners have, with too much boldneſs,
importuned the High Court of Parliament, and
His Excellencie the Lord Generall, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of ſo much blood and treaſure, for the liberty of the Subjects Perſons and Proprietie in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
to petition for the taking away of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and the Freehold Eſtates (for every Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
hath a free-hold Eſtate in his tithes) from ſo
many thouſands of good Subjects, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
due and full recompence or ſatisfaction
to be given unto them for the ſame.</p>
