         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A certaine brawling fryer of Paris, namely <hi>Feverdentius,</hi> hath stepped forth of late, opening his lying mouth wide, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the proceeding of the Protestants in France especially and England. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning France he saith, that the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did abound with blood, their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches made stables, or burned to ashes, their fields wasted, their riuers ran with blood: <hi>atque hi, novi evangelij, fructus:</hi> and these are <note place="margin">Dial. 1. p. 7.</note> the fruits, saith he, of the new gospel. And, of troubles in England mooued against Catholikes, he is not ashamed thus impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to write: that they are drawne to come to heare sermons; if they refuse to come, they are imprisonned, whipped, hanged, racked, bowelled, their members quartered and boyled, and cast forth to be <note place="margin">Dial. 1. p. 15.</note> eaten of foules, beasts, and dogges, because they desire to obserue the religion recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from their fathers.</p>
            <p>Would any man thinke, that they were so shamelesse, as to publish such wicked slaunders and impudent lies, to the view of the world?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14372:9"/>
This lying fryer hath most slaunderou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly <note place="margin">Feverdentius refuted.</note> charged the protestants, with the ciuill warres and troubles of France, with defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the temples, shedding of blood, laying wast the countrie: whereas it is most notoriously knowne, that the Papists were the onely causes of all these mischeifes.

            <p>Nowe concerning the affaires of the state in England, this franticke Franciscan

But, it is most true that once a popish bishop in Hungarie, did cause a <note place="margin">Ex tomo 2. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it hath beene the auncient and most deserued punishment for traitours, by the law of this land, to be hanged, drawne, and quartered. 5. That any pope-catholiks are put to death, for keeping the auncient religion of their Fathers, is a great blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of our state, as now shall be shewed for the satisfaction of all.</p>
            <p>The Romanists suffer not death for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but for rebellion, not for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but for their practising against the state, not for poperie but for treacherie, it
<pb facs="tcp:14372:11"/>
may diuersly appeare. 1. Because there <note place="margin">Feuerdentius refuted.</note> are so many thousand knowne papists in the land, and yet fewe of them but such as are seditious and treacherous, are capitally punished. 2. Hereticks that doe swarue from the faith, are by the lawe adiudged to the fire: but, no papists haue yet felt that heate, as protestants did, who were consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the flames of fire, aboue 300. in lesse then fiue yeares space. 3. None of these traiterous papists that haue suffered for their demerits, were indited, arraigned, examined, or condemned for any article of faith, as it may appeare in the seuerall proceedings against them. 4. There is no law in England, to put any papist to death for his conscience: and without lawe our state punisheth none.</p>
            <p>It will be obiected, that the act which maketh the comming in of the Iesuits and Seminarie priests, treason, doth for their profession condemne them. I answere: that this is altogither vntrue: 1. because that this act was but lately made in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the whole time of Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties raigne hitherto, about <hi>Anno regni</hi> 27. when it was found by experience, that the end of their comming ouer into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was to peruert the obedience of the
<pb facs="tcp:14372:11"/>
subiect, and to contriue most vnnaturall <note place="margin">For religion in England.</note> conspiracies against our most gratious Soueraigne. Then was it high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them by law. 2. If it be obiected that though some of them haue conspired against the prince, yet all of them doe not so: I answer, that they beeing birds all of a feather, and receiuing their direction from the Romish chaire of pestilence, are all to be feared, though perhaps not all alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied, yet they are all dangerous, beeing deuoted to execute the Popes will, who is a professed enemy to our state. 3. Their very purpose to alienate the subiects from due obedience, and to reconcile them to a forraine potentate, is, and hath alwaies bin adiudged by the lawes of this land, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable act: as to be adhƒôrent or ayding to the kings enemies, such as the pope is, was made treason, <hi>An. Edwardi. 3. 25. c. 2.</hi> But, it cannot be denied that all Iesuits and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries are adhaerent and aiding to the Popes proceeding, who is the cheife ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie to our state. 4. All lawes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ciuill and canon haue condemned all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises and conspiracies against the state. <hi>Arcadius</hi> made this lawe, that a conspiracy against the counsellers of the prince (much more against the prince himselfe) though
<pb facs="tcp:14372:12"/>
it take not effect, is to be punished with <note place="margin">For religion in England.</note> the sword: which lawe is rehearsed in the <note n="b" place="margin">par. 2. c. 6. q. 1. can. 22.</note> decrees. <note n="c" place="margin">par. 2. c. 11. q. 1. can. 31.</note> Fabian decreed, that he which did lie in waite against the Bishop, should be committed to prison.

This point then, I trust is sufficiently cleared, that not the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, but the papists are the cruell perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of these daies, and the spillers of the blood of the Saints, so that by their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous crueltie, and vnsatiable blood thirsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it is no hard matter to iudge of their religion, what it is, and of themselues, by what spirit they are ledde.</p>

But no country hath had greater experience of popish se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious practises, then this nation of ours, nor yet any people bound more to thank God, for the deliuerance of their prince from so many dangers, as we are. What shal I speake of <hi>Mortons</hi> conspiracie who was Pope Pius the fifths agent to raise the rebellion of the North? of Saunders at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in Ireland, of Parry suborned by Gregorie the thirteenth, of Arden, Soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merfield,

            <p>Are these then the Catholiks of these daies, and is this that holy father of Rome, out of whose head such monstrous &amp; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous practises are forged? and call ye this (ye papists) the holy Catholike Romane faith, that bringeth foorth such vngodly fruits? Euen old heathenish Rome would haue beene ashamed of such dealings. They might haue remembred, howe C.

Fabricius would not accept of the physitians offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red seruice to poison his master: the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings corrupted Lopeze physitian to the Queenes houshold, with great summes to poyson her Maiestie. He reuealed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie against an enemie: the other doe not onely conceale, but contriue conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies against the prince. And he did this to a violent &amp; professed aduersarie, that with all hostilitie had inuaded the confines of Rome, and made a great slaughter of the Romanes before; but, they haue offered this hard measure to a peaceable prince, that till shee was most iustly prouoked by their wrongs, offended none, but onely defended her selfe and her people. And, as this new generation of pretended Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and Christian Romanists, hath dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the auncient Romes, yet bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idolatrous heathen; so herein they doe farre exceede the barbarous Mahumetans the Turkes.

These that hold of Peter and Paul, who, <note place="margin">Their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie.</note> they say, were founders of the Romish Church, how vnlike are they vnto them in their profession and practise? Paul excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe, because he had vnwittingly called the high priest, <hi>painted wall,</hi> Act. 27. but Papists doe iustifie, not their reuilings onely, but rebellions against the highest powers on earth. Peter saith, <hi>Submit your selues to all manner of ordinance of man, for the Lords sake, as to Kings, to superiours, and vnto other gouernours,</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 13, 14. but these Petrians follow not Peters steppes, but in stead of submitting, seeke to subdue Princes. Much vnlike be they to Dauid, whose heart smote him, <hi>because he had cut off the lappe of Sauls garment:</hi> but their heart is not touched, for seeking to cut off the life of Princes.

And as Ismael serued Gedaliah, who eating bread with him as his friend, rose vp and slue him. Ier. 41. 1. As Iudas betrayed our Sauiour with a kisse; so, this is a new popish tricke, that where neither open violence and tyrannie preuaileth, nor secret practising and vnfaithfull trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie taketh place, there by deceitfull sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie they thinke to make a way.

Thus the Admiral with a great sort of most worthie men beside, whome they could not ouercome by force, were ouerthrowne by faire promises, &amp; a vaine hope and expectation of peace: that, like as Absalo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s sheep shearing feast was made a snare, to intrappe his brother Amnon, 2. Sam. 13. 29. so this mariage feast and princely solemnitic, was but a stale to draw

the Protestants into their nets. And as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal is reported to haue saide thus of the Romane captaines Fabius and Marcellus, whereof the one wrought by policie, the other by force: <hi>Magis se √† non pugnante Fabio, quam √† pugnante Marcello, sibi me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere:</hi>

The like deuice hath beene set afoote in England, when as, to the intent to make her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and the Counsel secure in that behalfe, they set forth a booke, declaring it to be <note place="margin">Fulk. in epist.

So should we neither be inquisitiue to know, nor knowing, discouer the secrets of State: but, as the Apostle biddeth, we should pray for Kings and magistrats, that God would direct their counsells; not praie or talke our pleasure of them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice their proceedings. Wherefore, till such time as it shall seeme good to the State, to haue those popish bookes more fully answered, I will set downe some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisments for the satisfaction of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concerning the foresaid dissentions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas the Priests doe lay all the blame vpon their fellow Iesuits as authors <note place="margin">Dissention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene priests and Iesuits.</note> and contriuers of all the treacherous plots against her Maiestie and the state, they can not iustifie themselues. For it is certen that priests as well as Iesuits, haue had their hand in many of the saide conspiracies. Morton, Allin, Hall, Ballard, Gifford, were priests and not Iesuits. The first, the instrument of the commotion in the North: the second, a continuall practiser a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the State: the third, incited Arden and Somerfield: the fourth, Babington &amp; his fellowes: the last, yet aliue, prouoked Savadge, Williams, Yorke, to take in hand their wretched enterprise. It may be that all priests are not treacherously bent, but
<pb facs="tcp:14372:17"/>
yet we see, they can not cleare euery one of their profession. They haue beene both very dangerous and are so to be held still. Me thinke then, their fellowes may very well say vnto them, as Ierome saide to Ruffinus, though the case be not alike, <hi>Quid vulneribus tuis prodest, si ego fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro vulneratus? an solacium percussi est a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnicum socium videre morientem? What doth it helpe thy wounds, if I be wounded? Is it a comfort to him that is smitten to see his friend die with him?</hi> Secondly, they affirme and maintaine this position, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they doe depend vpon the pope for their faith, yet they may be and are good subiects to the Queenes highnesse: which is a very false ground. 1. Because they gaue the pope preheminencie before the prince, and authoritie to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. 2. They allowe appeales to be made to Rome, which is contrarie to the lawes of this land. 3. They make the pope cheife in all spirituall causes; and so doe maime the office of a prince. 4. They count all these martyrs, which haue beene executed for treason, which is a great slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the state. 5. They commend Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Alle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, D. Gifford with others, which were known to be sworne enemies to the
<pb facs="tcp:14372:17"/>
state. 6. They giue ayde and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Seminaries, and societie of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasites, Iesuites I would say, which is no good subiects part to foster enemies to their countrie. Wherefore I conclude vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these reasons, that a professed and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute papist, priest, Iesuite, pope catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, lay, regular or secular, can be no good subiect, though he may be no traytour. And if the Queene had no better subiects then such, her maiestie were ill bestead. And if the common wealth had no better sheild to defend it selfe, it might deceiue them, as Brasidas the Lacedemonian bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded through his sheild said, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente me clypeo vulneratus: I was wounded,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> 
               <hi>my sheild betraying me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas a question is mooued by the popish priestes, which of them, or the other faction are likest to the puritans, and it is resolued, that the sect of the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its commeth neerer vnto them, though not so absurd in doctrine, nor yet so mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious against either Church or common wealth: neither yet are they such grosse heads, but much finer witts then the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans: for these are their owne words. Let it here be considered, that if by the name of puritans, they did vnderstand such buisie
<pb facs="tcp:14372:18"/>
factious heads, as beeing malecontents, of a couetous and greedie minde, seeke the hauocke and spoile of the Church, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, nor in trueth, touched with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of religion, such as Martin Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate might seeme to be, we would not greatly stand with them for this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For such a puritan may proue a good stocke to graffe a papist in, as that vile Hacket that iustly suffred for his villanies, and did leape, as it is reported, out of such a puritans skinne into a papists hide. But whereas vnder this scandalous name of puritans, they doe gall and wound the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <note place="margin">Puritans better subiects then papists.</note> of many worthy ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell as Caluin, Beza, and the preachers of Scotland, and diuers amongst vs, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, setting aside their opinion of some externall vsages of the Church, are very profitable labourers, and most loyall subiects: betweene these and the best lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the papists, for true religion and sound diuinitie, and faithfull obedience, &amp; loue to their prince, there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at all. First, these whome they vpbraid with the name of puritans, do hold sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all points of religion, and articles of the protestants faith, throughout, excepting onely concerning externall matters of
<pb facs="tcp:14372:18"/>
discipline and ceremonies, which belong rather to the pollicie of the Church, then to faith and doctrine. And therefore, they admitting of no absurd point of poperie, are by many degrees to be preferred, and I doubt not, but are better liked of the state, 2. Those preachers and ministers of the Gospell, neuer yet attempted any thing against the life of their prince, as priests and Iesuits haue done; neither (doe I trust) shall it euer be seene. They neuer conspired the death of Queene Marie, as these haue done of Queene Elizabeth. Wherefore it is a great sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>der of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to say, they seeke to pull downe kings &amp; princes. 3. These admitte of no forraine poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to haue power in matters ecclesiastical as the popish priests doe, wherein they curbe the authoritie of princes. 4. They perswade to obedience to their prince, and thankefulnesse to God, for the puritie of religion professed among them. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creepe in corners to seduce and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the subiects from the faith, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently from due obedience to their prince. 5. They communicate with the assemblies of the Church, in the worde, praiers, and Sacraments: the Romanists re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse so to doe, and disswade whome they
<pb facs="tcp:14372:19"/>
may from our Church assemblies. 6. They both in their publike and priuate praiers, doe lift vp their hands for the life of our Soueraigne, and the continuance of her state; of popish priests it is to be doubted. For, whome the pope their head curseth, how dare they blesse? &amp; whome he would haue cutte off, is it like they desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue? 7. They haue beene meanes to detect the conspiracie of the common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, and are readie with all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do it: popish priests vse not to reueale but to conceale them. 8. They are bound by oath to acknoweledge the princes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authoritie in all causes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all forraine iurisdiction: popish priests will take no such oath. 9. They acknowledge a Church here in England, and themselues to be members of it; the popes priestes count vs no Church, but <note place="margin">Gifford praefa. 2, impudently &amp; traiterously saith, that in England, haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fis est regio di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ademat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Those whome they call pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan ministers, haue both by preaching and writing, impugned the common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, as much as any, and therin haue done God good seruice in his Church.
<pb facs="tcp:14372:19"/>
And this is the cause, if the trueth were knowne, why popish priests haue such a spite at them, because they stand so much in their waie, staying the spreading of their infection, by the contrarie exposition of sound doctrine. And as for <hi>grossum caput</hi> and his fellowe, let them seeke him among themselues. I doubt not, but they, whome they most scorne of the protestants, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to set foorth from them those, which either by writing or conference shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the proudest priest or Iebusite. But in truth we disdaine this comparison, that the best popish priest should match with the worst protestant preacher, either for doctrine or obedience to his prince. Let them, the priestes and the Iebusites measure themselues with themselues, and compare themselues with themselues, as the Apostle saith of the false teachers of Corinth; <hi>2. Cor. 10. 12.</hi> We dare not make our selues of the number, nor compare our selues with them. But, as Ierome saith of the dialogue of Origen and Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, so we of this contention betweene these <note place="margin">Apolog 2. ad. vers. Ruffin.</note> popelings, <hi>In quo duos Andabatas inter se digladia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tes spectasse mihi videor: Me thought I see two blinde sword-plaiers play togither.</hi>
 The fourth &amp; last consideration is the
<pb facs="tcp:14372:20"/>
scope &amp; end of these popish books, which is to insinuate themselues to the State, and to perswade a toleration of religion, which <note place="margin">A toleration of popery dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> I trust, they shall neuer obtaine, neither is it conuenient they should vpon these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It were not for her maiesties safetie; for if they haue practised so against her Highnesse person, in the time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, what will they doe hauing further libertie?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It were not for her Maiesties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that hauing held a constant course in religion these 44. yeares, should in her sacred old age, listen to any such motion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It would be an offence to all other protestant princes, that the famous church and common wealth of England should giue such an example.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It would breed a confusion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes in the land, and tend to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe and abrogation of diuers profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lawes alreadie made against popish practises and the masse.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It would be an offence to God, that a Christian prince should suffer idolaters, such as Romanists are, to exercise their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous worship freely. Iaacob would not suffer it to be done in his house, but
<pb facs="tcp:14372:20"/>
buried all the images vnder an oake, <hi>Gen. 35. 5.</hi> much lesse is it to be permitted in a kingdome. And Eliah well said, <hi>1. Kings, 18. 21. How long will ye h√†lt betweene two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions? if the Lord be God follow him: but if Baal be, then goe after him.</hi> So to admit two contrarie religions, were to halt betweene two opinions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The pope in none of his territories nor where he hath absolute iurisdiction, doeth graunt any libertie to protestants, but tolerateth rather Iewes and Turkes: neither is it reason that his popelings should receiue any such toleration.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It would be a meanes to obdurate and harden papists in their superstition, whereas I trust, there may be hope of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, so many as God shall call to returne to the Gospell.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Her Maiestie hath the example of the good kings of Iudah, for her warrant: they are commended which did expell all contrarie worshipps; as Asa because he brake downe the altars and images of strange Gods, <hi>2. Chro. 14. 3.</hi> Iehosaphat for remoouing the high places and groues, <hi>2. Chro. 17. 6.</hi> Iosias for putting downe the Chemarims that were idolatrous priests, <hi>2. King. 23. 5.</hi> Whereas the scripture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:14372:21"/>
such kings as did not take away the high places, as Iehoash, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 12. 3. and Azariah, 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Her Highnes hath a president from vertuous and blessed prince Edward 6. her Maiesties brother, who notwithstanding the request of Charles the Emperour, and the instance of Bishop Cranmer, and B. Ridley, would not consent to graunt to his sister the ladie Marie, to haue masse in her house. <hi>Fox. p.</hi> 1295. <hi>edition</hi> 1583.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Lastly, I will propound the most worthie example of the Emperour Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian, that when the citie of Rome sent <note place="margin">Ambros. in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> Valentin.</note> vnto him to restore the rytes of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the idolls, and all the consistorie being Christians perswaded therunto: the Emperour alone, being a yong man, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said them, alleadging the example of his brother Gratian; <hi>Quod pius frater eripuit, quo modo √† me putatis esse reddendum, cum in co relligio laedatur, &amp; frater: √† quo se nol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let pietate superari? How can I restore that which my brother tooke away? for both reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion should receiue hurt, and my brother, of whome he would not be ouercome in religion. Postulet parens Roma alia quaecunque desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret: Let my mother,</hi> saith he, <hi>aske any thing else that she please:</hi> but, in this request he
<pb facs="tcp:14372:21"/>
would not yeelde. The like constancie and firme resolution, thankes be to God, hath well appeared in her Maiestie. And so I conclude with that saying of Ambrose to Valentinian, with whome certaine dealt to haue their altars restored: <hi>Sed hac siiam sublata non essent, auferenda tuo imperio com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probarem.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epist. 30. ad Valentinian.</note> 
               <hi>But, if they were not alreadie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, I would prooue that they ought to be remooued by your authoritie: much lesse being now abolished, is it fit to haue them restored.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to these Romanists, sacrificing priests, and others, I wish that either they would returne home againe to vs, and that God would giue them repentance, that they may know the truth, and that they come to amendment out of the snare of the deuil, of whom they are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> at his wil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Because the Apostle maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely of the fal of the angels, not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time when, or the place from whence, or who and how many fell, we

are taught to stay our curiositie, and not to mooue needlesse questions. Yet so farre as <note place="margin">Of the fall of Angels.</note> the Scripture doth lead vs we may safely wade. 1. For the time, it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as soone as they were created, or not long after their creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, as it is said in Iob, <hi>he found no steadfastnes in the angels,</hi> Iob 4. 18. and Ioh. 8. 44. <hi>He was a lyar from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:</hi> that is from the beginning, not of his owne creation, but of the world and mans beeing: &amp; they fell before the starrs were made, Iob 38. 7. For the children of God, that is, the angels reioyced, gaue praise vnto God, so did the deuill neuer, not his angels that fell. 2. They fell from their estate, that is, that perfection of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, holines, innocencie, wherein they were created: their fall was of two sorts, the first was voluntarie and sinnefull in their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apostasie, the other necessarie and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in beeing cast downe from heauen: as the fall of man was first in his transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then in his expulsion out of paradise: and so the Apostle here saith, <hi>that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels first kept not their estate,</hi> and then <hi>lost their habitation,</hi> beeing depriued of their glorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The state]</hi> wherein they were created according to Gods image did consist, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14372:38"/>
in holines and innocencie, or in their knowledge and power: for these are the two parts of Gods image; <hi>knowledge,</hi> Col. 3. 10. <hi>holines, righteousnes,</hi> Eph. 4. 25. Then like as man hath wholly lost his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which was a supernaturall gift, and his naturalls, as knowledge, wisdome, are empaired, though not altogether lost: so Sathan is cleane fallen from the truth, Ioh. 8. 44. his power and knowledge remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, though not like to the elect angels, yet very great and vncomparable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of mans weaknesse: and therefore the Apostle Eph. 6. 12. giueth the name of <hi>powers, principalities, gouernours,</hi> euen vnto wicked angels.</p>

For the third: though directly in <note place="margin">Whether more good or bad angels.</note> Scripture it be not expressed, which is the greater number of Elect, or reprobate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; yet I hold it most probable, that the number of good angels is greater: as may appeare first by these places of Scripture, Psal. 55. 18. <hi>Many were with me.</hi> 2. king. 6. 16. 2. chron. 32. 7. <hi>They are more that are with vs, then they that be with them:</hi> which is to be vnderstood of the angels and inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirits. Againe, the greatest number of euill spirits, that I remember mentioned in Scripture is a legion, which contained
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14372:39"/>
6000. but we read of 12. legions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Math. 26. 43. and of not legions one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of whole hoasts. Gen. 32. 2. of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousands, &amp;c. ten thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands. Dan. 7. 10. yea twentie thousand thousand. Psal. 68. 17.</p>

Further by this doctrine we are taught, to take heed vnto our selues, that we fall not away from the first grace receiued, seeing the angels stood not, <hi>let him that standeth, take heede least he fall,</hi> 1. Cor. 10. 12. Neither is there any strength in mans freewill to hold him, as the Papists <note place="margin">Error 15.</note> affirme, seeing the Angels freewill could not keepe them from falling. Againe we see what a dangerous thing it is to despise gouernment, and to speake euill of those that are set ouer vs in the Lord, either in Ciuill or spirituall matters: to the which ende all these examples are produced by the Apostle, as the Israelites murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Moses, the Angels rebelled against God, the Sodomites skorned the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lot. Men for feare of the law, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine to speake euill of the Magistrate, but the tongues and stomackes of many are whetted against the Ministers, and they iudge it no fault: whereas their murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are not against them, but against

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14372:43"/>
fire and destruction is both in respect of the maiestie of God, who is offended, and his euerlasting will transgressed: as we see sinnes committed against the prince, are most grieuously punished, 1. Sam. 2. 25. as also in respect of themselues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue a will to sinne euer, if they could liue euer; as Gregorie saith, <hi>Adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiam dei pertinet, vt nunquam careant sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicio, qui carere noluerunt peccato: It belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Gods iustice, that they should neuer want punishment, that would neuer haue beene without sinne.</hi> God punisheth the will as well as the acte, as he rewardeth the will, 2. Cor. 8. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Applicat.</hi> 1. For the solution of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine doubts: first, whether hell fire be a materiall or spirituall fire? <hi>Answ.</hi> We nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Hell fire not onely corporal.</note> thinke the same to be onely spirituall, as Hierome imputeth to Origen, <hi>Gehenna tormenta non ponit in suppliciis, sed conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia peccatorum:</hi> that he thought hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not to consist in punishment, but in the conscience of sinners: neither is the fire corporall onely, as Augustine seemeth to be of opinion, that the deuils may be tormented with a corporall fire: but our opinion is, that hell fire shall be both a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall torment to the soule, and a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14372:43"/>
punishment to the bodie: as it is called <hi>the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone,</hi> Reuel, 21. 8. Mark. 9. 46. <hi>the worme dieth not:</hi> there is the torment of conscience, <hi>the fire neuer goeth out,</hi> that is, which tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the bodies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is obiected howe it may stand with Gods iustice to punish twice <note place="margin">Whether one sinne may be twice punished.</note> for the same sinne: and so Hierome see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to thinke vpon these wordes of Nahum. 1. 9. <hi>Non consurget tribulatio du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex: affliction shall not come twice:</hi> that the Sodomites, Egyptians, Israelites, were but temporally punished. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>The Sodomites suffer euerlasting fire:</hi> that as they were consumed with fire and brimstone once, and that countrey remaineth yet accursed, as we may see, Deut. 29. 23. beeing nowe turned to the dead sea; so they are for euer tormented in hell, their burning flames of vnnaturall lust are punished with euerlasting flames. 2. That place of the prophet hath no such meaning, but onely, that the Lord will punish throughly at once, that he shall not neede to punish the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, as Abishai saith, <hi>He would not smite Saul againe,</hi> 1. Sam. 26. 8. 3. Amongst men it is a very good
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14372:44"/>
rule not to punish twice for the same sinne where there is hope of amendment: but where they are incorrigible they may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish often: as God punished Pharao with one plague after another, because his heart was still hardned: Dauid was chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed but once with the death of the childe, because he repented. And as godlinesse hath the promises both of this life, and the next, 1. Tim. 4. 8. so it is iust that impietie should haue the punishment of both.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, against the papists let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued that onely make the greater sinnes, which they call mortal and deadly worthy of condemnation, and there are seauen of <note place="margin">Error. 19.</note> them, pride, enuie, wrath, idlenesse, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, gluttonie, lust: whereas all sinnes of themselues deserue death, Rom. 6. 23. but in Christ both these and all other are pardonable, Ioh. 1. 29.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, all Atheists are here conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that beleeue no hell, who shall feele it before they beleeue it, if they take not heede: let vs then feare God, that is able to punish bodie and soule, Math. 10. 28. and let vs by repentance clense our selues from these sinnes, so shall they neuer waigh vs downe to hell, 1. Cor. 6. 11.</p>

               <p>The reasons of the first are these: 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wheresoeuer else in scripture we finde mention made of Michael Christ is implyed: as Dan. 10. 13. 21. <hi>Michael your prince:</hi> but there is no prince of Gods people but Christ: Reuel. 12. 7, 10. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael is expounded to be Christ. 2. The word it selfe, beeing interpreted, <hi>quiest par deo, who is like vnto God,</hi> best agreeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ. 3. This angel that did burie Moses bodie, that the people should not make an idoll of it, was the same Angel, that was the protector, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour of the Israelites, which was Christ, Exodus, 32. 21. in whome Gods name was, which was also Iacobs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14372:49"/>
Angel, Genes. 48. 16. 4. Because in Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie the same forme of wordes is vsed, translated by the Septuagint. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Nowe I thinke it more proper to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Moses bodie literally, because, <note place="margin">Moses bodie how to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> it is without any wresting or crackled sense, and more agreeable to the storie, Deut. 34. 6.</p>
               <p>The obiections made against this sense are three: two against the first part, one against the latter.</p>
               <p>1. Because Saint Peter speaketh of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels properly, that they <hi>giue no railing iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2.</hi> Pet. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer, 1.</hi> Saint Peter speaketh not altogither of the same case; for there the angels raile not against the Magistrates of the earth, here Michael doeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Deuill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may both very well agree; Iude speaketh of Michael himselfe, Peter of Michaels Angels, that follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their prince.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect. 2.</hi> But the word here vsed is, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. 1.</hi> It is like that some histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call books of scripture are perished, as that Iosu. 10. 13. out of the which the Apostle had this storie, as S. Paul that of Iannes and Iambres, 2. Tim. 3. 8. and yet the scripture
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14372:50"/>
remaining is sufficient. 2. Or it may be affirmed, that these stories were preserued in the Church by faithfull tradition: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it follow, this beeing allowed, that popish traditions are to be admitted. <note place="margin">Error 23.</note> Traditions we absolutely condemne not, but receiue them with these three conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. That they be traditions historicall, <note place="margin">What traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be receiued.</note> not doctrinall, as this of Moses bodie: for the scripture containeth all sufficiencie of doctrine. 2. They must be consonant and agreeable to the scriptures, as this is to that place, Zachar. 3. 2. 3. There must be an apparant certentie and euidence of them, as there was of this<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the Apostles beeing directed by Gods spirit, beeing able to iudge, of true and forged traditions. Wherefore this is no warrant at all, for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish traditions, which are of doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Scripture, and fabulous and vncerten.</p>

And whereas they say, they worship no i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols but images, the Apostle here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the images of the heathen: for he vseth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifieth an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, not an idol.</p>
               <p>Secondly all carnal gospellers, that giue themselues to gluttonie, drunkennes, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, wantonnes, are reprooued: for euen these are sinnes against nature: for euen Abimelech by the instinct of nature, knew adulterie to be vnlawfull, Gen. 20. And bruit beasts, when they haue satisfied their nature, take no more: and they haue a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection to prouide for their yong: so haue not these, that spend vpon their bellie, and suffer their wife and children to want, who <hi>herein are worse then infidels,</hi> that were but naturall men. 1.

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:14372:55"/>
how farre this naturall knowledge doth extend it selfe: as there are three degrees thereof; in naturall things: ciuill and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties: and spirituall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This light of nature doth teach not onely men but bruit beasts, what is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good, as to eate, to drinke, to sleepe, to shunne that is hurtfull to nature. Isa. 1. 3. <hi>The oxe knoweth his owner, the asse his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters cribbe.</hi> But to doe these things well, and to referre them to a good ende, is a worke of grace, aboue nature. 2. Nature also giueth some light of morall duties. Rom. 2. 14. <hi>The Gentiles doe by nature the things contained in the law,</hi> though not as they should. 3. The light of nature serueth also for the knowledge <hi>of spirituall things,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. The godhead and eternall power are seene in the creatures: but after a generall, confused, and vnperfit manner.</p>
               <p>An example of naturall knowledge we hauein labal, Gen. 4. 20. <hi>who inuented tents and the keeping of cattell.</hi> Of morall duties in Pharao, who thought it vnlawfull euen by the light of nature, to touch an other mans wife. Gen. 12. 18. Abimelech also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an heathen man, had some knowledge of God, when he said to Abraham, <hi>God is with thee in all that thou doest.</hi> Gen. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:14372:55"/>
But this naturall light is imperfect and insufficient, like vnto that light, which was made at the first to distinguish the day and night before the Sunne was created, Gen. 1. 2. which was but a dimme and obscure light to the brightnes of the sunne: like as the cloud <hi>on the forepart gaue light to the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> on the backe part <hi>it was darkenes to the Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 14. 20. Such difference is there betweene the light of nature, and the light of grace. The reason of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light S. Paul sheweth, Rom. 1. 20. <hi>That the world should be left without excuse.</hi> This light of nature is not sufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men, but to correct them, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them, but to condemne them; not to iustifie them, but to testifie against them.</p>
               <p>First then here we reprooue certaine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Papists, who doubt not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that nature doth not onely affoard a <note place="margin">Error 29.</note> generall and common knowledge of the Godhead, but that it is able to bring a man to the true knowledge and worship of God, &amp; that by the light of nature a man may attaine to right morall duties, and true vertuous acts. But for the first, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour sheweth, that <hi>to know the onely very Lord,</hi> is a worke of faith, and giuen by Christ, ioh. 17. 3. And for the other S. Paul
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14372:56"/>
testifieth, that <hi>we are not able of our selues to think a good thought,</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 5. much lesse to produce any vertuous act.</p>
               <p>Secondly if notwithstanding the light of nature be able to giue some direction to discerne betweene good &amp; euill, betweene iust things and vniust, the light of grace ought to doe much more: wherefore if Christians beeing taught of God shall come short euen in externall duties of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honestie, the Gentiles shall rise vp in iudgement against them: yea I am afraid, that many of vs, that do professe the name of Christ, doe not shew that example of iustnesse, sobrietie, temperance, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which is to be found among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: nay I am more afraid, that euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians such enormous sinnes may be found, that the Gentiles would haue beene ashamed of: as the Apostle vpbraideth the Corinthians, with <hi>such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication as is not once named among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that one should haue his fathers wife,</hi> 1. Cor. 5. 1. so for craft, extortion, adulterie, malice, and such like, I doubt me, many Christians exceede the profane Gentiles.</p>

               <p>Secondly, brethren let vs take heede of schismes, seditions, mutinies, neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately to resist the ciuill state, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to forsake the felloweship of the Saints, as the manner of some is, as the Apostle speaketh, Heb. 10. 25. but to yeeld our selues in all obedience to our superiours; that it may be said of vs, as of the Israelites: <hi>Thou didst lead thy people like sheepe by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</hi> Psal. 77. 20.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As before the Apostle amplified this part, in describing the corruptions of these hypocrites by examples, so nowe he doeth illustrate the same by diuers similitudes: by the first, in calling them spots in feasts, he setteth forth gluttonie; by the two next of drie cloudes and barren trees, their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie: comparing them to the foaming sea, he sheweth their vaine glorie: by the similitude of wandring starres, which are dimmed and darkened, their euerlasting miserie.</p>
               <p>We see then that this is a sure note of a carnall professour that onely seeketh his <note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> pleasure, to pamper and feed his bellie, and to liue delicately.</p>
               <p>So S. Peter saith, <hi>they count it pleasure to liue deliciously for a season, spottes they are and blottes, in feasting with you, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 13. Of such also S. Paul speaketh, <hi>whose God is their bellie, whose glory is their shame,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. Such were those Israelites, which <hi>perished hauing the flesh yet within their teeth,</hi> Numb. 11. 33. Such were they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14372:61"/>
in the prophet Amos time, that did eate the lambes of their flockes, and calues of the stall, <hi>and did drinke wine in bowles: but no man is sorrie for the affliction of Ioseph,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So then, like as a spotte or blemish in a comely face, so were they a disgrace to the charitable feasts of the Church, which were then vsed for the cherishing of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue and releeuing of the poore. Like the <hi>fowles that did seaze vpon Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </hi> Gen. 15. 11. so these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure holy things, and pollute the holy feasts.</p>
               <p>The reason is expressed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>They make their bellies their Gods, &amp;c.</hi> because they minde earthly things. Philip. 3. 19.</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:14372:62"/>
Secondly we are taught, not to be giuen to a greedie appetite: for such an one, doth as the wise man saith, <hi>put a knife to his throat.</hi> Proverb. 23. 2. He that eateth and drinketh more then sufficeth, doth eate and drinke to his owne hurt both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and soule. We should then behaue our selues at feasts, as in the presence of God: as it is said of Iethro Moses father in law, <hi>that he did eate before God,</hi> Exod. 18. 12. and the elders of Israel saw God and did eate and drinke; so let vs so eat and drinke, that we may see God, that we be not made vnapt to praise him, and pray vnto him.</p>

               <p>Of such speaketh the Apostle, 2. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth. 3. 5, 6. <hi>Which haue a shew of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet denie the power thereof: of this sort</hi>

               <p>Such were the Pharisies, Math. 23. 15. <hi>That compasse sea and land to make a Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, and when he is made he is twofold more the child of hell then your selues:</hi> that is, there was neither true doctrine, nor holines of life to be found in their religion.</p>
               <p>Very wel is the doctrine and life of such compared to the grasse in the house top, <hi>wherewith the mower cannot fill his hand,</hi> Psal. 129. 6. and as potsheards couered with siluer, Prou. 26. 23. such is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of hypocrites.</p>
               <p>The reason hereof the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 2. Tim. 3. 5. before rehearsed. <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the power of godlinesse,</hi> contenting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

               <p>First, this doctrine laieth open the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie of Papists, and nakednes of their religion: which hath no true substance of <note place="margin">Error 35.</note> comfort in it.

promises which they make of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their followers remaine still in feare, doubt, and vncertentie of saluation, and many of them the children of hell, that they may truly say vnto them, as Iob to his friends, <hi>Miserable comforters are ye,</hi> and <hi>physitians of no value,</hi> Iob 13. 4. Secondly we are taught, that professe the Gospel, that we be not as wells without water, or cloudes without raine, or trees without fruit, but that all, both pastour and people, doe adorne our holy profession with wholesome fruits, not ouerthrowing in practise, which we build by our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor destroying by life, what we defend by learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>v. 13. They are the raging waues of the sea, foaming out their owne shame, &amp;c.]</hi> Here <note place="margin">Doctr. 5.</note> the Apostle toucheth their vaine glorie, that in their raging affections both ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously commend themselues, and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously despite others, which is but a reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their owne shame.</p>
               <p>So the Apostle saith, <hi>Their glorie is their shame.</hi> Phil. 3. 19. S. Peter saith, <hi>Speaking swelling wordes of vanitie, they beguile with wantonnes, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 18. Such an one was proud <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> that pratled against the Apostle <hi>with swelling words.</hi> Ioh. epist.

3. v. 10. Such were the swelling and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious words of the false prophet Zidkiah, when he smote Micaiah vpon the face, saying, <hi>When went the spirit of the Lord from me to speake vnto thee?</hi> 1. king. 22. 24.</p>
               <p>This similitude the Apostle taketh from the prophet Isai, 57. 20. <hi>The naked are like the raging sea, &amp;c. whose waters cast vp myre and dirt:</hi> so these by the foame of their mouthes and wordes, doe cast vp the dirt of their hearts.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Christ sheweth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Math. 12. 34. <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh:</hi> as their heart is wicked and corrupt, so are their words.</p>
               <p>First then this note fitly agreeth to all <note place="margin">Error 36.</note> popish writers: for let a view be taken of their bookes; therein shall you finde cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, rayling, proud boasting, presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Papists rayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14372:64"/>
out their owne shame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are taught euery man to gouerne his tongue: to refraine lying, slandering, swearing: for what doe these else, then bewray their filthie shame, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall escape vnpunished: as Psal. 52. 4. <hi>Thou louest all words that may destroy,</hi> so shall God destroy thee for euer: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Prou. 14. 3. it is said, <hi>that in the lippes of fooles is a rodde of pride:</hi> that is, his proud foolish tongue is a rod to whip himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As wandring starres, to whome is reserued the blacknes of darknes for euer:]</hi> That is, <note place="margin">Doctr. 4.</note> horrible and euerlasting darkenes. Here then the doctrine is, that they which doe erre themselues and mislead others as they delighted in darknes, so shall be punished with euerlasting darknes.</p>
               <p>This the Apostle sheweth, thus allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out of the Psalme, <hi>Destruction and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, are in their waies, the way of pease (or truth) they haue not knowne,</hi> Rom. 3. 17. They are ouerwhelmed with destruction, because they peruerted others with their errors.</p>
               <p>Such was that great seducer Simon Magus, to whome S. Peter saith, <hi>Thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney perish with thee, &amp;c. thou hast neither part nor fellowship in this busines,</hi> Act. 8. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:14372:64"/>
For like as wandring starres doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time loose their light, beeing ouershadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the funne: and as falling starres, are <hi>extinct like a torch quenched in waters,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 8. 10. so are false teachers compared: and they haue the key of the bottomlesse pit to open it to themselues and others. Reuel. 9. 1.</p>
               <p>The reason is giuen by the Apostle, 1. Ioh. 1. 5. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> therefore they which delight in error and darknesse, can haue no accesse vnto God.</p>
               <p>First we see the ende of all seducers and false teachers, whether Papists or others: the <hi>deuill that deceiued, and false prophets, shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone.</hi> Reuel. 20. 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, neither giue you eare to false and erroneous doctrines, to be as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring starres to wander from one doctrine to an other to your owne confusion.</p>

Esay, <hi>The Lord will come like fire, &amp; his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots like whirlewind that he may recompence his anger with wrath, and his indignation with the flame of fire, for the Lord will iudge with fire,</hi> Isay, 66. 16. Thus the Apostles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as S. Paul testifieth, <hi>Behold he will appoint a day, wherein he will iudge the world in righteousnesse,</hi> Act. 17. 31.</p>
               <p>A president of this iudgement day we haue, 1.

               <p>For like as the husbandman in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>calleth his labourers to paie them their hire,</hi> Matth. 20. 8. <hi>the master reckoneth with his seruants,</hi> Math. 25. 19. <hi>the rich man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth account of his steward,</hi> Luk. 16. 2. so the Lord hath appointed a day of reckoning, wherein he wil call all men to account.</p>

               <p>Agreeable to this, is that of Saint Paul, that <hi>euery man shall receiue according to that he hath done in his bodie, whether it be good or euill,</hi> 2.

                  <hi>vers. 16. These are murmurers, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp;c.]</hi> The Apostle here by a recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation rehearseth together the seuerall corruptions of these deceitfull hypocrites: they are toward God, <hi>murmurers:</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>following fleshly lusts:</hi> toward men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiours, such as their followers, they are boasters and speake proud things; or superiours, them they flatter and haue in admiration, for their owne aduantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Murmurers, complainers.]</hi> This is the <note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> propertie of carnall men, when all things fall not out according to their corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, to murmure against God.</p>
               <p>So saith the wise man, <hi>The foolishnes of a man peruerteth his way, and his heart fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth against the Lord.</hi> Prov. 19. 3.</p>
               <p>Such were the Israelites in the desert, that murmured against Moses and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, when they wanted foode, and wished that they had died in Egypt, Exod. 16. 8. To whome Moses saith, <hi>Your murmurings are not against vs, but against the Lord,</hi> v. 8. So they murmured againe, when they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted water, <hi>Wherefore hast thou brought vs out of Egypt, to kill vs, our children, and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with thirst?</hi> Exod. 17. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:14372:73"/>
But this murmuring against God, which is a kinde of resisting his will, is, as our Sauiour saith to Saul, a <hi>kicking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pricke,</hi> Act. 9. 5. the more a man striueth, the worse is his heele galled: or like as a potsheard should striue against a vessell of brasse: a <hi>potsheard with the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheards of the earth,</hi> as Esai saith, 45. 9. like against like: it is not for man to striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</p>
               <p>The reason, that ought to cause vs to leaue murmuring is this, as it is expressed, Exod. 16. 12. because <hi>the Lord heareth the murmurings of the people:</hi> and if, as it is in Iob, <hi>No man will say vnto the king, Thou art wicked, how much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of princes?</hi> Iob 34. 18, 19. If murmuring &amp; repining against the prince goe not vnpunished, how much lesse shall they not escape that repine against God?</p>
               <p>First then this doctrine discouereth the impietie of popish professours, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Error 40.</note> discontented with the present state, murmure and repine at euery thing. They <note place="margin">Papists mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers and grudgers.</note> were not contented to enioy their landes and liuings, and to liue in ease and quiet, but beganne to practise against the state, and to lie in waite against the life of our Soueraigne; whereupon, the state hath
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14372:73"/>
beene enforced to make lawes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine their vnbridled, factious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious spirit: as before they regarded not the princes <hi>lenitie,</hi> so nowe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of <hi>crueltie,</hi> which is not so, but iust <hi>seueritie</hi> executed vpon their disloyall and vnnaturall treacherie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all carnallmen, are here laid open, who if any thing fall out crosse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, if sicknesse, vnseasonable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, losse of wordly substance doe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, they are ready to lay the fault vpon God.

                  <hi>Walking after their lusts:]</hi> that is, their whole desire is to satisfie their owne carnal <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> lusts and appetite: it is one thing to walke in the flesh, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This then is a note of a false religion, &amp; of the professours thereof, that it worketh not true mortification, but euen the best of them are addicted to their affections of enuie, ambition, couetousnes, lust, &amp; such like: it is the right faith onely that mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the earthly members, and causeth all <note place="margin">Mortification a note of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> those to die vnto sinne, that truely receiue it.

So no other religion can sanctifie the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but the faith of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>The reason here of Saint Paul sheweth, because <hi>heresies are of the workes of the flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 20. and the flesh lusteth against the spirit: but it is <hi>the spirit whereby we doe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deedes of the flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 13.

and where in the world is more fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and adulterie, so domitrie, to be found, then in Rome the cheife seat and palace of the Popedome?</p>
               <p>If they shall obiect, that there are truely mortified among them, as their Hermites, Anachorites, Caponchians, Carthusians, many of them going barefoote, eating no flesh, cloathed with sackcloath, &amp;c. <hi>I aunswere,</hi> that among the Iewes, there were the Essaei, a most strict sect, that eate no flesh at all, and the Pharises, that were more secular and worldly; among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, we reade also of diuers sectes, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures, that gaue themselues to pleasure.

               <p>The prophet Isay noteth this in his time to haue beene a fault, that flatterers would <hi>call a foole wise or ingenious, and a ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or churle liberall,</hi> Isay, 32. 5. but he prophesieth that this custome should not be vsed by the faithfull seruants of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Such were the princes of Zoan, and counsellers of Egypt that flattered foolish and simple Sethon their king, saying vnto him, <hi>that he was the son of the wise,</hi> Isa. 19. 11.</p>
               <p>Thus the woman of Tekoah beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by wilie Ioab, flattered king Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, saying, <hi>My Lord the king is as an angell of God,</hi> that shee might winne his fauour for the returne of bloodie Absolom, 2. Sam. 14. 17. Thus Baals prophets that were fedde at Iezabels table, flattered A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, &amp; pleased his humor, that they might pamper their bellies still, 1. King. 22. 6.</p>
               <p>Like as the strumpet enticeth the yong man with <hi>carpets, &amp; laces, &amp; perfumes,</hi> Pro. 7. 16. 17. <hi>til she haue got all his substance into her house,</hi> Prou. 5. 10. so doe flatterers play, they perfume &amp; please others with sugred words, &amp; renowmed praises, as with toyes

               <p>The reason that mooueth men to vse flattering wordes, is because they know, that many times the truth offendeth, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Am I therefore become your enemie, because I speake the truth!</hi> Gal. 4. 16. As Hierome saith, <hi>The truth is bitter, of a</hi>

               <p>First we here discouer the hypocrisie of the Romanists, Iesuits, seminarie priests, <note place="margin">Error 43.</note> with others, that will crouch and insinuate themselues into the courts and fauour of princes, commending them with most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable words, and blazing their praises, <note place="margin">The popish sort flatterers of the state.</note> many times, but due and iust, but they doe it cunningly to make a way for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>selues, and to get footing for their superstition.

               <p>Againe, this may be a rule to all true professours of the Gospel, especially to ministers of the word of God, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the persons of men, neither seeke to please them, for their owne preferment sake. I am afraid, least there be many such preachers, that hauing occasion to speake before great persons, are afraid to offend them, but studie to deliuer pleasing things: not remembring what Saint Paul saith, <hi>If I should yet please men, I were not the seruant of Christ.</hi> Neither shall the fawning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of such profit the soules of the hearers, no more then a building can stand, which is <hi>daubed vp with vntempered and vnwrought morter.</hi> Ezech. 13. 10.</p>

an effectuall exhortation, from v. 17. to v 24. and a solemne thanksgiuing vnto God, v. 24, 25.

                  <hi>But ye, beloued, remember the words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ:]</hi> In that this our Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth <note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> them to the sayings of the elder Apostles, he thereby teacheth vs, what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities we ought to relie vpon in matters of faith: not vpon humane &amp; terrene, such as are the writings of poets, philosophers, and other heathen, but vpon diuine say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the prophets and Apostles.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As our Sauiour Christ himselfe beeing to preach in the Synagogue, taketh his theame out of the prophesie of Esay. Luk. 4. Saint Peter referreth the brethren to the epistles of Saint Paul, 2. Pet. 3. 15. thus writing: <hi>As our beloued brother Paul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wisdome giuen vnto him, wrote vnto you, as one, that in all his epistles spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>

                  <hi>of these things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For like as it is a vaine thing to leaue the fountaine that is neuer dried vp, and to <hi>digge broken pittes, that can hold no water,</hi> Ierem. 2. 13. so is it to leaue the word of God, and to follow the fansies of men.</p>
               <p>And as the Israelites loathed Manna, and longed for the fleshpottes of Egypt, Exod. 16. so doe they that not contented with the word of God, delight themselues with the grosse inuentions of men.</p>
               <p>For if the word of God be profitable to <hi>reach, to improoue, to correct and instruct in righteousnesse,</hi> and not onely profitable, but sufficient, beeing <hi>able to make the man of God perfect to euery good worke,</hi> 2. Tim. 3. 16. where a sufficiencie may be had, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpes are superfluous.</p>
               <p>First then the Papists are here confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who in stead of Scripture in their <note place="margin">
                     <p>Error 44.</p>
                     <p>Humane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings preferred before scripture in poperie.</p>
                  </note> Churches, did read their legend stories, lies of their owne making, Prophets and Apostles in the meane while beeing si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: in their schooles they expounded not the bookes of scripture, but some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane author, as Dionysius hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, or such like: in their writings they did gloase and comment vpon the master of sentences, in stead of interpreting the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:14372:80"/>
Next vnto these, yong wanton deuines are reprooued, of which sort there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in these daies, especially in the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, that stuffe their sermons with the quotations of Philosophers, Poets, and make ostentation of humane eloquence, and so preach themselues, and not Iesus Christ. S. Paul did not so: <hi>His preaching was not in the entising speech of mans wisdom.</hi> 1. Cor. 2. 4.</p>
               <p>If any shall obiect Saint Pauls example, that alleadgeth the testimonie of heathen <note place="margin">How S. Paul alleadgeth Poets.</note> Poets, Act. 17. 28. 1. Cor. 15. 33. Tit. 1. 12. the answer is readie: 1. the Apostle is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sparing in such allegations, he vseth them but thrise. 2. He doth it not with vaine ostentation of their names, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of long sentences in a strange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but in the same wherein he wrote and spake. 3. He doth it vpon iust occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in confuting the heathen by their owne writers: which we denie not, but is a lawfull and commendable vse of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane authours: for so Origen against Celsus, Cyprian against Demetrianus, Methodius against Porphirie, Hilarius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Vioscorus, beeing Gentiles, doe vrge the authorities and testimonies of their owne wise men. But Saint Paul, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14372:80"/>
such testimonies sparingly, not with vaine ostentation, neither superfluously, but vpon iust occasion; is no warrant to our greene Diuines to doe it ordinarily, vainely, vnprofitably: and so I conclude this point with Origen, who reading ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Septuagint, that Ioshua made kniues of stone, or of the rocke, to circumcise the people, thus writeth: <hi>Esaxo non ex ferro artificis opere fabricatos: hoc</hi>

               <p>This is expressed in the parable of the eleuenth houre, Math. 20. All the time of the last calling of the world by Christ, is called by the Apostle, <hi>novissima hora,</hi> the <hi>last houre,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2. 18. For like as after the sunne beginneth to decline, we count it the latter part of the day, though yet there are some houres to night; so this is the latter age of the world, though many hundred yeares thereof are alreadie past.</p>
               <p>Saint Iohn giueth this reason, why it should be accounted the last time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14372:82"/>
then when he liued: <hi>As ye haue heard that Antichrist shall come, euen nowe are there many Antichrists, whereby we knowe it is the last time,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2. 18.</p>
               <p>Another reason may be gathered from the wordes of our Sauiour, Math. 11. 14. <hi>If ye will receiue it, this is Elias which was to come:</hi> from whence, we reason thus; Elias was to come in the last times, euen imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the great and fearefull day of the Lord, Mal. 3. 1. But Iohn Baptist was that Elias: therefore the time, wherein Iohn Baptist preached and euer since are the last times.</p>
               <p>First then if the last times began in the Apostles daies, and there are now runne of these last times, 16. hundred yeares, and <note place="margin">
                     <p>Error. 45.</p>

                        </gap>ce.</p>
                  </note> by the scriptures we finde that Antichrist was to be reuealed in the last times; here agreat error of the Papists is discouered, who imagine that Antichrist is not yet come, neither can they tell when he shall come; which their opinion is contrarie to the scriptures: for if the mysterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie beganne to worke in the Apostles time, 2. Thess. 2. 6. and if then many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs were in the world, the forerunners of the great Antichrist, howe can it be that a way hauing beene prepared for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14372:82"/>
aboue a thousand and halfe of yeres; that he should not yet come. And further, seeing that which was the onely let of Antichrists comming, is taken out of the waie, which was the Romane Empire, which hath beene many yeares since chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and altered, why should not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ be reuealed, there beeing nothing to hinder him? And as touching the Romane Empire, we say it is remooued out of the way, both in respect of place, name, order, <note place="margin">Error. 46.</note> authoritie, iurisdiction: the place and seate of the Emperour was in Rome, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> thence it was translated to the Greeks, from them to the French, from them to the Germans: neither hath nowe the Emperour his name of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, but of the Germans: the order is changed, the Empire went by succession, now it is conferred by election: his authoritie was before the Bishop of Rome, now it is inferiour: the Emperour did sometime confirme the election of the Pope, nowe the Pope confirmeth the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Emperour: and as for his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, sometime all the West parts were obedient and subiect to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour but nowe all kingdomes are fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him his imperials are limited to certaine free cities in Germanie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14372:83"/>
seeing that which letted Antichrists comming is taken out of the way, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Onely he which now withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, shall let, till he be taken out of the way,</hi> 2. Thess. 2. 7. We conclude that Antichrist is alreadie, and hath beene a long time in the worlde, and he none other but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, seeing the last times beganne so many hundred yeares agoe, and we are so much the nearer the ende of the world, howe much more ought we to be carefull <note place="margin">The last times should prepare vs for Christ.</note> to addresse our selues for the comming of the Lord? if the Apostle thus perswaded in his time, <hi>The Lord is at hand, be carefull for nothing,</hi> Phil. 4. 5. 6. then nowe the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Lord is at hand, the lesse greedie should we be for the things of this life. Therfore the Lord in wisdome hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the secret of his comming, still tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs by his Apostles and ministers, that we are in the last times, that we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be watchfull. Carnall and worldly men make a contrarie vse: for some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> as Saint Peter saith, <hi>will beginne to mocke &amp; say, where is the promise of his comming?</hi> 2. Pet. 3. 4. still the last times, the last times, say they, but we see no ende yet: whome the Apostle answereth excellently, first
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14372:83"/>
that in respect of God there is no slacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, because one day is with him as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, and a thousand yeares as one daie: secondly, neither is he slacke to vs ward, but patient; because he would haue all men come to repentance.</p>
               <p>Others there are that take more libertie to sinne, <hi>because their master deferreth his comming,</hi> Matth. 24. 48. But our Sauiour Christ teacheth vs to make another vse, <note place="margin">Non prodest scire, sed m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Such the Prophet speaketh of, Psal. 89. 51. <hi>They haue slaundered the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of thine annointed:</hi> that is, they laugh
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14372:84"/>
to scorne those that patiently waite vpon the Lord, and walke in his pathes: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Isay complaineth of such, <hi>that scorned and mocked</hi> at the iudgements of God, as though they should not come neare them, Isay, 28. 14, 22.</p>
               <p>Such were Lots sonnes in law, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they were warned to depart the citie, he seemed to them, as though he had moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but indeed they mocked him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not his wordes, Gen. 19. Thus the Philosophers mocked and scorned S. Paul when he spake vnto them of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; of the day of iudgement, Act. 17.</p>
               <p>Euen like as the Israelites beleeued not, that God would prouide for them in the desert, saying, <hi>Can God prepare a table in the wildernesse?</hi> Psal. 78. 19. And as the noble man gaue no credit to the prophet, when he foretolde of the great plentie &amp; cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of corne, to morrowe this time, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>though God should open the windows of heauen, it could not so come to passe,</hi> 2 Kin. 7. 2. Such are these mockers, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion are incredulous, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the mysterie of the incarnation of Christ, the resurrection, life euerlasting, &amp; such other mysteries, thinking these things impossible</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:14372:84"/>
The reason of this their scorning incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie the Apostle sheweth, thus writing, 1. Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse vnto him, neither can he know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> because they are spiritually discerned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First then by way of reproofe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may be applied against all professed or close Atheists, which deride the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, of Gods prouidence, of our redemption by Christ, of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins birth: they beleeue neither heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> nor hell, to whom I say with the prophet, Isay, 28. 22. <hi>Nowe therefore be no mockers least your bonds increase:</hi> least you sooner feele God, then beleeue him: as Pharao, who contemptuously said, who is the Lord, that I should let Israel goe? Exod. 5. 2. to his cost had experience of Gods power, beeing ouerwhelmed in the red sea.</p>

out their tongues make mockes &amp; mowes without all shamefastnesse and modestie.

               <p>Thirdly, let vs take heede, that there be not any scorners among vs, which deride the godly disposition or honest life of their brethren: as Dauid had experience, Psal. 69. 10. <hi>When I wept and fasted, it turned to my reproch: I put on sackecloath, and I became a prouerbe vnto them.</hi> But let such take heede, least if they scorne Isaac with Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, together with Ismael they be cast out of Abrahams house, and with Esau loose the birthright.</p>
               <p>Likewise we are taught not to measure the high points of religion with the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe reach of mans witte: for this were, as if a man should <hi>gather the wind into his fist, or bind the waters in a garment,</hi> Prou. 30. 4. But that, if we remaine yet in doubt, let vs seeke with humilitie to beleeue what we read, not by reason to comprehend: as the prophet saith: <hi>Nisi credideritis non intellige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis: Unlesse ye beleeue, ye cannot vnderstand.</hi> Isay. 7. 9.

               <p>And like as, while the whole hoast of Israel kept an holy rest in celebrating the sabbath according to the commandement of God, certaine rebellious persons went out from them to gather Manna, but found none.

               <p>First then, whereas the papists our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries charge vs, that we haue deuided our selues from the fellowshippe of the Church, and from the obedience of the sea of Rome, going out into diuers sects, &amp;c. Rhemists, annot. Iud. v. 16. &amp; so are those of whome the Apostle here speaketh. We doe most iustly returne this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation vpon their owne heades, that haue <note place="margin">Error. 48.</note> departed from the Apostolike faith, and haue made an apostasie from the auncient truth, as the Apostle prophecied of them: that there should <hi>come a departing or aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, when the man of sinn should be reuealed,</hi> 2. Thess. 2. 3. The protestants then leauing the society of the false &amp; corrupt Romane Church, do no more segregate themselues then Noah did, when he went into the arke, and left the old world in their infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: or Lot, which went out of Sodome, forsaking both their sinnes and plagues: or Elias which separated himselfe from Baals priests: or our Sauiour, that refused the traditions of the Scribes and Pharises, or the Apostles, that communicated not with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14372:87"/>
the idolatrie of the Gentiles. They then are not schismatickes or sectaries, that are fewer in number, neither are they Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, that boast of their multitudes: for Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs familie was fewer in number then the Cananites, Gen. 34. 30. And there were foure hundred Baals priests, to one Michaiah, 1. King. 22. But they make sects and segregate themselues, that forsake the auncient faith of the Apostles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, as the Romish Church hath done: and they are the true Catholike Church, which retaine the trueth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the right faith, how small so euer their number is.</p>
               <p>Againe, we are taught to take diligent heed, that we be not at any time seduced to breake the peace and vnitie of the Church, <note place="margin">We must not leaue the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Church.</note> to runne into schismes: giue not eare to the enticing perswasions of Brownists, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, Anabaptists, Papists, to forsake the communion of the saints in the visible Church of God amongst vs: for if the braunch be broken off from the stocke, it withereth, or if the sheep goe a stray from the flock it is in the way of perishing.

               <p>To this purpose the prophet Isaie speaketh diuinely, c. 40. 31. <hi>They that wait vpon the Lord shall renewe their strength,</hi>

               <p>Like as it is said of those that goe vp to Ierusalem, <hi>they goe from strength to strength,</hi> Psal. 84. 7.

               </p>
               <p>The reason hereof may be gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that saying of our Sauiour, Ioh. 15. 2. <hi>Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry braunch, that beareth not fruite in me, he taketh away, and euery one that beareth fruite, he purgeth it, that it may bring foorth more fruit.</hi> So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that branch which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and increaseth not, is like to prooue a dead and withered braunch: and so is that

their faith, hope, charitie, knowledge, zeale, is the same, which it was many yeres since: surely such may worthily suspect themselues that their faith is dying in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>: for it is most true, <hi>qui non proficit, deficit,</hi> he that increaseth not, decreaseth.

               <p>Saint Iames testifieth as much saying, <hi>If any of you lacke wisedome, let him aske of god, who giueth to all men liberally, &amp;c. but let him aske in faith.</hi> Iam. 1. 5. The prophet Dauid is a notable president to vs in

both these points: that praier is a meane to obtaine such graces as we want, Psal. 109. 4. <hi>But I betake my selfe vnto praier:</hi> and that it ought to be with the heart, Psal. 108. 1. <hi>Mine heart is prepared, mine heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, O God, I will sing and giue praise.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Exor.</hi> For like as Moses with his rodde wrought wonders, &amp; Elisha with his staff, in such stead is praier vnto Christians: but like as the <hi>Arke was couered with gold, both within &amp; without,</hi> Exod. 25. 11. so our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er must not consist in glorious &amp; goodly words, but proceede from the golden me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of the heart.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Testim.</hi> Therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Endeauouring to keepe the vnitie of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the bond of peace,</hi> Eph. 4. 3. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Be angrie and sinne not,</hi> v. 26. that is, so

                  <hi>Aitiolog.</hi> Now the Apostle sheweth the reason, why we ought to be carefull to maintaine peace and loue. Eph. 4. 5. <hi>There is one Lord, one faith, one baptisme:</hi> that is, like as they, which are seruants to one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, of one opinion and iudgement, and of the same blood will hold togither; so should we, beeing seruants to one Lord, professours of the same faith, and of one spirituall kinred in baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Applicat.</hi> Now whereas the Apostle saith, <hi>Keepe your selues,</hi> least the Papists, and <note place="margin">Error 51.</note> other freewill-men should take aduantage by these and such other words, as though it <note place="margin">Against free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</note> were in our owne power to keepe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue our selues in charitie, or in any other Christian vertue, we make this answer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. 1. That it followeth not, vpon these and other such like precepts, giuen in Scripture, that it is in mans power to performe them: for then, where S. Iohn Baptist saith, <hi>Repent: for the kingdome of God is at hand,</hi> Matth. 3. 2. and where Saint Peter saith, <hi>Saue your selues from this fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation,</hi> Act. 2. 40. it might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, that man hath power by his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to repent, and to saue himselfe. 2.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine another reason is why the Scriptures so exhort vs, because man is in deede to will and performe all those things, yet not of himselfe, but by the strength of grace: as the Apostle saith, <hi>He laboured: yet not he, but the grace of God in him,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 10. And this point is well touched by Augustine: <hi>Nos velle cum volumus, sed ille facit vt velimus bonum: certum est nos fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, sedille facit, vt faciamus. That we doe</hi>

               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dly we are taught by this doctrine, that we ought to be most carefull to keepe charitie, and so shunne all occasions which

The sense of the place giueth it: because thus reading, <hi>haue compassion on some, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers saue with feare,</hi> there is an apparant difference made betweene two sorts of men, the weake, and the obstinate: but in the other translation, <hi>those reprooue beeing iudged, &amp; them saue by pulling out of the fire:</hi> this difference is taken away: for to saue by pulling out of the fire, and by an earnest reproouing, is all one. 3. Because the latin <note place="margin">Error 54.</note> translator is hereby driuen to a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, to corrupt and transpose the words of the text, reading the next verse thus: <hi>but them saue pulling out of the fire, and on other haue mercie in feare:</hi> whereas this word, <hi>in feare,</hi> should be ioyned to <hi>saue,</hi> &amp; these words, <hi>on other shew mercie,</hi> should be read in the former verse.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Beside the corrupt vse in poperie, this is also a fault among carelesse ministers, that admitte vnto the Lords table many both in respect of their profannesse vnworthy, and for want of knowledge vnfit: an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely thing it is, that holy things should be giuen vnto dogges or swine: they are dogges, that are malitious, enuious, cruell, vsurers, oppressours, extortioners; sensuall persons, licentious, carnall, Epicures, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, drunkards: ignorant sottes are swine: it is herein the Ministers part, <hi>to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the pretious from the vile,</hi> Ierem. 15. 19.

                  <note place="margin">Error. 65.</note> a certaine erroneous opinion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists is confuted, as touching the god head <note place="margin">Christ God of himself though not the sonne of himselfe.</note> of Christ; for they say, that he had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his person, but his substance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Rhemist. Ioh. 1. sect. 3. We contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doe hold; that Christ, though as he is the sonne, he be of the Father in respect of his person, yet he is God of himselfe as the father is: as the Apostle saith here he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise, as Saint Paul calleth God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely wise, Rom. 16. 27. wherefore Christ is God himselfe, wise of himselfe, immortall of himselfe, as God the father is: if that his wisdome, power, Godhead, should be begotten of god, then he should be wise, not as he is God, but as he is the sonne; then could he not be onely wise, for the sonne cannot be said to be sole or one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14372:107"/>
because he is neuer without the Father, as Ambrose well noteth: <hi>Audeo dicere, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus est fillus, sed solus non est: primus, quia cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>patre semper, solus non est, quia sine patre, nunqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> est, non ego hoc dico, sed ipse dixit, non sum solus, quia pater mecum est: solum diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas facit, &amp; quod vnum est, solum est. I dare say the sonne is first, but the sonne is not alone: he is first, because alwaies with the Father, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone because he is neuer without the father: I say not this, but himselfe said it, I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, because my father is with me: the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head maketh him alone, for that which is one is alone.</hi> Wherefore Christ is onely wise as his father is, he is wise of himselfe, and God of himselfe as his father is: and so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ saith, that as the father hath life in himselfe, so likewise hath he giuen to the sonne, to haue life in himselfe, Ioh. 5. 26.</p>

spirituall grace, as Saint Iames teacheth: if any man lacke wisedome let him aske of God who giueth vnto all liberally, Iam. 1. 5. Wherefore the carnall securitie of all worldly minded men is here condemned, which as though they had all fulnesse in themselues, whereas they are emptie and destitute, seeke not vnto Christ for wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, grace and knowledge: as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ vpbraideth the Iewes, <hi>Ye will not come vnto me that ye may haue life,</hi> Ioh. 5. 40.</p>

            <p>The second is euident, not onely in that the Pope hath exalted himselfe against kings and Emperours, which are called Gods in earth, causing them to kisse his feete, to hold his stirrop, to lead his horse by the bridle, treading vpon their neckes, &amp;c. But also in suffering most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous titles to be giuen vnto him, as one Christofer Marcell. said to the Pope in the late Councell of Laterane, <hi>Tu es alter deus in terris.

            <p>For the proofe of this I will onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the acts of the second Nycene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, which denied the worship of images: there it is euident, what grosse fables and old wiues tales are alleadged to establish that grosse superstition.

            <p>Such in all respects is the profession of poperie: for though they boast of the true Catholike faith, and that none of their Church can be saued: yet if a man looke into their doctrine, he shall neuer finde his conscience setled therein, but still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in doubt.

they beleeue: Rhemist. 1. Tim. 2. sect. 4. that Christ died for all men, for Turkes, Iewes, infidels: that a man cannot knowe, neither ought discusse, whether he be in the state of grace. Rhemist. 1. Cor. 4. sect. 4. that it is a damnable and false illusion &amp; presumption for any particular man, to be sure of his saluation: Rhemist.

            <p>These and such like comfortlesse do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are held and maintained in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: so that according to their rules, the most deuout papist can neuer be sure that his sinnes are forgiuen him, or that Christ died for him, more then for a Turke or Iewe, or that he finally shall be saued. The faith of the Apostle was not so, who was fully perswaded, that nothing could sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him from the loue of God, Rom. 8. 38. and that there was a crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse laid vp in store for him, 2.

            <p>Such in all respects is the profession of poperie: for though they boast of the true Catholike faith, and that none of their Church can be saued: yet if a man looke into their doctrine, he shall neuer finde his conscience setled therein, but still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in doubt. They teach that God hath elected none but conditionally, so
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14372:128"/>
they beleeue: Rhemist. 1. Tim. 2. sect. 4. that Christ died for all men, for Turkes, Iewes, infidels: that a man cannot knowe, neither ought discusse, whether he be in the state of grace. Rhemist. 1. Cor. 4. sect. 4. that it is a damnable and false illusion &amp; presumption for any particular man, to be sure of his saluation: Rhemist. Rom. 8. in v. 38. they hold generally that faith may be lost, that no man can be sure that he shall perseuere or continue to the ende.</p>
            <p>These and such like comfortlesse do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are held and maintained in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: so that according to their rules, the most deuout papist can neuer be sure that his sinnes are forgiuen him, or that Christ died for him, more then for a Turke or Iewe, or that he finally shall be saued. The faith of the Apostle was not so, who was fully perswaded, that nothing could sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him from the loue of God, Rom. 8. 38. and that there was a crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse laid vp in store for him, 2.

Note.</note> The Apostle hauing described the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and conditions of corrupt teachers, <note place="margin">Liplabour praier.</note> nowe he turneth himselfe to describe the true members of the Church of Christ, whome by this note as one he would haue knowne: they doe pray in the holy Ghost, that is, with feeling and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, for such are the praiers of the spirit: this difference our Sauiour Christ maketh betweene true and false worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Iohn, 4. 22. <hi>Yee worship that ye knowe not, we worship what we knowe, for saluation is of the Iewes.</hi> But the members of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church knowe not what they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, nor what they pray, speaking in an vnknowne tongue; and therefore wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true and right vse of praier, they are not the true Church of Christ: for in the Church of God there is the true inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the name of God, and there are the true worshippers of God in spirit and trueth, Ioh. 4. 24. but liplaboure is no true worship of God, such as are all praiers

made without vnderstanding in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue: as Ambrose saith vpon these wordes of S. Paul, <hi>My minde is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruite,</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 14. <hi>Quem fructum habere potest, qui ignorat, quae loquitur? What fruite or profit can he haue that knoweth not what he saith?</hi>

               <hi>Uers.</hi> 23. <hi>Hate the garment spotted of the flesh:]</hi> This is another note of the true <note place="margin">25. Note.</note> religion, that it retaineth not carnall rites &amp; ceremonies, which are here vnderstood by the fleshly garment, such as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh against, Coloss. 2. 2. such traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s as consisted in touching, tasting, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dling, which things perish with the vse.</p>
            <p>But such is the popish profession alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether adorned with the vesture of the flesh: for most of their carnall and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious rites and vsages they haue borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed partly from the Iewes, partly from the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>From the Gentiles they haue learned, their adoration of images, praier to the dead, multiplicitie of saints, purgatorie, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of waxe candles &amp; burning of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, with such other infinit rites, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal whereof is deriued from the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, as <note place="margin">Moresin. de o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin. papat.</note> a learned scottish writer hath lately shewed in a treatise onely of that argument.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:14372:134"/>
From the Iewes they haue their palme, salt, oyle, holy water, obseruation of daies, difference of meats, with such other; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can not iudge that to be sound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which vseth such traditions, which are after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mandements of men, Col. 2. 22. and so I conclude this point with Augustine: <hi>De aqua, frumento, vino, oleo in seruitute veteris populi multa celebrari im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratasunt, quae nobis tantum intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>da tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur.</hi>

               <hi>Many things concerning corne, wine, oyle, were commanded to be obserued in the seruitude of the olde lawe, which are onely so be vnderstood of vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I by these 25. notes gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of this epistle consisting of 25. verses, declared howe the true religion and Church from the false may be discerned: which also may serue as a caueat &amp; aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to the Reader, concerning a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine seditious popish pamphlet lately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, called a quarterne of reasons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the libeller by his 25. reasons would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the credite of our Church and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which booke, as I vnderstand, is very sufficiently answered by a studious young man, and learned diuine, and is readie for the presse. Thus I end exhorting the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der according to S. Pauls rule: <hi>to trie all</hi>
