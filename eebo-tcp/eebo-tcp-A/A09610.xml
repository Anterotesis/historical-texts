            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO MY LOVING GOOD FRIND N. SECRETARY TO THE right honorable the L. Treasurer of Inglande.</head>
            <p>LOVING Sir, yf my former letters written to you from Midleburg, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Heid leberg, &amp; Franckford, as I passed by those places, haue come safely vnto your handes, then haue you vnderstood by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the estate of affayres, as I coulde learne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in so shorte a stay, as the continuance of my iourney per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to make in euery of these cityes: especially I wrote vnto you in all my former, of the great variety of bookes both in Inglishe and Latyn, and other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages already come forth, or in makinge (as by good meanes I vnderstoode) against the laste proclamation of her Maiestie published in Nouember for searching <note place="margin">1591.</note> out, apprehendinge and punishing of Seminarie priestes, and Iesuites, and such as receaue or fauoure them in Ingland; which proclamation seemeth to haue so netled the papistes, which we call here Catholiques, (and so muste I in the reste of my letters, especially those that shal come from Italie,) that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke almoste now in these partes, nor of any other matters, but of this combate of Englande, and in this countrie here of Germanie, where both parties liue in peace together, our course of Ingland hath diuerse that approue it not, though otherwise no papistes, for that they thincke it both troublesome, and daungerous,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22504:4"/>
whereof at an other time I shal write more vnto you, yf I may perceaue that my letters doe come vnto your handes safely, whereof I haue greate feare and doubt, consideringe the difficulties of passages, and manifolde interception of letters, whereof I vnderstande daily by reason of warres.</p>
            <p>But to come to the matter, I sent you with my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer letters while I was in flandres two or three diuers kindes of answers made and printed in Inglishe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out name of authours against the said late proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and some others I was told were in coming foorth though I could not learne by whome. Afterward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Colen I sente you one written in Latine by <hi>Ihon Perne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glis he man,</hi> as he nameth himself, &amp; it goeth by way of a letter, or discourse, written to a frinde of his that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his opinion and judgemente aboute the saide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and it is directed to my L. Treasurer himself.</p>
            <p>But now comming to Augusta, I haue learned of an other booke also written in Latin, and lately sent hither to be printed againe, &amp; is now in hande &amp; some sheetes already drawen of: which booke, though I can neyther hynder the printinge thereof, (for I haue assayed) nor yet get any whole copy into my handes to sende vnto you (for I vnderstande there is but one onely as yet in this citie, and this is that which serueth for the printer, sent hither by a certaine principall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be reprinted as soone as euer it had passed the presse in an other place) yet haue I so wrought as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday beinge sunday, and the print standinge still, I gat for mony the sighte of the booke, and in some few nightes I tooke out all the summe, and chiefe effecte thereof, &amp; doe sende it herewith vnto you, promisinge further to send also the whole woorke as soone as euer it shal come forthe, albeit yf the haste and greedinesse of printinge it in so many places and countreys, at one time be such, as here some woulde make me beleeue,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22504:4"/>
it is like yow shal haue it otherwise there in Inglande, before I can send it from hence, but yet this shall not lett me from doinge my dewtie also in sending it from hence as sone as I can get it.</p>
            <p>And in truthe yf I shal tell you myne opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about the hastie spredding of this booke (which I suppose you will also thinke, when you shal haue seene the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte that herewith I do sende you) there are so many poynts of curiositie, and hidden histories touching our estate discouered in the same, and so many personall causes, conditions of men, and secret affaires vnfolded, (whereof mans nature partly by desire of nouelties, partly by corrupt inclination to heare willingly other mens defects is greedy to vnderstande) as I maruaile not though printers to gaine thereby, doe striue in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places to diuulgate the same with all celerity, and the like I finde by experience in the late historie of D. Sanders in Latin <hi>de schisimate Anglicano,</hi> which for that it conteyned matter of such curiositie, and noueltie in personall affayres, I find it printed againe in Latin almost in euery state, <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ydes the translations that go in other languages, which I am tolde are many.</p>
            <p>But for this booke againste the proclamation, I do assure you it is the moste sharpe, bitter, and odious thing that euer I thinck was written by the papistes, though the writer pretende great modestie, and doeth not in deede vse open raylinge tearmes, but by a close, fluente, and cutting stile, and by discussing (as I haue saide) of many, and curious perticularities, and by pretending to proue all he saith, by our owne bookes, lawes, cronicles, and recordes, he filleth his reader with infinite desire to reade al through out.</p>
            <p>More ouer he putteth downe the whole proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> turned in to latin by partes or Sections, (which is an other curiositie, that other bookes come out before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued not,) and after he awswereth the same by seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

            <p>The writer nameth himself <hi>Ihon Philopatris</hi> prieste, and divine, that hath studied at Rome, and descended in tymes paste of the English blood, but he that shall see, and reade the booke (which is some xviij. or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie leaues of printed paper or more) will easily see that he hath lined lately in Inglande, or is very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily instructed in the affayres thereof, and when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that <hi>Philopatris</hi> in greeke signifieth a louer, or a frinde of his country, I easily see that the name is but borowed, and may be taken vp in theire sense by any of our Inglish papistes, that live here abrode, and so make your accompte that it is.</p>
            <p>More I shal write vnto you from Italie, and namely from <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>Padua,</hi> for here I will stay onely vntill this booke come forth, that I may sende you a copie.

the abbreuiation, taking out euery thinge as neer as I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sense though not in wordes as in the booke it lieth, and that in more sweete, and temperate manner also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers tymes, then there it is sett downe, culling out onely the heades of the most principal matters, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vtterly the discourses, declarations, and proofes of the same, wich are in truth more pearcing, plausible, and popular then will easily be imagined but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the whole: and in one word beleeue yow Sir, that it is a very pestilent booke, and so I pray you aduertise his lordship, and commend my seruice with continuing me in his honors good grace and fauour, which I euer desire to deserue as I may, and so to the lord I commyt you from Augusta this first of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. 1592.</p>

                     <hi>THE thirde member of this Section is about these wordes, where it is saide in the proclamation,</hi> that the King of Spaine now in his declined yeares meetest for peace, when he ought to be satisfied with his owne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seekinge of more Kingdomes by violence, seing be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth at this day more crownes, Kingdomes, and countreyes, then euer any Christian Prince had before, that all this notwithstanding he hath begunne a most vniuste warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganist the present Kinge of France, most daungerous to all Christendome, which yet is like to be the ruine of himselfe, as his enterprise against Inglande gaue him iuste cause to repent &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For answere of all this, there are many points tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <note place="margin">Diuers fals hodes and folyes of M.

Treasurer farr passing him, and nerer to his graue by all likelyhood. Thirdly that so greate amplification of the Kinges forces, wealth, and power, (being their enemy) was inconsiderate, and can serue to no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, but to terrifie their owne frends and subiects, and to animate their contraries, and to shew their lack of prouidence in making so vnequalla match fowerthly, that this great power of the King of Spaine being so iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stely and temperately vsed, at it is, can not be fearefull to any good man, but rather confortable nor is it daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Christendome, but rather a great and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler stay, &amp; prouidence of almightie God, who forseing the tumultes and reuoltes that heresies should bring in these tymes, hathe prouided this so potent and opulent

a Prince of all ages, for the defence of his Catholique church in these troobles. Fystly that this warre of the Kinge against Nauarre, is not iniuste, but moste iuste, &amp; necessary, not for any intereste of the Kings, but onely for the good of France it self, and consequently that all reasons, and circumstances considered, and the forces on both partes wayed, it can not be like to be the ruine of the King of Spaine, but rather of Nauarre, and other heretiques depending of him, or ioyning with him; and albeit the Kings last fleete against Ingland, had not the successe which was expected, yet it was not for wante of strength, or by any valure, or praise of the Inglishe, but rather by te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peste, lacke of experience in some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall officers, and other such casualties, that often fall out in warre, whereof the Inglishe oughte not to bragg, seing there are so many reasons, and examples of enterprices that take successe the second or thirde tyme, which did not at the firste, whereof this awnswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer alleageth many testimonies, and authorities, both prophane, and diuine, which in the booke are to be seene,</p>
                  <p>After this he entreth to treate at large of Nauarres <note place="margin">Nauarres iust exclusion from the crovvn of France.</note> iniuste pretence to the crowne of France, being an open knowen heretique, as he saith, and refusing to take the othe of mayntayning the Catholique Romaine religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which all Kings both of Fraunce and Ingland haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before this, and are bounde to take from the firste institution of Christian Kinges, and that her Maiestie tooke also the same othe at her entrance to her crowne of Ingland, and that by Cecils councell also, by whose councell the same othe was afterwarde violated; &amp; that the tytle of particuler succession in Kingdoms being founded onely vpon positiue lawes of seuerall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, (and not vpon law of nature or nations, for that Kingdomes and monarchies neither were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor are at this day in all realmes a like) it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22504:16"/>
muste needes folow, that the whole righte of these successions and interests to the same, do depend of the particuler ordinances, lawes, othes, and conditions, with which each countrey hath ordayned admitted, &amp; authorized their Kings, vvhereof the cheefe condition beinge in the Kingdome of France, hat the Kinge shall sweare, and geue assurance to defende and mayntaine the olde Catholique Romaine religion, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors thereof, and Nauarre refusing to do the same, he can by no law diuine or humaine be admitted to the crowne, which is largely proued by many autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, examples, and reasons.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this he declareth how al Catholique people in France are bounde vnder payne of damnable synne, to resiste Nauarrs entrance into that crowne, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the inestimable da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage that is like to ensew therof vnto that whole realme, yf he shoulde preuaile; And for the same consideration he proueth, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique partie of French nobilitie that either for hope of honour and commodity, or for hatred, and emulation against others that are againste Nauarre, or for any other passion, or pretence whatsoeuer do folow or fauour him in this his prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, doe offend God highely, and are guiltie of al euills &amp; miseries of their countrey, and that besydes the eternall punishement, which they are to expecte at Gods handes (excepte they repente) they will also be destroied, and pulled downe by Gods iuste iudgements in this world, as this awnswerer sheweth by as many of the nobilitie both of France, Flanders, Ingland and Scotland by name, as for any pretence whatsoener, haue bin the firste ayders of heretiques in their countreyes, haue perished and come to naught.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE third Section conteyneth an other large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnte no lesse vniuste then the former, as though the King of Spaine not onely by himself, but by other mens helpes also wente aboute to annoy Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and this by three manner of wayes.</p>
               </argument>
               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firste is, for that he is saide heere.</hi> for fortifyinge of his strange violent attempts to haue procured a Milanois a Vassall of his owne to be exalled to the Papacie of Rome, and to haue seduced him without consente of the colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls to exhauste the Treasures of the church, &amp; there with to leauie forces in Italie (which had no sounde of ware in is before) to inuade France a Kingdome that hath bin alwayes a mayntainer of that church, in all their oppressions &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>These are the wordes of the edicte, which the awns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werer doth play vpon diuersly, asking where my L. Treasurers wit was, when se set foorth these fancies; for first he saith that it is no noueltie for a vassall of the Kinge of Spaines, to be made Pope, seing the greatest partes of Italy, and the Ilandes adiacent (out of which nation in our times the Popes commonly are wonte to be chosen) are vnder him, &amp; the onely state of Millaine in our dayes hath had three Popes: which were <hi>Pius quartus, Pius quintus,</hi> and this Gregorie the fourteenth, whereof this proclamation speaketh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he sheweth, that it is rather a signe of great pietie and humility in the King, then to be attributed to ambition, yf he shoulde desire a subiecte of his owne to be made Pope, and thereby to be made his superiour and better, for that, as this awnswerer auoucheth, the pryde of hereticall Princes can not beare such a matter, &amp; in particuler he thincketh my L. Treasurer for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sake, would not choose Cardinall Allen of all others to be Pope, thoughe he be an Inglishman.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he saith that it is a ridiculous complaynt that the Kinge seduced this Pope to exhauste the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:22504:17"/>
of the churche without the consent of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinalls, as though the Pope were a childe, or that Ingland had such care to conserue the Churches treasure, whereof it seemeth that my L. Burley would also be treasurer, aswell as of that of her Naiestie yf he might.</p>
                  <p>Fowerthly it is much more childishe saith he that the Pope by leuying souldiours in Italy for France, did trouble the peace of Italie, as my L. Cecill insnuateth, &amp; moste of all, it is foolishe, saith he, that the Church of Rome by sending ayde to the Catholiques of France doeth invade that Kingdome which hath bin a mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayner of that churche in al her afflictions; for neyther is this ayde of the Popes to inuade France, but to assiste France, nor is it sente against the French, but for the French: neyther is Nauarre of those Frenth Princes that ayded the church of Rome, but contrarie to them, and to theire faith &amp; affection towards that churche, neither doeth there thing with thinge, nor tyme with tyme, nor person with person, as he saith, agree, whereof he maketh pastyme at large against my L. Treasurer, and and his broken Rhetorique, as He tearmeth it.</p>

                  <head>The second point of this section.</head>
                  <p>THE seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de poynte touched in this sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is about the accusations layde against Cardinall Allen, and father Persons (whome the writer of the edicte cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth heads of sedition and of base birth) saying that they haue bin dealte withall hy <hi>the King of Spaine to gather together with greate labours vpon his charges a multitude of dissolute younge men, who either for lathe of liuing or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes committed leaue theire countrey, &amp; become fugitiues, rebells, and traytors, and are broughte vp in certaine demies and receptacles, named Seminaries erected in Rome, Rheims, &amp; Spaine.</hi>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:22504:18"/>For awnswere of this, is examined first, why these two men aboue others should be so odious to the state of Ingland, seing they neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted any thing against them that mighte iustely be imputed to hatred or euill will, but rather haue soughte by all meanes their good both temporall, and eternall yf they would see it.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Scribe, as this awnswerer tearmeth <note place="margin">My L. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>er of his ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try.</note> him, thrusteth in a pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thesis, as hath bin said, that these two men are very base in birth, the awnswerer handleth that poynte somewhat at large, especially touching the Cardinall, for that he lyuing in so eminent a place of dignitie, such a slaunder (as he saith) is not to be passed ouer by silence, albeit the other beinge a Religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and hidden from the worlde, make lesse accompte of such affaires.</p>
                  <p>And by this occasion he commeth to defend the Cardinals gentry, and to compare it with the nobilitie of all the present clergie of Ingland, and with diuers of the Councell his enemyes, &amp; namely with my L. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer the bringer in of this comparison, of whome he saith, that a letter of his, writen with his owne hande, at westminster, vpon the 10. of January last 1592. to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer of his in the low countries, came vnto his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, euen at this very tyme when he was come to awnswer this point of gentry and nobilitie, touched in the proclamation: and for that he saith the matter of the saide letter, fell out fitt for this place, he resolued to awnswer the same heere, reducing the effecte hereof to two principall heads.</p>
                  <p>For my L. Treasurer in that letter first geueth thancks to the saide Intelligencer for sending him a copy of a printed pamphlet set forth presently in avvnsvver of this proclamation, in which avvnsvver both the fact of setting foorth this proclamation, and bloudy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se determined to be folovved by the same, is vvith many reasons thoughe briefely, yet very pithely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22504:18"/>
and some persons that haue bin causers thereof, but namely my L. Treasurer by reason of this his byte to the Cardinalls birth is insinuated to be but of very meane parentage, wherevnto his L. replieth in these wordes firste <hi>that this course is a necessary course, seing the multitude of priests (saith he) that come in dayly appeareth now to be so great as they are seuen for one in a yeare in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte of former tymes, and that this course will not he lefte for any such audacious censure of this awnswerer, &amp; that he douhteth not but that the scope thereof is iustifiable in all Kingdomes, and common wealthes where it shalbe knowen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which wordes of his L. this awnswerer saith firste that the necessitie of this course hath proceeded of the inconsideration and euill councell of such as haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, more for their owne passion and interests then for the common good, &amp; haue broughte her Maiestie by little &amp; litle to this bloudy necessitie, which can not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. And secondly yf it be trew that seuen priests for one do returne home now in respecte of former tymes, then saith he may his L. see, what he and others haue profited by their former persecutions against Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, and accordinge to that may make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte and proportion for the tyme to come, for yf they had not so vexed men at home, neuer so many vvould haue come abrode, nor yf there had not bin so great hope of martyrdome vvithin the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, neuer vvould so many haue desired to returne, nor vvoulde forayne Princes so greedily haue sett vp Seminaries, and offered mayntenance abrode for the same.</p>
                  <p>To the third poynt wherin his L. saith, that <hi>this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this awnswerers and</hi> this laying of their errors <note place="margin">VVicked men are vvarned vvithout o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> before their eyes vvil not stay this course begunne of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this man saith he is also of the same opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that he tooke not this awnswere in hande, with any such hope of stayinge this course, vntill God shall bend
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22504:19"/>
or burste the same of himself, and that for all this, men may not cease to speake the truth for that Christe did not omit to tell the Scribes and Pharisees, of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and wickednes, thoughe he knew that they were obdurate therin, &amp; would not cease to shedd his bloud for the same, so also he surceased not to forewarne ludas of his perdition albeit he knew it would little auayle him; and generally when he sent both prophets, and other good men to reprehend both by worde, and writings the wicked Kings, and Queenes of lurie, and other countreys, and common wealths as Moab, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumea Egypte, and the like, that persecuted his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, he sent them not with any hope (for the moste parte) that they would leaue, or amend their course thereby, but rather be worse, &amp; in the sending of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Aaron to Pharao it is wonderfull to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that on the one side God woulde haue him warned of his ruyne, &amp; on the other syde he saide in plaine wordes, that he would obdurate, or harden his harte, so as he should not heare the good councell geuen him, but rather waxe more fierce thereby, and run on headling to his owne destruction, for that there are some kinde of people, as the Prophete saith, which haue made a league, and contractewith death, so as nothinge will make them to auoyde the same, which this later awnswerer sheweth principally to be fulfilled in wicked and ambitious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, who laying commonly all conscience aside, &amp; being tyed to the prosecution of their euill actions once begunne with the forcible chaynes of honor, credite, riches, authoritie, envy, malice, &amp; ambition, haue no other way ordinarily of retreate, but when Gods hand entreth, and breaketh downe all; and then al falleth together like old muddy walles with losse of al that was moste deare vnto them in this life, and of that also that shoulde haue bin for the life to come.</p>
                  <p>And finally to the laste clause, he awnswereth that all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22504:19"/>
forayne Kingdomes and states are so farre of from allowing or iustifying the scope of this desperate Inglish course, that the very protestante Princes and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors that otherwise are no enemyes to Ingland, do cry out of the same. The reste that are aduersaries do laugh in their sleeues to see Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ruine it self on the rocks, &amp; the sandes, as is dothe by this course, which muste needes be er lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their totall destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; only the poore Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques (which rather I should call happy saith he) are those that abide the brunte for the presente, who are sent to heauen more hastely, then otherwise they would perchance haue walked of themselues, and others are inforced to merite more by sufferinge, then they had purposed, which is al the hurte they receaue; for as for their seede it shall remaine for euer <hi>&amp; peccator videbit,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the second parte of my L. Letter, he defendeth somewhat the gentry of three persons touched before in the firste Inglishe awnswere, to vvit my L. of Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Sir Nicolas Bacon, and his owne; and for the firste he saith that Leicesters great gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather (whome many men reporte to haue bin a carpenter) was no lesse then a lord Dudleys sonne, wherewith this awnswerer saith he vvil not greatly trouble himself at this present, thoughe this new genealogie seeme stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; not credible to many Inglishe mens eares of moste knowledge &amp; experience that liue abwade, and neuer heard of the same before.</p>
                  <p>For the second his L. saith no more, but that albeit Bacons father were no man of liuing, yet was he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so wealthy as he lefte to two of his sonnes stocks of mony to be honeste marchants, and to the third (which vvas afterward L. keeper) mayntenance for his study in Grayes Inne: al vvhich supposed to be trew (saith this awnswerer) it is nothing against that vvhich before hath bin spoken of him.</p>
                  <p>To the third, vvhich is himself, my L. Treasurer saith
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:22504:20"/>
much more for his gentrie, affirming that his howse, to wit the Cecills of Stamford, doe come of the <hi>auncient howse of the Sit siltes of wales, and are descended from the reigne of the conquerour, &amp; haue matched, &amp; come of many noble howses both of Ingland and wales, yea of the Princes of wales</hi> (for these are my L. owne wordes in his fore said letter) <hi>aud that his L. grandfather Dauid Cecil came out of Brytany as a sergeuit at armes first, with King Henry the seuenth, and was by the saide King placed at Samford, and was Steward of his mothers howse the Countesse of Richmond, and after was squyer for the body, both to King Henry the 7. and also to King Henry the eight:</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is my L. Treasures ovvne allegation for this gentry, and nobility.</p>
                  <p>To all vvhich, this awnswerer replieth, that so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent a displaying of genealogies by his owne hand vvriting at this instant, when he handleth the match of his grandchild with Arbella, implieth a further sequel, them euery man doth looke into, especially vvhere he addeth <hi>that his howse is descended of the very old Princes of wales themselues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly he taketh vpon him to shew that al this flourish, or at leaste wise the more part thereof, is but an ambitious fiction of M. Cecill himself, and very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to all Inglish of the discreeter sort; for that he saith, that many yet reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber when M. Cecil for diuers yeares after his comming to creditt, went about to deriue his name of Cecil, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cecilius the Romaine name, whereof theire vvere diuers, but especially that famous rich man named Caecilius Claudius vvho as Plinius writeth, <note place="margin">Plin. 1. 23. cap. 10.</note> after greate losses receaued in the ciuil warres, lefte notwithstanding in his testament, aboue foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand slaues, and aboue three thousand yoke of oxen, and aboue two hundred and fifty thowsand of other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell besydes infinite quantitie of ready mony, vnto whome this awnswerer upposeth that our M. Cecil
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22504:20"/>
at that tyme, desired to be like as well in vvealth as in name, and for that he imagined that the progenye of those Cecils had remayned in Ingland, euen from the Romaines tyme, and that his howse vvas descended of the same: He write himself (as he doeth now also in this his letter) Cecil, with two c. c. and after the first of them an E, which is far different in antographie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sitsilt vvhich himself writeth with tvvo s. s. twoo T. T. and tvvo I. I.</p>
                  <p>By occasion also of this, this defender telleth a story, <note place="margin">A story.</note> how that in Q. Maryes tyme when M. Cecil had decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Sir VVilliam Peter, and had made him beleeue he was an earnest papiste, and had persuaded him to offer the resignation of his office of Secretariship vnto him, as before hath bin touched; the old countesse of huntingto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mother to the earle that now liueth (though far differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from him in Religion) told the Queene and maydes of honor in the courte, that she had hard an old prophecie that one who had two c. c. in his name should be the destruction of Ingland, which thinge saide she I know not vvhome it shoulde meane, excepte it were M. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who being out of credit at this present, and neuer like to come in againe, I hope shall neuer be able to bring that to passe. This doe reporte such as haue hard it of the Countesse owne mouth, and perhaps her sonne may yet remember it though he vvil not dare to speake it; neither remembred M. Cecil at that tyme to vvrite himself Sitsilt to euacuate that prophecie, as he mighte haue done, had he knowen himself then to haue descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of that howse which now he pretendeth.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer this awnswerer asketh, how yf it be trevv <note place="margin">Manisest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes.</note> that Dauid Cecil my lordes grandfather descended of the nobles, &amp; Princes of wales, &amp; was so greatly in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt with K. Henry the 7. as to be squyer for the body as well to him as to his sonne K. Henry the eighte, hovv <note place="margin">He is said to hauebene first</note> then is it lykely that he would keepe an Inne in Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ford
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22504:21"/>
as diuers vvorshipfull yet aliue or lately dead haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <note place="margin">an ostler in that Inne and after to haue marie the hostesse.</note> to haue layen in the same; also how it is possible that his sonne the Treasures father, named also Dauid Cecil (if I forget not) should be onely groome of the vvardrobe, &amp; so plaine, and meane a man, as thousandes yet can testifie that he was? &amp; how finally VVilliam Cecil their child now Treasurer could be so poore, and meanely brought vp, as to get parte of his maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by ringing the morning bel at his beginning in S. Ihons colledge in Cambridge as commonly yet in that vniuersitie is reported.</p>
                  <p>And lastly this awnswerer taketh this for an euidente argumente of M. Cecills cogging and coseninge in this behalf, that for diuers yeares he tooke himself farr diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent armes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these, vvhich of late he hath taken vp of the Sitsiltes, for his former armes (yf I be not deceaued) vvere twoo Lyons eating of a wheaten sheafe betwene <note place="margin">In stede of tvvo Forses at a botle of bay.</note> them, as it is to be seene in diuers of his howses vvhere they are yet engrauen, &amp; aftervvard seing the Armes of the Sitsiltes (an auncient howse greatly decayed, yf not extinguished) to be six Lyons, he hath taken them also to himself, as it is here reported, to terrifie the vvorld perhaps vvithal, and to liken himself thereby to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that commonly haue Lyons in their armes, where as a good fatt capon, or a rosted pigg seemeth a fitter cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaunce for an Inneholders grandchild as this man affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, seing that those things are more commonly to be founde in Innes, and Osteries then are Lyons; and thus much in effecte he avvnsvvereth to the contents of my L. Treasurers letter touching his gentry, which this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender taketh either vvholy to be feigned, or moste vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely to be delated by the old mans ambition.</p>
                  <p>After this he commeth to avvnsvvere those wordes of the proclamation vvherin is is saide, <hi>that my Lord Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, and father Parsons do gather together with greate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours a multitude of dissolute yonge men, who haue partly for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:22504:21"/>
 lack, of liuing and partly for crimes committed, become fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, rebelles, and traitours; for whome there are in Rome, and Spaine and other places, certaine receptacles made to liue in, there to be instructed in schoole points of sedition &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All vvhich vvordes this avvnsvverer examineth, and <note place="margin">Ezech. 9. Prouerb. 29.</note> firste vvhat difference there is in holy vvryt betvvene <hi>dispersers</hi> and <hi>gatherers,</hi> and vvhat curse there is laide vpon the one &amp; blessing vpon the other by Gods ovvne mouth, and that seing M. Cecill, and other persecutours at the instigation of the devil do so attend to disperse their countreymen; good reason some others should serue God in gatheringe, and nourishing the dispersed for his cause.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he sheweth that these two men haue no need to vse greate labours in gathering together these youthes, as the proclamation feigneth, for that God himself gathereth them aboundantely from al partes of the Realme, and the euidente truth of the Catholique faith stireth them to seeke meanes abreode for the salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of their soules, seing they can not be permitted to haue them at home: and whereas many were letted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from comming out of Ingland, for that they knew not where to goe to be receaued, mayntayned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, now being informed thereof by this indiscrete proclamation of M. Cecils penning, which admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis heth all men that besydes the former colledges, and Seminaries in France and Rome, there are other also newly erected in Spaine, many haue resolued to come ouer, which otherwise had stayed in Ingland, &amp; so them selues at theire comming haue professed: and the King of Spayne among other Princes hauing seene so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an edicte, and considered the conscienceles causes of their distresses hath greatly enlarged his fauours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the saide Inglishe Seminaries in his dominions both by his personall visiting of that in validolid, and larger allowance tovvardes the mayntenance of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:22504:22"/>
same, and thus doeth M. Cecil profit by his new diuises.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he sheweth that these students come not out of Ingland neither for lacke of liuing, nor for crimes committed, as the proclamation moste vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly doth slaunder them. Not for the firste, for that they being commonly gentlemen, or vvealthie peoples children, and as good witts as any lefte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynd them, they might casely haue preserrmente, yf they vvould apply themselues to the protestant proceedings, and here he sheweth at large the great multitude of gentlemens sonnes, vvhich leauing their inheritances, and other hopes of vvorldly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities at home, do come ouer dayly to study, and be made priests vvith infinite desire to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine quickly to Ingland, vvhere priesthoode is more hated, infamed, and pursued, then any cryme or vvickednes in the vvorld: and that no such desire vvas seene in gentry and nobilitie to priesthood in Catholique tyme, vvhen is vvas honorable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to be a prieste, vvhich muste needes procede of Gods owne hande: and that there are more gentlemen this day in the Inglishe Seminaries of France, Rome, &amp; Spaine, then in all the Clergy of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland tvvise told, to vvhich no gentleman common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will affoord his sonne to be a Minister, and much lesse his daughter to be a Ministers vvyf; vvith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers examples of the basenes of their chiefe Prelates, as among others of Pierse, &amp; Cooper; Archbisshop, &amp; Bisshop, of yorke and winchester, both borne at Oxford, as this felow saith, the one the sonne of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, and the other of a cobler, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers like vnto them, vvhich yet M. Cecil toucheth not with basenes, nor that they went to their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie for neede.</p>

wilful destroyers of their natiue countrey, and mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous traytours; and for more hypocrisie, and deceptfull shew of some good meaning in this poynte, all men are exhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by M.

               <p>But besydes this he addeth somewhat also about the <note place="margin">The vayne vaunting of Ghospell.</note> worde <hi>Ghospel,</hi> which M. Cecil in his proclamations so often iterateth, and yet (saith this awnswerer) no man can easely gesse what he meaneth thereby, considering his owne Religion in Queene Mary and King Edwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des dayes, and his earnest being against the puritans vnder this Qneene vntill of late; and now his being for them, and yet his complying with her Maiestie on the other side, so that by his ghospel he can not seeme to meane any other thing but his owne fancie, and designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the tyme present to serue his turne.</p>
               <p>And by this occasion this awnswerer declareth, how the old fathers and doctours did not vse this name of <hi>Ghospell</hi> commonly, but only for the sacred writings of the fower Euangelists; to whome the priuilege of this highe word was peculiarly attributed, for that nothing in the said writing could be false or erroneous, &amp; that the Religions of Christians founded thereon (especially against heretiques) was vsually called the <hi>Catholique faith, and doctrine,</hi> vntill these our dayes, when euery man that deuised new opinions or wayes, would needes cal it the very ghospell it self; so began <hi>Luther,</hi> and after him folowed <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from him, and after them both, <hi>Ihon Caluine;</hi> and

about the same tyme the <hi>Anabaptistes, Trinitaries,</hi> and new <hi>Arrians</hi> in <hi>Transiluania,</hi> and synce that in Ingland both <hi>protestants, puritanes,</hi> and <hi>family</hi> of <hi>loue;</hi> of vvhich no one will admit worse name to his sect, then the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name of the <hi>holy Ghospel it self;</hi> vvhich being but one, and a simple truth, and these men different and repugnant to them selues can not possibly be posiessed by them all, though all pretend it; and therefore, saith this awnswerer, as in a cittie, where one onely pretious stone is knowen to be, yf a man should fynd the streets ful of diuers cryers that sweare and protest euery one of them to haue this iewell to himself alone, it vvere able to make a wise man, thincke rather that none of them had it, then that all could haue it; euen so (saith he) in this case of pretending the Ghospell.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he sheweth that of all these sects which at this day professe the name of <hi>Gospell</hi> abroad in the world, no one eyther within or without the realme, will confesse that the Religion generally held in Ingland at this day, is the pure Ghospell, exept perhaps some at home that dare not say the contrary, or esteeme little of any Religion, for abroade he sheweth first out of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himself, how he condemned to hell the heresy of Zwinglius &amp; Caluin now held in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus, Illiricus, and all other Lutherans haue followed synce, as appeareth by their brokes yet in printe, &amp; the decrees are extant of the Earles of Mansfild in the yeare 1559. and of the Lutheran cities of VVittenberg, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg and others the yeare 1560. and of al the reste of Saxonie the yeare 1562. which condemned the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Caluin now held in Ingland for damnable heresie. The like did the Zwinglians as appeareth by the doings, and writings of Andreas, Zebedaeus, and loannes Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Zwinglian Ministers against Caluin himself, being yet aliue, when they accused him to the Magistrates of Berna in Zuicerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for an Archiheretique: &amp; by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22504:32"/>

Is commaunded that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius institutions, &amp; such other bookes of his as in the assertions impugned by these Ministers were found, should be burned and prohibited as hereticall for euer.</p>
               <p>At home also the determination of King Henry the eighte, and his parlament for his six Articles against this Religion, &amp; the difference of the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> booke in King Edwardes tyme from this that now is; &amp; the exclamation of Caluin and Beza against the supremacie of a woman, or lay Prince (whereof dependeth the hart of Inglishe Religion) &amp; lastly the multitude of erors, heresies, &amp; abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s gathered out of late by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans (now defended by M.

               <p>This therefore passed ouer, he commeth to handle the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d remedy appoynted in the proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is of the forces, and preparations of her Maiestie hy sea and land to withstand this imaginarie inuasion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto M. cecil exhortethal good subiectes to geue assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Cecil hath no skill, nor wil to entermeddle himself, but only to set men on, whiles he, and his do looke vpon them; In the second of <hi>their purses,</hi> seing he is Treasurer, it serueth for his purpose to pull them on as many waies as he can deuise, and perhaps it was the greatest motiue of all this tragedie, to fill his coffers by this deuise: but for the third which is <hi>to assiste with their

Cecils arrogancie, &amp; exceeding foolish, and furious wrath in breaking so openly and arrogantly with all the old Allies of the crowne of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, in prouoking so many and so potent Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to reuenge their iniuries, in attempting so great and dangerous changes, and innouations, and exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s at home, as muste needs at lengh bring al the whole howse about his owne eares, and other mens to, and can not possibly endure; by all which, and many other things that he alleageth, this defendant wil needes haue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>beleue, that my L. Treasurer is vnaduised &amp; not only wanteth conscience, and Religion, but also wisedome, &amp; circumspection in the greatest of his doings, and that in very truth laying Godes cause aside (whereof his care is least) he is also for ciuil gouernement a very insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and lastly, he commeth to the forme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition <note place="margin">The forme of Inquisition</note> appointed in the proclamation for the finding out of the Seminarie priests, and punishement as vvel of them as of all such as shall receaue, harbour, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte them, about vvhich poynt after this awnswerer hath shewed that this forme of search &amp; punishement is more rigorous, &amp; cruell (considering all circumstances)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:22504:33"/>
then euer vvas any search in former tymes of any old persecutours or tyrants, he sheweth himself to wonder more at the impudencie, and follie of M. Cecil in setting downe this saide forme of Inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then at any thinge touched in this awnswere before.</p>
               <p>And for his impudency he alleageth these vvordes of the proclamation, vvherein it is auouched that this forme of examination, &amp; vexing of men for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, <hi>is in no wise contrarie, but agreable to the moste auncient lawes, and good vsages of our Realme,</hi> which this man refuteth, beginning from the firste Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King of the Britans named Lucius, that tooke his faith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, vnto the laste called Cadwalladar, that made himself a monke, and died in Rome; &amp; after that, from Ethelbert the firste Inglishe Kinge Christined by S. Augustine a monke, sent from Rome, vntill the laste Kinge Edward the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessor, held for a sainte in the same Religion: &amp; after him from VVilliam Conquerour first King of the Normans, vnto King Henrie the eighte father of her Maiestie; all which Kinges, and Queenes this awnswerer sheweth to haue bin contrarie in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to this of M. Cecils, &amp; consequently to haue made all their lawes, and ordinances in fauour of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion, &amp; against that which is now held in Ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and so their formes, of search, and Inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must needes be against this, &amp; not against that; and therefore that it is extreame impudency in M. Cecil to auouch so openly in proclamation, that this tyrannicall forme of his inuention against the Catholiques, is in no vvise contrary, but agreable to the most auncient lawes of Inglande.</p>
               <p>Secondly for M. Cecils folly, and lack both of wit, &amp; <note place="margin">M. Cecils folly.</note> consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pressing a free people with such irking, &amp; bloudy lawes, which driue to desperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he alleageth the authoritie of all graue men that euer wrote of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemente of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealthes, who affirme that such
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:22504:34"/>
proceeding is lacke of wisedome, for that violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses endure not long, and feare is no good conseruer of perpetuity, and ouermuch rubbing bringeth out bloud, and patience abused turneth into furie. He noteth also a want of ludgement in Maister Cecil the scribe to put downe in her Maiesties name, after recital of so great rigour, <hi>that she is resolutely determined to suffer no fauour to be vsed for any respect of any persons qualities, or degrees,</hi> which may chance to stirr vp some Matathias, and his children, and frends one day to do as he hid in his zeale for Gods cause, being inforced therevnto by the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet oppression of Antiochus the tyrant, to his owne destruction; and seing that it is euident that these hard, and rigorous woordes, could not proceed of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties owne inclination; but were thruste in by Cecil in despite, and disgrace of nohility, &amp; principall peeres, of whome he was afeard leaste the Queene mighte haue some respecte in these cases of Religion, this awnswerer exhorteth him to looke vnto it, and to thincke betymes <note place="margin">Councel and exbortation.</note> vpon the end of pierse os Gauerston, &amp; the Spencers, &amp; others that haue abused their Princes fauours in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d heretofore, to the debasing of true nobilitie, and pilling of the people; he willeth him also to thincke of the endes of wicked leroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Achab with the death of seuentie children of his in owne day; notwithstanding they were as well established and allied for matters of the world, as M. Cecils of spring can be. Finally he beseecheth also her Maiestie to looke about her betyme, &amp; not to suffer her self to be caried away, or to be made a pray to one mans ambition only, who will not be able to remedy the calamities, that now he soweth, but will leaue them all on his Princes backe, when he can wade no further, as the pittifull examples of King Ihon, King Edward the second, Richard the second, Henry the sixt, and others driuen into miseries by such euill Councellours do wel declare, nor is it safe for any Prince to leane to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22504:34"/>
much to one mans councell, especially one that seeketh so euidently his owne intereste as in M. Cecil doth: mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate courses do indure, but this is desperate, neither want there meanes to reduce things yet to some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, or moderation at least, yf her Maiestie would folow her owne Princely disposition, and leaue the bloudy humour of this old ambitions serpent. Her Maiesties age requireth more loue and peace of her subiects now, and to attend rather to securitie, then to enter into new odious conflicts; the fly hath her splene, saith the Philosopher and much more men of courage and free education, and so much bloud spent by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as lately hath bin in Ingland can not but threaten much bloud againe in the end. All this &amp; much more to purpose saith this awnswerer, and in the end concludeth all with certayne effectuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>solatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto Catholiques out of Eusebius, Gregorie Nazianzene, and Victor Vticensis, who recompte the exceeding comforts, which God gaue vnto Catholiques that had suffred for him after their persecutours were destroyed &amp; confounded.</p>
               <p>He writeth also certayne annotations vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions annexed to the proclamation for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners how to execute their forme of inquisitions and all he maketh very odious and cruell, which I can not set downe here for lacke of tyme, but I hope to send yow the booke it self very shortly.</p>
