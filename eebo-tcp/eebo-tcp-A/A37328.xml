         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Friday being the fifth of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
November, the Lord Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
with divers other Engliſh
Gentlemen, gave a viſit to Her
Majeſty the Queen of Bohemia at the
Hague, where they ſate in Councel (from
9 in the morning, till 7 in the evening.) to
conſult and adviſe how they might (even in
this preſent Juncture of Time) propagate
the Work in hand, for the moſt eaſie and
facile advancing of the Intreſt of their Lord
and Maſter Charles; whoſe preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they much commiſerate; And indeed,
it doth not a little concern them, ſince that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58578:3"/>
they are all ballanc'd equally in the Skales
of your Engliſh Judicatory. In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, they reſolved once more to
put the Chance of the Day to its Hazard,
and agreed upon a Declaration to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in the Name of their Maſter, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
all the loyal-hearted Engliſh through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the United Provinces, to an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Him: And in purſuance thereof,
her Majeſty hath ſent a Meſſage to her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
Charles, importuning his Reſidence
at the Hague, &amp;c. But I can give you no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the event thereof, by reaſon He
hath not as yet returned an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>The chief obſtruction which cauſeth the
delay is ſaid to ariſe from Sweden; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that Queen Chriſtiana hath given him
to underſtand by a Meſſage, That ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to put the general peace into the

            <p>Further aſſuring him, that ſhe is obliged

the publike peace of her People, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

Charge, againſt all Confederacies, Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and particular Intereſts, that may
prove dangerous and deſtructive to her
Weal-publique.</p>
            <p>Upon reading of this Meſſage, the King
ſeemed to be much aſtoniſh'd, and in the
preſence of the Marqueſs of Ormond, the
Lord Wilmot, and divers other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſtruck his hand upon his breaſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

and in him I wil repoſe my ſole Truſt
and Confidence; therefore I will not fear
what man can do againſt me.</p>
            <p>He continues ſtill at the Palace-Royall

promote and carry on the Deſign, and M.
General Maſſey is as buſie as a little Lord

the fire of Revenge, which lyes glowing in
the Embers throughout the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>We hear that the Engliſh are ſtill at
Portelongone, where the Dutch have got
leave to come in, upon pretence, ſay they, to
bury ſome eminent perſons among them
killed in the late fight; having permiſſion to
bury their dead, they have interred 8 of
their Commanders, among which the Vice
Admiral is ſaid to be one, with 3 Captains;

want of Trade will ſoon make a hole in the bottom
