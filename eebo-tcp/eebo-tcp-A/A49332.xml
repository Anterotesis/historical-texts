            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Further
ESSAY
ON
Gold and Silver Coins.</head>
            <p>MEeting with a Book, Entituled, <hi>An
Essay for the Amendment of Silver Coins,</hi>
which being written by the particular
Directions of the Lords of the Treasury, made
me more Curious to dive into the Affair.</p>
            <p>And upon a strict Survey I found that
Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> like a very Ingenious Gentleman,
hath taken a great deal of Pains by informing
us, what Records and Indentures he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted,
and what assistance he has had from
the Masters of the Mint, to demonstrate the
Standard of the Gold and Silver used in several
or most of the preceding Reigns: And he hath
also shew'd, how much we have been impos'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37161:3"/>
upon by the cunning Artificers of the Times;
as <hi>Goldsmiths, Merchants,</hi> &amp;c. And furthermore,
whence the word <hi>Sterling</hi> took its Derivation,
<hi>viz.</hi> from a Star or Asterism, impress'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or from the <hi>Iews</hi> Star, or from <hi>Sterling</hi>-Castle
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gerrard de Malynes,</hi> who was an eminent
Merchant in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, tells you,
That the Standard of the <hi>Sterling</hi>-Moneys of
<hi>England,</hi> had its first Birth from a Place so call'd,
being Coined there by <hi>Osbright,</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> King,
which is about Eight Hundred Years ago, at
which time an Ounce of that Silver was divided
into twenty Pieces, and so esteem'd as Twenty-Pence,
and in that manner continu'd until
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's Time.</p>
            <p>For what reason the Standard came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be alter'd, I referr you to his Book
written upon this Subject, Entituled, <hi>The Canker
of</hi> England<hi>'s Commonwealth,</hi> being one of the
best things extant in its kind.</p>
            <p>I must confess, that I am so far of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> That the Standard
ought to be alter'd, for to keep up a certain
equality of Trade and Traffick between us and
other Countries, not suffering an over-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
of Foreign Commodities with our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37161:3"/>
Home Commodities, or in buying more than
we can vend: For thereby our Treasure will
be exhausted, which is the Life of Trade and
Sinews of War: To this known Disease there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the Body Politick, some Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
should necessarily be devised and applied,
then <hi>sublatâ Causâ,</hi> the Cause being remov'd, the
ill Effect and Consequences thereof will
cease.</p>
            <p>It is to be consider'd, That the transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our ready Money or Bullion, maketh
our Home Commodities sell cheap, and the
Foreign Commodities dear, wherein chiefly
consisteth the over-balancing; so that in effect
we give both Money and Commodities to
have Foreign Commodities in exchange for
them.</p>
            <p>Some Gentlemen who has made it their
business for some Years last past, to melt down
all the mill'd and broad Moneys, will tell you,
That altering the Standard will lessen the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of our Trade abroad, as tho' all the
Foreign Trade depended upon the exchange of
Money. To which Objection I answer'd,
That that Trade which solely depends upon
the exchange of <hi>English</hi> Moneys had better be
broken off and omitted than supported; as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37161:4"/>
in the Trade which was maintained for
several Years betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where,
by Computation, it was made appear, That
the <hi>French</hi> King receiv'd in <hi>Specie</hi> of <hi>English</hi>
Money, at least a Million <hi>per Annum;</hi> and by
melting it down into his own National Coin
made at least Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> more advantage of
it; so that it never made any return back to
us. By which indirect Practices abroad and
the sinister Dealings at home by our own crafty
Operators; it is this that has benum'd our
Trade and thrown it into a Lethargick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</p>
            <p>I humbly conceive, that since such indirect
Means hath been used both at Home and
Abroad to exhaust our Treasures, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of supplying the Exigencies of the War
all along has obliged us to transmit our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
into other Countries, that if speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is not taken to supply these present Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
the Government will become Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plective.</p>
            <p>But as we are now under an undeniable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
for to call in the Publick Plate of the
Kingdom, so to supply the present Exigency
of Affairs, it will be consistent with the Honour
and Interest of this Kingdom to examine and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37161:4"/>
compare our Weight with that of other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and the Fineness of our Standard with that
of other Countries; and if we differ not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the Gold and Silver, then may
our exchange run at one Price both for Gold
and Silver, taking the Denomination according
to the Valuation of the Moneys of each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and hereby shall we find how much fine
Gold or Silver our Pound <hi>Sterling</hi> containeth,
and what quantities of other Moneys of the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> &amp;c. have to counter value the same
in the like Weight and Fineness to ours, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be by the Pound, Ducket, or Dollar,
giving always Value for Value, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
called <hi>Par.</hi> This course of Exchange
being abused, and of late Years become a
Trade in rising and falling in Price, according
to Plenty or Scarcity of Moneys, in regard of
distance of Places it hath become predominant,
and doth over-rule the course of Commodities,
and thereby becomes the efficient cause of the
over-balancing of Commodities before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
and consequently the decrease of our
Wealth, and the exportation of our Moneys,
as by demonstrative Reason have already been
shew'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37161:5"/>As Mr. <hi>Lowndes</hi> has well observ'd, that it
would be absolutely necessary to limit the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of Bullion to a certain Summ, which
shall be sufficient to support our Army; yet it
would have been much better, had he propos'd
and mov'd for a free Port in <hi>Flanders, Spain,</hi>
and other Confederate Countries, where we
might have Bullion in lieu of our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>And whereas Money will still be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Trade, as it is valued by the Publick
Authority, being reduced to a certainty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it doth not only give a set Price unto all
other Metals, but receiveth (as it were by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percussion)
a Price in it self has made. So
that as that studious Gentleman (who has made
his Remarks upon Mr. <hi>Lowndes</hi>'s Book) saith,
that advancing five Shillings to six will in no
wise advance Trade, by reason you cannot buy
therewith more Goods than you could formerly.
I will agree with the Gentleman, if we are to
buy Foreign Goods, there may be some tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Plea for it, because they look upon our
Money, in reference to the Value in Weight,
and not in Denomination: But it is otherwise at
Home, from common Experience; for I have
not yet found, but that if I had any Moneys
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37161:5"/>
that was indifferently good, upon paying down
I could buy as cheap as formerly.</p>
            <p>The second Assertion, that lowering the
Standard doth sink the Value of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Estates in the Country; for tho' they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
100<hi>l. per annum</hi> in the new Coin, they
have in effect but 70<hi>l.</hi> so they lose 30<hi>l. per
Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Truth of this Assertion, I do appeal
to the Country Gentlemen themselves, whether
in the Year last past they met with those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
as to pay away 100<hi>l.</hi> at the
Rate of 70. And when there is a prospect of
receiving better Moneys, there can be no such
loss. I think the Gentleman need not be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answered, than by his own Argument, in
saying, that the Price of Moneys is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Trade.</p>
            <p>If so, then I hope when the Price is reduced
to a certainty by Publick Authority, it ought
to be a Rule for all People to be govern'd
by; as for example, If the Government should
enact that Pieces of Leather should have the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37161:6"/>
Publick Stamp or Impression, for to go for a
Penny, tho' those Pieces are not worth one
Farthing, according to the intrinsic Value, yet
they may answer the end for which they were
made, in going for a Penny, to supply the
present Exigencies of Affairs; and as necessity
is the Mother of Invention, it ought to put
us on embracing such Expedients as may be
useful to our present Emergencies; as Instance
in the Case of the late King <hi>Iames,</hi> who called
in all the Plate, and the best Moneys in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
by which means he debarr'd all his <hi>Protestant</hi>
Subjects from holding any Trade or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in any other Coin than Brass Moneys,
and that was advanced to an exorbitant Rate;
yet they were well supported by, and as long
as it continued at a Price certain, it became
Current in Payment. But upon this Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Government, we were under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Calling in those Copper-Moneys, so
it prov'd very detrimental to such who had
great quantities of it by them. And in the
same manner it would be with us, if the late
Project should take of that Gentleman who has
propos'd to advance the Standard for two Years
and no longer; for nothing more preserves the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37161:6"/>
reputation of Moneys than keeping it to a
Certainty, so that the Standard may not be
subject to so many Changes: And as to the
Valuation or Alteration of Moneys concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
only the Soveraignty or Dignity of a
Prince or Governour in every Country, as a
thing peculiar to the Prerogative.</p>
            <p>An unknown Author has also made his
further Remarks, That it is a disreputation
for our Nation to bring in its Plate, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it argues our Ability, and for that we
are more esteem'd Abroad by the Wealth we
have in Plate.</p>
            <p>Is it not more disreputable for to be
said on us, that we have proportionable
Riches to discharge the Burthen of our War,
and at the same time be Indebted to both
our Fleet and Army.</p>
            <p>And what necessity is there for every Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house-Keeper
to have 100 or 200<hi>l.</hi> of Plate,
and the Government to want it, unless it be
to incourage Rogues and Vagabonds; for
scarce a Sessions happens, but some one or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37161:7"/>
other is Arraigned for stealing a Tankard,
or the like.</p>
            <p>I must confess, that I had the Honour to
Propose to the Honourable Houses of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
this Project that is now set on foot
of Calling in the Plate and Broad Money,
and of altering the Standard, but meeting
with such Opponents as the nameless Author
(who I presume is not willing to assist the
Government upon this Term) did help to
break the neck of so good a Design; for if
it had passed into an Act at that time of
the Day, according to my then Proposals,
it had brought into the Mint at least two
Millions of Moneys. And the Coinage upon
the same Proposal, besides appropriating so
much ready Money for the use of the War,
would doubtless have been Four Hundred
Thousand Pounds advantage to the Crown:
For, according to a strict Computation, there
is a Million and one half of Plate in the
Publick-Houses; besides, the advancing the
Price of Standard will incourage private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to bring in their Plate. And it had
prevented the Exorbitant Price of Gold,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37161:7"/>
and put a stop to the Baseness of our
Coin.</p>
            <p>And as I propos'd it before for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Publick, without any Self-Interest,
so if my poor Thoughts should in some
Measure contribute to relieve us from the
present Calamities, I have attained my
End.</p>
            <p>I must needs agree with Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi>
That the Gold ought to bear equal Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Advance of Silver; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Computation, a Guinea
should be established at Four and Twenty
Shillings, which, if Coined into Quarter-Guinea's,
would be very useful in way of
Trade.</p>
            <p>As relating to the Clipp'd Money, I am
sorry I cannot assent to Mr. <hi>Lowndes</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal;
for I think it very unreasonable that
any Person should be compell'd to bring in
their Money into the Mint at Eight Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<hi>per</hi> Ounce, when Sixteen Shillings
Currant now will scarce make an Ounce;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37161:8"/>
so that the People shall lose one full
half.</p>
            <p>Besides, It is to be considered what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
would happen daily betwixt the
Officers of the Mint and the People, both
about the Weight and Validity of the Moneys.
I am afraid it will prove of the same bad
Event to a great many Poor People, as in
the Case of the late New-Farthings, where
the Patentees were obliged to change Two
Hundred Pounds a Week of the old White-Farthings
in lieu of them; which Contract they
faithfully perform'd for about a Month, but
soon after that time no Farthings must be
exchang'd but by their own Creatures, and
Factors, who they had impowered to buy
up for a third part of what they used to
go at.</p>
            <p>I do not find Mr. <hi>Lowndes</hi> does propose
any farther advantage to those that have
unhappily gotten the Counterfeit-Money into
their Hands, than the Intrinsick Value, which
will be Six-pence in Half a Crown; so that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Computation that may be made,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37161:8"/>
by the loss of the Clipp'd-Money and <hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham</hi>-Coin,
will amount to no less than
a Million and one half; wherefore Eight
Hundred Thousand proposed cannot repair
the defect. And who must bear this Loss
but the poor People, for the Rich have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
all the best Moneys; and by the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
made, they reap an advantage by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into the Mint, whilst the Meaner sort
will lose.</p>
            <p>With submission to better Judgments, I do
think it but reasonable that the Government
ought to bear the Loss, and that all the
Base Moneys (excepting Copper) should be
brought in by a prefixt Time, and a Fund
settled to answer the Defect: And then Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will have encouragement to bring in their
Moneys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I wish that whilst the New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
are Coining, that some Expedient may
be found out to supply the Necessities of the
Poor; tho' in some measure the Quarter-Guinea's
would be very useful in Town, tho'
not so in the Countries, by reason Moneys
are more scarce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37161:9"/>There are several Pieces of small Money
that are laid up, as Groats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if
made Currant by the King's Proclamation,
would be very useful under these Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</p>
            <p>And further, if this Project in altering
the Coin should be approv'd and granted.
I wish that Commissioners may be chosen
in every County for to take an Estimate of
what Moneys there are; and that instead
of delivering Notes for Peoples Money,
that Tallies may be struck gradually as the
Money is brought in, which, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
will be much better than Notes:
In that Tallies are not subject to be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited.</p>
            <p>But for the better regulating of the Gold
and Silver, as aforesaid, I do propose the
following Expedients.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37161:9"/>I. <hi>Expedient.</hi> That all mill'd and broad
Moneys may be so far advanced as to induce
People to bring it forth, and to prevent the
Transportation of the same, which will be
a proper Means to supply us with present
Cost.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Expedient.</hi> That Gold may bear the
same proportion in advance with Silver, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>Lowndes</hi>'s Notion, a Guinea
will come to Twenty Four Shillings; so that
Coining them down into Quarter-Guinea's,
to consist of Six Shillings Valuation each,
will make them equally useful in Trade with
the New Shillings.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Expedient.</hi> That His Majesty would
graciously be pleased to Issue out His Royal
Proclamation, That all silver Groats, Two-Pences,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> might become Current, by which
means they will be brought to Light, and
be very useful in Change, whereas they
are at present like so much dead weight.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:37161:10"/>IV. <hi>Expedient.</hi> That all Shillings and Six-Pences
may be current still, until the New
Coin shall be Issued out, which, with the
Moneys aforementioned, I humbly conceive
may be sufficient to supply the common
Trade in the Interim.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That some Expedient may be found
out to supply us with Moneys for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of our Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> from <hi>Holland,
Spain,</hi> &amp;c. by which means we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Transportation of Bullion, which
is so dear and scarce a Commodity.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Exped.</hi> That all <hi>Birmingham</hi> Moneys
may be brought into the Mint by a prescrib'd
Time, and a Fund settled to answer the
defect of it; for, at the same time, as the
Banks and Goldsmiths will get by the broad
Money, it would be unreasonable that the
Poor should lose by their base, and according
to Computation, Eight Hundred Thousand
Pounds will not repair the Defect; but it will
be as absolutely necessary that such Care be
taken that Foreigners may be prevented from
Importing to us base Moneys; for it is to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37161:10"/>
be feared they have had too great a stroke
in this Affair already.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>Expedient.</hi> I think it very reasonable,
That the Publick Plate should be called in,
to answer the defect of our base Moneys,
and supply us with the New Coin; for the
Government ought not to want Moneys as
long as we have it amongst us.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Exped.</hi> That People may have Tallies
struck for the Moneys instead of Notes, in
regard Tallies are not to be counterfeited.</p>
            <p>All which <hi>Expedients</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> I have
Offer'd, nevertheless I submit to the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
of more competent Judges.</p>
