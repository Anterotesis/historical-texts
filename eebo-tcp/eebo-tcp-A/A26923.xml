            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WARS are most dreaded and hated by the Country where they are; but not so much by the Souldiers, who by them seek their Prey and Glory, as by the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inhabitants that lose thereby their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and Peace, who yet are forced, or drawn to be siders, lest they suffer for Neutrality.</p>
            <p>Religious (irreligious) Wars are of no less dismal Consequence, being about God himself, his Will, and Word, and that which more nearly toucheth our Souls and everlasting state, than our Houses and worldly Welfare does: And yet because Men are more sensible of their corporal than their spiritual Concerns, these Dogmatical Wars are far less feared, and too commonly made the Study, and Delight, not only of the Military Clergy, but also of the seduced and sequacious Laity: Though those that have the Wisdom from above, which is
<pb facs="tcp:59334:3"/>
pure and peaceable, condole the Church's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity hereby; knowing that Envy and Strife, the earthly sensual and devilish Wisdom, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Confusion, and every evil Work: And it is a heinous Aggravation, that the Militants, being Men consecrated to Love and Peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely father their Mischiefs upon God, and do all as for Religion and Church.</p>
            <p>Having these four and forty Years at least, been deeply sensible of this Sin, Danger, and Misery of Christians, I have preach'd much, and written more against it: To confute those Extreams which cause Divisions, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile those that think they differ where they do not; sometime also using importunate Petitions and Pleas for Peace, to those that have power to give it, or promote it, and that use either Word or Sword against it. And with the Sons of Peace it hath not been in vain: But with those that are engaged in Faction and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous strife, I am proclaimed to be the militant Enemy of Concord, for perswading them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and writing many Books for Peace and Love, is taken for writing them against these. Controversies I have written of, but only to end them, and not to make them: And who can reconcile them that never mentioneth them? or arbitrate in a Cause unheard and not opened?</p>

               </gap>icious terms. He that will now be taken for a Peace-maker, must be content to be so called by a few, even by the Sect that he chuseth to please, and be contrarily judged of by all the rest. And this satisfieth some, because their Faction seemeth better than others, be they never so few; and others, because their Faction is great, or rich, or uppermost, how noxious and unpeaceable soever: For <hi>vespae habent favos,</hi> saith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, &amp; Marcionitae Ecclesias:</hi> We could wish the Bees seldom used their stings, for it is their Death; but those of Wasps and Hornets, that make no Honey, are less sufferable.</p>
            <p>It is partly for unprejudiced Students that I write, and partly for the times to come, when the Fruits of malignant Faction and Wars, have disgraced them, and made the world a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59334:4"/>I am blamed by Dissenters, as coming too near by Conciliatory Explications, to some things which they call dangerous Points of Popery, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianism and Prelacy; but whether it be by <hi>Truth</hi> or by <hi>Error,</hi> I leave to trial: Sure our <hi>English</hi> Universities and Canonists are not like to receive any hurt by it, who will not read a Book that they see my Name to, though the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine would never so much gratifie them. And others (at home and Foreigners) are satisfied by Knowledge and Prepossession against such seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Danger.</p>
            <p>The great blemish of this, and other of my Writings is, That I say oft the same thing which I have said before. Much of this Book is in my Catholick Theology, and my Meth. Theol. and my Treatise of Iustifying Righteousness. But, 1. Forgetfulness in Old Men that have written so much, is no wonder. 2. But it sheweth that I have not forgotten the Matter, nor take it up suddenly and superficially, which I so oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat. 3. And there may be great use for such Repetitions, when it is for clearer Method, or for epitomizing larger Writings, which many cannot, or will not read; but those that can, may have the benefit of more Explicatory Copiousness. If it profit the Reader, I am not sollicitous for the Reputation of the Writer.</p>
            <p>You will find here one Chapter answering Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions about <hi>Futurity;</hi> concerning which you
<pb facs="tcp:59334:4"/>
must know, that my <hi>Catholick Theology</hi> was so bold and large an attempt to reconcile the <hi>Calvinist,</hi> and <hi>Lutheran</hi> or <hi>Arminian,</hi> and the <hi>Dominican</hi> and <hi>Jesuit,</hi> &amp;c. that I lookt to have been sharply assaulted for it by many: But after many Years expectation I have heard of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing written or spoken against it, save one <hi>MS.</hi> Paper of Objections about the <hi>Cause of Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>Physical Predetermination to sin,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Polhill</hi> a Councellor, a Man of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Knowledge, and Godliness, (now enjoying the Fruit of it with Christ; O Blessed <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if its Rulers, Senators and Lawyers, yea, or Bishops and Teachers, were all such men) having many Years past sent him my Answer, (and having no Reply) as to the question, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to answer the second, having said so much to it in my <hi>Methodus Theol.</hi> and lest the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject should make my Reply seem sharp to so good a man: And I thought it meet to publish this, because it is an unusual Dispute; and as no one else hath called me to it, so I know not where the Reader that differeth from me, will find so much for him; nor whither to refer him for an Answer. I publish not Mr. <hi>Polhill</hi>'s Paper, because I recite so much of it as may tell the Reader what it was; and I must not swell the Book too much.</p>
            <p>The Glorious Light will soon end all our Controversies, and reconcile those that by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
<pb facs="tcp:59334:5"/>
Faith and Love are united in the Prince of Peace, our Head, by love dwelling in God, and God in them: But falsehearted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, carnal Worldlings that live in the fire of wrath and strife, will find (so dying) the woful maturity of their Enmity to holy U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Love, and Peace; and the causeless shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true Servants of Christ out of their Churches, which should be the Porch of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is the way to be shut out themselves of the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If those that have long reproached me as unfit to be in their Church (and said, <hi>ex uno disce omnes,</hi> with their Leader) find any unsound or unprofitable Doctrine here, I shall take it for a great favour to be confuted, even for the good of others excluded with me, when I am dead.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. 1.</hi> How we may and must conceive of GOD.</head>
            <p>§. 1. A True Knowledge of God is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Being of Religion, and to Holiness and Glory. No man can love, obey, trust, or hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his knowledge: Nothing is so certainly known as God, and yet nothing so defectively known: Like our Knowledge of the Sun, of which no man doubteth, Whether it be a glorious igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Substance, endowed with the Power of Motion, Light and Heats: And yet what is less comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? And no man hath an adequate knowledge of it, or of the least part of it.</p>
            <p>§. 2. There are three things that must concurr to our Conceivings of God: 1. Our <hi>General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</hi> 2. Our Metaphorical Conceptions by way of Similitude. 3. Our Negative Conceptions; what <hi>God is not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:59334:9"/>§. 3. I have opened this as distinctly as I am able in my <hi>Methodus Theologiae, Cap.</hi> 4. in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble called <hi>Ontologia,</hi> the beginning to which I must referr the Reader that would be accurate and clear. I. We must conceive of God as a <hi>Substance,</hi> lest we think him to be nothing: And as a spiritual transcendent Substance, not univocally the same with created Substance, nor such as Man can reach to any sensible, or immediate or formal Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of: But by the Similitude of created Substance our Conceptions may get some help.</p>
            <p>This we call the Fundamental Conception; but it is but a Conception partial and inadequate; yet necessary, fetcht from the Similitude of the Creature, whose <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> is the first constitutive Conception.</p>
            <p>§. 4. II. We must conceive of God as the prime Essential LIFE: And though God be not compounded of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> yet from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Creatures, we must as inadequate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, think of his being LIFE, as the form of his Substance, not divisible or compounding, but as a distinguishing Conception. And <hi>formadat esse &amp; noment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. III. Though in God's Essence there be no <hi>Parts, Degrees</hi> or <hi>Accidents,</hi> yet to answer the Similitude of <hi>Parts,</hi> Degrees or Accidents in Man, we must put in general <hi>Transcendent Perfection:</hi> And this includeth abundance of his Perfective At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; as that He is <hi>One,</hi> infinite, eternal, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, independent, uncompounded, unchangeable, and all the rest that are contained in Absolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:59334:9"/>§. 6. IV. When we say, That God is the prime essential LIFE, we mean a Life of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency above all that is created: But yet such as must be known by <hi>Creature-similitude:</hi> And therefore from the Similitude of Man, we must think of the <hi>Formal Divine LIFE</hi> by a threefold Conception, 1. As <hi>Vital Power</hi> in <hi>Act,</hi> 2. As Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> called <hi>Omnipotency</hi> in Act, <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> or Love. Whether these be the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, is after to be opened: But as FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, the Scripture teacheth us to conceive of God; As Three in One God, and One God and Substance in these Three.</p>
            <p>§. 7. V. God is to be conceived of in relation to the Creation in general, as OF HIM, and THROUGH HIM, and TO HIM are all things: As He is the Divine Efficient, the more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive, and the final Cause of all.</p>
            <p>§. 8. VI. He is especially to be conceived of in his Relations to the Reasonable Creatures, as their absolute <hi>Owner, supreme Ruler</hi> and chief <hi>Benefactor</hi> and amiable attractive Good and End.</p>
            <p>§. 9. VII. He is especially to be conceived of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s related to Man; As our Creator and Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the God of Nature. 2. As our Redeemer by Christ and the God of Grace. 3. And as our Perfecter by his Spirit, and the God of Glory: And as related to his Kingdom of Nature, Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p>§. 10. VIII. He being without Passivity a pure Act, must be conceived of, as, 1. In <hi>virtute seu po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia Activa.</hi> 2. In his Acts objectively immanent, 1. <hi>Self-living,</hi> 2. <hi>Self-knowing,</hi> 3. <hi>Self-loving.</hi> 3. In
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:59334:10"/>
his transient Acts or Works, considered both <hi>ex parte agentis,</hi> and as the Effects.</p>
            <p>§. 11. IX. He is negatively to be known, by the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nial of all that noteth Imperfection.</p>
            <p>§. 12. X. When I say, that God is to be known by Similitudes, I mean, that though nothing be fully like to God, yet somewhat in which he may be partly known, appeareth on the whole frame of Nature; but especially on the Soul of Man, which is his Image. Therefore he that would know how to conceive of God, must first know himself, and what his own Soul is: The true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of your Souls must be the prime Helps to conceive of God by similitude.</p>
            <p>And here you first find <hi>Intellective, Volitive,</hi> and <hi>Executive Acts.</hi> 2. And by these you know that you have the <hi>Power</hi> so to act; for no one doth that which he cannot do. 3. And hereby you know that your Souls are Substance: For all Power is the Power of some Substance: Nothing can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 4. And by this you know that an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Spirit is a Substance so impowered: And that others are such as well as you: And knowing what a Spirit is, you know what God the Father is transcendently and eminently. And though all God's Works notifie him, you have thus the most intelligible Similitude within you.</p>
            <p>§. 13. Therefore I know not how you can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceive of God, than as MORE THAN A SOUL TO ALL THE WORLD, but especially to Saints.</p>
            <p>I say, <hi>More than a Soul:</hi> For a Soul is but a <hi>Part</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>

                  </gap>utive;</hi> but God can be no <hi>Part,</hi> and is more than <hi>Constitutive:</hi> The World is finite,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:59334:10"/>
but God is infinite, therefore he is more than <hi>a Soul of the World: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndus</hi> calleth the World <hi>Indefinite,</hi> but seemeth to mean <hi>Infinite,</hi> and so to make God but the Soul of the World: But that cannot be proved: Not but that there be created Souls under God: But while God is more than a Soul to all those Souls, he is more than a Soul to all the World.</p>
            <p>§. 14. It is lawful and useful to think of God, by such similitudes as he hath used of himself in his Word, how low soever. Even by his particular Works.</p>
            <p>Three Names he assumeth; Life, Light, and Love: He is the Living God; He is Light, and with Him is no Darkness: God is Love; saith the beloved Apostle. GOD is said to cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with LIGHT as with a Garment: And a man will say, I have seen the KING to day, who saw him but in his Garments: And if he saw the Skin of his Face, how little of the King did he see? In Scripture, they that have seen Angels are said to have seen God, and heard his Voice by them.</p>
            <p>When we see the Glory of the Sun, that diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth its Beams to all the surface of the Earth, and uniteth it self with every Eye, even of the smallest Worms, and quickeneth every thing that liveth; this giveth us by similitude some low re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of the <hi>Divine Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> When he is called <hi>Our FATHER,</hi> and he is said to love us as a <hi>FATHER</hi> his Children, this is some help to our Conceptions of him: When we read of all those Visions which <hi>Iohn</hi> had in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> of Christ's glorious Appearance (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the Mount) and of God on the Throne,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:59334:11"/>
with the four Beasts and seven Spirits, and the thousand thousands of glorious Attendants, and of the metaphorical Description of the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> It is not unlawful nor unuseful to us to make use of such Spectacles of Similitudes in our Thoughts of God, while we exclude all the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of such Similitudes.</p>
            <p>§. 15. But after all, till the Love of God be shed abroad on our Hearts by the Holy Ghost, and God as LOVE look on us with his attracting and exhilarating Aspect or Communication, all these notions will be dull and barren, and will leave the Soul under fears and despondency: It is Love by vital Influence warming the Affections, that must give us a sweet taste of what we know, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the fear of Death and Wrath, and give us comfortable Boldness and Courage in all the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that we must go through.</p>
            <p>And seeing Christ telleth <hi>Philip, If thou hast seen or known me, thou hast known the Father;</hi> we must by Faith see the Father in the Son incarnate, who came into our Nature, to be a Mediator of our Thoughts and Conceptions of God, and especially as he is LIFE and LIGHT and LOVE: and I think in his GLORY will in Heaven be the Mediator of our LIFE, INTUITION and FRUITION. Come Lord Jesus,</p>

WHen I wrote the foregoing Treatise, I found the generality of Christians (Protestants and Papists) agreed about the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but Heresie and Debauchery encreasing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Case seemeth partly altered; And the ambitious, rich and worldly sort being from their Childhood bred up in fleshly pleasure, and in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and contempt of serious Christianity, having really no true Religion, but a Name and Image of it, at last by their Tongues declare what is in their Hearts; and living in a Land where Atheists and Sadducees are in splendid Dwellings, whilst fear of sinning maketh Confiscations, Jails and Ruine the Lot of multitudes who are zealous Protestants, they take the advantage, decrying what they never had: But before they disown all true Religion, and declare themselves Sadducees or Brutes, they begin as Disputers, at the points where they think Difficulty will excuse them; and especially at the Trinity, and the Godhead of Christ, and <hi>Socinian</hi> Errors.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I have perhaps over-tediously and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixly handled the Doctrine of the sacred Trinity in my Latin <hi>Methodus Theologiae,</hi> opening the various Opinions about it, reciting the words of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, School-Doctors, and Protestants who han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it: And through the whole Book I have
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:59334:12"/>
shewed, That the Image of <hi>Trinity in Unity</hi> is imprinted by God, on the whole known frame of Nature and Government, or Morality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that Doctrine of the Trinity, which to the ignorant is a Stumbling-block, greatly helpeth to confirm my Belief of the truth of the Gospel and Christianity, while I find it so congruous, to the foresaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, and attested so much by all God's Works; especially on Man.</p>
            <p>§. 3. It is a truth unquestionable, that without some knowledge of God there can be no true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, no Love to God, no Trust, no Hope, no Obedience, no true Worship of him, Prayer or Praise.</p>
            <p>§. 4. And it is as certain that no man can have an adequate knowledge of God; that is adequate which comprehendeth the whole Object, knowing it perfectly, and leaving nothing of it unknown. And with such an adequate Knowledge we know nothing, not a pile of Grass, nor a Worm or a Hair: Much less God: With such a proper Knowledge <hi>nihil scitur</hi> is true, and yet <hi>aliquid rerum</hi> is known of all.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Yea, it is certain, that of God, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, we have here no partial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that reacheth so high as to be strictly FORMAL, but only such as are called analogical, aequivocal, metaphorical, or by similitude. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Substantia, Vita, Perfectio, Potentia, Actus, Intellectus, Voluntas, Love, Truth, Goodness, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c.</hi> are formally and univocally the same in God and in the Creature: <hi>Scotus</hi> excepteth only <hi>ENS.</hi> Which is true, as <hi>ENS</hi> is only a Logical term, signifying no more than <hi>EST</hi> or <hi>Quoddity,</hi> and not <hi>QUID est,</hi> or Quiddity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:59334:12"/>§. 6. Yet this Knowledge by similitude is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull or vain; but the greatest advancement of Man's Understanding: All that which is <hi>formally</hi> excellent in the Creature, is EMINENTLY and transcendently in God. Though he have not that which we call <hi>Knowledge, Will, Love, &amp;c.</hi> he hath that which is infinitely more excellent, which these in Man have some likeness to, whereby we know him.</p>
            <p>§. 7. Man's Knowledge beginneth at our selves and not at God: We do not first know God: But first we perceive our own Souls <hi>Acts,</hi> and thereby we know our <hi>Power,</hi> and our <hi>Substance,</hi> and thereby we know what all is that is such as we; and so what a <hi>Spirit</hi> is, and so what <hi>GOD</hi> is. As by seeing, hearing, feeling we perceive that we <hi>see, hear, feel, &amp;c.</hi> every Sense having essentially a <hi>self-perception:</hi> So by thinking, knowing, willing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>illing, loving, joying, we perceive that we do it essentially; yet though the <hi>famosius significatum</hi> be our own Act as to <hi>formality</hi> and <hi>priority,</hi> it is God's as to <hi>Eminency</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 8. It is certain, that as all God's Works bear some notifying Impress of his own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so Man is especially made in his Image; and therefore our Knowledge of God must there begin seeing we have no immediate and formal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him.</p>
            <p>§. 9. As God is the God of <hi>Nature, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> so he hath made on Man the Image of these three: 1. The natural Faculties of his Soul, are his natural Image on Man as Man: For which it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. that <hi>blood shall be punished with blood,</hi> because Man is made in the Image of God. 2. His moral gracious Image is Holiness, of Intellect, Will
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:59334:13"/>
and executive Power. 3. The Image of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, Glory and Greatness, is, 1. in all men the Dominion over the lower Creatures: 2. And in Governours a Power over Subjects or Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
            <p>§. 10. To begin where our Perception be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth, 1. It is certain, that the mental Nature in Man hath three <hi>distinct Faculties</hi> in one <hi>undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Substance;</hi> That is, 1. <hi>Vital Active Power, Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will:</hi> (The Vital Power being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, first as exciting <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and after as <hi>Executive</hi>). The same Essence or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is this vital Activity, Intellect and Will: But the Active Power is not the Intellect, nor the Intellect the Will, nor the <hi>Will</hi> the <hi>Intellect, &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>Melanchton</hi> told his Hearers,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Vit.</hi> Georg. Anhalt. &amp; Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaltrin <hi>in</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Adam.</note> (to the admiration of <hi>George</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>) That the Concrete and Abstract were here differently to be used, we may say, that the <hi>Intellect</hi> may be said to be <hi>willing,</hi> but not to be the <hi>Will,</hi> the Will to be <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual,</hi> but not to be the <hi>Intellect, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. I have fully proved in <hi>Methodo Theol. parte</hi> 1. in a peculiar Disputation, that these three Faculties are not Accidents of the Soul, but its es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential form in a triple, inadequate Conception, and fully confuted all that <hi>Zubarel</hi> saith to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who epitomizeth all the <hi>Thomists</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and vindicated <hi>Scotus,</hi> and added many Arguments of my own, and therefore must thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther referr the doubtful.</p>
            <p>§. 12. Not that Man's Soul is there by three forms; for all are but one <hi>form:</hi> But Man's nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Mind cannot conceive of them but by three
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:59334:13"/>
Conceptions; which yet are not <hi>Fictions,</hi> but as <hi>Scotus</hi> calis them, FORMALITATES, and as <hi>Campanella, Primalities</hi> or Essentialities; or as the Nominals extrinseck Denominations, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by connotation of the Objects and Effects: He that hath a Wit subtile enough to conceive of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his FORMALITIES, as noting only a <hi>fundamentum objectivum distinguendi,</hi> will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a Soul made in God's Image, should be of difficult Conception.</p>
            <p>§. 13. II. The same Soul of Man hath three more <hi>general Faculties,</hi> that is, <hi>mental, sensitive,</hi> and <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative</hi> (or igneous): These are distinct, but not divided, yet are not three <hi>Souls,</hi> but one; though the inferiour Operations (at least) may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable according to Organs and Objects; and some uses of Senses and Vegetation cease.</p>
            <p>§. 14. III. The sensitive Soul in Brutes hatk the Faculties, 1 Vitally active, 2. Sensibly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, 3. Sensibly appetitive; one of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties is not the other, yet all are but one sensitive Soul.</p>
            <p>§. 15. IV. The igneous Nature in Plants cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vegetative, hath three Faculties, Motive, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive (differencing its proper Nutriment from other things) and Attractive (which is assimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) yet all are but one substance.</p>
            <p>§. 16. V. The Sun and all igneous substances, have their <hi>formal Powers,</hi> that is, <hi>Motive, Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native,</hi> and <hi>Calefactive:</hi> The motion (in power or act) is not formally the <hi>Light,</hi> nor is the Light the Heat, nor is the Heat the Light or Motion: Nor are these three Suns or Substances, but one Substance is in all three, whose form we necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive of by this triple inadequate Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:59334:14"/>
And thus it is in all the Creatures of Active Nature, which the Receptivity of the Passive also answer; and as I have proved elsewhere through all Morality also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melancthon, Loc. Com. per Maulium,</hi> p. 3, 4. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth many such instances in the Sun, in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in Musick, in Geometry, in Grammar, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick; to which Logick and Politicks might be added, All Effects have only <hi>three</hi> Causes, which in the general of Causality are one; that is, the <hi>Cause efficient, Constitutive,</hi> and <hi>Final.</hi> For <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Receptive-disposition</hi> (called Privation) and <hi>Form,</hi> are but the three parts of the <hi>Constitutive</hi> Cause.

            <p>§. 17. It is certain that the three grand Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, Principles, Primalities, Essentialities, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities (as men diversly call them) of which the three Faculties of the Soul are an Image, are in God, not univocally the same as in Man, but eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and transcendently. And his other Attributes (of Truth, Mercy, Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously exercised and related; that is, <hi>Vital-act, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> called as Perfect, Omnipotent <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Omniscience</hi> (or Wisdom) and <hi>Goodness</hi> or Love. And I have proved (<hi>ubi supra</hi>) that these are not Accidents in God, but his Essence, in a threefold <hi>formal Conception,</hi> truly distinguishable; some say <hi>Ratione rationata;</hi> some say <hi>formaliter,</hi> and some, <hi>ex connotatione &amp; relatione ad objecta,</hi> and perhaps all little differ in Sence.</p>
            <p>§. 18. All Theologue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agree, That <hi>GOD</hi> must be said to be <hi>essential Life, Self-knowledge</hi> and <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,</hi> to be <hi>essentially sui-vita, se-scire, &amp; se-amare;</hi> and that these are best exprest by <hi>Substantives ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly,</hi> and not only in the Concrete by Adjectives or

               </gap>inently in God.</p>
            <p>§. 20. It is undeniable, that GOD is CREATOR, REDEEMER and SANCTIFIER; the God of <hi>Nature, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory: Vitae, Medicinae, Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>s.</hi> And though <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are all these, yet usually in Scripture, <hi>Creation</hi> is said to be the Work of the <hi>Father</hi> (by the Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, and Redemption the Work of the Son (sent by the Father) and <hi>Perfection</hi> or <hi>Sanctification</hi> the Work of the Holy Ghost (as sent by the Father and the Son.) Therefore Baptism, which is our Christening, bindeth us in Covenant to God, as in these three Relations (which I hope may be easilier understood, than all the Schoolmens Disputes of the Trinity.) And no doubt, but our Baptism is a practical Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thus the Trinity of Principles in Unity, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable (as is aforesaid) 1. Radically <hi>in virtute Essentiae.</hi> 2. In the immanent acts of self-living, self-knowing and self-loving. 3. And <hi>exeunter</hi> transiently in <hi>Creation, Redemption</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> considered not as Effects, but <hi>ex parte agentis,</hi> as acting them.</p>
            <p>§. 21. The word PERSON, by the custom of the Church, having been so commonly used, is not to be disused while it is well expounded, lest we seem by changing the word to change the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But the Church had the same Faith before
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:59334:15"/>
that word was applied to the Trinity; and it was long before the use of it was agreed on; some being for <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> and some for <hi>Persona,</hi> and some excepting against both, but not knowing what word to substitute. And is it any Wonder that Humane Language wanteth proper words to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that of God, which is so far above our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension? So that it is not because they are wiser than he, that some except against the judicious Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> for being no more zealous for this <hi>Name,</hi> nor peremptory for any substitute, but because they understand not so well how unfit man is to make Names for God, which he hath not made himself, and taught us.</p>
            <p>§. 22. The bare use of the name [<hi>Person</hi>] by one that knoweth not what that word signifieth, doth prove no man Orthodox, but only that he useth Orthodox words; it will save no man to use a word which he understands not. And the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of that <hi>word</hi> (or the word <hi>Hypostafis,</hi> as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> did) will condemn no man who believeth the <hi>thing,</hi> whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h those that understandingly use the word, do believe: The Scripture hath all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry names of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>§. 23. Doubtless the word PERSON of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> is of very different signification from the same word applied to Man. And what consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth a PERSON in the Trinity, none have so curiously searched and disputed, as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; yet he that shall read but what I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of them (in <hi>Method. Theol.</hi>) will find it past the capacity of an ordinary Student to know what they mean, and impossible to reconcile them with each other. Certainly their sence of the word PERSON was never made necessary to the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:59334:15"/>§. 24. Many Protestant Doctors take up with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; whenas the usual sence both of that Word, and of <hi>Persona,</hi> is but a <hi>Relative Person,</hi> (not <hi>Aquinas</hi> and such others <hi>Relation,</hi> which is a <hi>substance,</hi> but) properly the same <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Natural,</hi> as <hi>related diversly:</hi> And if this were all, no man that owneth <hi>One God,</hi> would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion a Plurality of Persons; so one man may have the relative Person of a King, a Husband, a Father, a Captain, General, a Physician, an Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I hold not this Relative Personality is all that we are to acknowledge in the Trinity, yet I see no reason but in the second place it is included; that is, 1. The Relations which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vitality, Intellect and Will have to the substantiality, and to each other. 2. And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which they have <hi>ad extra</hi> to <hi>Effects.</hi> And whereas it may be objected, that so God hath thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Relations to thousands of his Works; I answer, But he hath three grand Relations, which comprehend all the rest, as he is the God of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Clory,</hi> Creator, Redeemer, and <hi>Perfecter:</hi> As he hath the three grand Attributes, which comprehend the rest. But undoubtedly this Trinity of essential Attributes which are said to be related to the substantiality, and to each other, is here in the prime <hi>Conceptus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 25. He that placeth <hi>Personality</hi> in the Trinity in SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, leaveth us to enquire of him: <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether it be by him presupposed or not, that there are the three foresaid Attributes called Essentialities or Formalities in one Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we commonly call <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Spirit? Q.</hi> 2. Whether <hi>Conscire</hi> being <hi>scire,</hi> is not the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:59334:16"/>
proper Act of an Intellect, and not of a <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>executive Power, as such? Q.</hi> 3. <hi>Self-perception</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a first and essential Act of every sensible Agent: But doth not that among men only prove <hi>sensible Life,</hi> which is in <hi>many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faculties,</hi> and is as numerous as the Acts, and not prove many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, seeing he must be first a <hi>Person</hi> who shall thus act? By seeing, I perceive that I see, and by hearing, that I hear, and by tasting, smelling, touching, that I taste, smell, and touch: I know these by Intellection, but I perceive them first by essential Sensation; and so by understanding, I immediately perceive that I understand and think: And by <hi>willing</hi> I immediately (not know, but) by a sort of eminent Sensation <hi>perceive</hi> that I <hi>will:</hi> And by vital Action I perceive that I act. Yet these are not distinct Persons, but the acts of one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Perception is essential to Vitality or Sense, but not constitutive of Personality.</p>

            <p>§. 27. But though I am past doubt, that in God is this Trinity of essential, formal, inadequate Conceptions or Primalities, and that the impress of them is on the Soul of Man, which is his image, and on the whole frame of Nature and Grace; yet far be it from me to say, That nothing else is meant by the <hi>Trinity of Persons;</hi> thus much we are sure of: There may be more to constitute that personality, than is to us comprehensible; and I doubt not but there is more, because thus much is so intelligible; seeing the Divine Nature is so infinitely far above the Comprehension of us poor Worms: But what we know not, we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, or notifie to others.</p>
            <p>§. 28.

            <p>Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Book of Transubstantiation (and Mr. <hi>Tho. Beverley</hi>'s) drew me to write some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions on this Doctrine, as moderating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Extreams; but on further consideration, I am very Ioth to be so venturous in a Case of such tremendous Mystery, as to meddle for or against them, left <hi>etiam vera dicere de Deo si incerta, sit periculosum.</hi> Though I doubt not but their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. is unsound, while they make the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, which is Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and eaten and drunk, to be the eternal Flesh and Blood of Christ, a Man from Eternity.</p>
            <p>§. 29. The difficulty of the Controversie which this leadeth to, Whether the World be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Effect of an eternal Cause, or God from all Eternity, till the forming of this lower World and <hi>Adam,</hi> had no Being but Himself? Doth deterr me from meddling with it, lest I be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by presuming too nearly to gaze on the Light that should guide me; and God, that is Love, should for my boldness be to me a Consuming Fire: Things revealed only as for our search.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:59334:19"/>§. 30. But the Conclusion which all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth for, is this; That whatever else besides the Trinity of Primalities before described, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Trinity of Persons, it is rendred alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether credible to an implicit Faith, by the full Evidence and Certainty of the aforesaid Trinity of Faculties or Primalities, which are God's Image on Man's Soul, and the like imprinted on the whole Creation; which certainly is not done in vain.</p>

Among all the Attempts that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished for our Conceptions of the Deity and Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I know of none that give us their Notions with greater Confidence and Pretence of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than <hi>I. P.</hi> M. D. [Dr. <hi>Pordage</hi>] and his Leader <hi>Iacob Behmen.</hi> Many other of the <hi>German</hi> Prophets, going near the same way; as <hi>C. Beckman</hi> describeth them. <hi>I. P.</hi> his <hi>Mystica Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> pretendeth to far greater discovery of the Deity and Trinity, and the World, than ever Christ, Prophets or Apostles gave us. <hi>First,</hi> In his <hi>Globe of Eternity,</hi> or the Divine Essential World pictured by, 1. An <hi>Eye</hi> (the <hi>Father</hi>), 2. A <hi>Heart</hi> (the <hi>Son</hi>); 3. And the <hi>Effluvia</hi> or <hi>breathed Beams</hi> (the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>) with the innumerable Progeny of such Eyes flowing from that pregnant Essence, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from it only as <hi>lesser</hi> from <hi>greater,</hi> each an Individual, yet making no Composition (but Unity) in the Deity.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>But, 1. I consess there are many things in him (and in <hi>Peter Sterry</hi>) which Reason left to its conjectures, would think plausible; but short of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And he is so high in his Description and Defence of <hi>Trine-Unity,</hi> that even where I consent not, I dare not call him therein unsound.</p>
            <p>3. But many Passages in his Description of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> are apparently the effects of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and erroneous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:59334:20"/>4. And he goeth further in his making this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eternal,</hi> and a World, that is the Body of <hi>God,</hi> than I dare do.</p>
            <p>5. And though I would not be too forward, to contemn men that pretend to know such Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by <hi>Vision</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> yet I resolve to take Christ for my sufficient and infallible Teacher; and to pretend to know no more of the Deity and unseen World, than he hath thought meet to reveal: For no man hath seen the Father at any time, but the only begotten Son; nor doth any else know him but he, and those to whom he revealeth him: And what Christ hath not revealed of God, I think it is because it is fittest for us to be yet ignorant of it, as a necessary difference between our present and our future state. To search for more will but confound and lose us, and resting practically in what Christ hath revealed, and for the rest, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves fully in his Knowing for us, his Love to us, and his Promise for us, may safely and sufficiently quiet the Mind that can be well quieted no other way.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. 3.</hi> Of the Incarnation and Hypostatical Union.</head>
            <p>§. 1. NO wonder that it seemeth hard to Man, to understand how the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture assumeth the Humane into Union, when it is so far beyond our reach to conceive how God is near to all his Works, and how he opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on every man. Christ hath told us, That
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:59334:20"/>
we know not how a man is born of the Spirit, no more than we know whence the Wind cometh and whither it goeth: And can we easilier know how God became Man?</p>
            <p>§. 2. It is certain, that God being infinite, is as near to us as is possible; our Souls can be no nearer to our Bodies, nor perhaps to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And though Philosophers dispute, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirits be <hi>in loco,</hi> and whether God be in us, or we in him, and whether he be <hi>quasi locus &amp; spatium</hi> to the World; yet it is past questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he is omnipresent, and intimately <hi>proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> to all things.</p>
            <p>§. 3. It is not therefore his meer <hi>Presence</hi> or <hi>Proximity</hi> of being that is this Hypostatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; else it would extend to all the World. It is harder therefore to prove, that God is not as nearly united to all, than to prove, that he is not so united to the Humane Nature of Christ. Which caused <hi>Peter Sterry</hi> and such others, to hold, That Christ hath three Natures; that is, That the Divine Nature first produced the prime, superangelical, emanant Nature, (by which he seemeth to mean an universal Soul to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and that this superangelical Nature did unite it self to all, but eminently to the humane Nature of Christ, which he calleth <hi>One top-Branch</hi> in the Tree of Beings. Some say the superangelical Nature being Christ's only Soul assuming but a Body; others, that it assumed a <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 4. The grand difficulty about God's Unity with the World, and the World with God, is how to solve the difficulty that hath stalled the School-Doctors; That if the Creature have no
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:59334:21"/>
Entity distinct from God's, it is either part of God, or nothing: But it is not nothing, or no Substance (though some call it a <hi>shadow.</hi>) And it is not a <hi>part</hi> of God; for to be <hi>pars,</hi> is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and so to be no God. And if it have a real <hi>Entity</hi> distinct from God's Entity, then there would be more Entity in <hi>God and the Creature,</hi> than <hi>GOD alone:</hi> For two is numerally more than one; and two <hi>Entia</hi> have more Entity than one, how small soever the lesser be. And then God should be put part of Universal Entity, which is Imperfection. To say that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath part of Created Entity, but not of Divine Entity, seemeth to yield, that God is but part of Universal Entity. To avoid which, many Philosophers take up the Opinion, that the whole being of all Worlds is GOD, the <hi>material Part</hi> being his Body, and the <hi>eternal Spirit</hi> the Soul.</p>
            <p>What shall we say to this? To silence it will not silence the Objectors. And sure we must not grant them, <hi>That the World is God;</hi> or that it is part of God; or that God is but a <hi>part</hi> of Real Substance or Entity; or that to be so is no Imperfection. Is there no other sounder way?</p>
            <p>Though Divines say, that <hi>Dei non sunt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae,</hi> and it's true, That <hi>God is all Essence</hi> and <hi>per essentiam operatur,</hi> yet I dread to assert, but humbly <hi>ask,</hi> Whether rather than fall into any of the former Opinions, it be not less dangerous to say, That as God hath made his Works in his likeness, and no Substance is without all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, so the World be not <hi>quasi accidens Dei.</hi> And if so, it is no <hi>Part</hi> of Him, <hi>essential</hi> or <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral:</hi> And as its Substance is not univocally such
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:59334:21"/>
as God's, so such as it is, it is so totally caused by and dependent on God's continual Creating<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and Emanation, that its <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> is more <hi>GOD's</hi> (though not <hi>GOD</hi>) than its own, and so is no Addition of Being to God's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but contained in him, and flowing from him: A man's actual thought, words or sensation is no Addition to a man's substance as such; and yet they are not nothing. A man's Hair and Nails that have no life, but vegetative, are substantial Accidents, and yet no part of the man: And yet are so wholly his own, caused by his Soul, as heat and moisture, that we use not to call them any addition to the man's being.</p>
            <p>§. 5. <hi>Q.</hi> But wherein then lieth the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical Union, if God be equally near to all things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> He doth not equally operate on all: As the God of Nature, he sustaineth and operateth on all his Creatures: As the God of Grace, he worketh <hi>Holiness</hi> on Believers Souls: As the God of Glory, he is present demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and gloriously to the Blessed: But he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on none as he did on the humane nature of Christ: These three differences I conceive make this proper sort of Union. 1. Some Works God doth, though by essential Proximity, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the use and operation of second Causes: But Christ's assuming the humane nature by the divine, was by Conception by the Holy Ghost, as the immediate Efficient, without the Causali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Man or Angel, the Mother affording Matter and Aliment to the <hi>foetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Divine Operations being various, the Divine Nature did that on the Humane Nature of Christ, which it did not on any other Creature: He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:59334:22"/>
such Work to do, as no other Creature was to do, the divine nature fitted the humane for its part. No Angel was to be Mediator between God and Man, and to work Miracles as he did, and in our nature to fulfill all Righteousness, and be a Sacrifice for Sin, and to rise from the Dead, and to send down the Spirit, and ascend to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and there to reign and to judge the World: Therefore he was qualified for all this work.</p>
            <p>3. And so there is also a relative difference, in that the Divine Nature, by a fixed Decree and Will, united it self for this work, to this one humane nature, even for all futurity. It may be some that are wiser can better tell wherein the Hypostatical Union consisteth.</p>
            <p>§. 6. As to the Question, Whether the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane nature be <hi>two</hi> or <hi>one,</hi> it is to ask, Whether the nature of God and his Creatures be two or one? They may be called <hi>one</hi> as we are <hi>one</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> as conjunct, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and consenting: But not one and the same essential <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. But the great difficulty is, whether the two natures constitute one Person, or two. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> is accused (<hi>Derodon</hi> saith falsly, citing his own plain words) to have held, That Christ was <hi>two Persons,</hi> divine and humane. But what is to be held, the School-Doctors make a difficult question; that is, whether the humane nature be either a <hi>Person,</hi> or any part of the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ. 1. They say, that Christ was a divine Person from Eternity, and therefore began not to be such at his Incarnation. 2. That the divine nature cannot be <hi>pars personae,</hi> for that would be to be imperfect and not divine: Therefore that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:59334:22"/>
nature is no part, but an adjunct to the Person of Christ. (And if the humane nature be an Accident to the divine in Christ, why must we deny Creatures to be Accidents of God?) But most plain Christians would be star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to hear a Preacher say, that the Humanity is no part of the Person of Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 8. I have no answer to the difficulty, unless I may distinguish of the sence of the word <hi>PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON,</hi> and say, that in the sence as it signifieth a Person in the Essence of God, the humane nature is no part<note place="margin">Such a noise do the Histories of <hi>Church-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> make about <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Eurychians, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites,</hi> &amp;c. that will not permit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s to pass by these points.</note> of it. But as to a <hi>Relative Personality,</hi> (as a King, a Priest, a Prophet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Husband, a Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Persons) so there is one <hi>Mediator</hi> between GOD and Man, the Man Christ Jesus: And the humane is not here excluded.</p>
            <p>But is the Divine a part of the Person of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator? I handle such things with fear; The Lord pardon our weakness: But we are called to handle them by men's Presumptions.</p>
            <p>1. As God is not a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Substance, and yet is <hi>eminenter</hi> more than a part, what if it be so answered here?</p>
            <p>2. But if, as great Doctors now maintain, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be ascribed to God, without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, because they have no proper reality, but a meer objective comparability, why may not the divine nature have a relative part in the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mediator, as assuming and advancing the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and operating in it, without composition? And as according to this ambiguity, Christ may
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:59334:23"/>
have two persons (not univocally) divine and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial, so the divine and humane may make one Mediator: And in the one Person of a Mediator are contained many Relative Persons of Christ, as King, Priest, Prophet, Son of <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord pardon what is amiss in these Conceptions, and rectifie my Judgment, and give me that practical Faith and Knowledge of Him, which constituteth Christianity, according to the Baptismal Covenant, and which is it that He calleth <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>

            <p>§. 2. It is certain, That God is intimately present in Essence with every Creature, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Effect, and so all his Effects are <hi>immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione proxim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and having as much Causality in producing what is done, as when he useth none.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Yet it is certain, That God useth second Causes, and therefore that all Effects are not so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 4. Therefore it seemeth plain, that Energy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 5. Therefore God may so far suspend some Operations on inferior Patients, as to confine them to the Capacity or Aptitude of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior created Causes, as he doth in the ordinary Course of Nature: He shineth not by the Moon so much as by the Sun; nor in a cloudy day so much as in a clear; nor in the night as in the day; and nourisheth us not by every sort of Food a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, nor cureth alike by all Medicines.</p>
            <p>§. 6. As God doth thus in Naturals, so may he do in Morals, or spiritual Changes: As he is the God of Kingdoms and People, he may use its Mercies and Judgments by Kings and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and according to their good or bad Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, as he did in the Death of Christ.

            </p>
            <p>§. 7. So God usually prospereth or afflicteth Churches and particular Souls, working his Grace
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:59334:24"/>
according to the qualifications of the Pastors and Teachers; and fitting them to be meet Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the intended Good, though he do not always so confine his Operations. This is evide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>§. 8. According to this Method, we may judge also of God's working according to varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Company-helps, Temptations, and Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, and how much of God's Work of Grace is thus sapientially and mediately exercised; though as to the internal manner of the Agency of his Spirit, we are told by Christ, That every one that is born of the Spirit, is as the Wind bloweth where it listeth, and we hear the sound, but know not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth. It is much herein to know a little.</p>
            <p>§. 9. It greatly darkeneth us in judging of God's Providences on Earth, as to the Welfare or Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Nations and Souls, Believers and Insidels, Peace and War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we know not how much God doth here by Spirits good and bad; and how far such Spirits are left to their Free-will, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was, in their Ministration and Executions here below. God gave <hi>Satan</hi> power over <hi>Iob,</hi> and power on the <hi>Sabeans</hi> that robbed him, and power on the Fire that fell from Heaven on his Estate. Christ said, <hi>This is their Day, and of the Power of Darkness.</hi> What Laws the superiour Worlds are under, as to us, and one another, is much unknown to us; yea, what power for our sins Satan may have against (not only the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <p>§. 10. But yet we may be sure, that all God's Promises shall be fulfilled, and that he will never give Satan power to break them, nor suspend his Operations so much on any second Causes, as to violate any word of safety, and hope that he hath given us to trust to; which Assurance may serve to keep us in Faith, and Hope; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

            <p>§. 1. I Have answered this at large in <hi>Method. Theol.</hi> It is a confused and ill-worded Question.</p>
            <p>Distinguish, 1. between <hi>Faith</hi> taken <hi>objectively,</hi> and Faith <hi>subjectively</hi> as an <hi>Act,</hi> or Quality.</p>
            <p>2. Between that which is required of all men to be believed, and that which is required but of some.</p>
            <p>3. Between <hi>Reason</hi> in <hi>Faculty,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in Act and Habit.</p>
            <p>4. Between <hi>Reason</hi> advanced by improvement, and <hi>Reason</hi> unimproved and buried in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>5. Between <hi>Reason</hi> that hath only the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of common Nature, and <hi>Reason</hi> that hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I. It being only objective Faith that is meant in the Question; that is no Object of Faith which for want of Revelation, a man is not bound to believe. There are Millions of Things above our Reason, which are no Objects of our Faith. And more may be the Object of one Man's Faith, than of anothers that had it no way revealed to him.</p>
            <p>§. 3. II. Almost all the matter of Faith is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> the Reason of ignorant Sots that never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Reason, or studied the Evidences of Truth: It is above their Reason, as <hi>dispositive</hi> and <hi>active,</hi> though not above the possibility of their Faculties being better cultivated and disposed hereafter.</p>
            <p>§. 4. III. The Doctrine of Faith is not only <hi>above,</hi> but <hi>centrary</hi> to the <hi>false reasoning</hi> of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant deceived Fools; for so is the very Being of God, and such are many that boast of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>§. 5. IV. The Gospel of Christ, and many points of Faith are above his Reason that hath only such natural Light as the Creation can give him, without any Gospel supernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Who can know in <hi>India</hi> that never heard of Christ, that he was incarnate, and rose from the dead, and ascended, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 6. V. Nothing that God commandeth us to believe, is either <hi>contrary to,</hi> or <hi>above</hi> Reason (that is the reasoning Intellect) informed by Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Revelation or Notice, and honestly and soundly qualified to judge otherwise, as Law, Physick, Astronomy, so Divinity is above the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the unqualified.</p>

And if the Essentials of Christianity and Church-relation and Communion were not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of by Christ, and notified in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then there could be then no Christian Church, for want of Church-Essentials.

For he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth any essential part, denyeth Christianity and the Church; and therefore is no Christian (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may be called by himself or others.) And though Confounders make a great Controversie of it, whether a Heretick be a Christian and a part of the Church, it's easily resolved; if we dally not with an ambiguous word: If by a Heretick be meant one that professeth not, or deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d any essential part of Christianity or the Church, he is no Christian nor part of that Church which he denyed: But if by a Heretick be meant one that professeth not, or denyeth only something that is of the <hi>melius esse</hi> of Christianity and the Church, he is a Member though a faulty one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 9. But it will be said, that</hi> more than the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Christianity is necessary to Church-Communion:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59334:29"/>
else we must receive Drunkards, Fornicators, Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Railers, with whom, <hi>saith St.</hi> Paul, we must net eat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I would those that will not endure tolerable men for a different opinion or circumstance, could as little endure Drunkards, Fornicators, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and Railers, and Covetous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Objectors must understand, That as I said, <hi>The Baptismal Covenanting Profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> is our Church-title to its <hi>Communion.</hi> And that <hi>Christianity is more than a bare Opinion or Notional Assent:</hi> it is a <hi>solemn giving up our selves by Vow and Covenant to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as our God and Saviour and Sanctifier, to be Taught and Ruled by Christ, as well as pardoned, adopted, and glorified; which essentially containeth Repentance and the Renunciation</hi> of the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> which are <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it must be remembred that a <hi>Verbal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> proved counterfeit and false by inconsistent contradiction in word or deed, is indeed not valid, and is no <hi>Profession.</hi> And he that would say, I will be Ruled by Christ, but I will be a Drunkard, a Fornicator, an Extortioner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would thus nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie his Profession by a gross Contradiction: And to <hi>live impenitently in these sins,</hi> is as <hi>sure</hi> a <hi>proof</hi> of falshood of a man's <hi>Profession,</hi> as contrary words would be. And if a man once and again commit such Sins till he Repent of them, he chooseth them and liveth in them: And while he chooseth and liveth in them, he Repenteth not indeed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he say: For Repentance is a change of Mind and Life.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59334:29"/>Therefore we here distinguish of Mens Right to Church-Communion as 1. unquestioned, 2. as lost or null, 3. as doubtful and under tryal. 1.

            <p>And therefore the Church hath ever used <hi>Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> as a thing different from a full or proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. <hi>Suspension</hi> and some <hi>disciplinary</hi> restraints, have been called <hi>Excommunicatio minor,</hi> which doth not cut off a man from the Church: When the proper Excommunication called <hi>major,</hi> is but an Authoritative Declaring that a man hath cut off himself, by <hi>Apostasie</hi> at least from some <hi>essential part</hi> of Christian <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Duty:</hi> without which self-abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>C.</hi> VI. The Baptizing one into the Union of the Church-Universal, obligeth him to exercise Christ's instituted Worship in particular Churches; and therefore to know what that is: which is The Pastor's <hi>Teaching the Flock Christ's Gospel; officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> in the <hi>administration of the Lord's Supper, Prayer</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59334:31"/>
               <hi>and Praise,</hi> and <hi>Disciplinary Government</hi> by the <hi>use of the Church-Keys:</hi> Of Mens fitness for these, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors are the Judges, and the <hi>Flock</hi> must obey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C.</hi> VII. Christ hath in Scripture instituted all that is of necessity to this Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C.</hi> VIII. Every Governour hath a governing Judgment (called <hi>Publick</hi>) suitable to his Office. The Pastours are Judges who is capable of Baptism and Church-Communion, as far as must be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Keys.</p>
            <p>The Magistrate is Judge who is by him to be countenanced, tolerated, or punished by force.</p>
            <p>The Parents are Judges in cases about their Wives and Children, proper to Family-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</p>
            <p>But every reasonable Creature being a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of himself, is necessarily the Discerner of his own Duty. And God being the Highest Ruler, and there being no Power but of Him, and none against Him, no Man must obey any against him: and all must use their Reason to judge whether Mens Laws be against God or not: If this were not so, 1. Men were governed as meer Bruites: 2. And must curse God or Christ, or murder, or do any Evil that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers bid them. 3. And then God should for this punish none but Soveraigns. 4. And then all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must be of the King's Religion. 5. And then men must not judge whether it be the Just Prince or the Usurper that they must obey. In short, this overthroweth all Religion and Humanity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C.</hi> IX. No men have Power to Judge <hi>in partem utramlibet,</hi> or against any Article of Faith or Divine Obedience; the Thing is <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False</hi> before they judge of it: and if they judge against Truth, their Judgment is void: God binds as not to believe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59334:32"/>
their Lie: They have no Power to judge that there is no God, no Christ, no Holy Ghost, that the Gospel is false, that Men may commit Idolatry, Perjury, Murder, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The contrary all may and must judge; but some as Rulers, and some as Subjects. But in cases before indifferent, (where Man's Authority may <hi>make Duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or <hi>not,</hi> there they may <hi>judge it Duty or not</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C.</hi> X. In doubtful cases no mens bare judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can bind or make others to Believe things Divine with a Divine Faith: man is not God. But 1. <hi>Teachers</hi> that are credible must be believed with a human Faith according to the degree of their credibility, which is preparatory to Divine Faith. 2. And Rulers may <hi>Govern</hi> Subjects in the manner of expressing and using their controverted Opinions, and restrain them from doing hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C.</hi> XI. While true Union and Love are secured by common concord in things essential and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, a Judge of other Controversies is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to these ends before secured: Christians must live in Love that understand not many hundred Texts or Controversies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C.</hi> XII. It is worse than Madness to think that all Controversies will on Earth be ended, or that any Men can do it. But they that say it do most deeply damn such pretended Judges, that so many Volumes being written of Controversies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary textual Expositions among themselves, will not decide them to this day. Who shall decide all the Controversies between General Councils, and all the present Patriarchs and Churches in the World.</p>
            <p>Thus much to answer the question, <hi>Who shall be Iudge of Controversies and Scripture Sence?</hi>

If they considered how utterly impossible it is to make the multitude of ignorant People, yea or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, to be all of a mind, in the numerous hard Controversies, Opinions, and dubious or indifferent things, that are striven about in the World; certainly instead of damning, or despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or destroying, or hateing each other for such things, they would magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when I had set my self throughly and impartially to study it, I found that which so amazed me, that I durst scarce believe what I could not deny; even that from the beginning of the Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Pelugius,</hi> all the Voluminous

after their Leaders, of things that they never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. I am ashamed to hear of't in the Pulpits: one Party rendring the Doctrine of Predestination as odious Blasphemy, and another Party crying down Universal Redemption and Free-will and Arminianism, as an Enemy to God's Grace; and neither of them know what they speak against. One <hi>Davenant,</hi> or <hi>Camero,</hi> or <hi>Le Blank,</hi> sheweth more insight into the Controversies which they reconcile, than forty of these zealous Railers do.</p>
            <p>§. 10. I meddle not in this Book with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about <hi>Church-Government</hi> or <hi>Worship:</hi> A settled worldly Interest and the various mental dispositions of the Contenders, convince me, that I can there do little for reconciliation: God must do it, if he have not forsaken this world. But meer <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Controversies (though of great moment) methinks should not be so linked to a worldly Interest, but that men should be willing to know the Truth or to endure others to know it. That which I have attempted is, by meer and clear explication, without much argumentation, to end such Controversies: And to make men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand one another, and the things which they dispute about; and by abbreviating my <hi>Catholick Theology,</hi> to make the Conciliation fitter for all Students: And the Success of that Book giveth me great encouragement, which hath been unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this day, when I looked that it should have brought the Contentious of both sides about my ears. And I rejoice in the Success of <hi>Le Blank</hi>'s <hi>Theses</hi> which I publish'd (he sent them to me to publish, and I gave them to my Bookseller to print, and he sold his Copy to another.)

dismal effects that the History of the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Life mention of these Controversies, I rejoice that these many years last past, they have made in <hi>England</hi> less noise than ever, and are talked of with more peace and moderation.

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of God's Will and Decrees in general.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>THE Will of God</hi>] signifieth either, I. His own Essence, and that, 1. under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi> analogically to the <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in Man; or 2. under the notion of <hi>an Act,</hi> as it is considered only <hi>ex parte agentis</hi> without the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. II. Or the said Essence as related to the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> or <hi>Objects,</hi> and thence denominated. III. Or the <hi>Extrinsick Objects</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> themselves, called his <hi>Will,</hi> because <hi>willed</hi> by him.</p>
            <p>§. 2. These later are, I. His Works of eminent Power (with Wisdom and Goodness) <hi>viz.</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Preservation and Natural Motion, by God as <hi>sons naturae.</hi> II. His Works of Eminent Wisdom (with Power and Goodness) <hi>viz.</hi> ORDER, and specially Moral Government; the parts of which are, 1. Legislation, Antecedent to man's actions; 2. Retribution, by Judgment and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, consequent to them: especially by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer in the way of <hi>Grace.</hi> III. His Works of Eminent Love or Goodness (with Power and Wisdom) especially <hi>Glory</hi> begun and perfected.</p>
            <p>§. 3. By [<hi>God's Decrees</hi>] is meant his <hi>Volitions</hi> of what shall be; which are but his <hi>Will</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as in such acts: Now concerning all these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's Will.</p>
            <p>§. 4. I. God's <hi>Will</hi> in <hi>it self</hi> considered is <hi>his Essence,</hi> and not any <hi>Accident</hi> in God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59334:39"/>§. 5. II. Yet <hi>esse &amp; Velle</hi> are not <hi>Conceptions</hi> of the <hi>same sence</hi> or <hi>importance;</hi> but are distinct <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate Conceptions</hi> of the same God: And so is also <hi>Intelligere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 6. III. As <hi>Posse &amp; Agere</hi> are not really two things in God, so his <hi>Will</hi> as a <hi>Power, Faculty</hi> or <hi>Virtue,</hi> and his Will as an <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Volition</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, are not <hi>two things;</hi> but <hi>two inadequate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi> of that which is simple Unity in God; for Man's narrow mind can no otherwise know him.</p>
            <p>§. 7. IV. God doth <hi>operate</hi> or <hi>effect immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> by his <hi>Essence;</hi> and not by any <hi>Action</hi> of his, which is between <hi>his Essence</hi> and the <hi>Effect:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you call it his <hi>Agere, Intelligere</hi> or <hi>Velle,</hi> or all conjunct by which he effecteth, it is nothing besides his <hi>Essence</hi> which is so called: For there is nothing <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the <hi>Creature's Actions:</hi> And <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> both are true; because <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> in God are really the same: But as to our <hi>Conception</hi> and <hi>Expression,</hi> it is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler expression to say that he doth it by <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> because <hi>our Conception</hi> of <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 9. VI. God's Will as it is his <hi>Essence</hi> hath really no <hi>parts,</hi> no <hi>division,</hi> no <hi>change,</hi> no <hi>priority</hi> or <hi>posteriority,</hi> but perfect <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. VII. God's will as it is <hi>himself</hi> hath <hi>no Cause</hi> but is the <hi>Cause of every Creature:</hi> And to ask a <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>first Cause</hi> is absurd.</p>
            <p>§. 11. VIII. All the <hi>effects of God's Will ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> have their <hi>divers natures, orders</hi> and <hi>seasons, priority, posteriority</hi> or <hi>simultaneity,</hi> which we may sobe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly enquire after.</p>
            <p>§. 12. IX. <hi>God's will,</hi> though but <hi>one,</hi> as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>objects</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> may by us be diversly denominated: And so we distinguish of his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting will,</hi> and his <hi>Redeeming will,</hi> his <hi>will to Save,</hi> and his <hi>will to Damn,</hi> his <hi>will to save Peter,</hi> and his <hi>will to save Iohn,</hi> and so of all the rest of the Objects. In all which we mean not a Diversity of <hi>Essences</hi> or <hi>Faculties</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Acts ex parte agentis, really</hi> differing; but only one and the same Will diversly conceived of and denominated by reason of the diversity of <hi>objects</hi> or <hi>effects</hi> to which it is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59334:40"/>
               <hi>related,</hi> and so by <hi>Connotation</hi> the <hi>Will it self</hi> is thus distinguished.</p>
            <p>§. 13. X. This <hi>distinction</hi> and <hi>denomination</hi> of <hi>God's will</hi> hath <hi>extrinsick Reasons,</hi> which some call <hi>Causes,</hi> from the various <hi>termini;</hi> as the same Light shining into several Rooms; the diversity being real only <hi>ex parte recipientis.</hi> And so God's Will may be said in this Sence to <hi>begin</hi> and to <hi>end,</hi> to have <hi>diversity, priority</hi> and <hi>posteriority</hi> of Acts; which are all to be judged of by the <hi>Order of the Objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 14. XI. The great question which the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits trouble themselves with, and <hi>Vasquez,</hi> with abundance more, pronounce <hi>unsearchable</hi> and past our reach, is, <hi>What is the Cause that God's Will is terminated thus or thus, on this Object rather than on that?</hi> To which I take the boldness to answer for the ending of that Dispute.</p>
            <p>By [<hi>the Reason of Termination</hi>] you must mean either, 1. The Reason of the <hi>Being</hi> of that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or <hi>Terminus</hi> rather than another: or 2. The reason of the <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>God's Will</hi> to that <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> rather than another, and so of the <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> or 3. The reason of the <hi>being of that Act of God</hi> so terminated.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For the first, the cause of all the <hi>effects of God's Will,</hi> is <hi>his Will it self:</hi> And so of all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities effected.</item>
               <item>2. The reason of the <hi>Relation</hi> of God's Will to those <hi>effects,</hi> and so of the <hi>connotation</hi> and <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Effect</hi> as from which the relation doth result.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59334:41"/>3. And the <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> thus termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, is <hi>God's essence,</hi> which hath no <hi>Cause.</hi> And what would you have more?</item>
            </list>
            <p>§. 15. But this satisfieth not Men that still think of God as of themselves, but they go on still and ask, <hi>What is the Cause that God's Will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to make this World or Creature rather than another? or to give the first grace rather to one than to another? that his Will is terminated rather on</hi> Peter <hi>than</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das <hi>in election? &amp;c.</hi> But I must but call you back to consider again distinctly of what was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before. 1. The Cause of all the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Creation, &amp;c.</hi> is <hi>God's Will:</hi> 2. The cause why his Will is <hi>related</hi> to that <hi>effect</hi> à <hi>posteriore</hi> is the <hi>position of the effect</hi> with God's Will. 3. The cause why God hath such a Will is not to be asked, for God's Will hath <hi>no Cause.</hi> And if you add, <hi>But what is the cause that,</hi> à priore, <hi>his Will is thus related and denominated as decreeing this or that?</hi> I say, <hi>A priore,</hi> there is nothing in God's Will but it self, which hath <hi>no Cause:</hi> we dream of <hi>priorities</hi> and <hi>posteriorities</hi> and <hi>varieties</hi> in him, when we think of the <hi>following effects;</hi> But when there was nothing but <hi>God really</hi> to <hi>terminate</hi> his will, there was no ground for any <hi>real relation and relative difference;</hi> And to talk of <hi>Relationes ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> in God himself as to <hi>non-existent</hi> Creatures, and ask the <hi>cause of them,</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ash presumption; while we know that there was nothing in God but God, who hath no Cause. And the question respecting nothing but what was eternally in God himself, whatever you will <hi>call</hi> his Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Will fore-related to the future Creature, you must needs say, that it had <hi>no Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59334:41"/>§. 16. But if the question go further, <hi>Why God willeth not other Creatures,</hi> or <hi>other effects, and so his will is not effectively terminated on such;</hi> it is after to be fullier answered; and now it is enough to say, that <hi>Nothing hath no Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 17. And when we say, that God's will may be denominated as divers, <hi>prior</hi> and <hi>posterior,</hi> and changeable as <hi>related to Objects that are such,</hi> this is to be understood only of those acts which are to be <hi>denominated by Connotation</hi> of what is divers and mutable, <hi>ex parte termini,</hi> still remembring that <hi>ex parte Dei</hi> there is really no diversity or mutation. And therefore such denominations are given of God's will chiefly as <hi>related</hi> to <hi>existent Objects,</hi> which are his Acts called <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> or <hi>Complacency</hi> and <hi>Displacency: e. g.</hi> we may say that [<hi>God is displeased with</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseth <hi>unconverted</hi>] and [<hi>he is pleased with them when converted</hi>] the change being only in them. Yet the same denomination may be used also of God's <hi>purposing Will.</hi> As, <hi>e. g.</hi> we may say, that [<hi>before Christ's Incarnation, God had this Decree; I will send my Son to be incarnate, and die for Man's redemption.</hi>] But now it is not fit to say that <hi>God hath yet such a Decree,</hi> when the thing decreed is past: nor a Decree that <hi>He will create Adam</hi> and the rest of the World, which is created.</p>
            <p>§. 18. But whoever liketh or disliketh any of these modes of Speech, must still remember that Controversies about them are not about any real <hi>change</hi> in God, (which all deny) but only about the <hi>connotative</hi> and <hi>respective denomination</hi> of his Will from the changeable Creature. And while
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59334:42"/>
that is confessed, sober men will not be forward to fall out about it.</p>
            <p>§. 19. Suffer not the Quaerist to confound the three forementioned Sences of [<hi>the Will of God,</hi>] and you may resolve almost all the ordinary questions about it, as is before intimated, without any more ado. As, <hi>e. g.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Is God's Will resisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. God's Will, as it is his <hi>Essence,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come into the Question, as not being <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> and so not properly <hi>resistible.</hi> 2. As God's Will is taken for the <hi>objects</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of his will, many of them are <hi>resistible:</hi> As his <hi>Commands</hi> when they are violated are resisted morally; so one <hi>effect</hi> of God's will, or <hi>one Creature</hi> moved by him naturally, may <hi>resist another.</hi> 3. If the question be only whether the respective <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of God's will, and the <hi>Denomination</hi> of it as thus or thus terminated, can be <hi>resisted?</hi> I answer, 1. Not by any resistance upon the Essential will of God so terminated. 2. Not by making God to be <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>not willing</hi> of the same thing in the same respect at the same time; for that is a contradiction; and were to make the same Object <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>not to be</hi> at the same time, <hi>Contra necessitatem existentiae.</hi> 3. Not by preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or destroying any Object or Effect which God's will so produceth, as that no Creature hath power to hinder. 4. But when he will cause one sort of <hi>motion,</hi> and himself cause a <hi>greater contrary motion,</hi> or enable a <hi>free Agent</hi> so <hi>to do,</hi> this <hi>contrary motion</hi> resisting the <hi>other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which was the effect of God's will, his <hi>will</hi> is denominated as resisted respectively. The same may be said of <hi>Passive Resistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59334:42"/>
            <p>§. 20. So if the Question be [<hi>Whether God gave any Conditional Will?</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. There is no place for the Question about <hi>God's Essential Will</hi> in it self. 2. Many <hi>Objects of God's will</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> are <hi>antecedently conditional.</hi> 1. <hi>Quoad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Therefore if the Question be only, whether <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b objecto</hi> any Will of God may be <hi>relatively</hi> or <hi>connotatively</hi> called Conditional, 1. Remember that the Question is but <hi>de nomine.</hi> 2. The same will of God may be called Conditional, as <hi>quid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionale</hi> is the Object of it; and also Certain and Absolute, as the same thing is to him <hi>certainly future,</hi> which yet was in the <hi>Order of Causing, conditionally future.</hi> But this supposeth the <hi>certo futurum,</hi> to be <hi>quid volitum;</hi> and not Sin, which is <hi>certo futurum</hi> and <hi>non volitum.</hi>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Not as it is his <hi>Essence.</hi> 2. The Objects of it have their Causes. 3.

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. God's <hi>Essential Knowledge</hi> is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>one.</hi> 2. The <hi>Objects</hi> of it are <hi>many.</hi> 3.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. His Knowledge <hi>essential</hi> it self is not. 2. The Objects are. 3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Denominations</hi> of his Knowledge <hi>ab extrae</hi> oft are: As we may say, That <hi>God knew from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that the World would be created, and Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, as future.</hi> But now he knoweth that they were so, <hi>ut praeterita.</hi> God doth not now know, that <hi>Christ will be born,</hi> that <hi>Christ just now is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>preaching on Earth:</hi> but once he knew all these. Yet here all the Change is in the <hi>object,</hi> and none in God's Knowledge, as there is on mans.</p>
            <p>§. 7. If the question be, <hi>How God knoweth future contingents?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. God's <hi>Essence</hi> is <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and is <hi>Infinite,</hi> and therefore extendeth to all that is intelligible: And if they be not <hi>objects intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi> it belongeth not to a perfect Intellect to know them. But if they are, it is rashness to ask any other reason of God's knowing them, besides his <hi>Perfection</hi> and their <hi>Intelligibility:</hi> But all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59334:44"/>
that are <hi>future,</hi> are <hi>Certainties</hi> to God as well as <hi>Contingencies,</hi> in several respects, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly known: But the shallow Brain of Worms doth little know what <hi>Futurity</hi> signifieth in <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to God. 2. But we know what <hi>future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi> are to us. 3. And thence we know that God's Intellect may be denominated by imperfect Man, as in its perfection comprehending our <hi>Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities</hi> and <hi>Contingencies,</hi> and human Measures, tho' not as Measures to God.</p>
            <p>§. 8. If the question be, <hi>Whether God know things as future, because he willeth them to be future; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are future from the free Agent's Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. God's Knowledge, <hi>ex parte sui,</hi> is his Essence, and hath no <hi>Cause,</hi> for it is no <hi>Effect.</hi> God's <hi>Understanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially <hi>One,</hi> but as various, inadequate concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they only make up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perfect Unity, and are not Causes and Effects to one another; much less <hi>caused</hi> by any Creature. 2. But <hi>Futurity</hi> is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by that which causeth the <hi>thing future:</hi> And therefore the <hi>futurity of Sin</hi> is caused by Man that causeth <hi>Sin,</hi> so far as it is capable of a Cause; of which more in due place: But as <hi>Futurity</hi> is not <hi>Existence,</hi> so it needeth not an <hi>existent,</hi> but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times only a <hi>future cause.</hi> 3. And God's Intellect is terminated on things as <hi>Intelligible,</hi> and that is as they are: And so on things that are <hi>future by his own will,</hi> as such; and on things future by <hi>Man's Will,</hi> as such; as far as <hi>Futurity</hi> is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an eternal mind.</p>
            <p>§. 9. The many Disputes <hi>de scientia simplicis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligentiae, purae visionis &amp; mediae,</hi> I think best abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated according to the forementioned Principles. God's <hi>essential Understanding</hi> is but <hi>One: Things</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59334:44"/>
               <hi>intelligible</hi> are many; God's <hi>simple Intellect</hi> may be variously denominated as related to and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on various intelligible Objects, and so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>their Order:</hi> But this signifieth no real diversity at all in God, but in the things known: Nor must we dream, that <hi>Scientia simplicis intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae,</hi> is like <hi>man's,</hi> a knowledge of certain <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notions</hi> or <hi>Propositions</hi> by way of <hi>Thinking,</hi> as to know that [<hi>This is possible, and the other is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and that is convenient,</hi>] as if God needed such <hi>second notions</hi> to know by; but it is infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Man's mode of knowing: His Knowledge is first <hi>effective</hi> and then <hi>intuitive,</hi> and this without diversity or change in God.</p>
            <p>§. 10. It is a great aggravation of the Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prophaneness of many voluminous School-Disputes, about the unsearchable nature of divine Intellection, that the certain Knowledge of our own great ignorance (even about every silly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and of God's incomprehensibleness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite distance, do not prevail to repress such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciousness, and bring men to more Modesty and Reverence of God: And how much more learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>§. 1. ELECTION in Scripture sometimes sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth God's actual <hi>choosing</hi> or <hi>taking</hi> one <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>People</hi> from among others to himself, either for his special <hi>Complacency</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> by <hi>Sanctification</hi> or Conversion; or to some <hi>special Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> was chosen from among his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And sometimes it signifieth <hi>God's eternal Will</hi> or <hi>Decree</hi> so to choose, call or sanctifie and save men at a determinate time: as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>§. 2. God will convert, justifie, adopt and save some men, by his Grace.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Therefore it is certain that God from Eternity did <hi>will</hi> or <hi>decree</hi> so to do: For the <hi>event in time,</hi> maketh it <hi>fit so to denominate God's etern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 4. In the same manner as God bringeth men to Grace and Glory, he willeth or decreeth to do it: For his <hi>Decree</hi> to do it, is no real Act of God distinct from his Essence; but it is his simple es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential will denominated from the <hi>effect</hi> related to it.

            <p>§. 1. THough <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Scripture signifieth one whose existent Pravity rendereth him <hi>disapproved, loathed</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yet we here continue the word <hi>Reprobation</hi> as ordinarily used, for the Decree of rejecting men for ever,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59334:47"/>
that we may be understood; not refusing any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itter name.</p>
            <p>§. 2. God's <hi>essential Will as such</hi> is not called <hi>Reprobation</hi> nor a Decree of Damnation, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from other Volitions: Therefore the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing denomination must be fetcht from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects or objects which it hath relation to.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Therefore where there is no effect or object of God's Will, there is no such will to be named and asserted: But so much as God effecteth in or towards Mans damnation, so much he must be said to will.</p>
            <p>§. 4. God effecteth no mans Sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he willed not or decreed not to effect it.</p>
            <p>§. 5. He effecteth it not either for it self, or as a means to something better: Therefore he decreed not to do either.</p>
            <p>§. 6. God effecteth <hi>much</hi> without which Sin could not be, (as the Life and Power of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his abused Mercies, Objects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Therefore all this he decreed to do, even as his own Works, which Sinners make the occasions of their Sin.</p>
            <p>§. 7. If it be said that God <hi>permitteth Sin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he decreed to permit it:</hi> These things must be answered. 1. <hi>Permission</hi> is an ambiguous word: Strictly it signifieth in Physicks nothing at all but a <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er Negation,</hi> which is <hi>non impedire, not to hinder:</hi> But in <hi>Politicks</hi> it oft signifieth a <hi>positive Licence</hi> or <hi>voluntary Concession</hi> of <hi>Leave</hi> for a man to do or possess something: And many Divines by <hi>Permission</hi> mean not bare <hi>non-impedition,</hi> but also some action that tendeth to the procuring of the event. In the first and proper sence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> followeth not that God <hi>decreed to permit Sin,</hi> because he <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rmitteth</hi> it: For <hi>permitting</hi> here is but a bare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59334:48"/>
verb, and signifieth <hi>nothing: Not-to-hinder</hi> is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>nothing:</hi> And <hi>nothing</hi> is no <hi>terminus</hi> to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Gods Decree or Will. But as permitting sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth any positive act, which men make an <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of Sin, it is improperly called <hi>Permission,</hi> and it was spoken of before: And though God's <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Influx</hi> be <hi>presupposed,</hi> that is not <hi>Permission,</hi> nor part of <hi>Permission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Permission</hi> signifieth <hi>Leave</hi> to Sin, God permitteth none; for it is not <hi>Sin</hi> if <hi>so permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And if it would hold that God <hi>Decreeth his Permission</hi> of Sin, it followeth not that he decreeth the <hi>Sin permitted;</hi> for that is not a capable object of his Volition.</p>
            <p>§. 8. God effecteth <hi>punishment,</hi> even in Hell (at least, part of it, of which in due place) therefore he decreeth or willeth so to effect it.</p>
            <p>§. 9. God damneth none but <hi>Sinners:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he decreed to damn none but Sinners: Therefore a Man only as a Sinner is the object of the Decree of Damnation or Punishment, seeing the Decree is denominated from the effect.</p>
            <p>§. 10. It is not a Sinner meerly as a Sinner that God will damn: else all Sinners should be damned. But it is only a certain sort of <hi>Sinners,</hi> who <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and finally reject remedying means and mercy.</hi> Therefore it is only such that are the Objects of the particular Decree of Damnation.</p>
            <p>§. 11. In the first instant we are <hi>Men,</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>innocent,</hi> in the third <hi>guilty of Sin</hi> against the meer Law of <hi>Innocency;</hi> in the fourth we are brought under the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> upon the Promise of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and in the fifth we have the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mercies</hi> of that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> given us,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59334:48"/>
as means to our performance of the Duty which that Law requireth and obtaining further Mercy. In none of these instants is a man the object of the <hi>Decree of Damnation:</hi> God damneth not any man meerly as a <hi>Man,</hi> or as <hi>Innocent,</hi> or as a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner against the meer Law of Innocency,</hi> nor as <hi>redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>under the Law</hi> of Grace, nor as receiving the <hi>common means</hi> and <hi>mercies</hi> of that <hi>Covenant;</hi> Nay, nor as in the sixth Instant he is guilty of <hi>sinning against such Mercies;</hi> (for else all that do so should perish.) But only as in the seventh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant he is found a <hi>prevalent, final rejecter of the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace,</hi> and abuser of the <hi>common Mercies of that Covenant.</hi> And therefore the Decree is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly denominated; though God's <hi>essential will</hi> have no Cause, nor Dependance upon any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>§. 12. But there are other Acts of God's ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which are comprized in <hi>Reprobation</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> as the word is commonly understood: As, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cutting off a sinner untimely in his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency. 2. Denying him some inward helps of Grace which once he had, or was fair for (so far as that is <hi>quid positivum</hi>) and depriving him positively of some <hi>Means</hi> of Grace; for his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful refusal or abuse, or for abuse of other Means and Mercies. And all these punishments God so <hi>far decreeth</hi> as he <hi>Executeth;</hi> which is upon none but such as by <hi>sin against the Law of Grace</hi> deserve them.</p>
            <p>§. 13. But where <hi>Negations</hi> are no <hi>Punishments</hi> nor <hi>Privations,</hi> they fall not under the notion of <hi>Positive Effects</hi> or <hi>Objects,</hi> and so are not fit to denominate a <hi>Positive Decree</hi> or <hi>Will.</hi> Therefore when it is not a Punishment, (<hi>Not to give Faith, Repentance, Preaching,</hi> &amp;c.) is no act of <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation:</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59334:49"/>
As not to give that Faith, Repentance and Pardon which he needed not to <hi>Adam</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; not to give them in <hi>act</hi> to Infants, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Yea, when a <hi>Penal Privation</hi> is only the consequent of God's <hi>not Acting,</hi> and not of any <hi>Positive Act,</hi> there the <hi>Ratio Poenae</hi> is of God, and is <hi>quid positivum,</hi> and God causeth it by that Law which did make the <hi>debitum poenae:</hi> But yet the <hi>Negation</hi> or <hi>Privation</hi> in which it consisteth is Nothing, or nothing of God's causing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not fit to denominate a <hi>distinct Decree: e. g. Not to give special Grace, Pardon, Iustification, Glory, to Iudas,</hi> is <hi>nothing,</hi> and so as <hi>nothing</hi> not the object of a positive Decree: But both the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive acts</hi> by which any Mercy is withdrawn, and also the relation of Punishment which is in these Nothings or Privations is <hi>caused</hi> by God, and therefore Decreed by him. As if God say, <hi>This shall be his punishment that will not Eat, that he shall die of Famine:</hi> Here <hi>not eating</hi> is nothing, but the <hi>penal reason</hi> which is in Famine, which is but the <hi>privation of Meats,</hi> resulteth from the Law of Nature and will of God.</p>
            <p>§. 15. By all this it appeareth that <hi>Election and Reprobation</hi> go not <hi>pari passu,</hi> or are not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ascribed to God. For in <hi>Election</hi> God is the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> by his Grace, and of all that truly tendeth to procure it: But on the other side, God is <hi>no cause</hi> of <hi>any sin</hi> which is the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>Damnation;</hi> nor the Cause of Damnation, but on the supposition of Man's sin: So that sin is <hi>foreseen</hi> in the Person <hi>Decr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin, Prosper</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> still make this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, That the decree of Damnation goeth on foresight of sin, but the Decree of Salvation containeth a Decree to give that Grace that shall certainly Save us.</p>

I very highly value the worthy Gentleman whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers you sent me, hearing of few, if any, among us more commended for Knowledge and Piety. The question is but whether it be he or I that by half confused conceptions of the matters in question speaketh in the Dark, or which of us hath the more ripe digested and ordered thoughts hereof. And must others be troubled with such Cases? It is those that he pleadeth for that have made the edge of the Razor so thin that they or I do Cut our Fingers with it, and have spun such subtile Notions, which if their wits when they have done be not subtile enough to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, they will oft slip through or be as Spiders Webs. As to the first Controversie of Futurity or Possibility, this Gentleman's method will do me no good, being no whit fitted to that which I expect. I should expect from him that he had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59334:50"/>
taken notice of my Distinctions and Explications <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f Futurity, and that he had directly pleaded only for that sort or sence which I deny, and had Answer'd the Reasons which both in the First and Second Part I bring against it. But it is not so: And to Dispute at such rates is but to try who shall live longest to have the last word, (it being easie at this rate to talk against one another as long as we live) which I cannot expect, and therefore shall give any man herein the best. All that he hath said against me is materially Answered in the Book already, and if he perceive it not, how can I help that? More Books are not like to do it, nor have I leisure for such tasks: Yet briefly I return,</p>
               <p>I. As to my sence of the words (Future) and (Possible); 1. As they are predicated of the thing <hi>future</hi> or <hi>possible,</hi> they are <hi>termini diminuentes quod realitatem existentem,</hi> and <hi>futurity</hi> as it is <hi>rei ipsius futuritio</hi> is nothing. 2. Whether Time be any thing distinct à <hi>re durante</hi> or Nothing, is a Controversie, which I conjecture Mr. <hi>P</hi>—'s Pen and mine are never like to decide. It is enough for me now to say, that I take it for nothing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct. 3. Yet shallow man that seeth not <hi>uno intuitu</hi> the Universe, as God doth, nor hath his essential Eternity, is in motion, where there is <hi>mensura motus,</hi> and must think of things by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Conceptions, and must make <hi>past, present,</hi> and <hi>future</hi> his differing Notions in Duration. 4.

God's Will and Knowledge from Eternity, that there shall be Time, Successions, Man, Propositions, and that things shall be in such an Order, are a foundation of the verity of such a <hi>verbum mentis vel oris</hi> (these will be) if there had been any such eternal Words or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. 10.

And the proper Language is but this, (God can do this: God will do this) which suppose it not done. As (God can make the world) would have been a true word from Eternity, had there been any such word to be true. And thence we say (The World was possible.) And God's perfect Knowledge being <hi>eminenter</hi> somewhat infinitely more perfect than such Thoughts, Words, and Propositions, after the manner of weak man, we speak of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Nothings</hi> as related to his Will that they shall be, or to his Knowledge, and so call them <hi>possible</hi> and <hi>future.</hi>

And why answer you not what I wrote against Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> before you call for an Answer to him? Or at least, why answer you not <hi>Strangius,</hi> but impertinently talk of the Serpent <hi>Socinus?</hi> If <hi>Socinus</hi> had no more wit than to take the Futurity of Sin for a Being, (Substance, Accident or Mode) no wonder if he knew not how to deny that God is the Cause of it. And why do you not attempt to answer me, who tell you, That if you take it to be a real Being and eternal, you must take it to be God himself; for nothing else is eternal. But I pray you say not (like your former arguing about nothing) [<hi>The eternal Futurity of Sin is God himself;</hi> ergo, <hi>God is the eternal Futurity of Sin.</hi>] The Subject and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate are not so convertible as you seem to make them. You say, if we say, Futurity is nothing, then it is a wonder, an independent on God and his Will, self-originated and unpreventable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You write no wonders to me, this rate of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course being common in the World, and hath been in most Ages. Is Nothing a wonder? Is it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for nothing to be independent? but yet that which hath no dependent Being, may so far as a Nothing be at God's will, that he continue nothing or make something (the first <hi>non agendo,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>agendo</hi>) as he pleases, that is, by willing or not willing. And it were a wonder indeed for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59334:55"/>
Nothing to be self-originated, or that Nothing should spring from any thing as an efficient Cause: But reductively some Nothings may be ascribed to God's Non-agency, as Beings good are to his action. As God is improperly called the Cause of Darkness, because he there maketh not Light, so improperly he may be said to be the Cause of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, because he made not the contrary Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. You say (then there is <hi>fatum Stoicissimum</hi> on God) and all his Works, and this Futurity binds the Almighty, that he cannot do as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in Heaven and Earth. This is a wonder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that Nothing should be stronger than God, and rule him and the World. If Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> hold Sin to be nothing, doth it follow, that it binds God, because it's nothing? Doth Death bind God, because it is but the privation of Life; or vacuity (<hi>si detur vacuum</hi>) because it is nothing? Or when there was nothing but God, did Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness bind God? Is that God bound or conquer'd that can turn Nothing into Something at his pleasure? <hi>Non-futurity</hi> is nothing: therefore it hath no Cause. Is this Nothing the Ruler of God and All things, because he causeth not that which is not causable? Alas, that good men should keep up dividing Controversies at this rate of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: You say, If it have no Cause, it can have no Impediment, and so there is <hi>Fatum Stoicissimum.</hi> We all talk at the rate that we understand. The World was nothing before it was made, and so had then no Cause in the <hi>esse causae,</hi> as being no effect (Relations <hi>in esse</hi> being simultaneous): Doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that God was subject to Fate? There was no Impediment indeed to Nothingness; it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that Nothing be hindred, lest it become
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59334:55"/>
Something. God can make somewhat where there is nothing, at his pleasure, and can make a future Nothing to become an existent Something. And what should be the <hi>medium</hi> I wonder that tempted you to think otherwise: Did the nothingness of Angels before their Creation hinder God from making them? Or can nothing have a ruling Power?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ad</hi> 6. Again you stick not at the repeating of the contradiction of a self-originated Future (or Nothing) and think God's Decrees endangered by nothing, because it hath no Cause. What a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing is this Nothing! To be self-originated is to be Something of it self. And if <hi>Futurity</hi> be nothing, then it is something of it self. And you offer not a Syllable to prove these Contradictions. You add (<hi>To what purpose shall Decrees be?</hi>) <hi>Ans.</hi> To produce the thing decreed in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time and place, and not to make them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before they are any thing, nor to make an <hi>ens Rationis</hi> to be a real extrinseck Entity. You strangely say (<hi>To decree such a Futurity is a nullity, for it can never come to pass.</hi>) What can never come to pass? <hi>Futurity?</hi> Say also (<hi>To decree Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futurity, or that there shall be to us but one Sun, but one Saviour, is a nullity, because Nothing can never come to pass.</hi>) What is it for Nothing to come to pass? It is come to pass without a Cause that there is but one Sun to us, but one Saviour, and other Nothings. The Decree or Will of what shall come to pass is no nullity: for it shall all come to pass; and yet the Decree made not the word (<hi>shall be</hi>) to signifie a real Entity, distinct form or model of the thing that shall be. The Decree that there shall be a World, was fulfilled,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59334:56"/>
and yet (<hi>shall be</hi>) was not a <hi>being</hi> before t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> it to decree in compliance with nothing? Hath it any sence? How is it that Nothing will come to pass? It's true, that Nothing will be Nothing without a Cause, and therefore without a Decree. And therefore let the reverence of God make you consider, whether it be meet for us in the dark to ascribe to God such Decrees of nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to number Nothings, and make as many Decrees. Such a dance and game of notions we may more boldly use about our selves than about God, till we know him better. You add (<hi>God in decreeing doth not decree the thing into being in the instant of decreeing, but He decreeth the Futurity of it, and if that be nothing, he decreeth nothing.</hi>) <hi>Ans.</hi> Wrong thoughts will have wrong words. All that you should have inferred, is, [That His Decree effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth nothing till the time come] which is true: For He decreed only to effect it at such a time: But doth it follow, that God decreeth nothing but Futurity, because the thing decreed is not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done? Thus you must say, That God decreed not the World, nor CHRIST, nor Salvation, but Futurity only. The Decree or Will of God was, That the World, CHRIST, Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be at such a time: (<hi>shall be</hi>) is no <hi>being;</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59334:56"/>
yet it is a <hi>being</hi> when existent, which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, but his Decree maketh it not a <hi>being</hi> till it exist. Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> will over and over tell you, that God's immanent acts do <hi>nihil ponere in objecto.</hi> And I have oft told you truly, that you or I little know what we say when we divide God's Eternity into parts, and assign him his <hi>praeteritum &amp; futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> And it would put you hard to it to tell me clearly and surely what God's Eternal Decree is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effect exist! our present common-received School-Divinity will call us Blasphemers, if we say, that before the Creation there was any thing but God, and any thing in God but God, and that God had any real accidents: And therefore it saith, that he doth <hi>operari per essentiam,</hi> and not <hi>per accidentia.</hi> And therefore that God's Decree before the effect was nothing but his Essence. But it is his Essence denominated (not as such, but) as related to the things decreed, though yet they be not. If you will forsake this common Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and place acts in God, which <hi>ex parte agentis,</hi> are but Accidents and not his Essence, and say, This is consistent with his Simplicity and Perfection, you will let in a Body of new Divinity, and we shall not know when we have all God's Accidents, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you hold, That He hath no Decrees, what is it that you plead for? But to answer your Question, God's Decree is not a forming of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions in his mind, or any change in himself, or addition to his Being: But it is His simple will that such and such things shall be, emanative, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative, productive of them in their season. There are some that think, that as Time-Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the measures of imperfect Creatures, and God's Eternity hath none such; so that it is an ascribing Imperfection to God, to say, That he hath Decrees <hi>de futuris</hi> distinct from a productive Volition, which in the most proper sence should be denominated from the produced Existent as such. But in this I interess not my self, as knowing that we must speak improperly of God or not at all. You say that <hi>(It shall be, is a Futurity.</hi>) <hi>Ans.</hi> What's that? A (<hi>shall be</hi>) is (a <hi>Futurity</hi>), and (a <hi>futurity</hi>) is a (<hi>shall be.</hi>) <hi>Ergo</hi> a <hi>shall be</hi> and a <hi>futurity</hi> is a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Would I knew what. But to hope for that from you is too great Presumption. You add (<hi>A futurity, a nothing, and to decree nothing is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</hi>) <hi>Ans.</hi> Say you so? I am glad you say no worse: Then if those be in the right (as most) that think Sin is nothing (no more than Death or Darkness) you will grant that God decreed it not. And if I prove that Futurity <hi>ex parte rei,</hi> is nothing, you will grant that it needeth no Decree as such. But seeing you are so much on my side, I crave your help to confute those, that otherwise you defend, who make innumerable Nothings the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

of God's Decrees. But yet I would not follow you too far: <hi>(Not to give Grace to an Infidel</hi>) is nothing. <hi>(Not to give the Gospel, not to end the World till the time, not to take away Grace, Gospel, Life, &amp;c.</hi>) You say here (in your general) that none of these can be decreed. But then prepare an Answer to your Friends that will take this ill of you. I have fully opened my sence of it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. You say (<hi>Abstract futurity from the Decree and it will be nothing.</hi>) <hi>Ans.</hi> If you abstract not Futurity as a real Entity from the Decree, you will abuse God by presumptuous false Conceits: But if you abstract the word <hi>shall be</hi>) from the humane <hi>Conceptus</hi> of it, it will not differ from a <hi>Conceptus de praesente.</hi> And though I more reverence you, I may say of some other Objecters that quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with arbitrary notions, that if you except Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity and Futility, from what they say for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Futurity, it is all nothing. You add (<hi>That if in time only the thing actually exist by virtue of the Decree, the Decree is something in time, but eternally it was nothing.</hi> That is (<hi>God's will to effect any thing is nothing till it do effect it.</hi>) Yes, 'tis God's Will so to do, and is that nothing? It is nothing but God's essential will denominated from the <hi>res efficienda;</hi> but that is not nothing: if God be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there is Nothing: There is nothing indeed but God from Eternity. If you think otherwise, tell us what it is. <hi>Aureolus</hi> indeed pleadeth, That <hi>Actus Dei creantis</hi> is neither Creator nor <hi>Creatura,</hi> but <hi>quid medium,</hi> but few second him, and many confute him.

               <p>Your concluding line I pardon, and it needs no more. All that is said in this Paper on this point is materially fully answered in my Book; and I even now asked a Friend what I should say to all that object against a Book which containeth sufficient matter of answer to their Objections: And he answered, Not write for every man a new one, but wish them to read the former better.</p>
               <p>Pardon my oft repeating to you my sence of <hi>Futurity,</hi> with which I conclude. To man, Time in various instants, and the narrowness of our understandings, that must have various Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Organical Notions, make it needful to us to use names, even for things that are not (or <hi>nothings</hi>). When God (or any certain Cause) tells what will be hereafter, we frame an image of that thing that is not by the help of Words and the similitude of Things that are or have been. Then we put a name on that imagined thing, as if it were: Then we make use in our discourses of that name, and turning a Verb into a Noun, as [<hi>it will be</hi>] into [<hi>Future</hi>], and then an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective</hi> or <hi>Participle</hi> into a <hi>Substantive,</hi> [<hi>Future</hi>] into [<hi>Futurity</hi>] our poor Fancies run on with it, as if we had by the name made or mentioned some Substance or real Being. When all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59334:61"/>
but a Relative notion or <hi>Ens rationis.</hi> The knowledge that a thing will be may be a real knowledge: And instead of denominating the Act we denominate the Object, (which is internally an Image; externally Nothing real) and call it <hi>Future,</hi> and thence name <hi>Futurition:</hi> As <hi>Futurition</hi> signifieth improperly the relation of the mental act to the thing fore-known, it is a real mental act's relation: As the Subject is the thing <hi>future,</hi> so it is nothing real but a feigned organical Notion, by which we discourse instead of <hi>Verbs.</hi> The <hi>Relatio Conceptus vel nominis,</hi> is the relation of a real act. But the relation of the thing <hi>future</hi> as <hi>future</hi> is <hi>secundum dici,</hi> but feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed instead of a <hi>Verb.</hi> And of God's knowledge, I shall here say no more.</p>
               <p>In a word, If you take <hi>futuritio rei</hi> to be the Name of any immanent eternal Act of God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we think of the aptitude of your Phrase, I suppose we differ not about the thing inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as long as you hold no eternal Accidents or Composition in God, and that nothing is eternal but himself; which I must think you do in Charity. If you take <hi>futuritio rei</hi> for the <hi>modus</hi> or relation of a humane Conception or Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>de futuris,</hi> I suppose we shall not differ <hi>de re,</hi> nor will you say that it is eternal. 3. If you speak but suppositively, that if there had been such a <hi>conceptus</hi> or Assertion from Eternity, it would have been true, we differ not. 4. If you take Futurition <hi>extra mentem,</hi> to be any thing (Substance, Mode, Accident or any Reality or <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid rei</hi>) and that from Eternity, I deny it, and say, That they that make an universal Spirit, and they that make Matter and Motion to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59334:61"/>
with God, are more excusable, than they that make a thing called <hi>Futurity</hi> distinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from God; yea, the Futurity of Sin to be eternal, and God the eternal Cause of that eternal Effect.</p>
               <p>I purposed at the first glance to have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the second Paper also about God's decreeing Sin; but when I had read it I was unwilling, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is but too largely answered materially in my Book already, and more fully in old Papers that lie by me, which I cannot transcribe. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I hear so much Good of the worthy Author, that I am not willing to be drawn to dispute a Case, which cannot be handled justly, without opening so much Evil in that which I must op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as will sound harsh towards one that I so much honour. Men are so apt to feel that as touching themselves which is spoken to their Cause. If <hi>Hobbes</hi> (who wrote the Treatise of Necessity against Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi>) had sent me that Paper, I should readily have answer'd it: But here I fear it.</p>
               <p>Only I tell the Author, that I have been as strongly tempted that way as most others; and do acknowledge that it is the greatest difficulty in all these Controversies, to conceive, how free will can act otherwise than God doth predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it: But I am satisfied in the Solution; and fully satisfied, that the Predeterminant Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which I oppose doth certainly inferr the Religion of <hi>Hobbes,</hi> the denial of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and leaves us no Religion; but that Good and Evil, Happiness and Misery are Differences all made by God himself, as Light and Darkness, Angels and Serpents are made to differ by him:

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of God's Providence, and predetermining Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and Miracles.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THE word (<hi>Providence</hi>) is variously used by Writers: Sometimes as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending God's <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> and <hi>decrees</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Sometimes as comprehending <hi>all his Works:</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59334:62"/>
Sometimes as comprehending all his works which <hi>follow the Creation:</hi> And sometimes as signifying only his <hi>effective disposal</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> in <hi>Motions,</hi> and <hi>Alterations,</hi> as dictinct from <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislation,</hi> which only maketh <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. In CREATION God Glorified his Three Essential Principles or Attributes: 1 His <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency eminently</hi> in giving BEING to all things. 2. His <hi>Wisdom eminently</hi> in the ORDER and Composure of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. His <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Goodness emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,</hi> in the GOODNESS and Wellfare of all: For he made them <hi>Good,</hi> and then <hi>Rested:</hi> Yet so as that all these Attributes were glorified in each part of the Effect.</p>
            <p>§. 3. From hence <hi>a posteriore</hi> he is in the one Relation of CREATOR Related triply to the World, and specially to the Rational part: That is, 1. As the MAKER of things, (which is <hi>Creator</hi> in the narrow sence). 2. As ORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATOR. 3. As BENEFACTOR. And thus he is the Author of NATURE.</p>
            <p>§. 4. From this fundamental Relation of CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATOR, and the nature of the Creature made (and continued by Conservation, which is a continued Creation or Efficiency) there resulteth a threefold <hi>Right</hi> and further <hi>Relation</hi> to God. 1. A <hi>Ius Dominii,</hi> or Right of PROPRIETY, and so he is our OWNER, and may do with all things what he will, and must be the disposer of Events. 2. His <hi>Ius Imperii</hi> (including <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>) or Right of Government; which to things meerly <hi>Natural</hi> is <hi>Natural Government,</hi> and to <hi>Moral Agents</hi> it is <hi>Moral Government,</hi> by <hi>Doctrine, Laws</hi> and <hi>Executions:</hi> And so he is our KING or RULER. 3. His <hi>Ius Amoris ut finis;</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59334:63"/>
or Right to be the <hi>end of all,</hi> and by the <hi>Rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Creature to be <hi>chiefly Loved,</hi> and <hi>absolutely</hi> for <hi>Himself,</hi> as the <hi>Best</hi> and most <hi>Amiable,</hi> and so he is our <hi>ultimate END:</hi> Where LOVE is considered not only as an act of <hi>Obedience</hi> to a <hi>Rector</hi> as all other <hi>duties</hi> are; but eminently as it is the <hi>final perfective Act</hi> of man, closing with the <hi>final Object,</hi> and so above the common nature of meer Obedience.</p>
            <p>§. 5. All God's after-<hi>works</hi> and all our <hi>Duties</hi> to him must be observed as respecting all these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God to us, and our answerable Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him: For therein is the Nature, Order, and Harmony of them discerned to be Glorious: And unskillful confounding them is a spoiling and prophaning or dishonouring of them. And thus the various acts of Providence must be set each in its proper place.</p>
            <p>§. 6. God being the <hi>fons naturae,</hi> and having settled the frame of <hi>Nature</hi> (or created Beings and second Causes) in a fixed state and order, in which one thing is united to another, and ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to its proper work in concurrence with the whole, we must not expect that God do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily violate this his established Course: For his <hi>Works</hi> shall shew somewhat of his <hi>Constancy,</hi> and Experience telleth us, that <hi>really</hi> thus He doth.</p>
            <p>§. 7. But we must not dream that God is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily</hi> tied to his own Work, or hindered by second Causes, or the course of Nature, from doing what He would; but His free-will deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it self in this Constancy and ordered Course of Nature, and use of second Causes, which have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59334:63"/>
still all their being, force and order continued by Him.</p>
            <p>§. 8. And the number and operations of second Causes are so unknown to us, that when things <hi>seem Miracles to us,</hi> it is hard for us to say, that God useth <hi>no second Cause</hi> in effecting them. But it is enough to the use of Miracles to know that their extraordinary production hath an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable extraordinary use and signification of God's Will.</p>
            <p>§. 9. And no doubt but Nature and all its parts are absolutely in the Power and Government of God's Will: And He can and doth turn things up and down as He pleaseth, without making any breach in his established Order: If the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman can turn the course of Rivers to water his Grounds, by meer Impediments and Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, without any alteration of the natural motion of the Water; how much more must we ascribe to God, in using Nature without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing it?</p>
            <p>§. 10. It is Atheistical or absurd to set <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> in <hi>opposition, competition</hi> or <hi>separation;</hi> and to say as some Philosophers, [<hi>This or That natural Causes can do without calling in God as the Determiner.</hi>] Whereas <hi>natural Causes</hi> are nothing, and do nothing but by God: And there is no less of God in the effects of Nature, than if He did the same himself alone: In Him we Live and Move, and Are.</p>
            <p>§. 11. And it is no better in them that say, that God doth not operate <hi>proximately</hi> and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> where Nature or second Causes work, but only <hi>remotely.</hi> As [<hi>immediately</hi>] signifieth [<hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any medium</hi> or <hi>second Cause</hi>] so God doth not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59334:64"/>
then work <hi>immediately:</hi> But as it signifieth <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximately,</hi> He doth: For an <hi>infinite being</hi> cannot be <hi>essentially distant</hi> from any Creature or Effect: Nor is it possible that the <hi>second Cause</hi> can be <hi>nearer</hi> to the <hi>Effect</hi> than <hi>God;</hi> who is as near as if he used no such Cause.</p>
            <p>§. 12. And the Dispute, Whether God do <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximately</hi> effect <hi>immediatione suppositi,</hi> or only <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis,</hi> seemeth to have a false supposition, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>virtus</hi> which is neither his Essence nor a Creature, we believe them not.</p>
            <p>§. 13. The Controversie between <hi>Durandus</hi> and his Followers, and the Jesuites and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, about the necessity of a <hi>moving Concourse,</hi> besides the support of Nature, seemeth to me thus reconcileable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. God as he is <hi>fons naturae,</hi> is the <hi>Living God,</hi> the <hi>prime Active Principle,</hi> who by constant vital Activity is the Spring of all the Action in the World; and is not to be dreamt of as one that had made the World, and then left it to it self, and withdrew his hand and is fallen asleep.</item>
               <item>2. But the <hi>Living God</hi> moveth not all things alike, but every thing according to its nature and place; for his Influx is received <hi>ad modum raci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientium.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59334:64"/>3. The Nature of some Creatures is essentially <hi>Active,</hi> and so inclined to act that they <hi>will act</hi> if their Nature be not by others, or want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Necessaries, hindered. Such is every Soul or living Principle, and Fire. And other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are naturally <hi>Passive</hi> only <hi>ex se</hi> (or at least principally). So that for God to continue Fire or <hi>Souls</hi> or any <hi>naturally-active Principle,</hi> is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a nature essentially inclined to move or act.</item>
               <item>4. It is supposed that these Natures are not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, but parts of the <hi>universe,</hi> and are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with all necessary circumstant Beings and Objects; and that the whole frame of Nature and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating Causes are continued: <hi>e. g.</hi> That the Sun doth not stand still, while the Life of a Plant or Brute is continued.</item>
               <item>5. All this being supposed by <hi>Durandus, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reolus, a Dola,</hi> and all sober men, the Question de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated is, <hi>Whether there be further necessary another immediate Divine Motion or Concourse to every motion of a Creature natural or free, besides all this afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And, 1. Let it be consider'd, that God's <hi>Essence</hi> being but one, his Act, which <hi>ex parte agentis,</hi> is his <hi>Essence,</hi> is not distinguishable, saving <hi>ex connotatione effectus:</hi> And if this be all that is meant, That as <hi>ipse motus distinguitur a causis,</hi> so God's <hi>Will, Power</hi> and <hi>Agency</hi> may be distinctly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, 1. As <hi>from the second Causes;</hi> and 2. also <hi>from the Motion it self,</hi> as <hi>more than the Causes;</hi> this none can deny, nor is it a Controversie. But if the question be of the necessity of <hi>another distinct way of Divine Causation</hi> of the <hi>motus,</hi> besides that by second Causes before mentioned, they can prove no such necessity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59334:65"/>For is it <hi>mediate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> Causation or Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency which they mean?

            <p>But if they mean, that to every motion there must be an <hi>immediate operation</hi> of God to it <hi>witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> that which he doth by <hi>second Causes,</hi> even by <hi>God alone without any second Cause,</hi> I then ask, <hi>Doth God move any thing in the World by any second Cause or not?</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> then not by the <hi>Sun;</hi> not the Coach by the Horses, the Arrow by the Bow, the Stone by the Hand, the Pen by the Writer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If <hi>yea,</hi> then is it the <hi>whole</hi> or <hi>part</hi> only of that motion which is made by second Causes and God by them? If the <hi>whole, habetur quaesitum:</hi> If <hi>part,</hi> how prove you that God cannot make the whole motion himself by <hi>second Causes,</hi> as well as <hi>part,</hi> but must needs leave the other part of the <hi>same motion</hi> to be done without <hi>second Causes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it would follow that <hi>no second Cause,</hi> no not the noblest in the World (as the Sun) and <hi>God as acting by it,</hi> hath and exerciseth à <hi>vis ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quata</hi> to the smallest motion even of a Leaf: Whereas God in Nature maketh natural <hi>Power,</hi> with his own, as he is <hi>fons naturae,</hi> adequate to its Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59334:65"/>And let unbyassed Reason judge, Whether if a Rock should be held up in the Air, if God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>inue the <hi>natural Gravity</hi> of it, with all the rest of the frame of Nature, <hi>could</hi> not that Rock fall, without another motion of God which is without any second Cause, to thrust it down? If He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the nature of <hi>Fire,</hi> was it not a greater Miracle, that it burnt not the three Witnesses, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. than to have burnt them, or than its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Action? Why else should there need ten thousand fold more <hi>natural Power</hi> to hold up the said Rock, or to quench a City on fire, or to stop a River, or the Winds; than to move them sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing natural Causes, if there need an <hi>Infinite Power</hi> moreover to the <hi>act,</hi> and none to the <hi>ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation?</hi> And by this Rule it would follow, that all Motion in the World is supernatural: For if God cause it <hi>ut sons naturae,</hi> he causeth it in the natural course: if he do not, it's all supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and miraculous.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if all this satisfie not Disputes, if it be worth the Cost, they may try the Case thus: Supposing that God hath told no man his Secrets, when he will <hi>immediately</hi> move any thing <hi>without second Causes,</hi> and that no second Causes, nor his own Operation by them can move any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>another immediate Motion,</hi> Let them cut down the Pillars, or undermine their Houses, and say that by meer natural Causes the House cannot fall: Let them set fire on their Houses, and say that by meer natural Causes they cannot be burnt: Let them drink Poison, and say, By meer natural Causes it cannot hurt us: Or let them cut their Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For God never told them,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59334:66"/>
that he will <hi>immediately concurr,</hi> and then there is no danger.</p>
            <p>Perhaps they will say, That Experience telleth us that God doth usually concurr with them: I answer, And is not that because he worketh by them? What Experience or Reason have you, that God should <hi>still</hi> work <hi>immediately with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them,</hi> and yet <hi>not by them?</hi> We can prove that He worketh as the <hi>first Cause.</hi> But if you will prove that He doth it not as the <hi>first Cause</hi> moving the <hi>second Causes,</hi> but by <hi>immediate concomitancy,</hi> let us hear your proofs.</p>
            <p>Lastly, let it be noted, that when they that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm all Motion to be by immediate concomitant Concourse or Predetermination, do pretend that they do it lest God's Causality should be denied or extenuated, it is a meer deceit: For all are agreed, that there is no <hi>less of God</hi> in the Operations done by <hi>second Causes</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> than in <hi>immediate</hi> Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations without second Causes (such as God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth on the first created <hi>Motor,</hi> and how else he please) God is as much in one as in the other.</p>
            <p>§. 14. For the understanding of the nature and use of miraculous acts of Providence, it must be considered, 1. That God that made the World of Natural Agents, and things Passive, moved by the Active, is not to be feigned without good proofs, to alter any of the Works which he hath made, which we see he continueth in the course that he made them without any mutation of their Natures.</p>
            <p>§. 15. God can change, and cross, and use as he pleaseth the Actions of Natural Agents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing their natures and inclinations. One

               </gap>n most Miracles to say that God doth more than this.</p>
            <p>§. 16. But it is certain that God hath a rank of free Agents that act arbitrarily, and that these have a great measure of power over na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and necessary Motions: As man is a free Agent and driveth his Sheep to what Pasture he pleaseth, and guideth his Horses and Oxen in their way and furrow to do his will by their natural and sensitive necessitated motion, and as a <hi>Miller</hi> can make the natural course of the Wood and Water and Mill-stones, and Horse, all to serve his intention, without changing the nature of any one of them, so much more can God and free Agents under God, attain their freely chosen ends, by Ordering and not Changing Natural and Sensitive Movers.</p>
            <p>§. 17. We so little know what Arbitrary Free Agents that are invisible Spirits God hath set over this Passive World, and what power he hath given them to use Natural Agents as they themselves freely will, that it greatly disableth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59334:67"/>
us to resolve all the Difficulties of the Cause of Sin and Misery, and about the nature of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. But it is a clear truth that it is by such Free <hi>Arbitrary Agents</hi> primarily that natural Agency is crost and overcome in Miracles, the one <hi>Natural Agent</hi> be employed to resist another, (as to quench the heat of Fire, to stop the course of Winds and Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Yet it is some voluntary <hi>free Agent</hi> that thus useth <hi>natural Agents</hi> against each other. Scripture tells us, that God useth Angels as Rulers and Protectors of lower Agents: And that there is a kind of a war between these and Devils: And how far the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Wills of good and bad Angels or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Agents may be the Cause of Evil, or be the Actors of Miracles, by setting one moved Agent against another, and yet all but Natural motion that is caused by these free Agents, Mortals do not know; and therefore should not be peremptory in judging.</p>
            <p>§. 18. But though we know not that in Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles God useth not second Causes, some natural and some free in waies unsearchable to us, yet may we be assured by Miracles of his will and attestation: when we find that things are done quite out of the way of his ordinary Providence in the uncontrouled confirmation of some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Revelation: For God is the Governour of the rational World; and his moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be by the intelligible signification of his will <hi>de debito, what shall be due from us,</hi> and <hi>to us:</hi> And if Miracles be used to deceive us, they cannot be done without him, whatever second Cause there be: And if he should use them (tho' by second Causes) to deceive us, we are utterly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59334:67"/>
remediless, and therefore guiltless. And God that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>de it part of his Image, on Man, and needful to Mens Justice to each other to hate Lying.</p>
            <p>§. 19. A Miracle controuled by contrary Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is no notification of God's Attestation: It may be permitted for several good ends: For God by controuling it giveth us sufficient reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against Deceit. And there are two waies by which a Miracle may be controuled: First, by greater conquering Miracles used for some contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrine or Cause; so the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's Miracles were controuled by <hi>Moses.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when it is some unquestionable Truth or Duty or Word, that is already better proved, which that Miracle pretendeth to contradict. As if a Miracle were done by a Deceiver, to prove that there is no God, no Life-to-come, or against Mercy or Justice, or to disprove Christianity; the greater Miracles which have confirmed the Gospel, and the evident Light of Nature, which proveth the Deity and Life-to-come, and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Love and Justice, do controul such deceiving Miracles. (Therefore a Servant of Christ may most comfortably suffer Martyrdome for his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Deity, Christianity, the Life-to-come, or Charity and Justice against Malice and Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Cruelty, which even a Miracle would not justifie; more than for a disputable Opinion.)</p>
            <p>§. 20. It's a great Question, How a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet might be known antecedently, before his Prophecy was fulfilled. And it's of great moment to consider, the difference between a Legislative Prophet, and a meer particular Message. <hi>Moses</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59334:68"/>
and CHRIST, the Legislators, confirmed their Laws and Word by multitudes of uncontrouled Miracles: For Life and Death lay upon mens Obedience or Disobedience to them: And if a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did reprove any Sin against that Law, the Miracles that confirmed the Law did justifie them. But if it were but a Prophecy about some other temporal Event (as <hi>Ieremy</hi>'s of the Captivity) it needed no Miracle; for it was but a temporal Suffering that followed the not believing them.</p>

            <p>§. 1. HOw certainly the Doctrine of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of immediate, efficient, physical, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determining Premotion, doth make God the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cause of all Sin, I have so oft shewed, and so fully proved, that I shall here be very short upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>§. 2. To say, that God is the principal deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Cause of every sinful act with all its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Circumstances (called the <hi>materiale peccati</hi>) and also the Cause of the Law that forbiddeth it, and the Person that committeth it, is to make him
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59334:68"/>
the chief Cause of Sin, as far as it is capable of a Cause, even of the formal Cause.</p>
            <p>§. 3. To say, That such a Cause is the Cause on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Act,</hi> but not of the <hi>Obliquity,</hi> is absurd; because the obliquity is a <hi>Relation</hi> necessarily resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Law and Act with all its <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>circumstances:</hi> And the obliquity can have no other Cause.</p>
            <p>§. 4. To say, That God willeth and loveth and causeth Sin, not as Sin, but for <hi>good ends</hi> and <hi>uses,</hi> is, to say no more for God than may be said for wicked men, if not for Devils; save only that God's Ends are better than theirs.</p>
            <p>§. 5. To say, That God willeth not Sin, but the <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Futurity</hi> of Sin, is but as aforesaid, to say, that He <hi>wills</hi> not Sin <hi>as Sin,</hi> or <hi>sub ratione <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>§. 6. They that say, That God willeth the <hi>Existence of Sin,</hi> as it is <hi>summe conducibile,</hi> to the Glory of his Justice and Mercy, (yea, and that <hi>per se,</hi> and not only <hi>per accidens</hi>) do wrong the Glory of God's Holiness and Wisdom.

God's Church doth commonly abhorr, excepting some few singular presumers.</p>
            <p>§. 8. They that hold, That God doth by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate physical efficient predetermining Premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion principally and unresistibly cause every sinful act, with all its modes and circumstances, do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deny all certainty of Faith, and so subvert all Christianity: For the formal Object of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, is <hi>God's Veracity,</hi> (that God cannot lye) if God could lye, our Belief could have no certainty: Now God speaketh to us, but by <hi>inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red men,</hi> and not by an <hi>essential voice</hi> of his own: And if God cause, as aforesaid, all the Lyes that ever were spoken by Men or Devils in the World, then no man can be sure that he doth not so by Prophets and Apostles, or that ever they say true: And God's <hi>Veracity</hi> then is gone.</p>
            <p>§. 9. They that think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o evade this Evidence by the difference of <hi>Predetermination</hi> and <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and say God <hi>inspireth</hi> no Lyes though he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine</hi> all by <hi>physical Premotion,</hi> do labour in vain: For, 1. No man can ever prove that any Inspiration doth interest God more in the Act or Lye, than physical Predetermination doth: For how can God be more the Author of any Act than by effectual premoving the Creature to act it, and that by immediate physical Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What doth Inspiration do, but so move the <hi>Mind, Will</hi> and <hi>Tongue</hi> of a Prophet? No man can name more that Man is capable of. 2. But if there were a difference, we are not capable of understanding that difference so well, as to prove that God can cause all the Lyes in the World by <hi>predetermining Premotion,</hi> and yet can cause none
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59334:70"/>
by <hi>Inspiration;</hi> shall none believe him that know not this difference? 3. And were it <hi>intelligible,</hi> it would be only to <hi>inspired men</hi> themselves. So that I am past doubt that we must part with all <hi>Certainty of Christianity,</hi> and of all <hi>Divine Belief,</hi> if we receive this Doctrine of Predetermination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>objectum formals fidei</hi> is then gone.</p>
            <p>§. 10. They that say, that if we make not God the Predeterminer to every act <hi>in specie morali,</hi> and in every <hi>comparative respect</hi> and mode, we shall make Man a <hi>God,</hi> by making him a <hi>Causa prima,</hi> do thereby as much conclude God to be the first and principal predetermining efficient Cause of every wicked <hi>Habit</hi> (as of <hi>Malignity,</hi> or <hi>Hatred of God, &amp;c.</hi>) because a <hi>Habit</hi> hath as much <hi>Entity</hi> as an Act: Therefore if it deifie Man, to make him the first Cause, <hi>e. g.</hi> of a <hi>Lye</hi> or <hi>Murder, in specie,</hi> then so it will do to make him the first Cause of the <hi>Habit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. If it be as impossible for Man to do any thing but what he doth, or not to do all that he doth without God's foresaid predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Premotion, as it is to be <hi>Gods,</hi> or to overcome <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>make a World,</hi> then if Men are counted Sinners, and condemned, it is for not doing such impossibilities, for not doing what God alone can do, or for not overcoming Almighty premoving Power.</p>
            <p>§. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t cannot rationally be expected, that they that believe that God is the chief <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Willer</hi> of all Sin, should think it <hi>very bad,</hi> or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>bad for it;</hi> or that when God hath unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibly made all men to sin, he yet hateth it, and sent his Son into the World to testifie his Hatred by dying for it; and that he is serious in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59334:71"/>
all that he saith against it in his word: nor that <hi>such men</hi> should hate it, and rather <hi>die than sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 13. Therefore as the Church of God hath ever abhorred to make God the Cause of Sin, and kept up the sence of the Evil of Sin, (for our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of it, and departing from it, and our Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation) as a necessary part of our Religion, so must we resolutely do still; or else we shall be worse than the Light of Nature teacheth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themselves to be.</p>
            <p>§. 14. God hath many waies to cause the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Sin,</hi> without causing the <hi>Sin it self;</hi> as by impediments to other waies, by altering Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, Objects, Concauses, and many others, which I have elsewhere enumerated: He can <hi>will</hi> and <hi>procure,</hi> that Christ shall die by the sinful malice and action of the <hi>Iews,</hi> without willing or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their malice, will or action as bad: As he can procure a man to be in the way where a Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer cometh with a disposition to murder, and can direct the Bullet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 15. When one and the same word doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie both the <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Effect</hi> of the Sin, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioneth the error of men that cannot distinguish: And so if the Scripture should say, That God is the Cause of it, they think it includeth the Sin with the Effect. So <hi>Murder</hi> signifieth both the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>action</hi> of the Murderer, and the <hi>death of the man</hi> murdered as the <hi>effect: Absolom</hi>'s Constuprations signifieth both his <hi>sinful will</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> and the <hi>effect of both:</hi> The revolt of the <hi>Israelites</hi> from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam;</hi> the giving up of Kingdoms to the Beast, and many such-like, in Scripture are ascribed to God as the Cause, not as the words signifie the <hi>sinful will</hi> and <hi>action</hi> of the Malefactor, but only
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59334:71"/>
the <hi>produced effect</hi> of both (saving when God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission only is understood.)</p>
            <p>§. 16. They that deride it as absurd, that God should decree, will and cause the Effect, and not the Wills forbidden Act, are too bold with God, in measuring his Counsels and Actions by the rule of their vain Imaginations: Yet many give us, instead of Scripture and Reason, but such a confident derision, and say, [<hi>How absurd is it to say that God willed, decreed and caused that Christ should be murdered, and yet willed, decreed or caused not that any should murder him? That God should will and cause</hi> David's <hi>Concubines to be defiled, and not will or cause that</hi> Absolom <hi>should defile them? That He should will and cause the Kingdom to be rent from</hi> Rehoboam, <hi>and yet not cause any one to will or do it? &amp;c.</hi>] But is all false that is not agreeable to their imagination? Or is this a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing way of reasoning? It is not from <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> but <hi>perfection</hi> that God doth <hi>not will</hi> or <hi>cause</hi> mens Sin: But it is from his <hi>perfection</hi> that he <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth</hi> the <hi>effect,</hi> as being the Lord and Ruler of the World. <hi>Sin</hi> is not a <hi>capable Object</hi> of God's Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an <hi>effect</hi> which he can <hi>cause:</hi> But the <hi>effect</hi> is, God cannot love or cause <hi>Iuda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </hi>'s <hi>will</hi> or <hi>act</hi> (<hi>in specie</hi>) of betraying Christ, nor the <hi>Iews</hi> will or act in murdering him: But God can <hi>will</hi> and <hi>cause,</hi> that Christ shall be betrayed and killed, by such individual persons as he foreknew were by their wickedness disposed thereunto.</p>
            <p>§. 17. All good men have so deep a hatred of Sin, and zeal for God's Holiness, and confess, that Sin is of the Devil, and it is his special cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to be the Author of it, that when zeal against an Adversary in Disputation can yet make
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59334:72"/>
many put that character on God (yea, as the prime Efficient, which is more than a Tempter) and this as a part of the Honour of his Providence, and think they serve God and his Truth, by bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reviling the contrary-minded, it is a dreadful instance how far Faction and Contentious Zeal may carry men. And yet when we see how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully many avoid Sin when they have thus honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it as God's work, it is a notable instance how far good men may err in notions, and yet practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally hold the contrary truth, and what great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Errors must be pardoned to each other, as they are pardoned of God.</p>
            <p>§. 18. God <hi>punisheth Sin with Sin,</hi> without <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that Sin</hi> at all; that is, 1. He justly <hi>demeth his Grace</hi> to the rejecters of it, and their <hi>Sin</hi> is the consequent of that <hi>Privation,</hi> as a drunken man's wandering is to ones denying to lead him: 2. <hi>God</hi> maketh it a <hi>punishment</hi> when <hi>man</hi> hath first made <hi>it a Sin.</hi> [<hi>q. d. If thou wilt commit such a Sin, it shall have this penal nature and effect.</hi>] As if in the Law of Nature God decreed, that <hi>excess of Drink</hi> or <hi>Meat</hi> should breed Sickness, that taking a sweet Poison should torment you, that <hi>Venery</hi> should bring the Pox, that Prodigality shall impoverish men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here Man first maketh it a Sin, and then God maketh it a Punishment: And Sin it self being the deformity and misery of the Soul, hath two relations at once (in time); the first in order of Nature is the <hi>sinfulness,</hi> caused by Man; and the second the <hi>penal relation</hi> caused by God; whose Act indeed was antecedent in his <hi>Law</hi> (of <hi>Nature</hi>), ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Nature such, that it should <hi>so suffer</hi> if it will so do); and yet the <hi>Effect</hi> is consequent to mans Act.</p>

            <p>§. 1. THE Glory of God on his Works is their expression of his Perfections, by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of them which he hath made. And He hath communicated Being and Substantiality as the <hi>substratum,</hi> and therein the Virtues of <hi>Vital Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> (or Love): and these are his Image upon Man.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The more <hi>Power</hi> therefore a Creature hath, the more he glorifieth the <hi>Power of God:</hi> And the most <hi>powerful</hi> Creatures (as the Sun) do more shew forth his <hi>greatness</hi> than the most <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</hi> Therefore to deny or extenuate any <hi>Power</hi> given of God, is to dishonour him in his works: So absurd is it to think that the <hi>Power</hi> ascribed to Man, is <hi>dishonourable</hi> to God; as if you took from the Workman all the Praise that you give to his Works.</p>
            <p>§. 3. All <hi>Man's Power</hi> is <hi>passive from GOD</hi> and <hi>superiour Causes,</hi> but it is naturally <hi>active</hi> as to things inferiour, and in it self.</p>
            <p>§. 4. God endued man at first with a threefold Power, 1. <hi>Natural,</hi> 2. <hi>Moral,</hi> 3. <hi>Political,</hi> which is a Ruling Power over Inferiours.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Man's Power was partly <hi>essential</hi> or <hi>inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,</hi> and partly <hi>accidental</hi> or <hi>separable.</hi> 1. To have the three Powers or Faculties of <hi>Vital Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Intellection</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> is <hi>essential,</hi> and Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

be a Man without them: But to have these in <hi>promptitude</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> is but as <hi>health</hi> or <hi>strength</hi> to the Body; a separable thing. 2. To have some <hi>moral Power</hi> to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> some moral Good, it seemeth is inseparable from Man <hi>in via;</hi> for all men naturally have some <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae communes,</hi> and differencing sense of <hi>moral Good</hi> and <hi>Evil:</hi> Else men should be as bad as Devils: But to be truly <hi>Holy</hi> was separable (as Health) and so was lost. 3. To have some superiority over Brutes, and Parents over their Children, it seems is inseparable, or is not separated; for it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in Nature: But the true <hi>Majesty</hi> of this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority was lost by Sin.</p>
            <p>§. 6. No Creature hath any Power but what is totally derived from God and dependent on him, and still upheld by him and used under him.</p>
            <p>§. 7. Though some would have more Power ascribed to <hi>Nature,</hi> and others appropriate more to <hi>Grace,</hi> yet in this it is no Controversie, How much is to be ascribed to God: For both <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and the Powers of both are totally from God: But all the question is, Which way God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it to man.</p>
            <p>§. 8. In general we should be most cautious, 1. That we disparage not any Power or Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is <hi>God's own Work,</hi> whether natural or gracious. 2. That we give not <hi>too much</hi> to any Work that is proper to <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. <hi>Natural Power,</hi> of <hi>Vital Action, Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition,</hi> is supposed by God as Lawgiver in his Subjects; that is, that we are Men.</p>
            <p>§. 10. Every act of Knowledge, Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Love and Obedience is done by our <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Powers</hi> or Faculties, and none without them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59334:73"/>§. 11. The word [<hi>Moral Power</hi>] signifieth, 1. Sometimes a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>moral actions,</hi> (and so <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power</hi> in Man is also <hi>moral</hi> in some degree.) 2. Sometimes a <hi>Holy Disposition,</hi> especially in the <hi>Will,</hi> to such holy <hi>moral actions;</hi> which is the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our natural Powers, or the <hi>Health</hi> of them in a saving degree or sort, and is the Gift of Grace, since Sin departed. 3. Most frequently I use the words for such a degree of God's helping or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Influx or Grace, as is short of a Habit for promptitude and facility, but yet puts the soul in such a disposition, by which Man can do the Act, (and it may come to pass without more Grace whether it do or not) which the Dominicans call <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> and I rather call <hi>Necessary Grace.</hi> 4. Sometimes it is meant (as <hi>causa moralis</hi>) for that which is <hi>Power Reputatively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 12. <hi>Power</hi> hath several <hi>degrees:</hi> some can act <hi>easily,</hi> yea, is hardly restrained: some can act with <hi>difficulty,</hi> yet <hi>constantly:</hi> some <hi>difficultly</hi> and very <hi>rarely:</hi> some <hi>can act,</hi> but the Impediments are so great, and its weakness such, as that it never <hi>will do</hi> what it can: And these we call a <hi>moral Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> as being <hi>reputative impotency,</hi> in these three last degrees.</p>
            <p>§. 13. <hi>Sin</hi> hath <hi>debilituted</hi> Man's <hi>very natural Vivacity</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> to things <hi>spiritual,</hi> and also <hi>darkened</hi> and <hi>undisposed</hi> his <hi>Understanding</hi> to them; but especially <hi>dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59334:74"/>§. 14. <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>Power</hi> to have stood when he fell: God took no power from him, nor let out such a Temptation as he could not resist: But Sin entered at <hi>his Will,</hi> and corrupted it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lost his <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 15. There is therefore <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>§. 16. And there was such a <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Will,</hi> by which he could have <hi>willed</hi> what he did not <hi>

                  </gap>ill,</hi> and by which he could have rejected the Temptation: And this without any other Grace, than that which he then had, and used not.</p>
            <p>§. 17. Otherwise all the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> and the World would be resolved into the necessitating Will and Work of God, and so all Faith would be subverted.</p>
            <p>§. 18. Therefore <hi>Man's Will</hi> was such a Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as could be a <hi>causa prima,</hi> of the <hi>moral modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> or specification of its own Acts: (Not a <hi>causa prima simpliciter,</hi> but thus, <hi>secundum quid.</hi>) For else God must be the <hi>causa prima</hi> of Sin, which is the ill modification of that Act.</p>
            <p>§. 19. I know that to Nature the Reasonings of our late Infidels, to prove, That every Act of the Will is as truly necessitated as the motions of a Clock, do seem plansible and hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That <hi>God is able</hi> to make a <hi>self-determining Power,</hi> that <hi>can</hi> thus do: For it is no contradiction. 2. That it is <hi>congruous,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

And <hi>Experience</hi> perswadeth us <hi>de facto,</hi> that so <hi>it is.</hi> 4. And they that deny it, must unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably make God the <hi>prime Cause of all Sin,</hi> in a higher degree than it is or can be ascribed to Satan: And is all this with the rejection of Christianity more eligible, than the Concession that <hi>God can</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> make a Creature with such <hi>self-determining Free-will,</hi> as can, as a first Cause of<note place="margin">Of the divers sorts of <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Will,</hi> and the fuller opening them, see my <hi>Methodus Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiae,</hi> and <hi>Cath.

            <p>§. 1. BY one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and so Death passed upon all in that all have sinned.</p>
            <p>§. 2. We were not in <hi>Adam</hi> distinct Persons really; for our Persons then existed not; and therefore did not inexist.</p>
            <p>§. 3. God doth not repute us to have been what we were not; for he judgeth truly, and is not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: Therefore he judged not <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to have been those Persons in <hi>Adam</hi> then, nor <hi>Adam</hi>'s person the same with theirs.</p>
            <p>§. 4. Therefore we were not then when he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned persons guilty in <hi>Adam;</hi> for <hi>Non existentis non sunt accidentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. We were <hi>Seminally</hi> or <hi>Virtually</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> when he sinned: Which is but that he had that <hi>Virtus generativa</hi> from which we naturally sprang in time; But to be <hi>Virtually</hi> in him, is <hi>Not to be personally in him,</hi> but <hi>Potentially,</hi> it being as to <hi>Existence termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus diminuens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 6. As soon as we <hi>were Persons,</hi> we were <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons derived by Generation</hi> from <hi>Adam:</hi> Therefore with our Persons we derived <hi>Guilt and Pravity:</hi> For he could beget no better than himself.</p>
            <p>§. 7. When <hi>Adam</hi> sinned his <hi>whole Person</hi> was guilty and no part innocent: Therefore his very <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men prolificum</hi> had its part in the guilt according to its Capacity; And though it was not a <hi>guilty</hi>

               <hi>Person,</hi> it was a part of a guilty Person; and a part that was the <hi>Semen personae;</hi> so that when that <hi>Semen</hi> became a <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 8. God doth not impute <hi>Adam</hi>'s<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth this.</note> Sin to us because <hi>he will do it,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any real participation of ours; no nor <hi>beyond</hi> our true natural parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation, but <hi>according</hi> to it: Otherwise <hi>God</hi> should have <hi>made us sinners,</hi> meerly because he <hi>

                  </gap>ould do so,</hi> and not <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. We receive our Original Guilt and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity immediately from our next Parents, and but remotely from <hi>Adam:</hi> It could never have come to us but through them from whom we receive our Nature, from them we receive the guilt and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our Nature.</p>
            <p>§. 10. Therefore thus far at least our next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents communicate Guilt and Pravity to us, and not <hi>Adam</hi> only: In which we see that God's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation goeth along with real Natural Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>§. 11. It seemeth to me a strange oversight in too many Divines who deny (or observe not) our Guilt of all the rest of our Parents</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Of this I have publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which proveth it.</note> Sins, while we were in their Loins, as well as of <hi>Adam</hi>'s; seeing 1. there is that same reason of both, save what the change of the Covenant maketh (of which after.) And, 2. Scripture is so full and express about it.</p>
            <p>§. 12. 1st, If I have a guilty and deprayed Soul from my Parents, it is because I was once in them,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59334:76"/>
Virtually or Seminally as truly and naturally as I was in <hi>Adam:</hi> And had not the Guilt been theirs it had never been mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e: And if it be mine because it was theirs, why not one part of theirs as well as another?</p>
            <p>§. 13. It will be said, Because God so Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with <hi>Adam</hi> that he should stand or fall for himself and his Posterity: I Answer, That there was any such Covenant that if he stood his Posterity should all stand, or be Confirmed and Saved, is more than ever I found in Scripture or can prove, or do believe: But that it would have been to the <hi>benefit</hi> of his Posterity I doubt not. And that his fall was to the Guilt and Corruption of his Posterity I doubt not; but (as I said) not without and beyond their natural Interest in him, and Derivation from him as the reason of it: And we were as much naturally in our next Parents: And the Covenant of Innocency and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace do not so far differ as to exempt us from the Guilt of our next Parents sins: For the difference lieth not in this, That the first only made Death the due reward of all Sin, nor that the first did interest Children in the Guilt of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents sin: But in this, that the first made us Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without a Remedy; But the second giveth us a Remedy presently for Pardon and Recovery, and so our Guilt is not so full, because it is but a half Obligation having the Pardon annexed. The first Law said, [<hi>If thou sin thou shalt be</hi> filius mortis, <hi>and so shall those that are Propagated of thee.</hi>] The second Covenant saith, [<hi>For thy Original and Actual Sin death is thy due, but I give thee a Pardon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying Grace procured by the Righteousness of Christ.</hi>] But note, That this Covenant pardoneth our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59334:76"/>
Sin as from <hi>Adam;</hi> And yet it followeth not that we had none because it is pardoned: Even so it pardoneth our guilt of our next Parents sins, and therefore we had it to be pardoned: Both are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable to us; therefore we had both.</p>
            <p>§. 14. 2. And the Scripture is more copious, and as plain in making punishment due to Children for their <hi>next Parents</hi> sins, as for <hi>Adam</hi>'s, though <hi>Adam</hi>'s only was the Original of all Sin and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I have elsewhere proved it at large: The Case of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Posterity, and <hi>Cham</hi>'s, and <hi>Ishmael</hi>'s, and <hi>Esau</hi>'s, and <hi>Achan</hi>'s Family, and <hi>Ahab</hi>'s, and many more do fully prove it: And more fully the Second Commandment, and God's declaration of his Name to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 34. and many a Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Seed of the Wicked, and Christ's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 36. so that Scripture puts us out of doubt.</p>
            <p>§. 15. The common Objection is, that their [<hi>Guilt would be greater on us towards the End of the World, than on them at the Beginning, because all our Ancestours Guilt would be ours:</hi> But I answer, 1. If it were so, it would be but <hi>many Obligations</hi> to the <hi>same Punishment,</hi> when it amounteth to that which God seeth our Nature capable of: For a Finite Worm is not capable of more Suffering than is proportioned to his Nature. 2. And this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vainly supposeth, that none of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours Sins were pardoned: Whereas all are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to the Faithful and their Seed, and much Temporal Punishment is pardoned to many of the Unsanctified: And God himself by limiting it to the third and fourth Generation, seemeth to set bounds to his own Justice. 3. And the Guilt of our Parents Sins being of a more Diminute Nature

than that of our <hi>own Actual Sin (Coeteris paribus)</hi> it falleth not so fully on us, as it did on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters themselves, nor as our own do. 4. And God <hi>offereth</hi> us the full pardon of our own and all together: And as long as the Law which tells us of our desert of punishment, doth also give us a free pardon, we have no Cause to complain.</p>
            <p>§. 16. That we have all Original Sin is proved, in that else Infants should be saved without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Saviour, or a cleansing Sanctifier; which cannot be.</p>
            <p>§. 17. He that seeth the universal inclination of Mankind to Evil even in their Childhood, and their backwardness to Good, even that Evil and that Good which Nature it self assureth us are such, must needs believe Original Pravity, or else think hardly of God's Work.</p>
            <p>§. 18. He that seeth still that Drunkenness, Gluttony, Lust, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do vitiate both the Soul and Bodily Temperament of the Sinner, and how frequently a diseased, distempered Body, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Men to particular Vices, and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily vitiated Soul, is in their Children the plain fruit of the Parents Sin, may the easilier believe that we drew down Pravity from <hi>Adam</hi> also, when we derive so much from nearest Parents.</p>
            <p>§. 19. And they that consider, that Mans Soul being made Holy, for God, this unholiness is not only a <hi>Negation</hi> but a <hi>Privation,</hi> not of <hi>Sensitive</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> only, but of <hi>Moral</hi> Rectitude, will not deny but that the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Moral Pravity</hi> belongeth to it.</p>
            <p>§. 20. And they that consider, that Parents Cause not Children as an Artificer maketh an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, but by <hi>Generation,</hi> which is a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59334:78"/>
of their own Essence, and what Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest Parents and Children have in each other, and that it is real Sin that is in both, and that the Moral Privation in its Nature, containeth much of Mans misery, will easily grant that it is both a Sin and Punishment, and a Moral Cause of further punishment, properly enough so called.</p>
            <p>§. 21. They that lay that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their denying Original Sin,<note place="margin">Mr. W. <hi>Fenner</hi> put his Opinion for the Traduction of Souls, into his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismes: But the Publisher left that out.</note> upon the difficulty of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether Souls are new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Derived from Parents, do too little suspect their frail under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 2. But God would not have this <hi>Recovery</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> to be <hi>perfect</hi> at the <hi>first;</hi> but gave Man a certain proportion of Common Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Mercy, binding him to a Course of Duty, in the performance of which he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more by degrees till he were perfected.

            <p>§. 3. Therefore God did enter into Judgment with fallen Man, and did sentence him absolutely to some degree of Punishment, even to Labour, Pain, the penalty of the Cursed Earth, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to Death; which Temporal Punishment God would not remit, nor give him a Saviour to procure the pardon of it; but only to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to turn all this unto their Benefit, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the greater everlasting Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

            <p>§. 5. Some thinking it hard, that for 4000 Years the World should have no <hi>Existent Mediator,</hi> and that an <hi>Existent Faith</hi> in the <hi>future Mediator,</hi> should be more necessary than an <hi>Existent Mediator</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59334:79"/>
and his <hi>Work,</hi> and thinking withal that it would solve many Textual Difficulties objected by the <hi>Arians,</hi> and explain the Appearances of Christ to the Patriarchs, have conceived that Christ hath a <hi>threefold Nature,</hi> viz. The <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> a <hi>created Super-Angelical Nature</hi> to which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature was united before the Incarnation, and the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> assumed at the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that so we had an <hi>Existent Mediator</hi> from the time of the Fall. But whatever conveniences this Opinion may seem to have, I find no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory proof of it in Scripture, nor that the Christian Church did ever hold it. And it is overmuch boldness to take up so great a Doctrine as a <hi>third Nature</hi> in Christ, which the Church of Christ was never acquainted with. And the Texts that seem to be for it, are capable of the common Exposition.</p>
            <p>§. 6. If any think that this was the Judgment of abundance, yea, the most of the Antient Writers, before the days of <hi>Arius,</hi> because they have such unhappy expressions of Christ, which the Reader may find truly Collected to his hand by <hi>Petavius de Trinitate,</hi> and that it is fitter to Expound <hi>them</hi> as speaking only of <hi>Christ's second Nature,</hi> than to account them <hi>all Arians,</hi> or to honour the <hi>Arians</hi> by making them <hi>on their side,</hi> I answer, I leave every Man to his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon perusal of the Fathers words, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Charity that hath sufficient ground: But I cannot perceive, that these Writers talk of any more Natures in Christ than two, and pious ends must be served by no Fictions and Untruths: I think that we must rather gather with <hi>Petavius</hi> there that the Votes in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council tell us, that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59334:80"/>
then the <hi>greater part</hi> of the Church were against <hi>Arius,</hi> and therefore they were so before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they held (in so great a point) the Faith which they had received from their Fathers: And that the greater part of Writers, might differ from the greater part of the Church. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, these Writers having more than other men to do with the Heathen Philosophers and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who were prejudiced against the Doctrine of the Trinity, did shun their Offence by too much stretching their speeches to that which they thought they could easilier digest, which gave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his advantages. The Conclusions either way are harsh and sad; but I leave others better to avoid them.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The Deity it self may not unfitly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our REDEEMER before the Incarnation, though not so fitly a MEDIATOR, and though Redemption by Christ's Death and Merits in the Flesh was not then wrought: Because the word <hi>Redeeming</hi> is oft taken for a <hi>merciful Delivering,</hi> though without a price; and also because the <hi>Price</hi> was <hi>promised</hi> from the beginning. But thus the word REDEEMER is equivocal, signifying either the <hi>Deity</hi> as a <hi>promising,</hi> undertaking Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, or the <hi>Mediator</hi> who was promised, and who performed the undertaken means.</p>
            <p>§. 8. The MEDIATOR himself being purely the Gift of the Divine Love and Mercy, it was no inconvenience, that God then had all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that Faith then acknowledged no other existent Saviour, but God himself the infinite Good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59334:80"/>§. 9. It troubleth men much to open, how Christ was any true Cause of our Pardon and Salvation as a Mediator, before his Incarnation? And what his merits, sacrifice and intercession could do, before they did exist? And the common Answer is, That <hi>Moral</hi> (though not <hi>Physical</hi>) Causes may <hi>cause</hi> before they exist, and so ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as foreseen, foredecreed or willed. But these Logical notions must not be used to put off the Question, instead of satisfactorily answering it. This tells us not whether by a <hi>Moral Cause</hi> they mean a <hi>True Cause</hi> of some <hi>moral</hi> Being, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>morally</hi> called a <hi>Cause</hi> which indeed is not so, but <hi>quasi causa:</hi> Nor yet whether they mean a <hi>Cause efficient, final</hi> or <hi>constitutive:</hi> Nor yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they mean a Cause of any thing in God, or only of some following effect.</p>
            <p>§. 10. It must be concluded that Christ's <hi>merits, sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> make no <hi>real Change</hi> in God, his <hi>Understanding</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> and therefore have <hi>no such Causality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. But <hi>God's Promise first,</hi> and <hi>Christ's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice next</hi> make a Change in the state of things, laying that Ground-work or <hi>necessary Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> upon which it becometh <hi>meet, right</hi> and <hi>just</hi> for God to give the rest of his mercy which this is the Condition of, and the true meritorious Cause: And so the Change was neither on <hi>GOD,</hi> nor <hi>immediately on Man,</hi> but <hi>for Man</hi> on the <hi>state of things</hi> which God and man were both concerned in: It is a <hi>causa ordinis,</hi> while that is done first, which is prerequisite to what is to follow: And it is a <hi>causa rei</hi> (<hi>benefici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>) while it not only removeth moral Impediments of our Pardon and Salvation, but also setteth matters in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59334:81"/>
such a state, in which it becometh <hi>congruous, meet, right</hi> and <hi>just</hi> for God to pardon and save us; which is a remote disposing the fall'n sinner to be a <hi>due Recipient</hi> of God's following promised Grace. And thus it is in both senses a <hi>moral Cause,</hi> as it is a Cause of our <hi>Right,</hi> and of <hi>Congruity,</hi> and as it is, though not indeed, yet <hi>morally, reputative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or <hi>Quasi causa physica realis,</hi> of our <hi>Pardon, Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> by making them become just, right and due. And being thus far a <hi>Cause</hi> of the effects <hi>ad extra, per extrinsecam denominationem ex conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione &amp; relatione ad objectum,</hi> it may be called (with cautelous sobriety) a Cause of <hi>God's own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellections and Volitions:</hi> For though in themselves they are God's Essence, yet for God [<hi>to know us to be redeemed</hi> and <hi>to will</hi> our present Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as Redeemed ones,] are words that speak more than God's <hi>Essence</hi> as in it self, and include the termination of his Acts on these Objects as such; and so denominate God's Essence distinctly from the Objects, which else would never be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, nor have but one name; being really but one.</p>
            <p>§. 12. Yet all these diversifying, distinguishing, denominating Causes of God's Intellections, Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Operations, must not (even denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively or relatively) be counted or called <hi>Efficient Causes</hi> of God's Acts, nor <hi>strictly final</hi> but <hi>objective.</hi> And therefore here it must be considered <hi>what Cause an Object is,</hi> which Philosophers are not well agreed in. But I think I may safely say, That as to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts, the Object is to be reduced</hi> to such a <hi>cause materialis</hi> or <hi>constitutiva</hi> as they are capable of, not of the Act as an Act, but as <hi>this act, in specie,</hi> denominated from the receptive terminating mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59334:81"/>
or object. And though to <hi>Man,</hi> to <hi>know this or that,</hi> and to <hi>will this or that ad extra,</hi> seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what really different (or modally at least) from <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>willing our selves</hi> or <hi>some other Object,</hi> yet in God it is not to be called <hi>ex parte sui,</hi> a real or modal difference at all.</p>
            <p>§. 13. Yet I assert not that the <hi>Ratio prima</hi> of all these <hi>Diversities</hi> of the Divine Acts is <hi>ex ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis seu recipientibus:</hi> For the <hi>first Reason</hi> is in and of God himself: For it is God that <hi>maketh</hi> all <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> of Effects and Changes; and so it is from those divers Effects of his <hi>own Will,</hi> that his <hi>Will</hi> is relatively <hi>ex connotatione termini</hi> diversly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. But that in God which is the <hi>Ratio prima diversitatis,</hi> is not <hi>divers,</hi> but his <hi>one simple essential Will;</hi> so that it is the <hi>diversity of Objects</hi> which is the <hi>immediate Reason</hi> of distinguishing God's acts, (of which before).</p>
            <p>§. 14. These things premised, I come nearer to the Question, if that which <hi>existeth not</hi> do <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause,</hi> it must be either <hi>efficiently, constitutively,</hi> or <hi>finally.</hi> The two first are <hi>denied</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reason of Mankind. That which is not, cannot effect: Nothing can do nothing. And to say <hi>it is not,</hi> is to say, <hi>it constituteth not.</hi> And as it is certain, that <hi>causa finalis non efficit,</hi> yea, is but <hi>causa metaphorice operans,</hi> so it is certain, that no Creature causeth any thing in God, no not finally.</p>
            <p>§. 15. Those that say, That <hi>Christ and his death</hi> and <hi>merits</hi> did not <hi>cause</hi> before <hi>Existence, in esse existenti,</hi> but <hi>in esse cognito,</hi> as constituting the Divine <hi>Idea</hi>'s, 1. Must remember that the <hi>esse cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> as they call it, is no <hi>esse rei cognita</hi> at all; Therefore if only the <hi>esse cognitum</hi> do <hi>cause,</hi> then
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59334:82"/>
it was not <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Merits</hi> that caused. 2. In Man for an <hi>esse cognitum,</hi> to cause his further acts, is but for <hi>one Thought</hi> to <hi>cause another Thought,</hi> or a <hi>Volition</hi> or <hi>Nolition.</hi> And these <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Volitions</hi> are really divers, and constituted by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of intromitted Objects: But God is no <hi>Recipient,</hi> nor knoweth any Object as we do by <hi>intromission;</hi> Nor hath he any such <hi>Thoughts</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Creatures as are really divers <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> but only by extrinsick denomination.</p>
            <p>§. 16. If it be said, That then God should know nothing till <hi>it is,</hi> because a denomination must be from something, and nothing can be no <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>terminus;</hi> and so of his Will. I <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. God doth not know any thing as <hi>existent now,</hi> which doth <hi>not exist now.</hi> But our <hi>Now</hi> is in his <hi>Eternity,</hi> and his <hi>Eternity</hi> without partition comprehendeth all our <hi>Times; prae</hi> and <hi>post, ab</hi> and <hi>ad</hi> are Prepositions of no signification in and of <hi>Eternity;</hi> but only [<hi>In</hi>]. And therefore as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> is but his <hi>Science</hi> so denominated from the Order of Objects, but noteth not any difference in him, who hath neither <hi>prae</hi> nor <hi>post.</hi> How this is to be understood without making the Creature eternally exist, I have elsewhere fully opened.</p>
            <p>§. 17. That plain truth therefore which must here satisfie us is, That God, who is the first efficient and ultimate final Cause of all things, and caused by none, did of his free abundant Mercy undertake the saving of sinful Man, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his Threatning and Man's Defect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to make advantage of our Sin and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the Glory of his Wisdom, Love, Mercy and Justice, he promised that the Eternal Word should in due time assume Man's nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59334:82"/>
do and suffer that which should glorifie him more than Man's Perdition would have done, and which should make it just and meet for him to save the Guilty, both inceptively at the present under the Promise (for 4000 years) and afterward more fully at Christ's Incarnation, and finally to perfect all in Glory.</p>
            <p>So that the Work of our Salvation is one entire frame, composed by Divine Wisdom and Love; where one part is the Reason of another, though none be the Cause of any thing in God: And Christ's Mediation, though coming after 4000 years, yet was then to do that which should make it meet and right and just for God to pardon Sin before: Even as in a Building the several parts may be the reason of each other, because they must be all compaginated and fitted to their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive places and uses: And though the Foundation make not the Superstructure, it upholdeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And as <hi>Aquinas</hi> briefly faith, <hi>Deus non propter hoc vult hoc, sed vult hoc esse propter hoc;</hi> nothing is the Cause of <hi>God's Will,</hi> but it is God's Will that one thing shall be for another: And when all his Work must be one Frame, the part last made may be a reason of the former. And so Christ's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and sacrifice, though after 4000 years, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that for which it became just and meet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for God to pardon Sinners. For though it was not then existent, yet (besides the Decree) the Promise, Prediction and Publication made it useful to its ends, in respect to GOD and Man.</p>
            <p>§. 18. So then, though the <hi>Cause</hi> be not <hi>truly a Cause</hi> till it exist, and though all the Pardon and Salvation given for 4000 years, was before the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59334:83"/>
existence of the merits and sacrifice of Christ, yet the <hi>Promise</hi> and <hi>Notification</hi> of the Mediator and his merits and sacrifice, as the reason of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, did then exist, and was the cause of that Pardon, which Christ was afterward to merit.</p>
            <p>§. 19. It is therefore no absurdity, that the <hi>existence</hi> of <hi>Man's Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> should be <hi>necessary,</hi> when the <hi>Mediator's Existence</hi> and his <hi>Merits was not necessary:</hi> For it was not then an <hi>existent Mediator</hi> (and Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that was the Object of Faith, but only a <hi>Promised Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 20. And whereas it is a doubt, seeing the <hi>Head</hi> is <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> only was <hi>Head</hi> of the Church before the Incarnation, and the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane united</hi> was afterward the Head, whether it follow not the Church before the Incarnation and after (and so Faith and Religion) were divers <hi>in specie,</hi> and not the same? I answer, That while we agree all <hi>de re,</hi> that so much difference there is, it is not worth our trouble to strive about the Name or Logical Notion of [<hi>Sameness</hi> of <hi>Species.</hi>]</p>
            <p>§. 21. When God hath chosen to save Man by way of a Mediator, and by his Sacrifice and Merits, as that way in which his Wisdom, Love, Holiness, Mercy and Justice are eminently glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, it seemeth to me too bold Presumption to dispute, <hi>Whether he could not have saved us otherwise,</hi> and pardoned Sin without a Saviour? as it would be to dispute, <hi>Whether he could not illuminate the Earth without the Sun?</hi> He wanteth not <hi>Power</hi> to do whatsoever is meet for God to do; but all the question is, <hi>Whether it be meet, supposing Man's Nature and Sin to be what they are?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59334:83"/>§. 22. God did illuminate the World without the Sun, till the Sun was made: But it was the <hi>imperfect World,</hi> and before the perfecting of his Work: And so God did save Man without an <hi>Existent Mediator,</hi> (unless God may be called a <hi>Mediator</hi> between himself and us, which is a harsh Phrase). But it was before the Work of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was brought to <hi>maturity;</hi> for the Cure of Man is perfectest at last.</p>
            <p>§. 23. We must take great heed, that in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the parts of our Redemption by Christ, we look not all at <hi>one</hi> and over-look the rest, nor set not those Works of Christ in opposition which must be taken in conjunction: But his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Obedience, Contempt of the World, Victory over Satan, Suffering, Resurrection, Ascension, Glory, Intercession, Reign, Raising the Dead, Judgment, glorifying his Church, must be all conjoined, though not confounded.</p>
            <p>§. 24 The Benefits of Redemption, or recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mercies, are not all given in the same way: We must carefully distinguish of those that God giveth <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>antecedently;</hi> that is, before any <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> on <hi>Man</hi>'s part, and those that he giveth <hi>consequently</hi> upon <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>Duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> as the means of Reception.</p>
            <p>§. 25. <hi>Antecedent</hi> Mercies are some common to all men, and some proper to some Countries, Ages and Persons, as the <hi>free Benefactor</hi> pleaseth.</p>
            <p>§. 26. Of the former sort is the <hi>Sustentation of Nature, reprival</hi> from deserved miseries, the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> as to the tenor, and some degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation, with all the common Mercies, Means, Duties which tend to Recovery. Of the later sort are the <hi>greater degrees</hi> of such mercies and means,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59334:84"/>
which God freely giveth to some more than others.</p>
            <p>§. 27. Therefore we must not say that Infidels or wicked men have no Mercies, or no Right to what they do possess as from God, as being no <hi>Consenters</hi> to the Covenant or Performers of it: Because there are <hi>Antecedent Mercies</hi> given before <hi>such Consent</hi> or Performance; not as to <hi>Covenanters</hi> but as to <hi>miserable men,</hi> invited to enter Covenant with God in Christ. Though these are so forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their refusal, that they have no assurance of their continuance, but God may soon take them all away.</p>
            <p>§. 28. The <hi>consequent</hi> Mercies are <hi>Pardon, Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> a <hi>secured filia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Right to all outward Mercies</hi> that are good and suitable to us, and <hi>final Glory,</hi> and whatever God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised on <hi>Conditions</hi> by us to be performed.</p>
            <p>§. 29. The question of <hi>universal Redemption,</hi> and <hi>special,</hi> I shall pretermit till I speak of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 30. Seeing Life, Health, Food, Hope, and all that is truly good, were forfeited by Sin, and none of them can be due to us by the <hi>Law of Innocency,</hi> it followeth, that wherever they are given, it is upon other terms, which can be no other than those of the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> as fruits of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's Mercy (<hi>antecedently</hi> or <hi>consequently.</hi>) And where the <hi>Fruits</hi> are apparent, we may know the <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 31. The <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> are <hi>one entire frame</hi> consisting of various and unequal parts, to divers persons (yet mutually related:) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not follow, that nothing but what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inferreth the person's <hi>Salvation</hi> is any such effect of Man's Redemption.</p>

            <p>§. 1. THough the order of the matter require, that I should have spoken of the Law of Innocency before I had spoken of Sin and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, yet thinking that the <hi>sort of Readers</hi> for whom I now especially write, will best understand things, if I treat of all <hi>God's Laws</hi> together, I will at this time fetch my method from their intended benefit.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The nature of a <hi>Law in general,</hi> and of <hi>God's Laws</hi> in special, I have elsewhere so oft and largely spoken of (pretending somewhat to clear up that Doctrine from several mistakes) that I must here pretermit it.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Though the word [<hi>Law</hi>] do principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifie the regulating Imposition of our Duty, and the word <hi>Covenant</hi> doth principally signifie a <hi>mutual Contract;</hi> yet it is the same <hi>Divine Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is meant oft and usually in Scripture, by both these Names: (Of which see <hi>Grotius</hi> at large in his Preface to his Annotations <hi>in Nov. Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi>) It is called a <hi>Law</hi> in one respect, and a <hi>Covenant</hi> in another, but the thing is the same.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Law,</hi> the parts of it are, 1. The <hi>Precept</hi> (and <hi>Prohibition</hi>) constituting our <hi>Duty.</hi> 2. The <hi>Retribution, Premiant and Penal</hi> constituting the <hi>Dueness</hi> of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> as the duty is performed or neglected.</p>

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59334:85"/>As it is a <hi>Covenant</hi> it containeth, 1.

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Of the Law or Covenant of Innocency made to <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>§. 1. I Shall in this order Treat briefly of the Divine Laws. I. Of the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to <hi>Adam.</hi> II. Of the Law of <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to Christ. III. Of the Law of Grace to fallen Man. And there, 1. As in the first Edition to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah:</hi> 2. As in the same Edition joined with the Jewish Law of <hi>Peculiarily</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of Works by <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed. 3. Of the Law of Graces as in the second Edition by Christ:</p>
               <p>§. 2. 1. The <hi>Law of Innocency</hi> contained a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> and <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and a <hi>Retributive part</hi> to which <hi>Adam</hi> was bound to be a <hi>Voluntary Subject,</hi> and therefore to <hi>Consent</hi> (which will allow it the name of a <hi>Covenant.</hi>) But here the brief Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Scripture calleth to us to distinguish of <hi>things certain,</hi> and things <hi>uncertain</hi> (whoever as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them.)</p>
               <p>§. 3. 1. The <hi>Preceptive part</hi> was revealed by <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Supernaturally</hi> (by <hi>Voice,</hi> or <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Vision,</hi> &amp;c.) The former being <hi>Lex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura integrae,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Intire Nature,</hi> though the <hi>Chief</hi> is least spoken of in <hi>Gen.</hi> because it is supposed legible in Nature it self.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> properly so called, is <hi>in esse Objectivo,</hi> that <hi>signification</hi> of <hi>God's Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Man's Duty,</hi> which was discernible in the <hi>Universa rerum Natura</hi> in all God's Works; but principally in <hi>Mans own Nature,</hi> as related to <hi>God</hi> and all <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> about him.</p>

                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59334:88"/>§. 5. But <hi>Improperly</hi> or <hi>Metonymically</hi> so called, the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>in esse subjectivo</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes notitiae,</hi> which Man had and was to have from the said <hi>Objective</hi> Law of Nature. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly this is rather the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> than the <hi>Law it self,</hi> being not <hi>perfect</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> himself at <hi>first,</hi> but was to be <hi>perfected</hi> as he came to <hi>know more</hi> and more of the Works of God, and varying much now in several Persons. Yet may it well be called <hi>God's Law written in the Heart,</hi> when we have the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of his primary proper Law.</p>
               <p>§. 6. This Law of <hi>Nature</hi> bound <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Devotedness to God</hi> as his <hi>Owner,</hi> and perfect <hi>gratitude</hi> to God as his <hi>Antecedent Benefactor,</hi> and to perfect <hi>Obedience</hi> to God as his <hi>Ruler,</hi> and to perfect <hi>Love to God</hi> as his <hi>ultimate most amiable End.</hi> And this perfect <hi>Obedience</hi> was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.</p>
               <p>§. 7. It was <hi>Adam personally</hi> that the Law bound to this perfect <hi>perpetual Obedience,</hi> and not <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him,</hi> or that he should obey by a <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or a <hi>Delegate,</hi> a <hi>Servant,</hi> or by any other.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Nature, even in its depraved state, now telleth us, that <hi>all Sin</hi> against God <hi>deserveth Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> had a <hi>Penal part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. It is a great doubt with many Divines whether the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> had any <hi>premiant part</hi> or <hi>promise,</hi> and so was a <hi>Covenant;</hi> because, say they, <hi>Duty obligeth not God to reward us.</hi> But it seemeth to me as far past doubt as the <hi>penal part.</hi> For the question is not, what our Duty performed <hi>obligheth God to,</hi> much less in point of <hi>Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Iustice,</hi> where no Creature can Merit of God,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59334:88"/>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 35. 6, 7, 8. <hi>If thou be Righteous, what givest thou him,</hi> &amp;c. But it is presupposed that <hi>God first</hi> became Man's <hi>Benefactor</hi> and his <hi>Ruler,</hi> and his <hi>Law</hi> is the Instrument of his Government; and his <hi>Promise</hi> is but the signification of his <hi>Will,</hi> what he <hi>will give,</hi> and on what Terms: And God in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture signified his Will</hi> to <hi>bless the Obedient,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> those that <hi>love him;</hi> For as a <hi>Ruler</hi> he is <hi>Iust;</hi> and if he differenced not the <hi>Righteous</hi> from the <hi>Sinner,</hi> what were his Justice? Were there no other <hi>Reward,</hi> but the <hi>Continuance</hi> of the <hi>Paradise-Blessing</hi> freely given him (which Sin would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit) it would have been a <hi>great Reward:</hi> And if God equally <hi>take away</hi> his Gifts from <hi>Good and Bad,</hi> it is not <hi>Governing Iustice,</hi> though as the Act of a <hi>Proprietor</hi> it be neither <hi>Iust</hi> nor <hi>Unjust,</hi> so that the very essence of <hi>Undertaken Government,</hi> containeth a discovery of God's <hi>Rewarding Will;</hi> which is the <hi>promissory</hi> or <hi>premiant</hi> part of the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>§. 10. The <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Kind</hi> of the <hi>Natural Reward,</hi> must be gathered, 1. From the state that Man was in. 2. From the nature of his Duty. 3. From the state of Perfection which his Nature was made inclined to desire and seek.</p>
               <p>§. 11. 1. Man being freely placed in the state of Innocency and God's Favour in the Earthly Pleasures of <hi>Eden,</hi> as a Sanctified state of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, seeing Sin was to be punished with the privation of these, we may gather, that the <hi>Innocent</hi> should not have been deprived of them.</p>
               <p>§. 12. 2. Man's <hi>great Duty</hi> being to <hi>Love God perfectly</hi> (according to his present Ability) and to please him, and <hi>delight</hi> herein, we may gather,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59334:89"/>
that the <hi>Innocent</hi> should have the felicity which is herein contained, even in the <hi>Delights</hi> of <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>pleasing</hi> God.</p>
               <p>§. 13. 3. Man's Nature being not made in its <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perfection,</hi> but <hi>in via,</hi> with a desire of knowing God, loving him, pleasing him, and delighting in him yet more, according to his Capacity, we may gather, That obedient Man should have <hi>attained that Perfection:</hi> For God maketh not the capacities, dispositions and desires of Nature in vain.</p>
               <p>§. 14. But whether all this should have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on <hi>Earth</hi> or in <hi>Heaven,</hi> is not so clear in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Scripture: But, 1. The Translation of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> maketh it probable, that so Man should have been translated. 2. And so doth the Glory purchased by the Redeemer. 3. And the matter is the less, because where-ever the place be, the same state of <hi>Enjoyment</hi> would make it a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to such a person.</p>
               <p>§. 15. Neither doth Nature now tell us, <hi>How long Man must have obeyed before he had merited the full Reward of his Perfection.</hi> But only that he must conquer all the Temptations that God would try him with, and must persevere till God should please to translate him, not appointing him any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate time. Nature and Scripture favour this.</p>
               <p>§. 16. There are some who considently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (without either natural or Scripture-proof) That had <hi>Adam</hi> performed but one <hi>Act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to God, before his Sin, he had been <hi>confirmed</hi> is the <hi>Angels,</hi> as his Reward: And what a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> do they make <hi>Adam</hi> before he sinned, if he performed not one Act of Love and Obedience to his Maker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Fancy I dismiss.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59334:89"/>§. 17. Others say, That if he had overcome <hi>one Temptation</hi> he should have been confirmed; but I find no Promise or Proof of it in <hi>Nature,</hi> nor in Scripture; and I suppose they feign not a <hi>secret conditional Will</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Though it be agreed on by most Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, That <hi>Adam</hi> had been an Heir of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> if he committed the least Sin, even an idle thought or word, though he had not <hi>eaten the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit,</hi> and so that the Law of Nature made <hi>Hell</hi> the due punishment of the <hi>least Sin,</hi> and doth so still if it be not pardoned, yet the Law of Nature in our <hi>lapsed state</hi> is herein <hi>somewhat dark,</hi> and the Scripture not so clear for it as some imagine: But thus much methinks Nature it self still spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
               <p>§. 19. 1. That the <hi>least sin</hi> deserveth some <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of Punishment. 2. That God hath <hi>various degrees</hi> of Punishment, suited to the <hi>degrees</hi> of Sin. 3. That the <hi>least Sin</hi> hath a tendency to <hi>more,</hi> and that still to <hi>more,</hi> till Man be utterly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And that both in its own <hi>Nature,</hi> and in the <hi>forfeiture</hi> of some measure of <hi>God's Grace</hi> or Help. 4. That if you suppose that <hi>vain thought</hi> or <hi>word</hi> to consist still with <hi>true Love to God,</hi> God could not <hi>immediately hate</hi> and <hi>damn</hi> that Soul that so <hi>loved him.</hi> But if that Person perish, it must be by that <hi>idle thought</hi> or <hi>word</hi> producing <hi>worse,</hi> till it had turned his <hi>love</hi> from God to the <hi>Creature.</hi> 5. That <hi>antecedently</hi> to Gods underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be the <hi>Ruler</hi> of Man, no doubt but as an <hi>absolute Owner,</hi> he might have taken away all that he gave him, even his <hi>Life and Being,</hi> without any fault in Man: for he may do as he list with his own: And therefore he might have done the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59334:90"/>
same for the smallest <hi>fault,</hi> which he might have done without it. And therefore he might have inflicted any Pain, which to Man is not worse than Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, for ever. But whether his three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Acts; 1. <hi>Antecedently placing</hi> Man as he did. 2. Making him <hi>such Duty</hi> as he made him. 3. And such <hi>Inclination</hi> to <hi>better,</hi> do not imply that God <hi>would not</hi> punish him unless he <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and then but according to the degree of his Sin, I leave to Consideration.</p>
               <p>§. 20. But whether God <hi>must,</hi> and whether <hi>he might,</hi> punish the <hi>least Sin with Hell,</hi> are different questions: Whether by the Law of Nature <hi>he must</hi> do it or be <hi>unjust,</hi> and so a vain thought was not pardonable by or under that Law, and so <hi>Adam</hi> was an Heir of Hell when his thought first failed, before he did eat or <hi>consent</hi> to eat the forbidden Fruit, are questions which I cannot resolve from Nature, and are to me more difficult in Scripture than to wiser men.</p>
               <p>§. 21. The <hi>supernatural part</hi> of the Law is known to us only by <hi>Scripture,</hi> but perhaps the Fathers before the Flood might know more of it by <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> than God hath thought meet to write for our times.</p>
               <p>§. 22. The <hi>preceptive part</hi> was the <hi>not eating</hi> the forbidden Fruit, and consequently the overcoming all <hi>Temptations</hi> thereto: The Law of <hi>Matrimony</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> also, are partly <hi>supernatural</hi> (called <hi>Positive.</hi>)</p>
               <p>§. 23. The Penalty is called <hi>Death,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>Undoing</hi> and <hi>Misery:</hi> But whether it was only <hi>temporal Death</hi> or also <hi>Hell,</hi> Divines are not agreed. They that are for the <hi>former,</hi> seem chiefly drawn to it, by comparing the <hi>Law</hi> with the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59334:90"/>
                  <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Execution,</hi> thinking it indecent to say, that God fulfilled not his Threatning, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with it: And therefore seeing <hi>Temporal Death</hi> only is in the <hi>Sentence</hi> and <hi>Execution,</hi> they think that no more was <hi>meant:</hi> And consequently that Christ did not by Redemption, <hi>prevent</hi> the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> and <hi>execution</hi> of that Death, but only when it was <hi>fulfilled,</hi> deliver us from <hi>continuance</hi> under it by a Resurrection.</p>
               <p>§. 24. But I would have such remember, 1. That the Soul was made <hi>naturally immortal,</hi> that is, not <hi>tending to Annihilation,</hi> unless God should against Nature or settled Course annihilate it. And if it were <hi>not annihilated,</hi> it must be in some state, <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad.</hi> If it was to be <hi>penally annihilated,</hi> Christ prevented that: And such an <hi>annihilation</hi> is as little desirable as a <hi>tolerable</hi> degree of Pain. 2. And that God's Law determining directly but <hi>de debito poenae,</hi> what should be <hi>Man's due,</hi> and not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>peremptorily</hi> then <hi>de eventu,</hi> God reserved to himself a <hi>pardoning Power,</hi> so it were done upon <hi>valuable Considerations,</hi> more fully glorifying him and his Government and Law, than Man's Destra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would have done. And thus to dispense with his Law is no dishonour to God.</p>
               <p>§. 25. It is the <hi>Wrath to come</hi> that Christ delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us from, and <hi>Hell</hi> and the <hi>Power of Satan</hi> that he redeemed us from: Therefore it seemeth that it was no less that our Sin deserved. And <hi>spiritual death</hi> is contained in <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Apostacy</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>§. 26. What the <hi>Reward</hi> was to be, besides what I said before from <hi>Nature,</hi> it is not easie to gather out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor to find there any plainer a Promise of Life; but in both I think it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59334:91"/>§. 27. It is ordinary to say, That the <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Confirmation</hi> was, That <hi>he should have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten first of the Tree of Life:</hi> But to find that among the <hi>Commands,</hi> much less the <hi>Condition with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> requireth more discerning than I have; notwithstanding the words [<hi>Lest he eat and live,</hi> &amp;c.] from which they gather it.</p>
               <p>§. 28. How far this Law is yet in force, is also difficultly disputed. In brief, 1. The <hi>general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of <hi>perfect Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> for the <hi>future,</hi> and the Commands of the <hi>unalterable Duties</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> are still so far in force as to oblige us. 2. But whether <hi>sub poena mortis</hi> is the doubt? Punishment is due either <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>statedly,</hi> and so it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it due only to the <hi>Impenitent</hi> and <hi>Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> Or only in <hi>primo instanti, inceptively,</hi> with an annexed <hi>Remedy:</hi> And so every Sin maketh Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so far due to the Faithful, as that they have need of the <hi>Grace of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>new Covenant</hi> to <hi>pardon</hi> it. 3. But the <hi>premiant</hi> part of the Law of Innocency, from whence it is named a <hi>Covenant,</hi> is now <hi>truly null.</hi> Which maketh our Divines say, That the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> (which they call <hi>moral</hi>) bindeth as a <hi>Rule of Duty,</hi> but the <hi>Covenant</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
               <p>§. 29. This was not done by GOD but Man, who <hi>ceased</hi> to be a <hi>capable Subject</hi> of that <hi>Covenant, Promise</hi> or <hi>Reward:</hi> And so the <hi>Condition</hi> (<hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> or <hi>perfect Obedience</hi>) being become <hi>naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,</hi> we must not feign God to say to Sinners [<hi>On condition you be no Sinners you shall live</hi>]. But <hi>Cessante capacitate subditi cessat promissio conditionalis, &amp; transit in sententiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of the Cessation of the Law and Covenant of Innocency, see more after <hi>Sect.</hi> 5, §. 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59334:91"/>§. 30. They pervert this Covenant by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Fictions, who say, that the sence of it was [<hi>Thou, or one for thee, shall obey, and if thou Sin, thou or Christ shall suffer.</hi>] And so that we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this <hi>same Covenant</hi> which condemneth us, as having been innocent and perfectly righteous (habitually and actually) in and by Christ.</p>

               <p>§. 5. Christ took the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> but not strictly the <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Reputative Person</hi> of <hi>any man,</hi> but <hi>himself,</hi> much less of <hi>every Man</hi> or <hi>every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> I mean, that <hi>his Person</hi> was not the <hi>natural Person</hi> of any other, nor <hi>esteemed of God so to be;</hi> nor yet was he the full and proper <hi>Representative</hi> or <hi>Civil Person</hi> of any man, much less of <hi>all men;</hi> that is, One that the <hi>Law allowed us</hi> to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>suffer by,</hi> so that in <hi>Law-sence</hi> his <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> should be <hi>reputed ours;</hi> as a man payeth a Debt by his Servant or Substitute; which is morally or reputatively his Act and Deed, or accepted in the same sort and to all the same effects and purposes, as if he had paid it with his own hands. The <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Mediator</hi> was not in Law-sence, nor God's account, nor Christ's undertaking the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Sinner himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. Else Christ should have been in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and the <hi>greatest</hi> Sinner in the World, and <hi>hated</hi> as such by God above any other Sinner; which whoever shall affirm, shall speak presumptuously and blasphemously.</p>
               <p>§<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. Yea, else Christ should have been <hi>many millions</hi> of <hi>persons</hi> in Law-sence, and <hi>many millions</hi> of <hi>Sinners;</hi> which is not agreeable to God's Word.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Christ neither <hi>was a Sinner,</hi> nor <hi>reputed a Sinner by</hi> God: And his being <hi>made sin for us,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, 1. That <hi>he was made a Sacrifice for Sin,</hi> and was taken and used by God as one that undertook to <hi>suffer for our sins,</hi> in <hi>our stead,</hi> though not in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59334:92"/>
our <hi>person.</hi> 2. And that he was really accounted a Sinner by those that crucified him, and used as such.</p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>First,</hi> Christ did not fulfill the <hi>Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency</hi> in our <hi>several persons;</hi> He did not all those things <hi>materially</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was obliged to do; nor which most of us are obliged to do. We did not reputatively fulfill that Law by him, so as that his Perfection is taken as <hi>ours,</hi> in Habit and in Act.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ did not fulfill the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>person</hi> of all them that were <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bound themselves</hi> to fulfill it; so as that they are reputed Fulfillers of it in and by Christ: For since his Ascension it is abrogated even to the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, and now bindeth none in the World (as <hi>Mosaical.</hi>)</p>
               <p>§. 11. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ did not work Miracles, rise, ascend, intercede, reign, teach, give Laws, and Ministers, and Grace, in the <hi>Person of every</hi> or <hi>any other,</hi> but only in his <hi>own Person</hi> as the great Mediator and Saviour of Man.</p>
               <p>§. 12. If any will use the word [PERSON] in a private, narrow and improper sence, and say, That [<hi>He who undertook in the person of a Mediator to obey and merit for our Iustification,</hi> and to suffer in our stead to save us from deserved suffering, may therefore be called <hi>The Person of every one that he merited and suffered for,</hi> though I will not so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to thrust Phrases on the Church which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture never used, when their <hi>obvious</hi> sence is <hi>perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> yet if that man will by Explication of the word PERSON (or REPRESENTATIVE) notifie to the World, that he taketh it in a <hi>sound</hi>

               <p>§. 15. Though if Christ as a Creature had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he had deserved Punishment, yet the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition being of a thing <hi>impossible,</hi> by reason of the Union of the Divine Nature, it is improper to talk of any <hi>penal part</hi> of the Law that was given him: For penal Laws are for those that have need by fear to be restrained from Sin, or constrained to Duty; which Christ needed not.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Christ's <hi>entire Righteousness</hi> (as before his exaltation) <hi>habitual, active, passive,</hi> elevated by union with the <hi>Divine Perfection,</hi> was his <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Condition of his Covenant with the Father:</hi> And his performance of that Condition was his <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Title</hi> to God's promised Effects: And that as it was one <hi>entire Righteousness</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: And our Justification and Salvation are part of those promised Effects: Therefore it is abusive subtilty to divide <hi>Christ's Performance</hi> into little Parcels, and then say, <hi>This Parcel is imputed to me for this use, and that for that use, and by one he merited this, and by the other that,</hi> when (though each part of his Condition or Duty had its proper <hi>reason,</hi> yet) it was only the <hi>entire performance</hi> that was the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Benefits,</hi> and so of our <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. But I say, [<hi>before his Exaltation</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Benefits being of several sorts, some of them were given upon Christ's <hi>merit presently,</hi> and some upon <hi>Man's believing,</hi> and some not till <hi>long after</hi> by application: But to all these, what Christ
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59334:94"/>
did only as <hi>under the Law of Mediation,</hi> was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>his merit,</hi> by which they were procured: But his [<hi>undertaking</hi>] <hi>what he after did,</hi> (in gathering his Church and interceding and ruling) may be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with the parts of his foresaid <hi>merit;</hi> and <hi>still,</hi> as a Creature, he is under his <hi>Creator</hi>'s Law, even the Law of <hi>perfect uniting Love,</hi> and so doth <hi>eminently merit.</hi>

               <p>§. 18.

               <p>§. 1. AS God delivered the <hi>Law of Innocency</hi> partly by <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> and partly by <hi>supernatural</hi> and <hi>verbal</hi> significations of his will, so hath he done the <hi>Law of Grace;</hi> which is the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59334:94"/>
signification of his Will concerning Pardon and Life granted to guilty Sinners, and the terms thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents head, &amp;c.</hi> was a <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate</hi> of the <hi>supernatural</hi> signification; but it is not unlikely, that God did more fully acquaint them with his Law of Grace and Redemption, than those words alone could make us understand: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we find in their sacrificing, some such inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; (and in other signs.)</p>
               <p>§. 3. God's <hi>actual Continuance</hi> of forfeited Life, Liberty, Health, and other comforts, and his <hi>actual Collation</hi> of many great <hi>Mercies</hi> by the course of <hi>Nature,</hi> to such as by Sin have deserved present Damnation, is a <hi>degree</hi> of signification of his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning will</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> by these natural signs: (which they were not <hi>before sin</hi> and <hi>forfeiture.</hi>)</p>
               <p>§. 4. Man being after guilt of death, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved and enriched with manifold Mercies, and his life and faculties continued with many instructing providential helps and means, the very Law of Nature now obligeth him to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>thankfulness</hi> to God that sheweth him so great kindness.</p>
               <p>§. 5. And the same <hi>Law of Nature</hi> obligeth him to take <hi>that God still</hi> for a God of Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to believe, that what Mercy he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shewed the World and us, is on terms which he knoweth to be very well consistent with his Holiness, Truth and Justice: And it obligeth us therefore to seek to him for Mercy, and to use all possible means for further hope and pardon and recovery, and not to sit down in despair.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The <hi>common sence</hi> of all <hi>Mankind</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to this day, acquainteth us by that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59334:95"/>
That these <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> are found in the Law of <hi>lapsed Nature:</hi> For all the World that never heard the Gospel, do yet take God to be a <hi>merciful, forgiving God,</hi> and take themselves to be under some duty for the obtaining of further mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, recovery and felicity.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Though want of the sense of Sin, and its desert, and Man's misery may be thought by some to be the only cause of this, and so that it is but sinful presumption, and no part of Nature's obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; yet this upon trial will prove false. (Though what they alledge be <hi>one part</hi> of the Cause). For, 1. These men do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themselves Sinners, and to deserve punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God. 2. They find <hi>some</hi> misery and fear <hi>more.</hi> 3. It is not presumption to judge God to be merciful, when they and all the World do <hi>find</hi> him so. 4. It is not presumption to judge, that he <hi>can</hi> and <hi>will pardon Sin,</hi> when full Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience assureth us, that he hath <hi>already pardoned</hi> much. To remit the Sin, is (as we now speak of it) to remit the deserved punishment. And He that giveth Man forfeited life, health, time, and all the abundant Mercies which the World is full of, doth thereby so far actually forgive Sin: Saith Christ, <hi>Whether is it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say arise, take up thy Bed and walk,</hi> that is, <hi>Executively to forgive them,</hi> which is the <hi>full forgiveness,</hi> by taking away the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 5. It is no presumption to believe such Duty to be incumbent on us, as the remaining Law of Nature doth oblige us to. 6. Nor yet to take God's own Encouragements to seek our own recovery and felicity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:59334:95"/>§. 8. The <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>lapsed Nature</hi> doth convince men of the duty of <hi>repenting</hi> and <hi>retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to God, and oblige them to it. So that as <hi>Perfect Obedience</hi> was the duty of <hi>entire Nature,</hi> so <hi>Repentance</hi> is the duty of <hi>laepsed Nature:</hi> And I think few will say that all men are not hereby obliged to repent, and that in hope of mercy.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Hence it is that it is found among the <hi>Communes notitiae,</hi> and all the World as well as Christians acknowledge it and plead for it.</p>
               <p>§. 10. They that by God's Patience and Mercy are <hi>invited to Repentance,</hi> which is a return from sin to God, and are by Nature obliged to it, ought to believe that it is not made their Duty in <hi>vain,</hi> nor shall they lose by it if they perform it; for that were to accuse God of making Mans Duty in vain, or to his loss, which is not to be suspected.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Therefore they are bound not to <hi>despair</hi> of <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>don</hi> and <hi>Salvation;</hi> for an obligation to <hi>use means as tending to recovery,</hi> is inconsistent with an obligation to <hi>despair.</hi> Therefore <hi>hope of Mercy</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of some <hi>means</hi> Mankind is obliged to by the Law of <hi>lapsed Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 12. This is not the obligation of the Law or Covenant of <hi>Innocency;</hi> for that Law bound us only as <hi>Innocent</hi> to keep our <hi>Innocency</hi> and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein obey: But it giveth <hi>no pardon,</hi> nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth Man any Duty in order to pardon and recovery: Whatever doth this, is a Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 13. The sum of that Duty which the Law of Nature <hi>now</hi> obligeth Man to, is, To <hi>consider</hi> of all the <hi>Mercies</hi> which God vouchsafeth <hi>Sinners,</hi> and <hi>thankfully to improve them;</hi> to <hi>repent of sin,</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> to this <hi>God,</hi> who sheweth himself a <hi>merciful</hi>

               <p>§. 14. But the <hi>Supernatural</hi> Revelation telleth us much more than all this, <hi>Of the promised Seed,</hi> the <hi>means of our Salvation,</hi> and of our <hi>Duty in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them,</hi> and of the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of the Pardon, Deliverance, and Blessedness which we shall attain.</p>

               <p>§. 16. Even under the Old Testament, God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Messiah gradually:</hi> The <hi>Prophets</hi> spake plainlier of him, than any thing written before. Therefore a more <hi>extensive</hi> and <hi>distinct belief,</hi> was needful in <hi>one</hi> Age than in a <hi>former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. Yet, even the <hi>Apostles</hi> were in a state of <hi>Salvation,</hi> before they <hi>understood</hi> and <hi>believed,</hi> that Christ must <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>§. 18. Yet all this was partly revealed before by the Prophets, and plainly foretold them by Christ himself: Therefore it was not of absolute necessity to Salvation <hi>then,</hi> to believe all of Christ which had been before Revealed, though it was a duty to them that knew it.</p>
               <p>§. 19. Therefore under the Covenant of Grace, the <hi>Condition of our right,</hi> is narrower than the <hi>Duty</hi> which we are commanded to perform.</p>

God's Word maketh no difference. 2. <hi>Adam</hi> was as much after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father of Mankind, and all we as much in him, as before the Fall. And he that will say that God arbitrarily Judgeth otherwise of us, must prove it if he can. 3. The express Word of God in many places proveth it, joyning <hi>Children</hi> with their Parents in such Blessings, and therefore inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 22. The same Covenant with some positive Additions, it pleased God to renew to and with <hi>Noah,</hi> because he was as a second Head and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the generality of all Mankind, all coming from his Loins as they did from <hi>Adam</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>§. 23. As all Mankind was made the Subjects of God under this Law of Grace, so by it they were all to be Governed and Judged, allowing a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Degrees, in the Promulgation, Mercies and Penalties thereof.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Of the same Law with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Covenant of Peculiarity,</hi> and the Mosaical Iewish Law of Works.</head>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>ABraham</hi> being a subject to this same <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> did so faithfully <hi>Believe and Obey</hi> it, that it pleased God to <hi>reward him</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, by, 1. <hi>Renewing the Covenant</hi> by special <hi>Application to him,</hi> and by the <hi>promises</hi> of <hi>Peculiar Privileges</hi> to <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. Not that his <hi>Infant seed</hi> was the <hi>first</hi> that was taken into Covenant. For the Covenant of Grace had from the beginning been made with the Faithful and their Seed, as well as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Innocency</hi> was.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The <hi>Peculiarities</hi> of this <hi>Covenant</hi> were <hi>Initially</hi> promulgate to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> and more fully to the <hi>Iews</hi> as a <hi>Politick Body,</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Law; with some particular Sub-addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by <hi>David</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>§. 4. 1st. The Promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> was, besides the Common Covenant of Grace, renewed. 1. A promise of <hi>peculiar Favour</hi> to his <hi>Seed increased</hi> to a political <hi>Society</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and differenced by special Mercies from all the People of the Earth. 2. A promise that the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be of his Seed.</p>
               <p>§. 5. This Covenant did not <hi>Discovenant</hi> the rest that the World, nor put them into any worse Condition than they were before.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The <hi>peculiar Precept</hi> of that Covenant was, That by <hi>Circumcision</hi> as a Seal and Symbol, and by <hi>peculiar Gratitude</hi> and Obedience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59334:97"/>
the Sins of the Degenerate World about them, they should difference themselves from others, as God's <hi>peculiar People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. As the Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> was not a <hi>separated state,</hi> but an additional Privilege and Reward to <hi>Abraham</hi> as faithful to the Common Covenant of Grace; so <hi>Circumcision</hi> was the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol neither of <hi>Abraham</hi> as under the <hi>Law of Grace alone,</hi> nor as under the <hi>Covenant of Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity alone</hi> (for that was never alone) but as of <hi>One under both,</hi> even under the <hi>latter</hi> as a Reward for his special Fidelity in the <hi>former.</hi> And so it <hi>was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 8. Infants interest in the very <hi>Covenant of Peculiarity,</hi> and <hi>Iewish Church-state,</hi> was not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from <hi>Circumcision.</hi> As Infants were ever Members in the <hi>Common Church and Covenant of Grace</hi> with their Parents before Circumcision, so they were also without it Members of the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> when as all the <hi>Females</hi> were Members, and all the <hi>Males in the Wilderness,</hi> who for Forty Years were Uncircumcised: Yet is it called, <hi>The Church in the Wilderness,</hi> when except very few at last it was an Uncircumcised Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Much less did God lay such a necessity on the outward Sacramental Act, as to deny <hi>Salvation</hi> to the Uncircumcised aforesaid, as some would have us think that even under the Gospel he doth by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. The <hi>Covenant</hi> was still necessary as <hi>consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to by the Adult for themselves and their Infant

               </p>
               <p>§. 10. The gathering of <hi>Israel</hi> into a Policy by <hi>Moses,</hi> as a Theocracy, and their receiving a <hi>Law</hi> from God himself as a Political Body, was but the full Establishment of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity,</hi> in performance of what God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in Circumcision had begun.</p>
               <p>§. 11. This Law of <hi>Moses</hi> therefore must be Considered as an Affix or Appendix to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of Grace, and so either as <hi>related</hi> to it, or as considered simply and distinctly in it self without that relation. And as it was a Divine Political <hi>Law,</hi> for the Government of a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as such.</p>
               <p>§. 12. The Common Covenant of Grace was the <hi>Soul</hi> as it were of this Political Jewish Law; and therefore was really expressed in it, in the Decalogue and other parts: As it was the <hi>Soul</hi> of their state of <hi>Peculiarity,</hi> which was the Reward of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faithfulness in the Common Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: And their peculiar Promise to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed as the Nations Blessing, with their Types and Prophecies all led them to Christ more plainly than he was revealed to others.</p>
               <p>§. 13. The Law as such an <hi>Appendix,</hi> contained Preceptively the <hi>Decalegue</hi> as the <hi>Summary</hi> and <hi>stamina,</hi> and the <hi>particular Determinations under it,</hi> as belonging to the First and Second Table; For all those (not accurately distinguished as <hi>Moral, Political</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial,</hi>) are but the particular Determinations of the things only Generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> according to which they are fitlier distributed.</p>
               <p>§. 14. It pleased God to make the particular <hi>Precepts</hi> (about Worship and Political Converse)

Thereby they were so taken up with the outward Work, that they neglected the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward spiritual exercises of the Soul, without which all the rest are dead and carnal things. 2. And they hereby grew into so high a conceit with the Letter of the <hi>Law</hi> it self, and these External Duties, as that they thought the very doing of them was enough to make them just and acceptable to God, and forgot the true Doctrine of the Promised Messiah, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by him. 3. And hereby they grew Proud as if they had for these Externals, been so much better than all other People, that all the World was Abominable save they. 4. And they were so intent on the present Political Punishments to be escaped or suffered, and Rewards to be won or lost, that they much overlook'd the everlasting Punishments and Rewards: And this Corruption increased till Christ came to Cure it; who found the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 15. It may seem to some a difficult Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether God by such a Law made them <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier</hi> or <hi>Worse</hi> than the rest of the World? And whether Christ's Abrogation of it was not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning them to the <hi>common, easier</hi> and <hi>better</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59334:99"/>
of Mankind? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. You must know, that though God made a <hi>common Covenant of Grace</hi> with <hi>Mankind,</hi> the rest of the Nations about them were <hi>fall'n into Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and the Jewish Law much tended to cure both, and to make them better know God and the meaning of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and to return to him from Idols, and worship him aright. So that the Jews were happier than other Nations. 2. The abuse of their Law was through their fault and folly, and the Law by the faithful among them was better understood and used. 3. Christ, after setting up a <hi>better Covenant</hi> in its stead, did bring the Church into a better state than the Jews were: But the Unbelievers and idolatrous World, that had not Christ's better Covenant, were still left in a worse state than the Jews were before Christ's Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And God by this <hi>operous Law</hi> would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Jews, that by their peculiarity were apt to be puffed up with Pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as all his works grow to Perfection by degrees, even the Works of Grace in particular Souls, so did his Means of Grace, and the welfare of his Church; which was to begin at their Rudiments, and grow up to better means and knowledge: yet so that all were to be judged according to the Law that they were under.</p>
               <p>§. 17. It is this <hi>operous Law of Moses</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth usually by the [<hi>Law of Works,</hi> and the <hi>old or former Covenant</hi>] and neither the Law or Covenant of <hi>Innocency</hi> made to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor yet as if this Law of <hi>Moses</hi> were of the <hi>same Tenor or Conditions,</hi> and so called a Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> as making <hi>Innocency its Condition:</hi> But this Law
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59334:99"/>
which was an Appendix to the Law of Grace, and was a peculiar Law of Grace it self, is called, <hi>The Law of Works,</hi> because of the great and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome and costly Externals before mentioned, and because as a <hi>political</hi> Law it so much insisteth comparatively on those Externals, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace is comparatively more obscure in it than in the Gospel; and because the Jews had by their abusive Interpretation overvalued the Externals and operous Ceremonies and Sacrifices of it.</p>
               <p>§. 18. The mistake of <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning in this Phrase [<hi>the Law of Works, or old Covenant</hi>] hath led some men to a new frame of Theology in a great part, and engaged others in Errors, and fruitless Contentions.</p>
               <p>§. 19. By the words [<hi>He that doth these things shall live by them</hi>] as distinguished from <hi>believing, Paul</hi> meant not that the Condition of the Jewish Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> was the same <hi>perfect Innocency</hi> as was required in the first Law of <hi>Adam;</hi> for when Man was actually guilty, it was impossible that he should ever become one that had not sinned: And we must not put such a scorn on the infinitely wise and righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World, as to suppose him to have such a Law or Covenant as this [<hi>If you that are sinners are not sinners you shall be saved</hi>], much less to make this a Covenant of peculiar favour.</p>
               <p>§. 20. Nor doth <hi>Paul</hi> mean, That the Laws Condition was [<hi>If you will never sin more, I will pardon all that's past</hi>]. For God never made such a Law with man; <hi>not to sin</hi> being morally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, and Pardon never offered on such terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59334:100"/>§. 21. To put all out of doubt, 1. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand proclaimed the Name of that God from whom they received their Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping Mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssion and sin, though he will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> (That is, He will not judge a Sinner to be no Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor the Wicked to be Godly, nor pardon and save any contrary to the established terms of his Covenant.) 2. And the Law it self hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny express <hi>means</hi> of <hi>forgiveness</hi> of Sin appointed, as sacrificing, confessing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which sheweth that it was a Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 22. By <hi>the Law, Paul</hi> usually meaneth the <hi>written Law of Moses, as contained in the very words now in our Bibles:</hi> As by the <hi>Word of God</hi> we usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean the Scripture. Therefore though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain much of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> yet as a <hi>written Law,</hi> and part of a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> of that Nation, even the <hi>Decalogue</hi> may be said to be done away, though as the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> it still remain.</p>
               <p>§. 23. By the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> then, which <hi>Paul</hi> mostly disputeth of, and by [<hi>He that doth these things shall live in them</hi>] is meant, That this Law, besides the sweet and easie Precepts of faith and Love, did as part of the Matter of the Jews Obedience, require abundance of <hi>burdensome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals,</hi> and he that would not do all those must die (for Obedience even to those commanded Tasks was then made necessary by God): And as to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death, it was not by that Law to be esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but on the strict terms thereby required: So that <hi>doing these things,</hi> was necessary to <hi>life tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59334:100"/>
(and to <hi>eternal</hi> in sincerity): And the driving on the People by temporal punishments to these externals, was that Body of the Law which the mistaking Jews had separated from the Soul of it.</p>
               <p>§. 24. And he saith, <hi>None could be justified by the Works of the Law,</hi> because this <hi>written political Law</hi> and its <hi>externals,</hi> were in this Dispute put in opposition to <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Law taken for the meer <hi>Body of Moses's Law,</hi> separated from the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> which was its <hi>Soul;</hi> and no doubt, 1. It is <hi>Faith in the Redeemer</hi> and Covenant of Grace, which is the <hi>Condition of constituting Men Iust,</hi> (which they must have before any Obedience to their <hi>particular</hi> Laws could be sincere and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable:) and the faithful <hi>keeping of the Law of Grace,</hi> which is made the Condition of <hi>salvation.</hi> 2. And to dream that legal Strictness, Ceremonies, Sacrifices, or other legal Works, would justifie them without Christ and Faith in him, or any otherwise than as Acts of Obedience to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, by which their fidelity to the Covenant of Grace was to be expressed while that Law was in force, was contrary to the true meaning of their Law it self.</p>
               <p>§. 25. The rest of the World were not in the Covenant, nor under the Law of Peculiarity or Jewish Policy. And as <hi>such</hi> (as is said) it is now all abrogated, even the Decalogue it self, though its Matter be still in force, as aforesaid.</p>

In some respects they may be called the same, and in some not the same.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Parties in the <hi>first Covenant of Grace</hi> were really but two: GOD and Man (unless you could prove that Christ had then such a <hi>superange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Nature in which he mediated, as some before mentioned hold). But the Parties in the new <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace</hi> are <hi>really Three, viz.</hi> GOD as the absolutely Supreme, who gave us a <hi>Mediator;</hi> and Christ the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as the supreme Subad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator to whom all Power is given, and <hi>Man</hi> the Subject to both.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The Benefits of the first Edition, respected a <hi>future Saviour</hi> and his <hi>future Righteousness, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 4. The revelation of <hi>life eternal</hi> and Man's spiritual felicity and duty, is far clearer in the second Edition than in the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:59334:101"/>§. 5. As there is <hi>more done</hi> for us, so there are more full and excellent means provided for Man's information, conversion, sanctification and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Apostles, Scriptures, Miracles, spiritual Ordinances, than under the first.</p>
               <p>§. 6. As the <hi>means</hi> excel, so the <hi>Spirit</hi> is given in a <hi>greater measure,</hi> answerable to the <hi>greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> and <hi>means:</hi> And is specially <hi>Christ's Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Agent</hi> in the World, and the <hi>mark</hi> of his peculiar ones.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And as more is done for us, so more is now <hi>to be believed</hi> by us: Many necessary Articles are added to our Faith: That <hi>this Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> that he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> suffered under <hi>P.

               <p>§. 8. This second Edition is both the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant of Peculiarity,</hi> far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Iewish Covenant of Peculiarity:</hi> Believers are a holy Nation, a royal Priesthood, a peculiar People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

The Sum of all essential to this Covenant, is in <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sacraments and Symbols of it; and <hi>Baptism</hi> was appointed by Christ himself to be the solemn Initiation, Badge, and Character of his Disciples and Church-Members.</p>

               <p>§. 18. This Covenant did constitute Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty many years (suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 19. As Man hath an <hi>Intellect,</hi> a <hi>Will,</hi> and an <hi>Executive power,</hi> and the Gospel is to work on all, so the <hi>Creed</hi> is the Summary of our <hi>Belief,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> of our <hi>Desire;</hi> and the <hi>Christian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue</hi> and <hi>Institutions,</hi> of our <hi>practice,</hi> as expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Baptism generally expresseth.</p>
               <p>§. 20. Though to the <hi>Iews</hi> that were bred up under the use of the Old Testament, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59334:103"/>
the Messiah, the Apostles staid not long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them, before they baptized them, when they professed Repentance and Faith in Christ; yet it cannot be conceived, but that with the ignorant Gentile Christians, all Teachers took pains to make them understand, first what they were to profess and promise; for ignorant doing they know not what, pleaseth not God. And therefore that the Faith contained in the <hi>three Baptismal Articles,</hi> was certainly <hi>explained in more words</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>professed;</hi> which must be in substance that called the Apostles Creed, which the Churches pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and use, with the Custom of long instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Catecumens, giveth us notice of, as well as the reason of the thing.</p>
               <p>§. 21. When we find Christ commanding his Apostles to <hi>disciple the Nations,</hi> and <hi>baptize them</hi> in the <hi>Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>teach them all his Commandments;</hi> and when we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, after people have learned to say, <hi>They believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> how long it is ere they understand the <hi>meaning</hi> of those three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; and when we know that it is not <hi>bare words,</hi> without the sence, that constituteth the Christian Faith; no sober Man will doubt, whether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be baptized were taught the <hi>sence</hi> as well as the words; which must be done by <hi>more words.</hi> And it is certain that those Words were not to <hi>alter</hi> Christ's Baptismal Covenant, nor the Nature and Terms of Christianity, but to <hi>expound</hi> them. And it is certain, that multitudes were so weak, that had those <hi>Words</hi> been very <hi>long</hi> and <hi>many,</hi> they would rather have burdened them, than become their own profession, as understood and remembred. And it is certain, that the changing of words doth
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59334:103"/>
easily turn to a change of the sense; and that even then Heresies quickly multiplied; which made it necessary to the Church to be careful to preserve sound Doctrine. From all which it clearly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that a <hi>Creed</hi> (that is, a Summary Profession of Belief explaining the Baptismal Articles) was in common use in all the Churches many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the writing of the New Testament. And it is not likely that in the Apostles days the Churches did receive it from any but themselves.</p>
               <p>§. 22. Yet it is not probable that they compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed exactly such a Form of Words as might not at all be altered, and used still the very same terms; for the Creeds recited by <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and others, do all differ in some words from one another, and some Articles have been added since the rest (of which see <hi>Usher</hi> and <hi>Vossius de Symbolis.</hi>) But (except those few Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions) they all agree in Sence; which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us that the ancient Churches kept still to <hi>Words</hi> which signified the same <hi>matter</hi> of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our common Creed, and admitted no vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Words, but such as was small, and endangered not the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>§. 23. Though <hi>Baptism</hi> explained by the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of Faith, Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Decalogue,</hi> contain at least the Constitutive <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christianity, yet the <hi>Integrals</hi> are much larger, and all that Christ commanded was to be taught the Church. And though this was done by <hi>Voice</hi> many years by the Apostles before they wrote any part of the New Testament, yet the Memory of men from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Generation, would have been a very unsafe and treacherous Preserver of so many things, had they been committed to Memory alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59334:104"/>
Therefore it pleased the Wisdom and Love of God, to inspire the Apostles prophetically and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to commit the Sum of the History of Christ's Life, Sufferings, and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals of his Word, to those durable and sacred Records which we call the Holy Scriptures, for the easier and fuller Propagation and Preservation of the Christian Faith, and all its Integrals, especially his Example and sacred Precepts; yea, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Accidentals, or Appurtenances.</p>
               <p>§. 24. Because the Scriptures contain both in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sence,</hi> much more than the Essentials of Christianity, and so more than is of absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to Salvation; many a million may be saved, that understand not all that is in the Scriptures; nay, no man on Earth understandeth it perfectly: And he that understandeth and receiveth the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials,</hi> shall be saved, though he were ignorant of a thousand particular Texts.</p>
               <p>§. 25. Therefore it is that the Church hath ever selected the great and most necessary Truths, and taught Children and Catechised Persons these before the rest, by way of Catechism; of which the foresaid Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue are the Sum, and the Sacramental Covenant is that Sum yet more contracted. And it hath not been the Churches way to teach Children or Converts the Bible over in order indifferently, without se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting first the Marrow out of the whole, which the Ignorant cannot do for themselves.</p>
               <p>§. 26. Besides the Method or Order of the Scripture books, there is specially to be studied by those that will be more perfect than the rude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fort, the <hi>true Method</hi> of the <hi>Body of Doctrine,</hi> contained in all the Scriptures: For all the parts
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59334:104"/>
of that Doctrine have that Place, Order, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect each to other, as maketh up the Beauty and Harmony which is in the whole. And even in the <hi>Covenants,</hi> the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> there is a most excellent Order and Method, above all that is found in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any humane Writers, though, alas! too few perceive it.</p>
               <p>§. 27. Therefore they that gather true <hi>Systems</hi> of <hi>Theology,</hi> do not add to the Scripture, nor feign it to have a Method which it hath not (no more than Catechisms do) but only gather out that Doctrine which is there, and deliver it in the true Scripture-method; not as it lieth in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Words, but in the order of Relation that one Truth hath to another. And to despise this real Method, because every dull and slothful Wit doth not see it in the Scriptures, is indeed to despise the Matter and Design of the Scripture, and to despise all true and clear Knowledge of things Divine: For to see Truths placed in their proper Order, doth differ from a knowing of some confused parcels, as knowing the parts of a Man, a Picture, a Clock, a House, a Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> duly compaginated, and seeing all the parts cast confusedly on a heap. But to draw up a <hi>true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> is the Work of a skilful hand; and mistaken ones so seduce, that one Error in the Order leads to many.</p>
               <p>§. 28. Yet even Catechumens and young Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should learn what they learn in <hi>method:</hi> And that is first the said <hi>Baptismal Covenant,</hi> and our Relation to the Trinity thereby; and all that is added to their Knowledge daily (be it never so little) should be methodically added: For a weak head may perceive the true method of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59334:105"/>
few Essentials (being great and plain), though the strongest cannot follow the due Distribution of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Integrals and Consequent Truths: As the first partitions of the Tree into its greater Boughs, are easily perceived, though not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable sprigs thence arising.</p>
               <p>§. 29. Accordingly a wise Teacher will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with <hi>Infidels in proving the Christian Religion,</hi> (yea, and with himself); and will first prove the <hi>Truth of the Essentials</hi> (which are delivered us both in Scripture, and other infallible Tradition) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he undertake to prove <hi>all the Scriptures</hi> to be the Word of God: For he that will begin here, 1. Must shew the Book which he will so prove; and when he cannot vindicate it from <hi>variety of Lections,</hi> and the Errors of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Printers</hi> (to say nothing of the greater of <hi>Translators</hi>) it will stop him in his Designs. 2. And when he hath so many thousand Words to prove to be Divine, and so many Integrals and Accidentals to make good, he maketh his Work difficult, by allowing his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to doubt as much of the Essentials of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he shall doubt of the Truth of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Book or Text, History, Genealogy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the whole Scripture. A blind Zeal for Scripture hath led some to this dangerous way; but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches did otherwise, and so will all that well understand what they do. And really on supposition it could be proved (as it cannot) that any Penman of the Scripture erred in a Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59334:105"/>§. 30. So far is it from being true, that the Scripture is <hi>too narrow,</hi> as to the matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith and Duty, without the additional mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Tradition,</hi> that indeed, as the compleat Body of a Man hath more than his <hi>Essentials,</hi> yea, or <hi>Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>§. 31. They that in peevish opposition to others, tell us, That Christ made <hi>no Law,</hi> and that the <hi>Gospel</hi> is <hi>not a Law,</hi> if they strive not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>equivocal Words,</hi> but mean that Christ is not a <hi>Legislator,</hi> nor hath a <hi>Law and Covenant</hi> by which he will <hi>govern and judge the World,</hi> do deny all our <hi>Christianity</hi> at once: For Christ is <hi>not Christ,</hi> if he be not the <hi>King of the Church;</hi> nor is he <hi>King,</hi> if he be not a <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> nor doth he <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Iudge,</hi> if he have <hi>no Law;</hi> which is so far from Truth, that there is now <hi>no Law of God</hi> that we are under, but what is truly the <hi>Law of Christ:</hi> For he is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and <hi>Head over all things to his Church;</hi> and <hi>all power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth is given to him;</hi> and<note place="margin">John. 17. 2. &amp; 13. 3.

But it is not to be supposed, that the <hi>very preceptive part</hi> of the Law of <hi>Innocency</hi> is now in force to us, as it was to <hi>Adam:</hi> For it bound him to be <hi>perfectly innocent in Act</hi> and <hi>Dispositions.</hi> But to a Man that hath <hi>lost his Innocency,</hi> and is already in <hi>Act and Habit</hi> sinful, it is not to be supposed, that the Law saith, <hi>Thou shalt be innocent:</hi> For that were to command not only a <hi>Moral,</hi> but a <hi>Physical absolute impossibility,</hi> as saying, <hi>Thou shalt not have sinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 33. Obj.</hi> God changeth not his Law when man changeth his capacity: Therefore the Law may be the same as in Innocency, both as to the Precept, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Promise: God may still say, 1. Sin not, <hi>or</hi> be innocent: 2. And if thou be perfect, thou shalt live: 3. Else thou shalt die. And if man will make himself uncapable, it's his own change.</p>
               <p>§. 34. <hi>Answ.</hi> I spake to this before, and now further add; <hi>God's Law is not</hi> to be taken for a <hi>meer script of Words</hi> considered as standing in a <hi>Book not obliterated,</hi> or as written on <hi>stone,</hi> and not <hi>broken,</hi> or <hi>cast away:</hi> The <hi>signum</hi> materially may stand, and the <hi>Law</hi> be changed, and the <hi>significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> cease: As a <hi>repealed Statute</hi> may be still in the <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Records:</hi> God's Law is <hi>signum voluntatis divinae, debitum constituentis:</hi> Therefore if it <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie not God's Will as constituting what shall be due from us, and to us,</hi> it is <hi>no Law.</hi> And that it may so signifie his <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>constitute Dueness</hi> (<hi>Debitum</hi> or <hi>Ius</hi>) (or as they use to say, <hi>oblige</hi> and <hi>give</hi>) the Subject must be in a <hi>natural capacity:</hi> For where there is no <hi>Subject</hi> to be obliged, there is <hi>no Law.</hi> And where <hi>natural capacity</hi> ceaseth (as in a <hi>dead corps</hi>) there is <hi>no Subject</hi> to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And the Law is <hi>Instrumentum regiminis.</hi> So

that if you do not only say, <hi>This was God's Law,</hi> but <hi>This is God's Law,</hi> you must mean, <hi>Thus he n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In which Case, all Law and Reason saith, That the Law doth <hi>transire in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam, vel rem judicatam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 35. So that, as was before-said, the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works is ceased;</hi> yea, the <hi>Law or Precept</hi> bindeth not now, as it is a <hi>Law of Innocency made to innocent Nature</hi> for its <hi>preservation,</hi> for <hi>Nature</hi> is not <hi>innocent:</hi> But the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> is now the <hi>Law of lapsed redeemed Nature,</hi> and not of <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> Nature. And it obligeth us for the <hi>future</hi> to as much perfection of Duty, as we are <hi>naturally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of performing at that time, though viciously indisposed, it being only <hi>natural disability,</hi> and not <hi>moral vicious unwillingness</hi> that hindereth <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But though (<hi>not to do all that we can</hi>) be <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,</hi> yet it is not to <hi>sin unto Death or Damnation,</hi> if he perform so much as is made by Christ the Condition of life. In short; 1. Before mans sin, he was under the proper Law and Covenant of Innocency, which made perfect personal Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59334:107"/>
the Condition of life. 2. Immediately after sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the Promise, man was not under any Promise of life on condition of Innocency, nor yet under the Command of being innocent, nor of seeking and hoping for life on that Condition: For upon the Impossibility these ceased, without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, <hi>cessante capacitate subditi:</hi> But man was then under no Covenant or premiant Law: But under, 1. The Command of perfect Obedience for the future. 2. The Obligation to Punishment, not peremptory, but due for every sin, unless it should be pardoned on due satisfaction: These two Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations man was under between the Fall and the Promise.</p>
               <p>3. But next, <hi>sinful condemned man,</hi> with his said Obligation, was delivered into the hands of the Redeemer, who now continueth the said Law of lapsed Nature (making perfect Obedience <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo</hi> due, or Death for sin in <hi>primo instanti;</hi>) but adding the Remedying Law of Grace, giving Christ, Pardon and Life to penitent Believers.</p>
               <p>§. 36. The Question, What Punishment is due to <hi>Venial sin,</hi> must be resolved from the sence of the Law that obligeth us: And the Question is not what Punishment <hi>would have been due</hi> to the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest sin, if the Covenant of <hi>Innocency</hi> had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; but what <hi>is due</hi> to it by the Law of <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature</hi> and <hi>of Grace,</hi> which is in force.</p>
               <p>§. 37. There is a <hi>three-fold Dueness</hi> (or <hi>Desert</hi>) here considerable (without distinguishing of which, many such Questions cannot be answered.) 1. A <hi>Due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>natural Congruity,</hi> without any Remedy which the Law gave, or took notice of: So <hi>Death</hi> was <hi>due</hi> for every sin by the Law of Innocency (as I think).</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59334:107"/>2. A <hi>Dueness of natural Congruity</hi> with an <hi>affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Remedy,</hi> which hindereth the guilt from being <hi>compleat and fixed.</hi> And such is the <hi>Dueness of punishment</hi> to the least real sin, by the Law of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Nature,</hi> to which the Law of Grace is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, giving a <hi>Conditional Pardon</hi> to all the World for the Merits of the Redeemer. As if God said, [<hi>Thy sin in strict Iustice is worthy of death, but I will forgive thee, if thou repent and believe in Christ.</hi>] Here is so much Dueness as <hi>needeth pardon;</hi> but it is <hi>virtually, conditionally pardoned</hi> as soon as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and so it is not a plenary Obligation to punishment.</p>
               <p>3. A <hi>Remediless Dueness</hi> (or <hi>Guilt</hi>) by <hi>natural Congruity</hi> and <hi>peremptory determination</hi> of the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver:</hi> And such was the Guilt of <hi>temporal death</hi> for sin against the Law of Innocency, (at least the <hi>eating</hi> of the forbidden Fruit) (for so far it is not forgiven); and the Guilt of <hi>perpetual misery</hi> to impenitent Unbelievers and ungodly Ones, that so die.</p>
               <p>§. 38. By this it appeareth, that sins of meer <hi>Infirmity,</hi> consistent with <hi>sincere Faith, Repentance, and Holiness, in the second sence</hi> deserve punishment (not all alike, but) according to the degree of the Offence: But not in the <hi>first</hi> sence, or the <hi>last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 39. Accordingly a great Question must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, Whether the sins of the <hi>Faithful</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any more than a <hi>temporal Chastisement?</hi> And whether they may <hi>pray</hi> for pardon of <hi>perpetual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> or <hi>need any such pardon? Ans.</hi> The sins of the Godly deserve <hi>everlasting punishment</hi> in the <hi>second Sence,</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi> of Desert or Dueness; which is so far as to need a <hi>Saviour and Pardon,</hi> and so as they must <hi>pray</hi> for, and <hi>receive</hi> that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59334:108"/>
But not in the <hi>first</hi> or <hi>third</hi> Sence.</p>
               <p>§. 40. It is the <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> or of <hi>Grace,</hi> which is <hi>norma officit &amp; judicii,</hi> and by which we must be judged at the last day.</p>
               <p>§. 41. It is of great importance in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Justification, to know whether, or how far we shall be judged by the Law of <hi>Innocency,</hi> or whether only by the <hi>Law of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that is judged by the <hi>Law of Innocency,</hi> must be <hi>justified by personal, perfect, perpetual Obedience</hi> (not by <hi>anothers</hi>) or be condemned: But he that is <hi>judged by the Law of Grace,</hi> must be justified by Christ's Merits and Sacrifice (or Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) as purchasing his Grant of a Pardon and life, or Right to Impunity and Glory, given by the Covenant of Grace conditionally, with his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that Condition.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Universality and Sufficiency of Grace.</head>
            <p>§. 1. IT was not only the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Elect,</hi> but of all <hi>Mankind,</hi> that Christ assumed in his Incarnation.</p>
            <p>§. 2. It was not to <hi>Adam</hi> only, as the <hi>Father of the Elect,</hi> but as the <hi>common Father of Mankind</hi> (lapsed) that God made the Promise, or conditional Law, or Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed it with <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. It was not the <hi>sin</hi> of the <hi>Elect only,</hi> but of all Mankind that were the <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>Christ's</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59334:108"/>
               <hi>sufferings,</hi> (called by some, <hi>An assumed meritorious Cause,</hi> because by his consent they were <hi>loco Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae meritoriae.</hi>)</p>
            <p>§. 4. It is not to the <hi>Elect only,</hi> but for <hi>all the World</hi> (as to the <hi>Tenor</hi> of it) that Christ hath purchased, and given a <hi>conditional Pardon</hi> of sin, and a <hi>conditional Donation</hi> of <hi>Life eternal</hi> in the Covenant of Grace, both of the first and second Edition: That is, <hi>the conditional Grant</hi> is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal; <hi>Whoever believeth shall be saved:</hi> Though the Promulgation of it may have many stops.</p>
            <p>§. 5. It is not to the <hi>Elect only,</hi> but to <hi>All,</hi> that Christ hath commanded his Ministers to proclaim this Law or Covenant, and offer the Benefits, and require their Consent, as far as the said Ministers are able.</p>
            <p>§. 6. It is not only to the <hi>Elect,</hi> but <hi>to all</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that many Mercies procured by pardoning and reconciling Grace are actually given, which were forfeited (or not due) by reason of sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of Innocency.</p>
            <p>§. 7. These Mercies given to all Mankind after sin, and contrary to desert, are not given by <hi>Gods Mercy alone,</hi> without respect to the <hi>Blood and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ:</hi> But his <hi>Blood and Merits</hi> are the Cause of them, as truly as of the greater Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Elect. And they that say, That God doth give all these Mercies without a Saviour's Merits, as the Cause, prepare the way for Infidels to inferr, That then he might have done so by the Mercies of the Elect.</p>
            <p>§. 8. All these <hi>actual Mercies</hi> given to <hi>mankind,</hi> contrary to Merit, are a degree of <hi>Promulgation of the Law of Grace,</hi> telling all the World, That God doth not now rule and judge them meerly by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59334:109"/>
Law of Innocency, but upon Terms of Mercy (as is aforesaid)</p>
            <p>§. 9. Hereby it is signified to all the World, that God is as he proclaimed his Name to <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 34. 5, 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty</hi> (by false judging:) and that the World have no cause to despair of forgiveness, as if they were <note n="*" place="margin">Though this be said before, a new Case here causeth me to repeat it.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the remediless (or unreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died) Sentence of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>§. 10. There are no People on Earth that are not obliged to the use of <hi>some means</hi> appointed them to be used for their full Pardon and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, else <hi>Despair</hi> would be their <hi>Duty,</hi> and they should not be judged <hi>Sinners</hi> for neglecting any such means. And were they not bound to do any thing for their own Salvation, their Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery that neglect so to do, would be far less than it is.</p>
            <p>§. 11. Therefore all People have some such <hi>Means,</hi> that have a tendency to Recovery and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation afforded them by God.</p>
            <p>§. 12. They that say, That all the Mercies of the <hi>Non-elect,</hi> are <hi>no Mercies,</hi> because through mens Sin, they end in their Misery, do perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extenuate Gods Mercies and Man's Sin, and teach Sinners falsely to plead in Judgment, That they never abused, or sinned against Mercy, which God and their own Consciences will easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59334:109"/>§. 13. In the Controversie, <hi>Whether Christ died for the Elect only, or for all Mankind,</hi> it seemeth to me, that we little differ about the matter, but only strive about ambiguous Words; even about one Syllable [<hi>for.</hi>] If to die [<hi>for</hi>] signifie [<hi>for their sins,</hi>] under the reason of a Cause of Christ's Death, so (as <hi>Paraeus</hi> doth) we must all grant, that Christ died [<hi>for</hi>] all.</p>
            <p>2. If (<hi>for</hi>) signifie [<hi>eorum loco</hi>] <hi>in their stead,</hi> so the Phrase hath yet great Ambiguity, and will require a great deal of distinguishing for its due Explication: The various kinds and degrees of Benefits to which the Intention is limitted, do leave the word liable to various Sences. Christ died so <hi>far in the stead of all Mankind,</hi> as to suffer Death (by his voluntary sponsion) as a punishment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to themselves by sin, to free them all from it, on condition of their suitable acceptance of his Grace. But if by [<hi>for</hi>] be meant (<hi>in the civil person of all men, as representing them</hi>) the Word is still among <hi>Lawyers</hi> and all Writers, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In a large sence he may be said to (<hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> or <hi>represent</hi>) another who doth it but <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid,</hi> and not <hi>simpliciter, in parte aliqua, vel in tantum &amp; ad hoc,</hi> and not <hi>in omni, vel ad omne.</hi> And if any will so far stretch the Phrase, and because Christ suffered in the common <hi>Nature</hi> of man, will say that he suffered in <hi>every man's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> or because he had a special purpose of saving his Elect, will thence say, He died in <hi>the person</hi> of <hi>Peter, Iohn, and every elect Sinner;</hi> I will not strive against mens Phrases, if they will explain them soundly: But in strict Sence, as <hi>Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a man, or doing it in his <hi>Person,</hi> signifieth, that Christ so died (and merited) in several
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59334:110"/>
mens <hi>Persons,</hi> as that the Law or Lawgiver doth take it to have been <hi>in sensu civili,</hi> their <hi>own</hi> suffering, and doing, and meriting, or to all <hi>intents, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and <hi>uses,</hi> all one to them, as if they had so died and merited themselves:] thus Christ neither <hi>died,</hi> nor <hi>obeyed</hi> for any man (as shall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after proved.)</p>
            <p>But if by [<hi>for</hi>] is meant [<hi>for mens benefit or good</hi>] so it is yet ambiguous, and liable to a threefold sence, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Intentionally,</hi> 2. <hi>Aptitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinally,</hi> 3. <hi>Eventually,</hi> for their good. And, 1. <hi>Intentionally,</hi> the Controversie either speaketh of Christ's <hi>Divine Nature and Will,</hi> or of the <hi>Humane:</hi> Concerning the former, the Question is the same with that about Election, or Gods Decrees, which is before spoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> How far God decreed good to all men by Christ's Death. As to Christ's Humane <hi>Nature and Will,</hi> it will prove but an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant unprofitable Question, Whether Christ as Man, kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w the Names of every individual person in the World, or of every one of the Elect, and had a distinct Intent to save every one of those by Name that are saved: It's better let such Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alone. 2. And [<hi>Aptitudinally,</hi>] there is no question but there is that in Christ's <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Obedience, Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> which is in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature adapted to the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> of all, and hath that sufficiency thereto, which would accomplish it, if it were duly accepted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>3. And as to the <hi>Event,</hi> we are agreed, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>some,</hi> and <hi>not all are saved by Christ's Death and Merits;</hi> but that <hi>all have great Mercies,</hi> which are the <hi>fruits</hi> of these, though many wilfully turn them to their Sin and Misery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59334:110"/>§. 14. By all this it appeareth, that it is a most unfavoury thing for men called <hi>Divines</hi> to dispute hotly, That <hi>Christ did or did not die and merit for all,</hi> and bitterly revile their Adversaries in the Controversie, without ever explaining that one ambiguous syllable [<hi>FOR</hi>], or telling men what they mean. And when it is well explained, we scarce know how to differ.</p>
            <p>§. 15. For few will deny but that <hi>Christ suffered,</hi> not <hi>immediately because Man sinned</hi> (as if Suffering were due to him meerly because we sinned) but because he <hi>undertook</hi> so to do, and was obliged so to do by the Law of Mediation: But <hi>remotely</hi> he suffered, not only because the <hi>Elect had sinned,</hi> but because <hi>all Mankind had sinned.</hi> That is, The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Pardon</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> given to all Mankind, are such as Christ's Sacrifice and Merits must be congruously the Causes of, as well as the actual Pardon of Believers.</p>
            <p>§. 16. But if the stress of the Controversie be laid on Christ's <hi>personating</hi> or <hi>representing this man or that,</hi> by that time this (humane, invented, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, unscriptural) Phrase is explained, either we shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound to be all of a mind, or else some will run into an intolerable errour about [<hi>Christ's dying and meriting in our civil person,</hi> and our <hi>dying and meriting by his natural person</hi>]; or else they will dispute themselves into a Wood of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and be lost about the sence of a word that cannot be sufficiently explained.</p>
            <p>§. 17. And they that will lay the stress of the Controversie on the <hi>Aptitude</hi> or the <hi>Event,</hi> must be men of some singular Conceits, and not of the common judgment of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> or the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> if they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59334:111"/>
will disagree; for here we are commonly agreed.</p>
            <p>§. 18. But as far as I can discern, most Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders lay the Controversie upon the point of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intention, Purpose</hi> or <hi>Decree: viz. Whether Christ as God did purpose to justifie and save all men by his death?</hi> or else, <hi>Whether he purposed to do good to all men by his death?</hi> Which Purpose is nothing but God's <hi>eternal Will</hi> or <hi>Decree.</hi> And why then do they make two Controversies of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> when they mean the same in both? And here methinks there cannot easily be a difference. For (in a few plain words) <hi>whatever good Christ giveth to any, that he from Eternity decreed to give them:</hi> But we are agreed that he giveth not Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all men, and yet that he doth give many and great Mercies to all men, and especially, that he hath given to the World (and not only to the Elect) an <hi>express conditional Pardon</hi> of Sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional <hi>Iustification, Reconciliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Adoption</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> to Glory: And sober Divines had rather say that this universal <hi>conditional Deed of Gift,</hi> is the <hi>effect of Christ's Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> than that God giveth it to one part of Men for Christ's death, and to the other part <hi>not for his death,</hi> but as <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</hi> And we are agreed, that Christ doth give to some such <hi>special Grace,</hi> as shall and doth infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevail with them to repent and believe, and also actual Pardon, Justification, Adoption and Salvation.</p>
            <p>§. 19. Therefore in this sence Christ <hi>died for all,</hi> but not for <hi>all alike</hi> or <hi>equally;</hi> that is, <hi>He intended good to all, but not an equal good with an equal inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Whatever Christ giveth men in time as the fruit of his death, that he decreed from Eternity to give them. And whatever he never giveth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59334:111"/>
them, he never decreed to give them. What he giveth them absolutely, he decreed to give them absolutely. And what he giveth them but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, he decreed to give them but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Therefore being agreed of the <hi>fact</hi> and <hi>event,</hi> we must be agreed of the <hi>Intention</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> and what needs there more?</p>
            <p>And by this time you may answer their Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that say, Why not a <hi>common</hi> and <hi>conditional Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> as well as a common and conditional Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither of them are <hi>conditional</hi> as to the Act of God and Christ: There is no act of ours the Condition of God's <hi>decreeing ex parte Dei,</hi> but only of the thing decreed; nor of Christ's <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Intent,</hi> but only of the benefit: That a <hi>conditional</hi> Act of Grace, or Deed of Gift of Christ and Life to all Mankind in common (in the tenor of it) should be made, was both decreed by God and purchased by Christ. But, 1. This is not the whole of God's Decree or Christ's Purchase and Intent. 2. And this is not to be called <hi>Election,</hi> as it signifieth a choosing of some from among the rest: Common Redemption and the Decree of Common Grace, both antecede that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Election, in order of Nature <hi>in esse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivo;</hi> that is, God decreeth to give Faith and Salvation effectively to some of them that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace.</p>
            <p>§. 20. The old Solution which Schoolmen and Protestants have acquiesced in, is, That <hi>Christ died for All, as to the sufficiency of his death,</hi> but not as to the <hi>efficiency</hi> of <hi>their salvation:</hi> Which is true, but must be thus explained: Christ's Death and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were not only <hi>sufficient</hi> but <hi>effectual</hi> as to their <hi>first effects;</hi> that is, They effected that which is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59334:112"/>
commonly called, <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Merit;</hi> and hence and from the Covenant of God they were also effectual to procure the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> as of <hi>universal tenor,</hi> and therein a free <hi>pardon of Sin</hi> and <hi>gift of Right</hi> to <hi>life-eternal to all,</hi> on <hi>condition of due acceptance:</hi> This <hi>conditional Gift</hi> of Christ and Life is <hi>effected:</hi> And this <hi>efficacy</hi> of the <hi>antecedent Mercies,</hi> must either be called part of the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of Redemption, as to the consequent Mercies (<hi>viz.</hi> Actual Pardon and Salvation) or else an efficiency beyond the sufficiency, antecedent to the said spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial efficiency. That Christ's Death hath effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally procured the Act of Oblivion or conditional Gift of Life to all Mankind; but it doth not effect the actual salvation of all: To the <hi>universal Grace</hi> it is both <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>efficient;</hi> but to the <hi>special Grace</hi> and <hi>actual Salvation</hi> it is sufficient <hi>to All</hi> (as after shall be opened) but not efficient, (which is by the Refuser's fault and forfeiture.)</p>
            <p>§. 21. When we say, that either Christ's <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Grace</hi> is sufficient to more than it effecteth, the meaning is, that it hath all things on <hi>its part</hi> which is <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to the effect, but that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else is supposed necessary to it, which is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>§. 22. As there is a common Grace actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Mankind, (that is, <hi>common Mercies contrary to their merit</hi>) so there<note place="margin">Of Sufficient grace.</note> is such a thing as <hi>sufficient Grace in su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> genere,</hi> which is <hi>not effectual.</hi> So that though it be disputable in what cases this is found, and what not, yet that there <hi>is such a thing</hi> is past dispute.</p>
            <p>§. 23. By sufficient Grace here I mean such without which <hi>Man's Will</hi> cannot, and <hi>with which</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59334:112"/>
it <hi>can perform the commanded Act toward which it is moved, when yet it doth not perform it; and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other degree of help than that which procureth not the act.</hi> So that it is not all that is useful to the <hi>effect,</hi> nor all that is necessary to <hi>easie</hi> or <hi>prompt performance,</hi> or to the infallible ascertaining of the act, nor to the <hi>melius esse</hi> only that we speak of; but so much as is necessary <hi>ad esse,</hi> and <hi>efficient</hi> of the true <hi>posse:</hi> When you can properly say that a <hi>Man can do this,</hi> you say that he hath all that is of necessity to the doing of it.</p>
            <p>§. 24. <hi>Iansenius</hi> himself is so far from denying this Grace called <hi>Sufficient,</hi> that he asserteth that by this, improved by free-will, (without such special Grace, as of it self, giveth the Act as well as the Power) the <hi>good Angels stood</hi> when the bad ones fell, and <hi>Adam</hi> stood till the time of his Fall: And so that such a thing there hath been.</p>
            <p>§. 25. And seeing God is <hi>still the same,</hi> and <hi>man's will the same</hi> in its <hi>natural faculties,</hi> and God seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us to delight in <hi>Constancy,</hi> it is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably imagined, that God did for so short a time Rule Angels and Men by such a Grace, as he would never after make use of in the World; and that <hi>Man's free-will</hi> did for so short a time do its Duty by that <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> and <hi>never after do any one act by the like Grace,</hi> in any one to the World's end.</p>
            <p>§. 26. It's true, that such Grace will not serve our turn to do that now in our lapsed state, which <hi>Adam</hi> could have done in Innocency (no, nor will all our <hi>effectual Grace</hi> yet reach it) that is, to have continued sinless: But it is incredible, that no <hi>common Grace</hi> of God now is <hi>as sufficient</hi> to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the <hi>least good act</hi> (which is good but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59334:113"/>
               <hi>secundum quid</hi>) as <hi>Adam</hi>'s was to the fulfilling of all God's <hi>Law;</hi> and that the best unregenerate man is not able to do <hi>any better than he doth,</hi> or <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear</hi> some <hi>Evil that he doth,</hi> as well as <hi>Adam</hi> to have forborn all.</p>
            <p>§. 27. At least, to the <hi>Regenerate</hi> such a Grace must be acknowledged: For though of the rest <hi>Iansenius</hi> will say, <hi>They do no good,</hi> because they <hi>love not God and goodness</hi> (and on the like reasons others will say, That the <hi>Regenerate do no good,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all hath sinful mixture or imperfection); yet he will not say so of the <hi>godly:</hi> And must we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that no godly man can do any more good than he doth? and so, That he hath no meerly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient Grace to any one act in all his life?</p>
            <p>§. 28. The Controversie about <hi>sufficient Grace</hi> is the same in the true meaning of it with that of the <hi>Power</hi> of Mans Free-will. For when by <hi>sufficient Grace</hi> we mean nothing but the <hi>enabling</hi> a Man to the act, or giving him <hi>Power</hi> to do it, the stress of the Question is, Whether Man hath <hi>truly any Power</hi> to do more than he doth? For if he <hi>have such a Power, Grace</hi> hath given it him, if it be for a Work that Grace is needful to. So that indeed were it not for Custom and Expectation, this Question should be handled under that of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Man's Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 29. No man hath at the present Grace suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his <hi>Salvation,</hi> if he have longer time to live: Because the Grace or help of the present hour is not sufficient for the next, but there must be continual Supplies from God; supposing that we distinguish of Grace by the distinct <hi>numerical acts</hi> and <hi>hours</hi> for and in which we need it: But if you distinguish of Grace by the <hi>species of Acts</hi> for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59334:113"/>
which it is needful, and not by the numerical acts, then it may be truly said, that the same Grace (<hi>in specie</hi>) which a Believer hath to day, may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to his Salvation, or to his life's end.</p>
            <p>§. 30. But if you speak <hi>de gradu,</hi> that Grace may be sufficient to <hi>one thing,</hi> which is not sufficient to another: And so, 1. An Infidel may have Grace sufficient to forbear some Sin, or avoid some <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> or use <hi>some means</hi> that tendeth to Faith and Repentance, who hath not Grace sufficient to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> and <hi>repent</hi> unto Salvation. 2. A man may have Grace sufficient to enable him to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>repent</hi> unto Justification, and yet not have at that instant <hi>Grace sufficient</hi> to enable him to <hi>love God above all as God, with a fixed habitual Love,</hi> and to <hi>live an holy life</hi> (for the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> are promised on condition of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi>). 3. A <hi>sanctified</hi> man that is yet but <hi>weak,</hi> may have Grace sufficient to live to God a holy life at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and yet not have Grace sufficient for <hi>greater trials</hi> of Duty and Temptation: And therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> and all his Followers still say, That the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Perseverance</hi> is a Gift over and above the Grace of meer Sanctification in the weakest degree.</p>
            <p>§. 31. By all this it is evident, that he that disputeth of the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of Grace, must first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly tell us,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Whether he mean <hi>extrinseck</hi> Grace, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. If <hi>extrinseck,</hi> Whether he mean it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensively of <hi>all extrinseck Grace</hi> together, or only of some particular part of sort.</item>
               <item>3. If the <hi>latter,</hi> Whether he speak of the sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Christ's Death</hi> and <hi>Righteousness, Sacrifice, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Intercession, &amp;c.</hi> or of the <hi>sufficiency of the Gospel-Covenant</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59334:114"/>
or <hi>Promise;</hi> or of the sufficiency of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Praying, and other means; or of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Records, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. If he speak of <hi>intrinseck</hi> Grace, Whether the Question be of <hi>Sufficiency ex parte Dei agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> (which none must question); or <hi>ex parte effecti.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. If the latter, <hi>What is the effect</hi> whose <hi>sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> he questioneth? 1. Is it a Grace or Power to do some <hi>more common good,</hi> use <hi>some means,</hi> forbear some evil, as the Unregenerate may do? 2. Or is it a Power truly to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe?</hi> 3. Or to <hi>love God habitually,</hi> and <hi>live holily?</hi> 4. Or to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come greater Temptations,</hi> and <hi>persevere?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. And he must tell you whether he speak, 1. <hi>De specie,</hi> whether the Grace or Power sufficient to <hi>this sort</hi> of Acts or Duty be sufficient to <hi>another,</hi> or <hi>to all.</hi> 2. Or <hi>de gradu,</hi> Whether this <hi>degree</hi> be sufficient against a greater degree or sort of <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 3. Or as men use to distinguish Grace and Help by numerical Acts and Hours, Whether the Grace of this Hour and Act be sufficient for the <hi>next,</hi> or for <hi>all?</hi> The sence of all these Questions is distinct.</item>
               <item>7. But his last and greatest difficulty will be, to tell you truly and plainly <hi>what is that Grace</hi> which is the subject of his Question, of its <hi>sufficiency</hi> in the <hi>general nature</hi> of it, and as related to the thing which it is called <hi>sufficient</hi> to.</item>
            </list>
            <p>§. 32. For, by Grace he meaneth, 1. Either somewhat <hi>ex parte Dei agentis,</hi> 2. Or <hi>ex parte effecti,</hi> or, 3. <hi>Quid medium;</hi> 1. Grace, as it is in God the Agent; 2. Or as it is in Man the Recipient; 3. Or as it is somewhat <hi>between</hi> both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59334:114"/>§. 33. I. <hi>Grace,</hi> as it is in God, is nothing but <hi>his Essence,</hi> not as <hi>Essence,</hi> but as an <hi>essential Power, Intellect and Will denominated by Connotation from the effect:</hi> This is commonly agreed on: God doth operate <hi>per essentiam,</hi> and not by <hi>Accidents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 34. II. If they mean any <hi>mediate thing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Effect, either they speak of the <hi>first</hi> effect or a <hi>second,</hi> and so on: If they speak but of secondary effects, and the meaning be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether one effect be a <hi>sufficient Cause</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they mean either an <hi>outward</hi> or an <hi>inward</hi> Grace or Effect. If an outward, then the sence of the Question is, Whether some other Work of God be sufficient to move the Will of Man? And then it must be told what other Work you mean: Whether an Angel, or the Planets, or the Word or Preacher, or an outward Mercy or Affliction, or what it is? But if you speak of the very first effect, then the fancy is almost proper to <hi>Aureolus</hi> among the Schoolmen, to think that there is something from God antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the <hi>Creature</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> which may be called <hi>Action</hi> or <hi>Energy,</hi> or <hi>Efflux,</hi> which is neither the Creator nor a <hi>Creature,</hi> neither <hi>Cause</hi> substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial nor <hi>Effect,</hi> but <hi>Causation:</hi> As if some Beam of <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> went from God to produce every Creature and Motion, which is neither God, nor the <hi>Creature,</hi> or <hi>Motion.</hi> But this is commonly and justly rejected, as feigning a <hi>third sort of Entity</hi> between God and the <hi>Creature,</hi> which it passeth the wit of Man to conceive of what it should be.</p>
            <p>☞ And if God do <hi>immediately per essentiam,</hi> cause that <hi>middle Entity,</hi> or <hi>Action,</hi> or <hi>Force,</hi> which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59334:115"/>
he saith is <hi>no Creature,</hi> why may he not as well immediately <hi>per essentiam,</hi> cause the <hi>Creature</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> it self? This therefore cannot be the thing meant by <hi>Grace</hi> in this Question.</p>
            <p>To question the sufficiency of God's Essence is intolerable: To question the sufficiency of a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate divine Efflux</hi> or <hi>Action,</hi> which is between God and the Creature and Effect, is to dispute in your Dream of a <hi>Chimera,</hi> an unproved, and a disproved, and commonly-denied Entity. To dispute of the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of Angels, Scripture, Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to work Grace, is not the thing commonly intended in this Controversie of <hi>Grace:</hi> Each several sort of <hi>means</hi> may be <hi>sufficient</hi> in its own kind and to <hi>its own use;</hi> but no one of them is sufficient to the effect. But if you will put the Question as of <hi>All together,</hi> it must be so explained.</p>
            <p>§. 35. III. The Grace therefore meant in this Question can be no other than either <hi>some effect</hi> on the <hi>Soul,</hi> as tending to a <hi>further effect,</hi> or the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>comprehension of necessary extrinseck means.</hi> If the former be meant (as it is by almost all School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Disputers of this Case) then, 1. It must be enquired, <hi>Whether such a thing be?</hi> and, 2. <hi>What it is if it be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 36. 1. <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> and some that go his way, do deny the being of any such thing as we now dispute of; and say, That <hi>God's essential will,</hi> as a <hi>will,</hi> is the <hi>immediate Efficient,</hi> and the Act of Man is the <hi>Effect,</hi> (<hi>e. g. Faith,</hi>) and because God willeth that Act, it doth immediately exist, as the World did, by his creating will: And so here is no place for the Dispute of <hi>Sufficient Grace:</hi> For <hi>God's Will</hi> is certainly <hi>sufficient</hi> to cause what he will cause: And Man's Act either is <hi>existent</hi> or <hi>not:</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59334:115"/>
And there is no Grace antecedent to it, to be called insufficient, unless you will vainly say, that Gods essential Will is sufficient to nothing but what he preduceth, which is a Dispute unfit for sober men.</p>
            <p>§. 37. 2. But because the contrary Opinion is far more common, that there is an inward <hi>Grace</hi> (<hi>e. g.</hi> to <hi>believe or consent</hi>) antecedent to our Act, whose <hi>sufficiency</hi> is questioned, it poseth the Wits of all the Schoolmen (much more is it above many Contenders that never so much as studied it) to say, <hi>what it is.</hi> The Notions of <hi>Alvarez</hi> (who calls it <hi>motus</hi>) and of <hi>Vasquez,</hi> and others I have elsewhere considered, and here pass by: And I have shewed, that I take it to be so far past man's reach, as to be unfit for hot Contention. But so far as we may conceive of it, it must be in this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion: 1. As it is some <hi>Divine Impress</hi> on the Soul, which is Analogus to the <hi>Vis impressa</hi> received from the Mover in the Patient in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Motion. 2. That this <hi>Impression</hi> received, doth <hi>in primo instant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> put the Faculty into such an immediate <hi>Ability</hi> to the <hi>Act,</hi> or such a state of <hi>Disposedness</hi> to the Act, as may be called a <hi>Moral Power</hi> (the natural Faculty being supposed) and puts the Will in such a state as to the act of Consent, as that it <hi>can do</hi> it, but is not necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to it, nor actually determined, but <hi>can</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. And this is called <hi>sufficient Grace.</hi> 3. And in the next instant when the <hi>Will doth consent, God and Man</hi> are both <hi>Causes</hi> or <hi>Agents,</hi> and the Grace is <hi>effectual</hi> by both Causes, God the first, and Man the second.</p>
            <p>§. 38. 2. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> and some others seem to think that God doth not operate <hi>immediately</hi> on
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59334:116"/>
mans Soul, as to <hi>proximity of Causation,</hi> but <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> on <hi>superiour Causes</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> (as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Word, Objects,</hi> &amp;c.) and that when all means are duly ordered, man may be said to be <hi>able</hi> in his meer <hi>natural powers</hi> for the Act, because those <hi>means</hi> are now <hi>Grace sufficient</hi> to <hi>excute it.</hi> And that when <hi>one Means</hi> of an hundred is wanting, it is insufficient Grace.</p>
            <p>§. 39. We all confess, that God worketh by <hi>means,</hi> and we cannot name an Act on us, which he always or ordinarily doth without <hi>any means,</hi> or second Cause. And we acknowledge that there are <hi>gracious means,</hi> and that ordinarily these must have a sufficiency in their kind: But withal we must say, that God worketh immediately as to proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Causation, when he worketh not so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately as without second Causes: And that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>means,</hi> or <hi>without means</hi> (as he pleaseth) there must be such a <hi>Disposition</hi> communicated to a depraved, undisposed Soul, as shall be a <hi>moral power,</hi> and put it into an immediate capacity to consent (or act): And to dispute the sufficiency of the <hi>means,</hi> is one thing, and to dispute the <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of this inward <hi>Disposition</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And this must be the question.</p>
            <p>§. 40. The common disputed question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all men have Grace <hi>sufficient to believe?</hi> which must be negatively answered; They have not. Those that never heard the Gospel, have not.</p>
            <p>§. 41. But, 2. have all that <hi>hear the Gospel</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grace to believe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No: many of them are hardened by former sinning, so as to be set at a greater distance and enmity, than many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59334:116"/>
            <p>§. 42. But, <hi>3ly.</hi> All the World hath Grace (or merciful Help) sufficient to enable them to do <hi>less evil,</hi> and <hi>more good</hi> than they do, and to use <hi>some means</hi> better than they do, which tend to further Grace. And they that do not this, are justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied further Help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 43. 4. But the sticking difficulty is,</hi> Whether any men in the World have Grace sufficient to repent and believe savingly, who do not?</p>
            <p>To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. The Question is of less moment than it's commonly made to be; seeing those are unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable who use not that Grace which was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their foresaid <hi>use of means,</hi> and less <hi>resistance</hi> to God's Grace: 2. But certainly to answer the question negatively or affirmatively, I cannot; as not knowing any more of Gods working on mens Souls, than he himself hath told us of. 3. But if we may conjecture upon Probabilities, it seemeth to me most likely, that <hi>there is such a sufficient Grace or Power to repent and believe savingly</hi> in some that use it not, but perish. For, 1. if <hi>Angels had, and used</hi> such a <hi>sort</hi> of Grace: 2. And if <hi>Alam</hi> had such a sort of Grace, and used it a while: 3. And if <hi>unregenerate</hi> men have such a <hi>grace</hi> for lower Acts, which tend to Faith: 4. And if the <hi>Faithful</hi> have <hi>such a grace</hi> to <hi>do more good, and less evil than they do:</hi> 5. It seemeth very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that only to the fifth Instance (to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe</hi>) none in the World should have such a <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 44. And though <hi>Iansenius</hi> seem very singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in denying that there is now any such <hi>sufficient grace of Christ</hi> in the World, which is not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al either to believe, or to do any other good; that is, That <hi>Christ's grace enableth no man to do any more</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59334:117"/>
               <hi>good than he doth;</hi> yet indeed it is most in <hi>two am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Words,</hi> that <hi>Iansenius</hi> differeth from others, (though many unskilful Disputants suppose it to be much more material a difference) <hi>viz.</hi> 1. In one Syllable [GOOD.] For he will call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>good</hi> in man's Actions, but <hi>Holy Love and its Effects;</hi> and so saith, That no unsanctified Man <hi>doth good,</hi> and therefore hath not Grace sufficient to do it. But moral [<hi>Good</hi>] is taken in three Sences (or Degrees) 1. <hi>Good, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid,</hi> in <hi>a degree not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi>
               <note place="margin">See of this my Discourse of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Faith.</note> And so Infidels and ungodly Christians have some good. 2. <hi>Good, secundum quid, vel imperfectum,</hi> but in a <hi>degree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant.</hi> And so the Godly do <hi>good,</hi> though mixt with evil. 3. Good in <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>unmixt</hi> with evil: and so none do good till they are perfected in Glory. (To say nothing of [<hi>essential simple Good per se, and independant;</hi>] for so none is good but God only.) And all this is the Effect of Grace.</p>
            <p>§. 45. 2. But, saith <hi>Ian senius,</hi> there is some <hi>grace</hi> which is not <hi>grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christi,</hi> the <hi>grace of Christ;</hi> and such is all that cometh from meer <hi>fear</hi> without <hi>Love,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>providential</hi> preparatory <hi>grace,</hi> but not the <hi>grace of Christ. Ans.</hi> It is not that <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>special</hi> grace of <hi>Christ:</hi> But to think that it befalleth men <hi>without Christ's procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and is not a commoner sort of Christ's grace, when all Power in Heaven and Earth is put into his Hand, and he is made Head over all things to the Church, is below a Christian Divine to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and too injurious to Christ. But by all this it appeareth, that even <hi>Iansenius</hi> differeth from others more about the Names of [<hi>Good</hi>] and [<hi>Christ's Graces</hi>] than about the <hi>Matter.</hi>

            <p>§. 1. SO much is said, Chap. 9. of Mans <hi>natural Power</hi> and <hi>Free-will,</hi> and so much now, Chap. 13. of <hi>grace,</hi> and the Power given by it, as may allow me to be short in what is here to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>§. 2. All that <hi>natural Power</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> which was essential to the Will, remaineth in it since the Fall: For Man is of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the same <hi>Species.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. The <hi>Will</hi> is still a <hi>self-determining Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> supposing, 1. God's necessary Influx, as he is the first Cause of Nature, 2. And the Being and convenient Position of Objects, 3. And the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Intellect, 4. And the concourse of necessary concomitant second Causes.</p>
            <p>§. 4. The three Faculties of mans Soul are all vitiated by sin. 1. The <hi>vital active Power</hi> is so far dead to God and Holiness, as to need the cure of <hi>quickening,</hi> and <hi>strengthening,</hi> and <hi>exciting</hi> Grace. 2. The Intellect is so far <hi>blinded,</hi> as to need the cure of <hi>illuminating grace.</hi> 3. And the <hi>Will</hi> is so far turned by Enmity from God, to the inordinate Love of <hi>carnal self-interest</hi> and Creatures, as to need the cure of <hi>converting, sanctifying</hi> Grace.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Grace healeth the Will of this Enmity and vitious perverseness, so far as it prevaileth; which is, 1. common Grace enableth it to common good, and prepareth it for better. 2. Special Grace causeth it actually and habitually to will and love
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59334:118"/>
special Good; that is, God as God, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for God, and Holiness as his Image. 3. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter Grace bringeth up the Will to perfecter ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acts and Habits.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Nature it self is not in lapsed man, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested of all <hi>moral</hi> or Divine Principles, Abilities, and Inclinations: In the Intellect there are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Notices</hi> of <hi>a Deity;</hi> that is, That there is <hi>one God</hi> who is <hi>infinitely powerful, wise, and good:</hi> And in the <hi>Will</hi> there are some Inclinations still to <hi>good as good,</hi> and therefore to <hi>God</hi> as far as he is truly conceived of <hi>as good;</hi> and so far as that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is not conquered by a cross Conception of some Enmity: And so of other Good.</p>
            <p>§. 7. <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>common Grace</hi> may cause a man to go as far in Love and Religion, as those whom we call the <hi>highest Hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>almost-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> may do (which our practical Preachers do frequently tell the People at large in Books and Sermons.</p>
            <p>§. 8. Such may have a common sort of <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ (even formerly to the working of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles), and of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> and of <hi>good Desires, and love to goodness</hi> and <hi>good Men;</hi> yea, to God himself.</p>
            <p>§. 9. For men are not so corrupt by <hi>Nature</hi> (much less under the Effects of <hi>common grace</hi>) as to hate <hi>all goodness,</hi> or to hate all that is in God: They may <hi>love God</hi> as he is the Almighty Creator, Preserver, and Natural-Orderer of the World, and the Cause of its Being, Motion, Beauty, Harmony, and all natural Good: And they may love him as he is the <hi>Giver of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and all natural Blessings to themselves, and as he is the Preserver of them, and their only Security and Help in Danger, and not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59334:118"/>
only as his Blessings gratifie their Senses, but as all their Hope of everlasting Happiness is in his Power and Love: They may love him as he doth this good to others also, and is the common Benefactor to the World, without whom it could not subsist a moment. And they may love him as he maketh such Laws as preserve their lives, and Properties, and Rights, from Fraud and Violence, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king other Men conscionable just, and charitable to all, do both gratifie themselves, and tend to the common Order, Peace, and Welfare of Societies, and of Mankind.</p>
            <p>§. 10. I am not able to confute or deny what <hi>Adrian</hi> (afterwards Pope) hath written (in his <hi>Quodlibets</hi>) That an unsanctified Man (not in a state of Salvation) may so far <hi>love God,</hi> even <hi>above himself,</hi> as to consent rather <hi>to die,</hi> and be <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi> than (were it possible) <hi>God</hi> should be <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated,</hi> or not be God. For a Heathen might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to die for his Country: And he is a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And he that knoweth that if there were <hi>no God,</hi> there could be <hi>no World,</hi> no Being, Motion, Knowledge, Goodness, or Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the World; besides, that which is worse, the Cessation of the Infinite Good himself; must be yet more unmanly, if he would not rather be <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated</hi> alone (if <hi>per impossible,</hi> you suppose he could live alone) than all this greater Evil should come to pass. He that tells men, that they shall be saved, if they would rather be annihilated, than that there should be no God, doth make them a promise which God hath not made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59334:119"/>§. 11. But (as the same Author observeth) that which the unholy cannot do, is, to <hi>love God as God,</hi> as the <hi>ultimate Object,</hi> and <hi>most amiable Good</hi> to be <hi>known, and by Love and Holiness enjoyed,</hi> and pleased by a holy <hi>Soul;</hi> and this above all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual terrene Delights, and to love him as the holy Ruler of the World, who forbiddeth all sinful sensuality, and all mens inordinate Conceits, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, Delights, and Practices, and requireth holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and purity of Mind, and Life, and Sobriety, and Temperance, and Self-denial in all that will be saved. And as he is a just Judge who will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all these Laws, and condemn the ungodly to endlers Misery. They love not God, as he is the <hi>holy Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

And consequently they love not his Laws, and other means by which this is to be done: Because <hi>loving</hi> the <hi>pleasure</hi> of their <hi>Lusts,</hi> and being averse to things spiritual, high and holy, they love not that holiness and rectitude in themselves, which God commandeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§. 12. Though God, as the Fountain of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, continue the natural power and liberty of the Will, yet its <hi>moral Impotency, Pravity,</hi> or ill <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> by which it is <hi>averse</hi> to Holiness, and prone to Sensuality, must be cured by Grace; where <hi>common Grace</hi> and <hi>special,</hi> cause <hi>common</hi> and <hi>special Effects</hi> in the Cure.</p>
            <p>§. 13. The moral <hi>Power</hi> given by Grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in the <hi>right Disposition of the Will,</hi> is not of the same <hi>kind</hi> with the <hi>Natural Power</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:</hi> And the Words [<hi>CAN</hi>] and [<hi>CANNOT</hi>] used of both sorts, have not the same signification,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59334:119"/>
but are equivocal; otherwise <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> should change mans <hi>Species.</hi> Those Disputants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that confound them for the <hi>sounds sake,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Auditors.</p>
            <p>§. 14. We must say then, That <hi>quoad vires, vel potentiam naturalem,</hi> every man <hi>can believe,</hi> who hath <hi>the use</hi> of <hi>Reason, Objects revealed,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck necessary Causes; that is, He wanteth not the <hi>natural Faculty</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> nor needeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>natural Faculty,</hi> but only the <hi>Excitation, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination,</hi> and <hi>right Disposition</hi> of that which he hath: But as to the said <hi>right Disposition,</hi> or <hi>moral Power,</hi> no one <hi>can</hi> truly <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> without that Grace which must so <hi>dispose</hi> him: Common Grace must dispose him to a common Faith, and special Grace to a saving <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 15. It is more proper to say, That an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, and unholy Sinner <hi>will not repent and believe,</hi> than that he <hi>cannot;</hi> though that also may be truly said, if well explained. But the meaning is not, that <hi>he cannot, though he sincerely would:</hi> Nor yet that <hi>he cannot be willing, for want of the natural Power of willing:</hi> But, 1. That he hath a <hi>Logical,</hi> and, 2. A <hi>moral Impotency;</hi> that is, an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition;</hi> he wanteth both <hi>Disposition, Habit,</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> but not the <hi>Faculty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. It is an abusive miscarriage of those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants, who in the Words [<hi>CAN</hi>] and [<hi>CANNOT</hi>] use to confound not only, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral Power,</hi> but even <hi>Logical</hi> also, which is <hi>neither,</hi> and signifieth no more but that <hi>in ordine probandi;</hi> such <hi>Premises</hi> being put, the <hi>Conclusion Can</hi> or <hi>Cannot</hi> follow: For so it may be truly said, That <hi>no man can do, speak, or think any other than he doth; and nothing can ever come</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:59334:120"/>
               <hi>to pass, but what doth come to pass;</hi> even from Gods <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> this will follow: For seeing <hi>nothing ever will be otherwise than God foreknoweth it will be,</hi> a Disputant will say, <hi>It can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;</hi> but he must only mean that <hi>posita praescientia divina,</hi> the Conclusion <hi>cannot</hi> be true, that the <hi>Event will be otherwise:</hi> when yet as to the nature of <hi>Causation,</hi> we must say, <hi>sensu physico &amp; morali,</hi> that it <hi>Can be otherwise</hi> oft-times, though it <hi>will not</hi> be otherwise.</p>
            <p>§. 17. These things considered, it appeareth that we are commonly agreed as followeth: 1. That all Men have <hi>natural Powers</hi> and <hi>Free-will to good,</hi> even <hi>spiritual good;</hi> that is, Whenever such <hi>good is chosen</hi> or <hi>willed,</hi> it is done by the <hi>natural Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty;</hi> and when it is not willed, it is not for want of a <hi>natural Faculty,</hi> but its <hi>due Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 18. 2ly. That as to <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Law-power</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> all men have much more than <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> granted them by God to repent and believe. For Helps and a Command are more than <hi>Leave</hi> or <hi>Liberty:</hi> But <hi>Liberty</hi> from the Penalty for sin, belongeth only to the pardoned.</p>
            <p>§. 19. 3ly. That as to <hi>Ethical Power</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> which lieth in a right <hi>Disposition</hi> of mans Faculties, every man hath it so far as Grace hath prevailed, and wrought it in him, and none any further.</p>
            <p>§. 20. Or as Liberty is denominated from the Evil which we are free from, 1. All mens wills are free from being <hi>constrained</hi> to sin, 1 By <hi>natural</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the faculties themselves; 2. Or by the <hi>senses;</hi> 3. Or by <hi>Objects;</hi> 4. Or by <hi>Men;</hi> 5. Or by <hi>Devils;</hi> 6. Or by <hi>God:</hi> Because the rest <hi>cannot</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59334:120"/>
and <hi>God will not;</hi> no, not physically premove and predetermine it thereto.</p>
            <p>§. 21. 2. The wills of all men are free from any <hi>Commands to Sin:</hi> that is, God cannot <hi>command it</hi> (for else it were no Sin) and if men command it, their <hi>Commands</hi> are <hi>null,</hi> and lay no obligation on the will to obey them.</p>
            <p>§. 22. 3. We are free from sinful <hi>Dispositions</hi> so far as Grace freeth us, and no further: Therefore by common Grace men have common Liberty, and by special Grace saving Liberty; but none perfect Liberty here; and no unsanctified man hath <hi>saving Liberty</hi> of Will: that is, such by which he is duly disposed to such acts as have a flat Promise of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And where now doth our difference re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 23.</hi> Obj. <hi>The difference is,</hi> Whether a bad man can change his own will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Your [<hi>can</hi>] meaneth the <hi>natural Power,</hi> or the <hi>due disposition:</hi> As to the first, <hi>he can,</hi> that is, he hath those facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which <hi>want</hi> not <hi>natural Power</hi> to act better: But as to the latter, he <hi>cannot without Grace,</hi> that is, through indisposition he will not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 24.</hi> Q. But is not Grace the only cause of the Change?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Grace only causeth the first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press on the Soul, which moveth it to act; but the Soul (or will) it self is a Cause of the Act, else it were not Man but GOD that doth repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 25. Q.</hi> But is it Grace or Free-will that is the chief Cause?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Grace no doubt: Which is commonly acknowledged by the several Parties.</p>
            <p>§. 26. The very marrow then of all the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Power and Liberty of the <hi>Will,</hi> is that so often before mention'd, Whether Man's
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59334:121"/>
               <hi>Will</hi> be made of GOD such a self-determining Power, as <hi>can truly do any more good than it doth, or forbear more evil, without any more Grace from God, than that which it hath while it doth no more:</hi> And whether ever the Will can and do make a various use of the same degree of Divine Assistance: And this as is said, is confessed of the Angel's Case and <hi>Adam</hi>'s: For if <hi>Adam</hi> had not <hi>Power</hi> to have stood when he fell, by the same Grace that was given him, but fell because God withdrew or with-held such necessary Grace without which he could do no other than he did, we may then lay by these Controversies, and think how to answer Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
            <p>§. 27. Those persons that make others odious by their revilings, for <hi>holding Free-will,</hi> or <hi>denying Free-will,</hi> without telling men what <hi>Freedom</hi> it is that they mean (<hi>natural, ethical, legal</hi> or <hi>logical,</hi> Freedom from <hi>Coaction, necessitating Premotion, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination,</hi> or <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious Disposition, &amp;c.</hi>) should be rebuked by the Lovers of Truth and Peace, as the Peace-breakers of the Church and World, that presume in their proud ignorance to reproach others for that which they understand not.</p>
            <p>§. 28. They that say, That the Liberty of the <hi>Will</hi> as natural is not violated, but by <hi>Coaction,</hi> and that <hi>Coaction,</hi> is nothing but making a man <hi>will against his Will</hi> in the <hi>same respect and act,</hi> and so that to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>will freely</hi> is all one, and that to <hi>will</hi> by <hi>Coaction</hi> is a contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>nil</hi> the same, and that God predetermineth all mens wills to all sinful habits and acts <hi>in specie</hi> as circumstantiated, by immediate, necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or unresistible premotion, and yet taketh not away their Liberty, because he maketh them <hi>will</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59334:121"/>
and not <hi>nil</hi> the sin. These do but play with the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Free-will,</hi> and are confuted as aforesaid from the instance of <hi>Adam,</hi> and from the scope of Scripture, and do subvert the Foundations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. To <hi>will</hi> is the proper act of <hi>my will;</hi> and if he that moveth me by prime physical effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to will the circumstantiated act of Sin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me not of my Liberty, because it is <hi>willing</hi> that he maketh me do, then if Men or Devils had Power to make me <hi>will Sin,</hi> as I cause my Pen to write, or the Fire to burn this or that, it would be no loss of Liberty. But of this more largely elsewhere.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of Effectual Grace, and how God giveth it.</head>
            <p>§. 1. AS I said before about Sufficient Grace, so here about <hi>Effectual;</hi> the first thing to be done by Disputers, is, to agree what that is which they here call [<hi>Grace</hi>] as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Question. And as I there shewed, 1. It cannot or must not be <hi>God's essential Will or Power,</hi> for that is simple and immutable, and not in it self (save <hi>relatively</hi>) distinguishable into <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>effectual.</hi> 2. An <hi>Efflux</hi> or <hi>vis,</hi> which is neither God nor the Effect, there is <hi>none,</hi> or none prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 3. It is not <hi>Faith</hi> it self that is meant here by Grace, for it is the Grace <hi>that effecteth Faith;</hi> and it were absurd to ask what Faith is effectual to make or cause it self: This is true both of the Act and Habit. The meaning is not, what <hi>Habit</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:59334:122"/>
of Faith is effectual to the Act, nor what Act to the Habit or it self, but what <hi>Grace of God</hi> is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to <hi>cause both</hi> Act and Habit. 4. Therefore there is nothing left to be meant by Grace, but the two things before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>gracious Means</hi> or <hi>second Causes</hi> appointed by God to cause our Faith. 2. The first <hi>moving Impress</hi> on the Soul, as it is antecedent to Act and Habit, (supposing that such there is, <note n="*" place="margin">Some say, that <hi>God</hi>'s meer will causeth man's act, as <hi>willing</hi> it, without any other Influx or Impress on Man's Will, save our Act it self effected: But though it be only God's essential will, which is the first Cause, yet the thing received by us from God seemeth to be a certain Impress, Impulse, or <hi>vis,</hi> or Disposition to act in order of Nature, before the act it self, which Impress sometime is made uneffectual by a prevalent Indisposition or Resistance of the Will.</note> though some deny that there is any such thing.)</p>
            <p>§. 2. And for the first, <hi>all means</hi> will be uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual without God's inward Operation by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: He must work on the Speaker and on the Hearer, to make means effectual, as is agreed on. But whether as God worketh in <hi>Naturals</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>aptitude</hi> of <hi>natural second Causes,</hi> so he work <hi>Faith</hi> and other <hi>Graces</hi> by a <hi>settled propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Concourse,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Aptitude of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious second Causes</hi> (or Means of Grace) is a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too hard to be boldly and peremptorily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by us that are in so much darkness.</p>
            <p>§. 3. But it seemeth to us, that God would not have made it so great a part of his Government to establish a <hi>Course of Means,</hi> if he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to work <hi>ordinarily by them,</hi> and according to their fitness. <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>chief Means,</hi> and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth the rest; <hi>Scripture, Ministers, Example, good</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59334:122"/>
               <hi>Company, merciful Providences, Afflictions, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Books, Prayer, Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> are all appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for such effects: And if God would <hi>ordinarily</hi> work <hi>immediately without means,</hi> what need all these? This teacheth Infidels to say, that he may do it <hi>without Christ.</hi> The Spirit first indited the <hi>Word</hi> (as we cut a Seal to be the instrument of Impression) and then by that word doth work on Souls.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But if God did tie himself not only <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,</hi> but <hi>alwaies</hi> to <hi>apt means,</hi> no mortal could say <hi>what means</hi> is <hi>sufficient,</hi> and what is <hi>insufficient,</hi> and what is <hi>more than sufficient,</hi> even <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily efficacious:</hi> For the <hi>means,</hi> 1. are very <hi>many</hi> and more than we can take notice of; and if <hi>one</hi> be wanting, it may render the rest insufficient or uneffectual, how excellent soever in themselves. 2. And that means is fitted to <hi>one</hi> Hearer that is not fitted to <hi>another:</hi> All have not the same tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, hindrances, prejudices, objections, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, nor obstinacy: And God only knoweth when <hi>means</hi> are adequately fitted to the desired effect upon mens Souls.</p>
            <p>§. 5. And though <hi>many</hi> of the means operate <hi>ex parte sui, necessarily,</hi> yet so do not <hi>all:</hi> For <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Instructers</hi> are <hi>free Agents,</hi> and so it must be <hi>other effectual means</hi> that must first <hi>move them</hi> to do <hi>their Duty</hi> for a Sinner's good: Which who can judge of?</p>
            <p>§. 6. But God is the <hi>Arbitrary Absolute Lord</hi> of <hi>all means,</hi> and therefore he can change and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of them as he pleases, and yet <hi>work by them.</hi> So that the Effect is nevertheless from God's free or arbitrary Volition, though he never went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the aptitude of means: When even a silly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59334:123"/>
man can turn the natural course of Water and Wind to move his Mill or Sails at his pleasure, without any alteration of their natures: A Fisher can use his Bait as may serve his end; and a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician can vary his Medicines to cure the Disease without changing their <hi>nature,</hi> or curing <hi>without them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. But there is no question but God <hi>can</hi> work <hi>without means,</hi> and <hi>Intellectual Souls</hi> being so near to the <hi>first Cause,</hi> it is utterly uncertain to us, whether in Works of Grace God have not a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble operation on the Soul, one <hi>by</hi> his <hi>appointed means,</hi> and another by <hi>immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Though before I shewed that this seemed not necessary to all acts of Man, &amp; will not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw <hi>Durand.</hi>
               </note>; and if it be so, how <hi>these concurr</hi> to one and the same effect, and also <hi>how</hi> God doth <hi>immediately move Souls,</hi> are all past Man's reach, and should be acknowledged above our Disputes.</p>
            <p>§. 8. II. God hath more inward operations on Man's Soul than one or two (whether with means or without) to bring us to Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: The <hi>mind</hi> must be <hi>enlightened,</hi> the <hi>dull faculties</hi> must be <hi>excited,</hi> especially <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> must be touched with the gust of <hi>Divine Love</hi> to breed a holy <hi>Complacency</hi> in good, and many <hi>Impediments</hi> must be removed, some by outward acts of Providence, and some by inward Grace. And where Impediments are not removed, no doubt but there needeth more of the other Acts of Grace, to bring such a Soul to Faith and Repentance, than in one where there is less resistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:59334:123"/>§. 9. And seeing that <hi>Recipitur ad modum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis,</hi> and the disposition of the Recipient hath so great a hand as common Experience telleth us in almost all the Changes in the World, (what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful variety of Effects doth the same Action of the Sun produce throughout the World, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>receptive dispositions</hi>)? Therefore no mortal man can say <hi>when</hi> the efficacy or success of Divine Grace is more to be ascribed to the <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Disposition</hi> of the <hi>Recipient</hi> by a former act of Grace, and when more to the <hi>present moving Influx?</hi> nor what <hi>proportion</hi> these alwaies bear as comparable. And what man dare say that he can search out the waies of God?</p>
            <p>§. 10. When we know so little of the secret Energies of <hi>natural Principles,</hi> nor how God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>Animals</hi> in the Womb, nor how he causeth our Food to nourish us, nor how any of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses do their Office, nor how our Souls do use the Corporeal Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when Christ hath told us, That <hi>the Wind bloweth where it listeth,</hi> and <hi>we hear the sound of it, but know not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; and so is he that is born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. Should not this, with the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and consciousness of our Ignorance, suffice to keep us from bitter Contendings about that which is certainly beyond our reach, and from presumptuous boldness with the unsearchable things of God?</p>
            <p>§. 11. Whether you will with <hi>Bradwardine</hi> and many others say, That it is God's meer <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition</hi> that effecteth all things <hi>ad extra;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will say with the most, That it is not his <hi>Will alone,</hi> but his <hi>Will</hi> as operating by his <hi>executive Power,</hi> the meaning seemeth to be the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59334:124"/>
same, and the difference to be but notional, as is aforesaid: For they that speak in the first man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, mean, That it is not God's Will as in it self immanently considered, but his will as going forth to <hi>produce an</hi> effect; which emanation or exertion is, from the effect, called by those that speak in the second manner, <hi>God's Executive Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 12. The prime Reason of the Effect, is God's <hi>Wisdom, Will,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> as the Cause: And so the prime reason why Means and Grace become effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual whenever they are effectual, must be from God the prime Cause.</p>
            <p>§. 13. The <hi>first Impress</hi> on the Soul moving it toward the Act (<hi>e. g. Faith</hi>) is the <hi>first Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> (<hi>sub ratione effecti</hi>): And this God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self worketh on man as on a <hi>meer Patient;</hi> tho' not antecedently to all former acts of Man, or all preparative dispositions, (usually) yet ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to that Act of Man to which it moveth: So that as to this, 1. Man is passive, 2. and the Divine Operation (or the <hi>powerful Will of God</hi>) is not only sufficient but effectual; for that <hi>Impress</hi> or <hi>Motus</hi> is effected.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Though <hi>God</hi> being a <hi>Spirit</hi> moveth not by such Contact as <hi>Bodies</hi> do on each other, yet must we conceive of his motion, and the motion of all <hi>Spirits on Bodies,</hi> as <hi>analogous</hi> to corporeal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, and as a motion by Efflux and eminent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of Virtue and Essence, according to the more excellent nature and operation of Spirits; or else we cannot conceive positively of them.</p>
            <p>§. 15. It is already proved, that God useth <hi>various degrees</hi> of <hi>Impress</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> on Souls; of which some do by their <hi>proper power</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> so ascertain the effect, that the Argument is alwaies
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59334:124"/>
good as <hi>a causa,</hi> [where-ever God doth <hi>so move,</hi> there the Effect (that is the Act, <hi>e. g. Faith</hi> or <hi>Consent</hi>) followeth: And this Grace is effectual <hi>ex propria vi vel virtute:</hi> But that God sometime ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth by a <hi>less Impress</hi> or <hi>Motion,</hi> which doth not from its own <hi>force</hi> inferr the effect, but so far disposeth the Mind or Will to the Act, that the <hi>man can do it without any more grace;</hi> which is it that is called <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>§. 16. It is a thing not to be believed, that this <hi>latter degree</hi> of <hi>Divine motion</hi> is <hi>never eventual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effectual</hi> to the Act: Seeing, 1. it is granted, that there <hi>is such</hi> a Power in Man's Will as <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> act in some cases by <hi>that degree</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> called Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: And <hi>frustra fit potentia quae nunquam reducitur in actum.</hi> 2. And it's granted, that the Angels and <hi>Adam</hi> did act by such help. Therefore as to acts <hi>preparatory before special Faith,</hi> few do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they are all done by such Grace as is necessarily effectual <hi>ex propria vi</hi> alone, but that <hi>sufficient Grace</hi> leaveth them often to Man's Will.</p>
            <p>§. 17. Therefore all that remaineth, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve what is the reason of the certain effect when we believe? To which I say, 1. It is ever an effect of <hi>two Causes</hi> (at least) God's <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>man's faculty,</hi> and so both must be said to be the <hi>Cause</hi> of the effect. 2. But <hi>man's will</hi> is <hi>no Cause</hi> (save a <hi>recipient Cause</hi>) of God's <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Impress.</hi> 3. God sometimes, at least, maketh so <hi>powerful an Impress,</hi> as doth <hi>necessarily determine man's will,</hi> by a Necessity consistent with his Liberty. 4. It cannot be proved by any man, that <hi>no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth</hi> by that <hi>sufficient Motion,</hi> which doth not <hi>necessarily</hi> determine his will; seeing many <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory</hi>

               <hi>acts</hi> are done by such a motion. And it's probable that it is oft so. 5. But the certainty of this, or when and how oft it is so, no man can know.</p>
            <p>§. 18. But by which degree of Grace soever the effect be produced, still God's Will is the <hi>chief cause</hi> of it; which can procure the effect <hi>infallibly,</hi> when it doth not <hi>necessitate:</hi> Yea, and his <hi>premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>impress</hi> called <hi>Sufficient,</hi> is incomparably more the cause than Man's Concourse is; though God leave some part of the Causation to man's Free-will.</p>
            <p>§. 19. But when the Effect doth not follow, that is, when men <hi>believe not,</hi> it is <hi>man's will</hi> by <hi>omission</hi> and <hi>resistance,</hi> that is the chief cause, and culpable, and not God's omission or non-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
            <p>§. 20. The same degree of divine Impress or Motion, which prevaileth with a Soul predispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by common Grace, is not enough to prevail with some others that are ill or indisposed: Though God's <hi>Absolute Will</hi> and <hi>Answerable Operation</hi> would prevail with any, how bad so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the State of Heathens and others, that have not the Gospel.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THE opening of the several Laws or Covenants of God before, hath taken up most that is necessary to be said about this
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59334:127"/>
point: The question, Whether any but <hi>Christians are saved,</hi> is agitated on both sides by so much the sharper Censures, by how much the nearer it seemeth to concern the Fundamentals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>§. 2. On one side some say, That nothing is more fundamental than <hi>God's Nature,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> and the Attributes which belong to him in respect to each: And they say, That for God to be the <hi>Ruler</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor</hi> of the World, and to be also<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 5, 6, 7. Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>Love it self,</hi> and a <hi>Rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> are our Fundamentals; which are not consistent with this, That all the World since <hi>Adam,</hi> except a few Believers or Jews and Christians, that were born from <hi>Adam,</hi> under as <hi>absolute a necessity</hi> of being remedilesly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as of dying.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Here they use first to consider of the <hi>number, viz.</hi> 1. That it is not past the <hi>sixth part</hi> of the World that are called <hi>Christians.</hi> 2. That the far <hi>greatest part</hi> of these (perhaps twenty to one) have not competent <hi>means</hi> to understand <hi>what that Christianity</hi> is which giveth them their name, and which, as to the <hi>name,</hi> they profess. The <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassians, Mengrelians,</hi> and other <hi>Georgians,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> the <hi>Cossacks,</hi> the most of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Abassines,</hi> yea, and <hi>Papists,</hi> besides the <hi>Copties, Syrians, Nestorians, Iacob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes, Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> Christians of St. <hi>Thomus, &amp;c.</hi> and too many <hi>Protestants</hi> are bred up in so great ignorance, that multitudes of them never are sufficiently taught to understand the <hi>Essentials</hi> of the Christian Religion which they (nominally) profess; and therefore
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59334:128"/>
are really much in the case of common Heathens.</p>
            <p>§. 4. 2. They consider their <hi>impossibility</hi> of <hi>being saved:</hi> For it is not only <hi>morally</hi> (by Vice) but <hi>naturally impossible</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> that which was never <hi>heard, read or understood:</hi> So that their Damnation seemeth unavoidable, especially to such as live in the vast Countries of <hi>America,</hi> and much of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> that are quite out of the reach of any Instructions for the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>§. 5. 3. And lastly, they consider the <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>mercifulness</hi> of God, declared in his Word, and in his great and manifold mercies to all the World, and that he would have a righteous man to be merciful even to his <hi>Beast,</hi> much more to the <hi>Bodies of Men,</hi> and most of all to their <hi>Souls,</hi> and that our Rule and Motive is, <hi>Be merciful as your Heavenly Father is merciful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 6. And they think that the contrary-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by <hi>over-doing,</hi> are the greatest Hinderers of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and Promoters of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> while they make it seem so contrary to <hi>God's</hi> own <hi>Attributes,</hi> and to <hi>humane Interest,</hi> and to be a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine not of <hi>glad</hi> but of <hi>saddest</hi> tydings to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>viz.</hi> That none shall be saved that hear not the Gospel, when it is few comparatively that ever heard it or can hear it.</p>
            <p>§. 7. On the other side it is thought a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>undermining of Christianity,</hi> to say that it is not <hi>absolutely necessary to Salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 48. Mark. 16. 16. Joh. 3. 36. Joh. 14. 6. Ro. 10. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mat. 11. 27. Luk. 10. 22. Mat. 16. 17. Rom. 1. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 2. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3. Rom. 8. 1, 9, 13. Luk. 19. 10.</note> and that any besides <hi>Christians</hi> may be saved: And it seemeth to them to be contrary to Christ's words, that <hi>He</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59334:128"/>
               <hi>that believeth not, shall be damned;</hi> and that <hi>He is the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> and <hi>no man cometh to the Father, but by him.</hi> And <hi>how shall they call on him on whom they have not believed,</hi> &amp;c.? No <hi>man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him,</hi> &amp;c. And it seemeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> to say, That any are saved out of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 8. In this great Controversie, that which must satisfie us, is to agree in so <hi>much as is certain,</hi> and to leave that which is <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>unknown, undetermined:</hi> For we shall know it never the more for a confident pretending that we know it, when we do not.</p>
            <p>§. 9. And here the first thing to be enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is, <hi>What Law of God the World that heareth not of Christ,</hi> is now under, as the Rule of Duty and of Judgment. And then, 2. to enquire, Whether they so keep that Law, as to be saved by it? We can say nothing to the second, without the first.</p>
            <p>§. 10. And we have here nothing to doubt of, but, 1. <hi>Whether they are under any Law or none?</hi> 2. <hi>If any, Whether it be the Law of Innocency as made to Adam, or the Law of Grace?</hi> 3. <hi>And if the Law of Grace, whether of the first or second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> It must be one of these.</p>
            <p>§. 11. And, 1st. It is certain, That <hi>they are under a Law</hi> (and not only under a <hi>Physical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> as a Ship at Sea, or Brutes are): For else God were not their <hi>Ruler,</hi> and they his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> so much as by <hi>Right</hi> and Obligation; and then they were bound to <hi>no Duty,</hi> nor in hope of any <hi>Reward,</hi> nor in <hi>Danger</hi> of any <hi>Punishment</hi> for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59334:129"/>
Disobedience: For <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Transgression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 12. It is certain, That they are <hi>not under the Rule of the Covenant of Innocency made to</hi> Adam, or <hi>the Law of Innocency, as containing the Precept, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miant and penal parts,</hi> which is the same with the Covenant as <hi>offered.</hi> This I proved before: (Though I was long ignorant how far that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was repealed, till Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi>'s Papers (which I laboured to confute) did begin to enlighten me.) God now saith to no man [<hi>I give thee life on condition thou be personally innocent, and perfectly obedient:</hi>] Nor doth he say [<hi>I command thee to be perfectly innocent, sinless, and obedient, that thou ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st live:</hi>] For no man is a Subject capable of such a Command or Promise, being already a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>§. 13. If any should think that they are under the <hi>bare preceptive part of the Law of Innocency,</hi> with the <hi>penal part,</hi> without any <hi>Promise,</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miant part,</hi> or <hi>hope of life,</hi> this is certainly a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.</p>
            <p>Because, 1. God hath no such Law, nor never had, which hath no <hi>Promise,</hi> or <hi>premiant part;</hi> and is not in a Covenant-form, what he doth by the <hi>Devils,</hi> belongeth not to our Question; but as to Men, they must be under a Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> or of <hi>Grace.</hi> And it were a hard Conceit to think, that the far greatest part of Mankind had <hi>never any means</hi> to use for their Salvation, nor any thing <hi>to do for it,</hi> but were under a <hi>meer Sentence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair</hi> and <hi>Damnation,</hi> as the <hi>Devils</hi> are, without any <hi>offer of Help</hi> or <hi>Hope;</hi> and consequently that none of them all are <hi>guilty of refusing any such Mercy,</hi> or neglecting any such <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:59334:129"/>2. The very nature of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> tell us, That if God command any Duty, it is that the Subject may be the <hi>better for it;</hi> and he never saith to any [<hi>obey me perfectly, and thou shalt be never the better for it.</hi>]</p>
            <p>§. 14. Besides, the very <hi>Precept</hi> is not in force in that sence as it stood in the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for so it bound only <hi>innocent Man to keep his Innocency:</hi> But God saith not, <hi>Keep that which thou hast lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 15. Obj.</hi> God is not bound to change his Law, if man sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I answered this before, That God is not the Changer: But the Law will not <hi>continue</hi> to be a <hi>Law,</hi> but by continuing to signifie God's <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Will:</hi> And it cannot so signifie his governing Will, when there is <hi>no Subject</hi> to be a <hi>capable ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus:</hi> So that it ceased, <hi>cessante capacitate subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, vel cessante termino.</hi> To say, That the Law still signifieth what <hi>God would have had man do</hi> while he <hi>was capable,</hi> is true; but that saith no more but that [<hi>It was once a Law, and now is none:</hi>] For so it may do by <hi>the dead,</hi> yea, were they <hi>annihilated,</hi> even tell others what God would have had them do, but this is not a <hi>ruling Act;</hi> but <hi>Lex transit in sententiam.</hi> And to say, <hi>That at least the Law bindeth a Sinner to perfect Obedience for the time to come,</hi> is to say, That it <hi>binds not as the Law of Innocency,</hi> but as some other Law, of which we are enquiring.</p>
            <p>§. 16. And it is a clear Truth (before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) That God brought <hi>all Mankind in</hi> Adam <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law and Covenant</hi> of Grace, founded in the <hi>Promise of the Victory of the Woman's Seed:</hi> And his <hi>dealing</hi> with <hi>all men</hi> ever since, doth fully confirm
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59334:130"/>
it. And this Law made to Mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> was never repealed to the World, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a perfecter Edition to those that have the Gospel. Therefore we have two Questions here to consider. 1. <hi>What Law the World was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before Christ's Incarnation: And,</hi> 2. <hi>whether Christ repealed it to them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 17. 1st. And it is proved, That on God's part the said Law of Grace continued: And <hi>man's Disobedience</hi> could not here <hi>nullifie</hi> the Law, as it did that of Innocency: Because it was a Law that allowed Repentance till the time of Death: So that when they sinned never so much, they were still obliged by it to <hi>repent,</hi> that they might be saved. Their Rebellion deprived them of the Benefit, but did not end the Law, nor rendered them uncapable of its Obligation. God made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and after him the Heads of Families his Priests: He had then publick Worship natural, and instituted sacrificing, and the distinction of clean and unclean Beasts, Sabbath and Marriage, as well as calling on the Name of the Lord, are expressed: As the Covenant to <hi>Noah</hi> was the same with that to <hi>Adam,</hi> with some small Addition, so no doubt were the Precepts of <hi>Noah.</hi> As the <hi>Canaani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> sacrificed, so their marrying in the prohibited Degrees, is called one of their Abominations: It's very probable, that not only the Decalogue in sence; but also all, or most of the particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical Precepts, which are but the Instances, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and Applications of those Generals, were given before the Flood; and some more, which even the Nations Traditions kept some remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of, though not named particularly in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:59334:130"/>§. 18. And it was not God's Covenant of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> that ended it to the rest of the World (as I before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.)</p>
            <p>§. 19. So that though there be difficulty in opening the <hi>Terms</hi> of the Law of Grace, as it stood to all Mankind besides the <hi>Iews,</hi> there is no difficulty to prove, that it did indeed so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
            <p>§. 20. And that <hi>Christ</hi> hath not repealed or <hi>nullified</hi> that Law of Grace to the World that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the Gospel, which they were under be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming, is evident. 1. Because he came for the <hi>Benefit,</hi> and not the <hi>Destruction</hi> of the World, to make their Condition <hi>better,</hi> and not <hi>worse:</hi> But had he nullified that Law of Grace to all the World, and given them no better in its stead, save to a few, he had come directly by himself to take away their Mercies, and make them miserable. For it is certain, that though the Apostles Commission was to <hi>preach the Gospel to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>every Creature,</hi> yet it is comparatively but a small part of the World that ever heard it, or had the means to know and believe in Christ. And all the rest were under a <hi>Law of Grace before,</hi> and therefore <hi>are so still.</hi> 2. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed that Law, by <hi>which Act</hi> did he do it? Not by <hi>making a better Edition,</hi> for that could not have any such Effect to them that never did, or could know of that Edition: And there is no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to be found in Scripture. 3. And if the Law of Grace be nullified to all the World that hear not the Gospel, are they since under <hi>any Law</hi> of God, or <hi>none;</hi> if none, they are either <hi>no Men</hi> or <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men;</hi> for they are <hi>no governed Subjects:</hi> If they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59334:131"/>
are under <hi>any, what is it?</hi> The <hi>Law of Innocency</hi> I have proved it is not: And the GOSPEL (or <hi>second Edition</hi> of the Law of Grace) it is not: For that cannot oblige where it never is promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate: It being a <hi>supernatural</hi> Revelation, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to none to whom it is not (directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly) sent: Therefore it is evident, that Christ leaveth <hi>such under that Law which he found them under.</hi>

            <p>§. 21. What this Law to the World contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, having before opened, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. §. 3. I shall not repeat it, but only here add, 1. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that though this Law make <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> for the future to be <hi>a Duty</hi> (to them and us) yet not to be the <hi>Condition of Salvation;</hi> but that it doth hereto accept sincerity. 2. That it maketh not the particular Articles of our present Creed about Christ's person, Birth, Life, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, heavenly Intercession in our Nature, <hi>necessary to their Salvation:</hi> For before Christ's Coming, no Jewish Believers could believe, That <hi>this Iesus,</hi> in his demonstrable <hi>Person,</hi> is the <hi>Christ,</hi> but that <hi>Christ</hi> should <hi>come:</hi> And after he had long taught them, and pronounced them blessed, the Disciples knew not that he must <hi>die, rise, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, interced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> in Heaven, <hi>come again,</hi> &amp;c. 3. It is certain, that all that the Prophets had any way foretold of Christ to the <hi>Iews,</hi> was not of absolute necessity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> to the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves to be understood, much less to the World that never heard it: For Christ proved out of the Prophets, That he was to <hi>die, and rise, and so to be glorified;</hi> when yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> had not understood it till that time. And the Jewish Believers had very dark

            <p>§. 22. And it is certain, that when the Messiah <hi>was come,</hi> they were not bound to believe that <hi>he was yet to come</hi> (though they knew not of his coming) because it was then an Untruth.</p>
            <p>§. 23. The proclaimed Name of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. and 14. and 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11. do seem to be the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the true Sence and Tenour of that Law of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. which the World before Christ's coming, was under, and yet is, where the Gospel cannot be had.</p>
            <p>§. 24. The Texts that say, <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned,</hi> plainly refer to such as hear the Word to be believed, and speak of the Unbelief of what is revealed, and not of what is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
            <p>§. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. saith no more, but that no man <hi>can believe in Christ</hi> without the Revelation of him by <hi>preaching</hi> or declaring; and that no man that heareth, can be saved without <hi>believing</hi> in him, nor no man saved at all without that Faith, which the Law that he is under, maketh necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But if all were damned that <hi>believed</hi> not <hi>that this Iesus is personally the Christ,</hi> all before his Incarnation must be damned: But if <hi>not all before,</hi> then the same thing was never made necessary after to all that could not possibly hear of it.</p>
            <p>§. 26. The same I say of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>No man cometh to the Father, but by me.</hi> 1. No man is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59334:132"/>
to God, and <hi>pardoned,</hi> and hath <hi>right to life</hi> (in all Ages of the World) but for the <hi>sake</hi> of the <hi>meritorious Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of Christ, as promised, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. before, and performed after: But this was the part of God and our Redeemer, which he promised in his part of the Covenant, and performed: For <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself, not imputing to them their sins,</hi> (so far forgiving them, as to make an Act of Grace and Pardon, which he committed to his Ministers to proclaim,) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. But, 2. on <hi>mans part</hi> it is not the <hi>knowledge and belief of this Iesus incarnate personally,</hi> that was made necessary to all before his coming, and therefore not to all after. No man ever came to the Father, but by the <hi>Son's Merit and Spirit;</hi> nor without a <hi>consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Belief and Affiance</hi> in God's redeeming or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, pardoning, saving Mercy, and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a sanctified Soul, which is in love with God and goodness: And whatever was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary in the terms of the first Edition of the Covenant of Grace, even to all the World before Christ's Incarnation. But Christ never meant, that <hi>no man before his Incarnation</hi> (or since, that heard not of him) did come to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without believing that which the Apostles themselves long believed not, after they followed Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 27. <hi>The rest of the World</hi> were not bound to know so much of the Messiah as the <hi>Iews,</hi> as having not the same Revelation.</p>
            <p>§. 28. 1. Having proved that it is a Law of Grace that all the World is to be <hi>ruled</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> by, it remaineth to be enquired, Whether any of them <hi>that have not the Gospel, do keep the Conditions</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59334:132"/>
               <hi>of this Law,</hi> and so <hi>are justified by it, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, 1. That being a matter of <hi>fact,</hi> it is not of so great Importance for us to be certain of it, as some imagine: And who can be certain of the Affirmative, unless the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirm it; when if we knew all the World, one man cannot be certain of anothers Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And much less can any be certain of the <hi>Negative,</hi> without Scripture Negation, seeing no man can know every man in the World, and every Heart.</p>
            <p>§. 29. 2. But it is exceeding <hi>probable,</hi> at least, That God would never govern many hundred parts of the World (compared to the <hi>Iews</hi>) before Christ's Incarnation, and five sixth parts since his Incarnation, by a Law of Grace, which yet no person should ever have effectual Grace to keep as far as was necessary to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Every <hi>Law of God</hi> is a <hi>Means,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth the Subjects the use of much Means for their own Salvation: These means they are bound to use, and shall be condemned, if they use them not; and that none should ever use them savingly, is an Assertion so unlikely, that he that hath the boldness to affirm it, should bring certain Proof of it, which the Scripture; I think, doth not afford him.</p>
            <p>§. 30. But what <hi>numbers</hi> do perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and are saved, no mortal man can tell: But in general we know, that God usually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>Congruity to his appointed means,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that <hi>far fewer are saved</hi> where <hi>less means</hi> is vouchsafed, than among <hi>Christians</hi> who have herein the unvaluable <hi>pre-eminence</hi> above others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59334:133"/>§. 31. For as the Jews had both the common <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and also the <hi>Covenant of Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity,</hi> setting them above all others; so the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church</hi> hath both the <hi>common Covenant of Grace,</hi> and by the <hi>second edition</hi> of it a Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity;</hi> both sealed by <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as the Jews Covenant was by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and the Passover: Yea, our Covenant. Privileges set us above the World, incomparably higher than the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ws were.</p>
            <p>§. 32. Yet should we take warning by the example of the Jews Pride, who were so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that none were saved or beloved but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they despised the rest of the World, and provoked God to cut them off, and call the Gentiles into higher privileges: So some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians so trust to their <hi>Gospel-Peculiarities,</hi> (as the Jews did to their <hi>Law</hi>) that they despise all the World besides themselves, and can easilier believe that God will damn a <hi>thousand millions</hi> that never heard the Gospel than <hi>one</hi> of them, who have no more real Holiness, than many of those whom they despise. But it is our Duty to be thankful both for our excellent <hi>Peculiarities,</hi> and also for the <hi>commoner Mercies</hi> unto others.</p>
            <p>And I wish the impartial Reader to study, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 10, 11. whether even this be not the sence, [<hi>Nor will I accept an Offering at your hand, for from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place Incense offered to my name,</hi> and a pure Offering: <hi>For my name is great among the Heathen, saith the Lord of hosts; but ye have polluted it.</hi>] Our Translators have, as Expositors, thrice (at the least) added the future Tense [<hi>shall be</hi>]. But

It's strange, that all the ancient Churches should misunderstand it. It seems more probable by the Context that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the <hi>present Tense</hi> (none being expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.)</p>
            <p>§. 33. If we might imitate our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> (who <hi>yet saw Christ's day and rejoiced</hi>) we should suppose the <hi>number of the saved</hi> through the world, to be very considerable: For as I said elsewhere, though God had told him, that <hi>Sodom</hi> was so <hi>much worse</hi> than the rest of the World, that God would destroy it, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> thought there might be <hi>fifty righteous persons</hi> there. It's like he thought not worse of the rest of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 34. Obj.</hi> You seem to make the rest of the World happier than the Iews; for they had a Law that would justifie them, and so had not the Iews.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The second assertion is false: The Jews were under the Law of Grace, which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the Promise,</hi> and might be justified by it, and had greater helps to know and keep it than the rest of the World had. But when they foolishly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated their <hi>Mosaical Law</hi> from the <hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>common Law</hi> of <hi>Grace, Paul</hi> tells them, by the Deeds of <hi>that Law</hi> no flesh could be justified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 35. Obj.</hi> Do you not thus confound the World and the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No: I ask you, Did he confound them before Christ's Incarnation, who thought that more than the Jews were saved? Certainly no: No more do I now.</p>
            <p>§. 36. The word [<hi>Church</hi>] is sometime taken so properly and strictly, as to signifie only those
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59334:134"/>
that are <hi>under the Covenant of Peculiarity:</hi> And so the Jews before Christ's Birth, and Christians since, make up the <hi>Church,</hi> (and some few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps before the <hi>Iews Covenant.</hi>) But sometimes it is taken more largely, for the Kingdom of God: For all that are in a <hi>state of Salvation,</hi> under the several editions of the Law of Grace. And so <hi>Iob</hi> and his Friends, and <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> and many others, before, and all now that love God and Holiness sincerely, are of the Church. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly by the [<hi>World</hi>] is meant, either, 1. All Men as under the <hi>Redeemer's Law of Grace, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to their Consent;</hi> and so all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>God's Kingdom,</hi> as <hi>subditi obligati.</hi> 2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> that refuse Consent: And so they are of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by obligation, but condemnable for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: And these are the [<hi>World</hi>] in the worst sence. 3. <hi>Consenting Subjects</hi> under the <hi>Common Law of Grace,</hi> who yet were <hi>not Iews,</hi> nor are not in the Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity:</hi> And such are in a <hi>state of Salvation,</hi> though not in the <hi>Church of the peculiar</hi> (as the Subjects of <hi>Melchizedeck, Sem, &amp;c.</hi>) and so are both in the <hi>Church</hi> and in the <hi>World,</hi> in several sences.</p>

Having delivered that in this great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion which seemeth to me agreeable to God's Word, I advise those that use to assault such things with reproach, which they find reproached by their Party, to remember, that God is Love, and Christ is the Saviour of the World, and the Pharisaical Appropriators of Mercy and Salvation, do seldom know what spirit they are of.</p>

            <p>§. 14. Whatsoever Law Men are under, before Christ or since, Jew or Gentile, Works or Grace, no man can be saved and happy without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; that is, unless they be devoted in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59334:136"/>
and Love to GOD and Goodness.</p>
            <p>§. 15. No man can be damned that is <hi>holy,</hi> while such; nor can God hate and make misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble those that truly love him and his governing Will.</p>
            <p>§. 16. Yet a person that is <hi>holy</hi> may <hi>deserve Damnation,</hi> by deserving to be <hi>denied that help of</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by which his Holiness must be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And as to be <hi>saved</hi> is to be perfectly <hi>sanctified,</hi> so to <hi>deserve Hell,</hi> is to <hi>deserve to be forsaken,</hi> to the <hi>

                  </gap>al loss of Holiness.</hi> And so though it be hard for us to know whether <hi>Adam</hi>'s first loss of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was a <hi>total loss of Holiness,</hi> yet if it were not, it was a forfeiture of <hi>divine help,</hi> and so a <hi>mediate</hi> loss of it. And so a man that loveth God sincerely, may by great Sin <hi>deserve</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Spirit, and therefore we must pray for the pardon of such desert for the sake of Christ, though we cannot be damned or miserable while holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 17. Obj.</hi> But how doth God love a holy Soul if he forsake him, and with-hold his Spirit? And if he be not loved of God, he is miserable? If he be loved, he will not be forsaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Answer this your self as to the Case of the Angels and <hi>Adam.</hi> God loved them, and yet not so as to secure them from the loss of Grace: But he so far loved them efficiently, as to give them that grace by which they <hi>could persevere;</hi> but not that by which they necessarily <hi>should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe;</hi> and he loved them complacentially, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the goodness which was in them, and yet they lost it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 18. Obj.</hi> That is because they were left to their Free will, and had but sufficient Grace, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59334:136"/>
not efficacious determining Grace: But it is now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with all true Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> True Believers have not determining <hi>efficacious Grace,</hi> to <hi>prevent all sin,</hi> nor all such sin as <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Peter</hi> did commit: And that sin deserveth an answerable desertion of God, it being a deserting him first so far: And though God pardon it, yet the <hi>desert</hi> is presupposed to the pardon; for it is <hi>desert of punishment</hi> that is pardoned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 19. Quest.</hi> If a man were holy, (that is, an obedient Lover of God and Goodness) without Faith in Christ, would that save him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Covenants of Grace requireth various degrees of Faith, according to its several editions and promulgations: It is not the same degree of Faith, as to the Objects extensively, which was required of Jewish Believers before Christ's Incarnation, as is now of us, nor the same degree that was required of all the rest of the World as of the Jews. 2. But such a Faith in God our Redeemer as that Law which men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der maketh necessary to Salvation, is necessary to Holiness: And to ask what God will do with a man that is <hi>holy</hi> without Faith, is to talk of a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent Subject: There is no such man; for <hi>without Faith it is impossible to please God: for he that cometh to God must believe that God is, and that he is the Rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> notwithstanding original and actual Sin, and the Law of Innocency condemning us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he is under a <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>rewarding Law of Grace, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. No man can be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified without the <hi>Merit, Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor without that degree of Faith which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59334:137"/>
the Covenant which he is under requireth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 20. Quest.</hi> What if a man that was sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by believing, should retain his Holiness, or Love and Obedience, and lose his Faith in Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a thing that never was nor will be; and not to be disputed of.</p>
            <p>§. 21. <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> in the proper sence of the word, is the same thing as <hi>Holiness</hi> taken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensively, as containing our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to God, and to man for God's sake: But as <hi>Holiness</hi> is taken narrowly for our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> as distinct from our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to Man, so <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> is the <hi>genus,</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> the chief <hi>species</hi> of it. And thus we take <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> and <hi>Moral Action,</hi> and so all <hi>Morality,</hi> as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from <hi>Physicks</hi> or things meerly natural, not falling under the <hi>genus moris:</hi> And so Virtue and Vice (or Sin) are all that is <hi>Moral,</hi> that is, <hi>Moral Good</hi> and <hi>Moral Evil:</hi> And this is the first and most notable sence of the word.</p>
            <p>But some of late have used <hi>Moral</hi> as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct from Holiness or Grace, or from infused Habits, or from Faith and Christianity; and some tell us confidently but falsly, That this is the most fit and famous sence, and the word so to be taken when not otherwise explained. It's the sad case of Mankind, that we have no words but what are liable to ambiguity: And it's the unhappiness of the Church that hath so many Teachers that will dispute, write, and wrangle about words unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and in the end shew, that under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers terms they mean the same matter in which they are agreed and know not their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:59334:137"/>§. 22. As <hi>Holiness</hi> is sometimes taken so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to comprehend all that God commandeth, and sometimes for the natural part of our Duty (Love and Obedience) as distinct from Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the mediate Grace, and of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural revelation; so is <hi>Morality</hi> or <hi>moral Virtue</hi> distinguished.</p>
            <p>§. 23. They that take <hi>moral Virtue</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 8. 2 Pet. 1. 3, 5. Pro. 12. 4. 31. &amp; 31. 29.</note> so narrowly and improperly, as to mean no other <hi>moral Virtue</hi> than <hi>Heathens</hi> had, or than is taught in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Ethicks, should first tell us, That this is their sence; and then they may boldly declaim against those Preachers that take this for sufficient; or that preach no other: For Scripture and Christianity were to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose if they taught us no more than the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Philosophers do.</p>
            <p>§. 24. And no doubt but it is a pitiful sign and an odious Crime in a Minister of Christ, to say little to the People of the Mysteries of Man's Redemption, the Person, and Offices, and Works of Christ, the Covenant of Grace, and the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Blessings given by it, our Union with Christ, Justification, Adoption, and the special Works of the Spirit on Mens Souls, and all the Duties and Pleasures of a Heavenly Conversation, in the love of the Father, the Grace of the Son, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit, and all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of magnitying and preaching up the <hi>Love of our Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Charity to the Poor,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Temperance;</hi> as if <hi>Man</hi> were our <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>to wrong man</hi> were the only <hi>Sin,</hi> and to <hi>wrong God</hi> were <hi>none,</hi> or God could be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies wronged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:59334:138"/>§. 25. But <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> contradicteth their own Doctrine: For among their <hi>good works</hi> those of <hi>Piety</hi> are first extolled; and those are the <hi>enriching</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and that is <hi>themselves;</hi> and why them more than the poorer People about us? Because they are <hi>sacred persons,</hi> and <hi>belong to God,</hi> and <hi>serve at his Altars?</hi> Very good. And is <hi>Piety</hi> to a <hi>sacred person</hi> (and such as <hi>they</hi>) so great a Duty, and yet our <hi>Piety</hi> as <hi>immediately to God himself,</hi> an <hi>indifferent thing,</hi> in comparison of our Duty to <hi>Man?</hi> Yea, some usually make that part of <hi>their Piety</hi> which consisteth in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their own <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>unnecessary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,</hi> to seem of great weight, while the holy observance of <hi>God's own Laws</hi> is perhaps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused as too much <hi>preciseness</hi> or <hi>hypocris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s;</hi> when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Hypocrite is he, that instead of the life and serious practice of true Christian-Holiness, sets up and resteth in the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and certain <hi>formalities,</hi> that are lifeless, to deceive himself and others.</p>
            <p>§. 26. Where there is no <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love to God,</hi> nor Duty done in <hi>obedience</hi> to God, there is no true <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> but somewhat <hi>equivocally</hi> so called, whatever good such may do to the Common-wealth or to their Neighbors; for it wanteth the <hi>principle, end</hi> and <hi>object</hi> that should inform it.</p>
            <p>§. 27. An <hi>Hypocrite</hi> may be said to have <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> as he may be said to have <hi>Holiness,</hi> that is, only <hi>secundum quid,</hi> yea, but <hi>analogically;</hi> yea, but <hi>equivocally,</hi> in that he hath no other sort of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 28. An <hi>Infidel's moral Virtue,</hi> and all unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Heathens or other persons, is of the same sort only with this described of the Hypocrite:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59334:138"/>
And they err not that say, They have no true <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> but <hi>analogical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 29. Yet <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>common Grace</hi> do give <hi>men</hi> that which is <hi>truly good</hi> (and not only <hi>minus malum</hi>) and may do much good to others, and some to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and is truly laudable and amiable, considered without the mixture simply in it self: But because the contrary evil is still the predominant part in all the unsanctified, it will not properly denominate them <hi>good men,</hi> nor the whole <hi>action</hi> a <hi>good action,</hi> save equivocally, analogically or <hi>secundum quid;</hi> because the form denominateth, which is here wanting.</p>
            <p>§. 30. But if any one think otherwise, that the name of <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> yea, or <hi>Holiness,</hi> is due to the <hi>best actions</hi> or <hi>habits</hi> of <hi>Heathens, Hypocrites,</hi> or any <hi>unsanctified men,</hi> it is but a Controversie <hi>de nomine,</hi> and no otherwise to be regarded, while we agree of the things signified by that name.</p>
            <p>§. 31. It is certain, that now there is no <hi>moral good,</hi> in any man on Earth, that is not the effect of some <hi>Grace of God,</hi> common or special; for even <hi>Nature</hi> now as <hi>reprieved,</hi> and <hi>maintained</hi> is an effect of <hi>common Grace;</hi> much more further gifts: But it is perverseness in some School-men, who make <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Grace and <hi>special</hi> (at least as to <hi>Faith</hi>) to be differenced only in the <hi>Causation,</hi> one being not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi> and the other <hi>infused,</hi> but the same in act, and so that no man can know whether he have infused or acquired Faith (which some call but a <hi>Moral Virtue.</hi>)</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the necessity of Faith in Christ, where the Gospel is made known.</head>
            <p>§. 1. INfidels take scandal from Christ's making <hi>Faith in himself</hi> to be so necessary to our Salvation, as if it tended only to his Honour, and were in its own Nature of no necessity to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, but arbitrarily made so.</p>
            <p>§. 2. And their reason also against this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, is, because <hi>believing</hi> is an act of the <hi>Intellect;</hi> and <hi>Intellection</hi> is not <hi>free,</hi> and in its self is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Act. A man cannot know or <hi>believe</hi> what he <hi>would,</hi> no, though he most earnestly desired it: And will God condemn men for that which they fain would do, and cannot? Especially when mens intellectual Capacities do so greatly differ, that some seem to differ but little from the Brutes.</p>
            <p>§. 3. This Scandal ariseth from their not well understanding the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of our <hi>Faith in Christ.</hi> 1. They falsely suppose it to be only an Act of the <hi>Intellect</hi> (where many Divines have given them the Scandal.) 2. They falsely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, That the Intellect herein is <hi>necessitated</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. 3. And they consider not the <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Uses</hi> of our Faith.</p>
            <p>§. 4. 1. The true nature of our <hi>Faith,</hi> is our <hi>Trusting in Christ,</hi> as <hi>our Saviour, who hath reconciled us to God, by his Sacrifice and Merit, that he may bring us to God, by Iustification, Adoption, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Glory.</hi> It containeth <hi>Assent, Consent,</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:59334:139"/>
and <hi>Affiance,</hi> though through penury of Words, we are fain to call it by some one of these names oft-times, as the occasion requireth: But indeed the very sence of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>fides,</hi> and <hi>Trust,</hi> includeth all. And when the Act of the Intellect only is named, it is as including, or informing both the other.</p>
            <p>§. 5. 2. Though the Intellect be not <hi>free</hi> of it self, it is <hi>free</hi> by participation, being <hi>quoad exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum,</hi> under the Empire of the <hi>Will</hi> that is free. And the Will by commanding it to <hi>act, search, think,</hi> of the Evidences of Verity, may do so much towards the specifying of the Act, as that the meer <hi>weakness of Understanding</hi> without the fault of a <hi>vicious Will,</hi> shall keep no man in damnable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
            <p>§. 6. For Christ hath many ways provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>meer Weakness</hi> of our <hi>Understanding:</hi> 1. By the <hi>fewness</hi> and <hi>plainness</hi> of necessary Articles of Faith: 2. By the fulness of <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> 3. By <hi>great Means and Helps</hi> for our Faith, which he appointeth: 4. And by the powerful Helps of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is ready to illuminate us by these means.</p>
            <p>§. 7. No man was ever yet known, that could say [<hi>I have done my best to have obtained Faith, and did not obtain it.</hi>] Though many can say, <hi>I earnestly desired to believe, and could not:</hi> Because those may desire it, that yet use not the means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and faithfully, and that indulge their own Prejudices, or carnal Lusts, which hinder it.</p>
            <p>§. 8. 3: In the saving of Sinners, there is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: 1. The great Benefits <hi>already given</hi> in the Purchase, <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Covenant:</hi> 2. The <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Benefits offered,</hi> and to be received hereafter:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59334:140"/>3. The <hi>Means to be used</hi> on our part for obtaining them. 4. The <hi>danger</hi> and <hi>loss,</hi> if we miss of them. 5. The <hi>ultimate End</hi> of him that giveth them.</p>
            <p>§. 9. And, 1. will not any reasonable Infidel confess, That <hi>Thankfulness</hi> is naturally due for great and inestimable Benefits? And how can a man be <hi>thankful</hi> for that which he <hi>believeth</hi> not was ever done for him, or given him? Or can he be <hi>thankful</hi> to he knoweth not <hi>whom?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. 2. Do not <hi>great Benefits freely offered,</hi> require <hi>Acceptance?</hi> And how can a man <hi>accept</hi> of that which he <hi>believeth</hi> not was ever purchased, procured, or offered him? Will you <hi>accept</hi> a <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. 3. Christ never meant to carry Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards asleep to Heaven, but to save them in the <hi>use of his appointed means.</hi> 1. They must <hi>learn</hi> and <hi>obey his Doctrine;</hi> and can they <hi>obey</hi> it that <hi>believe</hi> it not? 2. They must take <hi>Heaven</hi> procured by a <hi>Redeemer</hi> for their <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Portion,</hi> and love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and seek it above all: And who will do this, that believeth it not, and the Word that promiseth it? 3. They must <hi>take Christ</hi> for their <hi>Guide,</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> and <hi>Intercessor,</hi> to bring them thither; and they must forsake all here that stands in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, that they may obtain it: And can you do this, and not <hi>believe and trust</hi> him that must save you? Will you venture your life in the Hands of a Physician, and take his Medicines, if you <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> not that he hath <hi>Skill and Will to cure</hi> you? Will you leave your Country, and follow one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Seas, that promiseth you a Kingdom, if you <hi>trust</hi> him not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:59334:140"/>§. 12. 4. And who will avoid Sin, Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Hell, that believeth not him that tells them of the evil, and of the danger that is before him?</p>
            <p>§. 13. 5. And God can have no lower <hi>End ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately</hi> than <hi>Himself,</hi> and the Glory of our <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> is more excellent than <hi>mine</hi> or <hi>yours.</hi> And therefore if <hi>We</hi> have the <hi>Salvation,</hi> it is meet and necessary that <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Redeemer</hi> have the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Thanks,</hi> the <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Yet hath not God <hi>arbitrarily</hi> made <hi>Faith</hi> more necessary than it is in the true <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Aptitude</hi> of it to its Ends. He hath not made to all a <hi>Faith</hi> so necessary of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi> and therefore though <hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>Ideots</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actually believe, they may be saved by Christ: And though those before Christ believed not all that we must now believe, nor the Gentiles before, so much as the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet neither of them were thereby excluded from Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 15. Quest.</hi> Hath not Christ made the Case of Christians harder than it was before his Incarnation, to Believers, by making so many more Articles of our Faith, and those of necessity to our Salvation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No, no more than it is our Misery to <hi>accept</hi> of <hi>more Mercies</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> than were offered to others. Our <hi>Belief</hi> is not of numerous unnecessary difficulties, but it is of such <hi>things</hi> as we must <hi>receive,</hi> and be Partakers of; it is the means of our <hi>use</hi> and <hi>fruition:</hi> Who would take it for a Misery to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> that the King will give him a Lordship, or that a rich Man will give him so much Money, if he will come and thankfully accept it? Every act of <hi>belief</hi> is but a <hi>means</hi> to some <hi>Benefit</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:59334:141"/>
            <p>§. 16. As Christ is the way to the <hi>Father,</hi> and the Mediator is to bring us unto God, so <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ is the <hi>Mediate,</hi> or healing Grace to help us to <hi>Holiness,</hi> or the <hi>Love</hi> of God, which being its End, is as much more noble than <hi>Faith in Christ:</hi> And <hi>Faith kindling Love to God,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> and <hi>Love kindled by Faith,</hi> is the Sum of the Christian Religion. And it is no <hi>Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Christ and Faith in him,</hi> to be taken for a <hi>Means;</hi> or to trust him, as one that will save to the uttermost all that come to God by him.</p>

What measure of Glory, and holy intellectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations Infants shall have after Death, we know not; but we have reason to judge, that they shall not be like <hi>Brutes,</hi> nor so unintelligent as in the <hi>Body,</hi> nor sleep in an unactive Potentiality; but be, intellectual Agents.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The Conceits of a middle state of those unbaptized, as having <hi>poenam damni,</hi> and not <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam sensus,</hi> we know not what to make of, unless they suppose them to be not <hi>actually,</hi> but only <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially intelligent:</hi> For one that is deprived of <hi>true felicity,</hi> must by <hi>knowing</hi> it, have the sense of his Privation. Nor do we find in Scripture any Proof
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59334:141"/>
of their middle State, however Reason may think it congruous.</p>
            <p>§. 3. They that think all Infants saved, go on these different grounds: 1. Some think that they <hi>have no sin:</hi> But if <hi>Pelagians</hi> could prove that, it would be no Proof that they shall have <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Happiness.</hi> 2. Others think that <hi>Christ hath pardoned them</hi> all that sin which was derived from <hi>Adam:</hi> But either they mean, that his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> immediately pardoned it; or that he hath pardoned them all by the Covenant, or Law of Grace. But, 1. Christ's Sacrifice and Merits are given to <hi>God for Man,</hi> and pardon no man immediately, but only <hi>Merit</hi> a <hi>pardoning Covenant.</hi> 2. And that Covenant doth indeed <hi>in tantum,</hi> pardon all men as far as <hi>common Mercy</hi> amounteth to (for the remitting any part of the punishment, is so far to remit the sin.) But the saving-pardon in question, it giveth to no man <hi>actually</hi> before the <hi>Condition</hi> be performed; for it is but a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pardon: Therefore as no one at age, so no Infant hath any Pardon given him by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that I can find, but only conditionally.</p>
            <p>§. 4. All grant, That the Covenant pardoneth the Adult only <hi>conditionally;</hi> and if it should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>all Infants absolutely,</hi> their Condition would be so much more happy than that of the Adult, as is not consistent with what Scripture, Reason, and Experience speaketh. And there is no such thing said of them in the Word of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be believed.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Those that think not <hi>all Infants</hi> (so dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to be <hi>saved and glorified,</hi> are also of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral minds. 1. Some think that <hi>none are glorified,</hi> as being uncapable Subjects (whom I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59334:142"/>
the labour to confute, nor to open the ill Consequents of it.) 2. Some think, that <hi>some</hi> are <hi>glorified,</hi> but <hi>none</hi> are <hi>positively punished</hi> with the <hi>poena sensus.</hi> These seem to me less rational than the former: For either Infants will have actual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection, and answerable Joys and Sorrows, or not: If not, the former, who reduce them all to meer <hi>Potentiality,</hi> or the state of Brutes, are in the right (of whom some will have them to be <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reo,</hi> and some are for their Transmigration, and return to Earth.) If yea, then as one part will have rational Joys, the other must have rational Sorrows, unless some <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> to Earth, or some <hi>middle state,</hi> be better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than I have yet seen.</p>
            <p>§. 6. 3. Some think, that all that are <hi>baptized, are saved,</hi> and no other, (though the rest have no Pain.) But, 1. this is not suitable to the Nature of God, as a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and as most <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> nor yet to the Tenor of his Word, to lay mens <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Rejection</hi> upon a meer outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eremony, or Act of Baptizing. The Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may want it in many Cases of Impedition; and the Children of Cannibals and Infidels, might by Souldiers be taken away by thousands and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized against the Parents Wills, and then turned to them again to be educated: And who can believe that barbarous Souldiers that must themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e damned, can thus save thousands at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? There are many Infants that have no <hi>right</hi> to Baptism; and why then should it save them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. 4. Some think, that all that are baptized by the <hi>Parents Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>int,</hi> are saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what if a Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen, or Infidel, or Athent say, I believe <hi>not</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:59334:142"/>
in God or Christ my self, but for worldly Ends, I desire my Child may be baptized (whether he say, I will, or I will not educate him u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to Christianity.) There is no shew of Reason, much less of Scripture, that this should save the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are no better offered to God.</p>
            <p>§. 8. 5. Some say, That all that any <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (Sinner</hi> or <hi>Hypocrite</hi>) offereth to God, and is so baptized, shall be saved; that is, That hath <hi>Christian Godfather or Godmother.</hi> But if so, then what if Christians take Heathens Children against their Wills, and baptize them, and then turn them home again? Are they saved by the <hi>Ceremony,</hi> or by <hi>Consent</hi> to the <hi>Covenant?</hi> Not by the meer Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, as is, and shall be shewed: Not by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of any such Christian that hath no right to them, nor power to represent them; else all the Children on Earth should be saved: For Christians would sit at home and <hi>consent for them,</hi> and <hi>dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to God unseen:</hi> And sure God would not refuse to save them, because of <hi>distance,</hi> nor <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause unseen</hi> (for the Godfather may be blind); nor because unbaptized; when it cannot be had, and the Child hindereth it not.</p>
            <p>§. 9. 6. Some say, That it is the <hi>Churches Faith,</hi> and <hi>dedicating</hi> them to God in Baptism that is the Condition of their Salvation: But this is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. If by the Church they mean all the Christian World, or all a National Church, or all a Diocesan Church, yea, or all a Parish-Church, they use not to be all <hi>Godfathers,</hi> nor to offer other folks Children to be baptized; nor did I ever know one that had so common a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ote, or was so offered: If they mean that the <hi>Churches Faith</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth whoever be the Covenanter or Offerer, then
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59334:143"/>
all the Pagan World may have their Children sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Churches Faith,</hi> or all that can be catcht up and baptized (and so the Ceremony doth it.) But if they mean by that Church the <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> whether it must be <hi>all the Bishops</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> or of the <hi>Nation,</hi> or <hi>one Bishop,</hi> or the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbyter that baptizeth,</hi> every one may speak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Invention and Fancy, but with no Proof from the Word of God or Reason (as the aforesaid Disproofs do manifest.)</p>
            <p>§. 10. 7. Some say, That any one baptized by a <hi>Godfather's offer, who undertaketh for his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Education,</hi> shall be saved, and no other. But, 1. The Godfather may have <hi>no Propriety</hi> in the Child, but steal him, shall that save him? 2. The Godfather may be an Hypocrite, and mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he promiseth; and shall the Child be saved by his Lye that damneth the Lyer himself? 3. Why should a <hi>Promise of future Education</hi> save a Child that must <hi>die to morrow,</hi> or ere long? 4. But if it be the meer <hi>opus operatum</hi> of <hi>Baptizing</hi> that must save, that may be a <hi>Profanation</hi> when <hi>unduly applied;</hi> and the Priest's sin that damneth himself, cannot save others.</p>
            <p>§. 11. 8. Some lay the hope upon <hi>Ancest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs Faith,</hi> and say, That if the Great Grandfathers, or others before them were faithful, the Infants shall be saved: But then are all Men saved for <hi>Noah</hi>'s Faith? Or how far must our Confidence ascend?</p>
            <p>§. 12. 9. Most of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> with us, hold, That there is no Promise, nor Assurance of the saving of any particular Infants in the World, either Christians or Heathens; but only that God electeth <hi>some,</hi> whom he will sanctifie and save, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59334:143"/>
reprobateth others, whom he will damn; without any notice given to the World who they be, or how many, or how few. So that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, that he will save Ten, or that he will damn Ten of all the World; nor have the Faithful any more promise than Heathens of the Salvation of their Infants, and so are not to baptize them.</p>
            <p>§. 13. 10. The commonest Opinion among the <hi>English Calvinists,</hi> is, That God hath made no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Promise of the Salvation of any <hi>particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> but by his <hi>general Promise of mercy to the Seed of the Faithful,</hi> hath given us cause to <hi>hope</hi> that <hi>more of them</hi> than of <hi>others,</hi> shall be saved; and therefore that they are by Baptism to be entred into the <hi>visible Church,</hi> as we baptize the Adult, while we are not certain but they may be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
            <p>§. 14. But I think this would not warrant their <hi>Baptism,</hi> nor give us any certain hope of any ones Salvation. God hath but <hi>one Covenant of Grace,</hi> which giveth us <hi>Christ and Life;</hi> and God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>no Baptism,</hi> but what is for the <hi>Remission of Sin,</hi> and <hi>making us Members of Christ,</hi> if we have the <hi>Conditions</hi> of Right to Baptism. The Adult <hi>profess Faith and Repentance;</hi> if they have them in sincerity, and consent with the Heart as well as the Tongue, they are certainly pardoned: If they are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>consent only with the Lips,</hi> they have notoriously the Qualification which the <hi>Church must require,</hi> and so are received to <hi>outward Communion,</hi> but not that which <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth</hi> to <hi>Remission and Salvation.</hi> But if an <hi>Infant</hi> be the <hi>Child of a true Believer,</hi> he hath all that <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> require: And therefore if he
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59334:144"/>
be to be baptized, he is certainly put into a state of Life, because no Condition is wanting on his part.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 11. Others say, That the Children of <hi>all Christians</hi> (<hi>Sinners,</hi> or <hi>Hypocri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi>) if <hi>baptized,</hi> are in a state of <hi>Pardon and Salvation;</hi> and that God will not punish the Child for the Hypocrite or prophane Parents Sin. But by that rule <hi>Heathens Children</hi> should be in as safe a case, because God will not punish them for their Parents sin. Either <hi>something</hi> on the Parents part is a Condition of the Child's Right, or <hi>nothing.</hi> If <hi>nothing,</hi> Heathens and Christians Children are equal: If <hi>something,</hi> it must be true <hi>Faith</hi> (as to God's acceptance): For whatever the <hi>Church</hi> must do, (that knoweth not the Heart) it is incredible that God should have such a Covenant [Thy Child shall be saved if thou wilt, (though lyingly) offer him to me, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou shalt be damned for that Lye.]</p>
            <p>§. 16. 12. That which I acquiesce in is this: That God who visited <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin on all his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, hath in the Covenant of Grace also so joined Infants to the Parents,<note place="margin">See the full proof in my two Disput. of Original Sin.</note> that till they have a <hi>Will</hi> to chuse for themselves, their Parents may chuse for them, and dispose of them for their good, and God taketh them as Members of the Parents so far: And so he hath made many express <hi>Promises</hi> of mercy to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and their Seed, (and Threatnings to the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and their Seed): And that this Mercy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be consistent with their Damnation; for it is <hi>to be their God,</hi> and to <hi>love and bless them,</hi> which cannot stand with damning them. And God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but <hi>one Covenant,</hi> seeing they are in the <hi>same</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:59334:144"/>
               <hi>Covenant</hi> with their Parents, and not another, if it give <hi>Pardon</hi> to the <hi>Parents,</hi> it doth so also to the <hi>Child,</hi> of whom no Condition is required, but that he be offered by a believing Parent to God; whose Acceptance is Salvation.</p>
            <p>§. 17. Therefore I think that the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> truly conclude, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 17. That <hi>faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents need not doubt of the Election and Salvation of their Children dying in infancy:</hi> The Covenant cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly pardoneth and saveth them.</p>
            <p>§. 18. But this is not only because they are <hi>born</hi> of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> nor yet is their <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>efficient Cause</hi> of it; but there are two things go to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the <hi>Receiver</hi> as the <hi>dispositive Condition,</hi> that is, 1. That he be the <hi>Child of a faithful Parent,</hi> who <hi>devote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h himself sincerely to God.</hi> 2. And that he be <hi>by the Parent devoted to God,</hi> by <hi>Consent,</hi> that he be in the mutual Covenant: Which <hi>virtually</hi> all the Faithful do that have Infants, because they devote <hi>themselves</hi> and <hi>theirs</hi> to God to the utmost of their Capacity. And the <hi>Recipient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> being thus qualified, <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, Covenant</hi> pardoneth him, as the <hi>efficient Instrument,</hi> by signifying God's Will.</p>
            <p>§. 19. Though the Promise here be not so plain, I deny not, that all true <hi>Propriet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs,</hi> whose <hi>own</hi> the Child is, here be as <hi>Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 20. God having not made the Case of Infants so plain to us as our <hi>own,</hi> that are Adult, there are difficult Objections against this way; but as it seems to me, much more against all the rest.</p>
            <p>§. 21. The grand Objection is, That then some Infants lose a state of Salvation when they come to age. <hi>Ans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This will follow; but far ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

things from all the rest: But, 1. This was thought no Absurdity for a Thousand years after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, when I cannot prove, that any one man thought that none of the <hi>Adult</hi> themselves fall away from true Sanctification and right to Life: When even <hi>Augustine</hi> the famous Defender of Election and Grace against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> thought that all the Elect only persevered, and that more were justified and sanctified than were Elect, and that the rest all fell away. 2. <hi>Davenant</hi> answereth this, That Infant-grace may be lost, and yet not the Grace of the Adult: Because it is but a <hi>Relative Regeneration,</hi> and an <hi>Extrinseck Remission</hi> of Sin, that giveth them Right to Impunity and Life, or if they are said to have the <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is not in a fixed Habit of Grace. If you say, They cannot be saved without real Holiness, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;</p>
            <p>§. 22. 3. Distinguish of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and of the <hi>Season of it.</hi> 1. Infants have not actual Faith, nor necessarily a proper Habit, which is a <hi>disposition</hi> to facile acting <hi>that same act:</hi> But a <hi>semen,</hi> a Seed, (as <hi>Amesius</hi> rather calleth it than a <hi>Habit</hi> at first even in the Adult:) And <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, That some men, <hi>semen fidei qualecunque perdunt. Adam</hi> had such a Holiness as might be lost: And why may we not say, that Infants <hi>first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grace</hi> is of such a sort or degree? 2. And yet that none are saved without more; but that upon this first degree they have a right to Salvation, and that their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holiness shall be given them whom God will, as part of their Salvation, to which they have right: At furthest, at death, in the same time and manner as perfect Holiness and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin is given to Believers that are till death
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59334:145"/>
imperfect. A <hi>loseable degree</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> like <hi>Adam's,</hi> may be the way to <hi>more</hi> in all that so die.</p>
            <p>§. 23. Divines use to mention three degrees of Grace in order to <hi>Faith</hi> it self. 1. So much Grace as maketh a man <hi>able to believe,</hi> (which they call <hi>Sufficient Grace.</hi>) 2. So much more as <hi>efficiently determineth him</hi> to the Act of Believing: This they call <hi>effectual special Grace,</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> call it our <hi>Vocation effectual.</hi> 3. So much more as giveth him a <hi>fixed habit of Faith, Love, and all Holiness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> This Papists call <hi>Iustification,</hi> and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants <hi>Sanctification.

            </p>
            <p>§. 24. Now some hold <hi>all these loseable:</hi> some hold only the <hi>last not loseable;</hi> and almost all hold the first loseable. Now, 1. What if we think that Infant's <hi>first Holiness,</hi> besides relative (<hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>jus ad impunitatem &amp; regnum</hi>) is but of the <hi>first degree?</hi> Though a meer <hi>moral Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> be not enough to the <hi>Adult,</hi> because the <hi>Act</hi> is necessary to them, yet say Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,<note place="margin">☜</note> The <hi>Habit</hi> is not necessary to their <hi>first Covenant-Right,</hi> but is given by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in <hi>sanctification as a Covenant-Benefit.</hi> And why may not Infants be in a pardoned state, that at first have but that Grace which giveth a <hi>moral Power</hi> to believe when they come to age? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the matter.</p>
            <p>§. 25. I have so fully elsewhere<note place="margin">In two Treatises for Infants <hi>Church-membership;</hi> and in my Review of Infant-Baptism.</note> proved, That Infants <hi>Church-membership</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:59334:146"/>
was instituted both in the Covenant of Innocency, in the first edition of the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> in the <hi>Covenant of Peculiarity</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the <hi>last edition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace by Christ; and also that God never had a Church on Earth, of which Infants were not Members, if the adult Members had Infants, that I will now supersede that Work.</p>

            <p>§. 1. SO much of this came in before on the by, as will excuse my brevity here. I have before shewed, That the Faith now in question is not meerly our <hi>general Belief</hi> and <hi>Trust in God,</hi> as a part of our Holiness, but the <hi>mediate Belief</hi> and <hi>Trust in God</hi> our Redeemer and our Saviour, which is made the Condition of the Covenant, &amp; the means of our sanctification: And also that as the <hi>editions</hi> of the Covenant vary, and promulgation of it, so it is not the <hi>same degree</hi> or <hi>acts of Faith,</hi> as to the particular <hi>credenda</hi> or Articles to be believed, that was and is necessary to all persons in all times.</p>

               </gap> and <hi>fides</hi> do properly signifie <hi>Trust,</hi> even a consenting or voluntary Trust upon <hi>believing;</hi> as is afore said.</p>
            <p>§. 3. We do very aptly call both the Act and Object by the same name <hi>fides</hi> in Latin, (and <hi>Faith</hi> in English, oft-times): For <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>trusting on another's Faith, Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Trustiness;</hi> and so the <hi>fides asserentis seu promittentis, &amp; fides credentis,</hi> are related.</p>
            <p>§. 4. The <hi>Faith</hi> that hath the promise of our Justification, is not to be called one only Physical act <hi>in specie</hi> (much less <hi>in numero</hi>): (That were but prophanely to jest with holy things); but it is a <hi>moral act</hi> or <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> containing many physical acts. Otherwise we should be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, not knowing how to distinguish of all our physical acts of Faith <hi>secundum speciem,</hi> and then to know which of them is the right: And it would be but some very little of the true Objects of Faith, that justifying Faith must be constituted by: In a word, the Absurdities are so numerous that would follow, that I will not be so tedious as to name them.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Saving Faith is such a moral work as we use to express by the names, <hi>Believing, Trusting, Consenting, Taking, Accepting, Receiving,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts personal with men. If we say [<hi>You shall Trust such a Physician, or take such a man for your Physician</hi>] all men understand us, and none is so logically mad, as to think that by <hi>Taking</hi> or <hi>Trusting</hi> we mean only some one physical act of the smallest distribution. If we say [<hi>I take this man for my King, my Master, my Commander or Captain, or this woman to be my Wife, &amp;c.</hi>] every one knoweth here what <hi>Taking</hi> meaneth: <hi>viz.</hi> our Consent to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59334:147"/>
that Relation, according to the nature and ends of it.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Therefore though we use divers names for this Faith, and also on several occasions, give several half-descriptions of it, we mean still the same thing, and <hi>suppose what we omit</hi> to make the description entire.</p>
            <p>§. 7. When we call <hi>Faith</hi> [<hi>a Believing</hi>] or [<hi>Assent</hi>] we mean <hi>such an Assent</hi> as prevaileth with the <hi>Will, to accept Christ with his Grace</hi> as offered in the Gospel, and <hi>consent</hi> to the Baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and this indeed as a fruit of the <hi>assenting act,</hi> but as <hi>essential</hi> to <hi>justifying Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 8. When we call it [<hi>Consent</hi>] or <hi>Acceptance,</hi> or [<hi>Receiving Christ</hi>] we mean, that as Man's Soul hath an Intellect and Will, and a true <hi>actus huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus vel moralis,</hi> is the act of both, but of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect as directive, and of the Will as more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, or as the Faculty, primarily moral; so the same <hi>Faith</hi> which is initially in the <hi>intellect's Assent,</hi> is perfectlier in the <hi>will's Consent:</hi> And it is the Receiving of a <hi>Saviour believed,</hi> or the Consent to a believed Covenant: We <hi>suppose Assent</hi> when we name it <hi>Consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. And when we name it <hi>Affiance</hi> or <hi>Trust,</hi> we include both the former, and mean a resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved practical <hi>Trust,</hi> and <hi>dedition of our selves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly</hi> to one that covenanteth to bring us from Sin and Misery to GOD and Glory; where Belief and Consent to that Covenant are supposed.</p>
            <p>§. 10. And the <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> and the <hi>renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of Competitors</hi> and <hi>Opposites,</hi> is connoted, if not essentially included in Saving Faith: And
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59334:147"/>
therefore Christ doth so often tell us, of <hi>forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all, if we will be his Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. I use to express it by this similitude: A Prince redeemeth a Slave, and also promiseth him great Possessions and Honours in a Kingdom in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> or at the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> if he will leave his Servitude and his Country, and all that he hath there, and go with him in his Ship, and patiently endure the Sea-trials till he come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Here he must, 1. believe that the Prince hath paid his ransome: 2. That he is a wise man, and knoweth what he promised, and skilful to conduct him safely through all the perils of the Seas: 3. That he is an honest man, and intendeth not to deceive him: 4. That he is sufficient or able to perform his word: 5. And if upon this belief he <hi>trust him,</hi> he will let go all and venture in his Ship, and follow him. And here one tells him that the Ship is unsound; another tells him that the Prince is a Deceiver, unable to perform his Word, or unskilful, or dishonest, and some way untrusty; and another tells him that small matters in his own Country, are better than grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with so much hazard; and sets out the dangers and terribleness of the Seas: Now if the man be ask'd [<hi>Do you believe, or will you trust me, or will you not?</hi>] here every one by <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>trusting</hi> knoweth, that a <hi>practical Trust</hi> is meant, which lieth in such a <hi>confidence</hi> as <hi>forsaketh all,</hi> and <hi>taketh</hi> the <hi>promised Kingdom</hi> for all his hope. Such is our Saving Faith.</p>
            <p>§. 12. As many Acts and many Objects go to constitute Saving Faith, so if you will logically anatomize it, all these following must be taken in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59334:148"/>§. 13. 1. The <hi>principal Efficient Cause</hi> is God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost respectively, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several operations.</p>
            <p>§. 14. 2. The <hi>Instrumental Cause</hi> is the Word of God, and the Preaching and Preachers of it, or Parents, Friends, or some that reveal the Word unto us.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 3. Subordinate auxiliary means are Providential Alterations, by some awaking Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or inviting Mercies, or convincing Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. 4. The Soul of Man in all its three Faculties, <hi>Vital-active, Intellective,</hi> and <hi>Volitive,</hi> is, 1. the Recipient of the Divine Influx, and then, 2. the immediate <hi>Efficient</hi> or <hi>Agent</hi> of the Acts of Faith.</p>
            <p>§. 17. 5. <hi>Preparatory Grace and Duty</hi> is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Man's <hi>Disposition,</hi> as he is the <hi>Recipient</hi> of God's Grace, and the <hi>Agent</hi> of believing. But God is <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>can</hi> work on the <hi>unprepared;</hi> but it is not to be taken for his <hi>ordinary</hi> way.</p>
            <p>§. 18. 6. The <hi>formal Object</hi> of the <hi>assenting Act</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is <hi>veracit as Dei revelantis,</hi> the <hi>Veracity</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> of God <hi>revealing</hi> his Will.</p>
            <p>§. 19. 7. The <hi>formal Object</hi> of the <hi>accepting</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> Act, is the Goodness of the <hi>Benefits offered</hi> us by the Covenant, as offered.</p>
            <p>§. 20. 8. The <hi>formal Object</hi> of our <hi>Trust</hi> or <hi>Affiance</hi> is God's <hi>fides, Fidelity,</hi> because of his afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Veracity</hi> in promising, and his Power, Wisdom and Benevolence as a Performer; and this full Act comprehendeth all the rest: It is God's Trustiness.</p>
            <p>§. 21. 9. The <hi>material Objects</hi> of the assenting Act <hi>in genere,</hi> are all God's Assertions or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59334:148"/>
More especially the Gospel, or the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> objective; according to the Edition of the Covenant which we are under.</p>
            <p>§. 22. The <hi>Essentials</hi> of our objective <hi>Christian Faith</hi> constitute the Essence of our active <hi>Saving Faith;</hi> and the <hi>Integrals</hi> of it constitute the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
            <p>§. 23. And it is of great importance to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish here (as to the Word and Objects) between 1. the <hi>signa</hi> or <hi>words,</hi> 2. the <hi>signification</hi> or <hi>sence,</hi> 3. the <hi>things, matter</hi> or <hi>incomplex objects,</hi> as distinct from words and sence, <hi>viz. God, Christ, Grace, Heaven, Goodness, Iustice, Men, &amp;c.</hi> And to hold, 1. That the words are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary<note place="margin">☜</note> for themselves, but for the sence; and therefore <hi>Translations,</hi> or any words which give us the <hi>same sence,</hi> may serve to the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Saving Faith.</hi> 2. That the <hi>sence it self</hi> is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for it self <hi>ultimately,</hi> as if <hi>Holiness</hi> lay in notions, but for the things which that sence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth, <hi>viz. God</hi> to be loved and obeyed, <hi>Christ</hi> to be received, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be received and obeyed, <hi>Holiness</hi> and all <hi>Grace</hi> to be received, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, used, encreased; our <hi>Brethren</hi> to be loved, <hi>Heaven</hi> to be desired, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All sence will not bring us to the reception of <hi>the things;</hi> for <hi>all</hi> is not apt; but any <hi>that doth this</hi> (which must be <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>apt</hi>) will constitute us true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
            <p>§. 24. 1. The <hi>material Objects</hi> of our <hi>acceptance</hi> and <hi>consent,</hi> are the Word of God <hi>commanding, offering,</hi> and <hi>promising,</hi> and the <hi>good of Duty</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> commanded, offered and promised; that is, <hi>All that is given us in the baptismal Covenant, God the Father and his Love, the Son and his Grace,</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:59334:149"/>
and <hi>the Holy Ghost and his Communion:</hi> The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as <hi>reconciled</hi> and <hi>adopting us,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> as <hi>having redeemed us,</hi> to <hi>teach, rule, justifie</hi> and <hi>save us;</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to <hi>sanctifie, comfort,</hi> and <hi>perfect us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 25. 11. The <hi>material Object</hi> of our <hi>Trust</hi> or <hi>Affiance</hi> is God himself, the prime Truth, Power and Good, and <hi>Christ</hi> as his Messenger and our Saviour, and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as the Author of the Word, and the <hi>Word</hi> as being the Word of God: You must pardon us as necessitated to call God a <hi>material Object,</hi> analogically, for want of words.</p>
            <p>§. 26. 12. The ultimate or final Objects of Saving Faith are, 1. God himself, the <hi>ultimate ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum;</hi> that is, the perfect <hi>Complacency</hi> of his will in his Glory eternally shining forth in our Glory and the Glory of Christ with all the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant. 2. Next to that, This Glory it self (which is a created thing) and the Perfection of the Universe, and of Christ's Church and our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which it consisteth. And therein our own Perfection, and our perfect sight, love and praise of our glorious God, and our Redeemer. 3. And next under that, the first fruits of all this in this World, in the foresaid love of the Father and Grace of the Son, and Communion of the Holy Spirit and the Church.</p>
            <p>§. 27. If therefore we were put to give a full description of Saving Faith, we must be as large as this following, or such-like in sence, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<q>The Faith which the Adult must profess in Baptism, as having the Promise of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation, is a sincere fiducial practical Assent to Divine Revelations, and especially to the Gospel, revealing and offering us God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59334:149"/>
himself to be our God and reconciled Father, Christ to be our Saviour, <hi>viz.</hi> by his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, meritorious Righteousness and Sacrifice, Resurrection, Doctrine, Example, Government, Intercession and final Judgment; and the Holy Ghost to quicken, illuminate and sanctifie us, that so we may live in the Love of the Father, the Grace of the Son, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit, and of the Christian Church, being saved from our Enemies, Sin and Misery initially in this Life, and perfectly in eternal perfect Glory: With a fiducial acceptance of the Gifts of the Covenant according to their nature, and a sincere federal Consent; and with a sincere devoting and giving up our selves to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; and renouncing of all that is inconsistent with this Covenant: Which <hi>Assent, Consent</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> are the effects of the Gospel and Spirit of Christ, and are founded on God's Fidelity, that is, on the Veracity, Love and Sufficiency of God Almighty, most wise and good, and on Christ the Father's great Apostle, and on Christ's sub-Apostles; and on the Gospel and especially the Covenant of Grace, as on God's revealing and donative Instrument; and on the manifold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signant operations of the Holy Ghost (miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and sanctifying) as God's infallible Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station to the Gospel-Verity.</q>]</p>
            <p>§. 28. Historical Tradition of the Words, Books, and Matters of Fact, are subordinate neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary means of transmitting the Objects to our sense of Hearing, who live at such a distance from the Time, Place and Facts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59334:150"/>§. 29. But though all these things aforesaid are in true Faith, yet a distinct Perception or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of them all is not necessary in him that hath them. But a more general Conception of it, which will but consist with the true Reception of the <hi>Things</hi> signified by the Words (God, Christ, Grace <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) may be certainly saving to a plain and simple-hearted Christian; when one that can describe it accurately, may be graceless: For it is <hi>Believing,</hi> and not <hi>Defining Faith,</hi> which God hath made necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>§. 30. Therefore we do ordinarily well use shorter Descriptions to the People, and sometime we say, That <hi>Faith in Christ, is our Christianity;</hi> that is, our Assent and Consent to the Baptismal Covenant, and our Self-dedition to God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For in Scripture it is all one to be a <hi>Believer,</hi> a <hi>Disciple of Christ, and a Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 31. Sometimes we say, That saving <hi>Faith is a fiducial-practical Assent to the Truth of the Gospel, and Consent to the Covenant of Grace;</hi> or an <hi>Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting of all the Benefits of the Covenant, as they are, and on the terms offered;</hi> or <hi>an Accepting of Christ and Life in, and with him there offered us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 32. Sometimes we say, <hi>It is a practical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, or trusting on Christ as our only Saviour for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> or <hi>to bring us to God and glory:</hi> And in all these and the like we speak truly, and mean the same thing; some terms being used on occasion, while the rest are implyed, and to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p>§. 33. Those that will needs call no act by the name of <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Assent,</hi> and confine it to the <hi>Intellect,</hi> do yet seem to differ with us but <hi>de nomine,</hi> about a <hi>Word,</hi> and not the <hi>Matter:</hi> For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59334:150"/>
if there <hi>concur</hi> not a <hi>Consent</hi> of the Will, it is not <hi>saving,</hi> but as some call it <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ides informis;</hi> and so that <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> make up our necessary <hi>Condition,</hi> or means of our Union with Christ, or Interest in the Covenant-Rights or Gifts. And then seeing we are agreed so far of the matter, it's not worth much striving, whether one only, or both Acts shall be called <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 34. When the first Reformers had to do with men that commended uncertainty of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Salvation, and kept People under a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage, and tempted them (contrary to the Nature of Faith) to love this World better than the next, and to be afraid of dying, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubtful whether they should be saved; in the heat of opposition, some of them called <hi>Faith, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,</hi> or <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>full Persuasion of our own personal Election, Pardon, and Salvation.</hi> But those that came after them, and those that conversed practically with Men of troubled Consciences, and observed the state of the greatest part of good Christians, followed not this Example, but spake more cautelously and soundly, and described Faith as I before have told you. For they found that not one of a multitude of godly Christians could say they were <hi>certain</hi> of their <hi>Election, Sincerity,</hi> or <hi>Salvation:</hi> And some that were forwardest to say so, were none of the best, and had not what they said they had.</p>
            <p>§. 35. But whatever the transmarine Divines say, I can witness, that except ignorant <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or such Sectaries, rejected by the Orthodox, I remember not that I have met these forty years with one Divine that taketh saving-Faith to be such <hi>Assurance</hi> of our <hi>personal</hi> Election, Justification or
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59334:151"/>
Salvation, especially the <hi>first act,</hi> which is not to believe that <hi>we are justified,</hi> but that we <hi>may be justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 36. Indeed you would think those few must hold this, who say, That Justification is an immanent eternal Act of God. But, 1. this is but a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the word [<hi>Iustification</hi>]: All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that God's essential Volition of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is eternal, as being himself; but some think that his <hi>Will</hi> may be denominated an <hi>Eternal Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> and others better say, <hi>Not:</hi> But all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that the Law of Grace doth justifie no man till he believe, much less the Sentence of Christ as Judge. And though some call our Perswasion that we are justified, by the name of <hi>Faith,</hi> yet they deny not another act of Faith antecedent to this, that maketh us true Christians.</p>
            <p>§. 37 And indeed, besides Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> (both excellent Men) it's rare to meet with any <hi>English</hi> Divine that talks for <hi>Eternal Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> who let fall some such things in his <hi>Vindiciae Gratiae,</hi> did set all right again in his <hi>Treatise of Iustification</hi> (being very young when he wrote even the last:) And Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> who in his <hi>Vindic. Gratiae,</hi> hath some such words, speaketh elsewhere soundly, as Mr. <hi>Iessop</hi> his Scholar hath shewed in a Treatise purposely written to prove it, when I had taken exceptions against his words.</p>
            <p>§. 38. It is therefore shameless Calumny of those who perswade their Followers, That the Reformed Churches take <hi>Faith</hi> for such an <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> or Belief, that we are justified or elected, and shall be saved; only because they find some such word in some former disputing Doctors of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59334:151"/>
ours; when as all, or near all have so long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that Opinion, that he would be a Wonder among us in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> (and I think abroad) that should hold it.</p>
            <p>§. 39. Yet we still say, That saving Faith is not only a believing that God's Word is true, but a believing it with personal Application to my self.</p>
            <p>§. 40. But that Application is such as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 1. I believe that Christ hath died for my sins as well as for the rest of the World. 2. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Gospel offereth Pardon and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me as well as to others. 3. I believe that God will have mercy on me, and Christ and Life shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e mine, if I shall truly believe and repent; and Glory, if I persevere. 4. Hereupon I accept the Offer and Consent to the Covenant of Grace, which giveth me right to these Benefits, if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. 5. And so far as I can say that I am sincere in my repenting and believing, so far my <hi>Faith</hi> help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me to conclude that I am justified.</p>
            <p>§. 41. But this last is a mixt act, and a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conclusion helped by Grace, whereof the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> only is <hi>de fide</hi> [He that believeth is justified] but not the <hi>Minor</hi> [<hi>I believe.</hi>] Therefore we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually call it a <hi>fruit of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 42. Some incautelous Divines in the heat of Dispute do indeed say, That it is <hi>de fide divina,</hi> or <hi>a Divine Word,</hi> that [<hi>I am a true Believer.</hi>] And <hi>Chamier</hi> too unhappily goeth about to prove it by saying, That it is the <hi>Word of the Spirit in us,</hi> which is the [<hi>Word of God:</hi>] As if the <hi>Spirit</hi> spake in us <hi>new Articles of Faith,</hi> or <hi>a new Word to be believed,</hi> whose work in those that are not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired Prophets,</hi> is but, 1. to cause us to believe that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59334:152"/>
Word already given: 2. To be a <hi>witnessing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> that we are God's <hi>Children,</hi> by making us holy as he is holy, as similitude witnesseth a Child to be his Fathers. 3. And to help us to <hi>discern</hi> that <hi>Holiness</hi> or <hi>Evidence,</hi> and to exercise it, and to gather Comfort from such discerning it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</p>
            <p>§. 43. We now commonly disown all such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions; I meet with no sober Divine that own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, because we grant, that <hi>Conclusio semper sequitur partem debiliorem:</hi> But yet we find that those few that call it <hi>de fide,</hi> do most of them mean no more, but that it's <hi>partly de fide,</hi> because the Major Proposition is so; and so they differ but about a Logical Notion.</p>
            <p>§. 44. Some have said indeed (beyond-Sea) That a man cannot believe, and not know it; but we know thousands may believe, and yet doubt whether it be a sincere and saving sort of Faith.</p>
            <p>But I have written so many Books of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I here add no more.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the nature of Righteousness, Iustification, and Pardon.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THE Controversies about Justification have made a great noise; but I think that those <hi>de re</hi> are few, in comparison of those <hi>de nomine,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among all sorts of Christians; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding them by unskilful Heads, who have made
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59334:152"/>
the ignorant believe, that those which are but <hi>de nomine,</hi> are <hi>de re,</hi> hath kindled foolish Wrath, and quenched Christian Love, and taken up poor Souls with a deceitful Zeal, who have thought that they were contending for great and necessary Truths, when it was but for Logical Notions, Names, and Modes of Expression, over-commended to them by their several Teachers.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The Words <hi>Iustice</hi> (Righteousness) and <hi>Iustification,</hi> are very ambiguous used in many sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Scriptures, and in the Writings of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and in the common use of men, which I have opened in so many Books, and so largely, as shall here excuse my brevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y: The Sences which we are now most concerned to take notice of, are these following.</p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>Righteousness</hi> is considered <hi>materially,</hi> or <hi>formally:</hi> Materially it is, 1. immediately; 1. A <hi>righteous Action:</hi> 2. A <hi>righteous Disposition</hi> or Habit; 2. And <hi>thence a righteous Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 4. <hi>Righteousness materially</hi> is, 1. in some or other <hi>particular Action,:</hi> 2. Or, in the <hi>main bent of Heart and Life:</hi> 3. Or, in <hi>Perfection.</hi> The first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominateth the Person <hi>Righteous in hoc,</hi> or <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid:</hi> The second denominateth him a sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Righteous Man: The third, a perfectly Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man.</p>
            <p>§. 5. In the notion of the <hi>material Cause,</hi> is included also the <hi>Comparative</hi> or <hi>Relative State</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> of <hi>Actions:</hi> When the Action is duly qualified and modified in its physical Nature and Circumstances, it is materially just.</p>
            <p>§. 6. The <hi>form</hi> enquired of, is <hi>Quid morale?</hi> And it is the <hi>Relation</hi> of the Action, and Habit, and Person, as congruous to the <hi>justitia mensurans,</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:59334:153"/>
or the Rule of Righteousness. The Rule or Law first maketh <hi>jus vel debitum,</hi> and saith, This shall be your Duty, and your Neighbour's Due (and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth God's Due:) And the <hi>jus</hi> being constituted by the Law (natural or positive) that which agreeth to it, is <hi>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stum.</hi> So that Righteousness formally is a <hi>moral Relation</hi> resulting from the <hi>physical mode and relation</hi> of Actions and Habits, as compared with the Law or Rule. A moral Relation founded in a physical Congruity.</p>
            <p>§. 7. Righteousness is both <hi>materially</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> distinguishable as <hi>towards God</hi> or <hi>Man: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,</hi> as it is <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> that we deal <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustly</hi> or <hi>injuriously</hi> by: Formally, as it is <hi>God</hi> himself, or <hi>Men ruling</hi> under him, who give us Laws, and make the <hi>debitum vel jus,</hi> or dispose of Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>Righteousness towards God</hi> being Relative to his Laws, is to be distinguished according to the <hi>several Laws</hi> that men are under, and according to the several <hi>parts</hi> of the Law, which give the word divers Sences.</p>
            <p>§. 9. 1. Righteousness as related to the <hi>Precept</hi> as such, is nothing but Obedience, whether <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, sincere,</hi> or <hi>perfect: He that doth righteousness is righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. 2. Righteousness related to a <hi>meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> (of Pardon or Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of that <hi>Condition,</hi> which may be the <hi>Causa judicanda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. 3. Righteousness, as related to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miant</hi> or <hi>donative</hi> part of the Law or <hi>Promise,</hi> is our <hi>jus ad praemium,</hi> our Right to that Reward or Gift.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:59334:153"/>§. 12. 4. Righteousness, as relative to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part, is our <hi>jus ad impunitatem,</hi> or when pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is not due to us according to that Law.</p>
            <p>§. 13. 1. Righteousness, as related to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Law of Innocency, is <hi>materially perfect, personal, continued Obedience</hi> to our <hi>Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 14. 2. Righteousness, as related to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of that Law, is the <hi>same;</hi> because nothing but the said perfect Obedience is there made the Condition of Life.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 3. Righteousness related to the reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of that Law is right to that Life which is there promised; that is, to God's Love and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>§. 16. 4. Righteousness related to the Penalty of that Law, is a Right to Impunity, as to the Death which it threatneth to Sinners.</p>
            <p>§. 17. 1. Righteousness, as related to the <hi>meer preceptive</hi> part of the Law of Grace, is also <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience for the future</hi> (not Innocency, as to the time past) for even Christ maketh <hi>perfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> our <hi>Duty,</hi> though he <hi>pardon sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 18. 2. Righteousness, as related to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> is <hi>sincere Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> as the Condition of our <hi>first Right</hi> to the present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gifts of the Covenant, and also <hi>sincere Love and Obedience</hi> to the end, as the Condition of our <hi>final Iustification and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 19. 3. Righteousness, as related to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of the Law of Grace, is our Right to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and all the Gifts of the Covenant, Christ, Grace, and Glory.</p>
            <p>§. 20. 4. Righteousness, as related to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of the Law of Grace, is our Right to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59334:154"/>
Impunity, as to the Punishment threatned specially by that Law.</p>
            <p>§. 21. The meritorious Cause of both these last (our <hi>Right to Impunity,</hi> and <hi>to Life</hi>) is the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of Christ; for the sake of which the Condonation and Donations of the Covenant of Grace are given us.</p>
            <p>§. 22. This Righteousness of Christ is his <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Conditions</hi> of his own proper Law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Mediation: which is materially, 1. His habitual, 2. and actual Perfection in Resignation, Obedience and Love; 3. and therein his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and offering himself a Sacrifice for sin: 4. And all this exalted to acceptable Dignity by the Conjunction of the Divine Perfection.</p>
            <p>§. 23. The Donative Covenant of Grace to Man being but a meer Instrument of Donation and Condonation, that which <hi>procured it,</hi> is the <hi>procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cause</hi> of <hi>Pardon and Life;</hi> that is, <hi>Christ's meritorious Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 24. Though this Covenant pardon and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie no man till he perform the Condition, and be a capable Subject by that <hi>moral Disposition,</hi> yet when that Condition is performed, its performance ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us but <hi>meet Recipients,</hi> and it is still the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Righteousness of Christ, for which we have the free gift of Pardon and Life; for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Condition doth but remove the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive Incapacity</hi> of the <hi>Patient,</hi> and the <hi>suspension</hi> of the Donation.</p>
            <p>§. 25. <hi>Iustification</hi> signifieth, 1. <hi>making us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> and judicially justifiable. 2. <hi>Iudicial</hi> Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (1. By Plea, 2. By Evidence and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 3. By Sentence.) 3. <hi>Using us</hi> as <hi>Righteous</hi> by Execution: Or, 1. <hi>Constitutive,</hi> 2. <hi>Iudicial,</hi> and 3. <hi>Executive Iustification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:59334:154"/>§. 26. No man of common Understanding will deny the real difference of these three: And if the <hi>Name</hi> only be<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 9. Hos. 14. 9. Heb. 10.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 38. &amp; 12. 23. Luke 1. 17. &amp; 2. 25. &amp; 14. 14. &amp; 15. 7, Matth. 10. 41. 2 Pet. 2. 8. 1 Tim. 1. 9. Rom. 5. 7. Mat. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 1 Jo. 3. 7. 1 Pet. 3. 12. &amp; 4. 18. Heb. 11. 4. Mat. 13. 43. &amp; 25. 37. 46. Rom. 10. 6, 10. &amp; 8. 4. 10. &amp; 6. 13, 16, 19, 20. &amp; 5. 17, 21. Rom. 2. 26. Act. 10. 35. Luk. 1. 75. Mat. 5. 6, 20.</note> questioned, no man will reasonably deny, That in humane use the name is accordingly applicable to each: And that use of it is easily proved also in the Scripture; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. &amp;c. And the word <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> is so frequently used in Scripture for that called <hi>Inherent,</hi> or <hi>Self-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Righteousness</hi> (incomparably oster than in any other Sence) as will help to inform us what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive Iustification</hi> is: And if any dislike the <hi>Name;</hi> let them call it [<hi>Making us righteous</hi>] if that will please them better than the word <hi>justifying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 27. <hi>Constitutive Iustification</hi> is ever first: God never judged a man righteous, that was not righteous.</p>
            <p>§. 28. No man on earth is righteous by the <hi>Condition,</hi> or by the <hi>rewarding Part</hi> of the Law of <hi>Innocency.</hi> Not by the <hi>Condition</hi> as performed, for that Condition is <hi>perfect, perpetual, personal Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> which no man hath; nor is any righteous in conformity to the <hi>Precept,</hi> unless <hi>secundum quid,</hi> as a damnable Sinner's <hi>less unrighteousness</hi> may be called Righteousness: Nor is any one justified by the <hi>Retributive</hi> or <hi>Promissory</hi> part of that Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause perfect Innocency is its Condition.</p>
            <p>§. 29. Though that Law perfectly justifie Christ, who perfectly fulfilled it, we are not therefore
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59334:155"/>
righteous in the sence of that Law, or justified by it, because Christ fulfilled it (of which more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:) Because the sence of the Law was not [<hi>Thou shalt obey, or another for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</hi>] (It never mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>vicarious Obedience:</hi>) But [<hi>thou thy self shalt perfectly obey.</hi>]</p>
            <p>§. 30. We are <hi>justified from,</hi> or <hi>against the curse</hi> of that first <hi>Law,</hi> by <hi>deliverance</hi> or <hi>grace;</hi> but it is by a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and not by <hi>that Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 31. The Causes of our <hi>whole Iustification</hi> (whose parts were before-mentioned) are these: 1. The <hi>constitutive Causes</hi> (called <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal</hi>) are before opened, being divers in their divers parts: In brief, our Righteousness now is [<hi>our Interest in the meritorious Righteousness of Christ, and our own performing of the Conditions of that Interest,</hi> or <hi>of the New Covenant by his Grace,</hi> and <hi>thereupon our Right to Impunity and Life</hi> (or to <hi>Salvation from destructive Punishment, and to Glory.</hi>) 2. The efficient Causes are, 1. Principal, <hi>God:</hi> 2. Mediatory and meritorious, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:</hi> 3. Instrumental (as to our <hi>jus ad impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem &amp; gloriam</hi>) the <hi>Condonative</hi> and <hi>Donative</hi> Covenant. 4. The material <hi>Dispositio receptiva</hi> of this Right, is our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Covenant's Condition hereof. 5. The principal Cause of this <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Disposition,</hi> is the Holy Ghost. 6. The instrumental, is the Word. 7. The mediate Agent is Man.</p>
            <p>§. 32. That Justification which consisteth in our <hi>jus impunitatis quoad poenam damni &amp; sensus,</hi> our right to <hi>impunity</hi> (as to <hi>Loss</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi>) is the same thing with <hi>Pardon of sin,</hi> whether you take both <hi>actively</hi> or <hi>passively.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="245" facs="tcp:59334:155"/>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 33. Obj.</hi> If the Law of Innocency as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ceased upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, no man but he and <hi>Eve</hi> was ever under it: And if so, they deserved not Damnation for any Sin but final Unbelief and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, according to the Law of Grace: And if so, no such desert is forgiven them by Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 34. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Law of Grace taketh in the Law of Nature (<hi>naturae lapsae</hi>), though not on the Terms of the first Covenant, as it was <hi>naturae inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grae,</hi> for preservation of Innocency: And still all that <hi>God commandeth is our Duty,</hi> and all that he <hi>forbiddeth, is Sin;</hi> and every <hi>sin deserveth death</hi> in the nature of it (for it cannot be <hi>Sin</hi> and not <hi>deserve Punishment</hi>): but the difference is, That under the Law of Innocency it was <hi>Desert unreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died;</hi> but now it is <hi>Desert with present Remedy,</hi> or an affixed Pardon to every penitent Believer. So much of the Law of Nature remaineth as maketh Punishment due <hi>in primo instanti naturae,</hi> conjunct with a Pardon which maketh <hi>Impunity</hi> due <hi>in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo instanti:</hi> As if the King should grant a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Pardon by a Law to every man that will list himself in his Wars under his Son, lest <hi>in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo instanti,</hi> their faults deserve punishment, while they are daily pardoned.</p>
            <p>§. 35. II. Publick <hi>judicial Iustification</hi> (for <hi>private</hi> I pass by) is <hi>virtually</hi> in the Law, or constitutive Justification before described: For when a man is righteous, the <hi>Law justifieth</hi> him <hi>virtually:</hi> And this is the sence that we are said to be <hi>justified</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> in, primarily in Scripture: A Believer is made <hi>just</hi> indeed, and so is <hi>justifiable in Iudgment,</hi> that is, <hi>justified virtually by the Law:</hi> As we use to say, <hi>The Law doth justifie such a man.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59334:156"/>§. 36. 2. But <hi>actual judicial Iustification</hi> is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by <hi>our Iudge</hi> and subordinately by Christ as our <hi>Advocate,</hi> by <hi>Plea;</hi> and by <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> which is chiefly by the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> laid open to all the World.</p>
            <p>§. 37. It is by the Law of Grace (the edition which men lived under) that Christ will judge the World: Therefore we must accordingly judge of his Justification.</p>
            <p>§. 38. Seeing the thing to be judged of is the <hi>meritum causae,</hi> the <hi>Merits of a man's Cause;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same may be the <hi>meritorious Cause</hi> and the <hi>material</hi> of this judicial Justification; and they err that take this for an Absurdity.</p>
            <p>§. 39. Though the <hi>great end</hi> of God's Judgment of Man will be to glorifie his <hi>own Iustice, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and to glorifie <hi>Christ's Righteousness,</hi> yet the <hi>Cause of the day,</hi> which is to be decided, is not <hi>whether Christ be righteous,</hi> but <hi>We:</hi> Nor whether he fulfilled his mediatorial Law; which is presupposed.</p>
            <p>§. 40. <hi>Iustification</hi> being related to (<hi>real</hi> or <hi>possible</hi>) <hi>Accusation,</hi> so many things as the <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may extend to, the Justification must extend to if perfect.</p>
            <p>§. 41. But no man is perfectly and absolutely <hi>just</hi> or <hi>justifiable:</hi> For instance, 1. If we be accused to <hi>have sinned,</hi> we cannot be justified directly against this Accusation, but must plead guilty by Confession. For <hi>factum non potest fieri infectum,</hi> and that Fact will for ever be culpable: [<hi>Adam did sin</hi>] will for ever be a true assertion. The Guilt of <hi>fact</hi> or <hi>fault</hi> is never done away <hi>in it self;</hi> [that it was really a fault] and [that we real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59334:156"/>
did it,]. will be an everlasting Truth: Of which more afterward.</p>
            <p>§. 41. 2. If the Accusation be, That [<hi>in</hi> Adam <hi>we deserved Death,</hi>] it must be confessed: Yea, temporal Death and correcting Punishments are not only deserved but inflicted, and <hi>not pardoned,</hi> nor we justifiable herein.</p>
            <p>§. 42. 3. If the Accusation be, that we <hi>deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have Abatements of Grace, With-holdings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and abatement of what Glory we might else have had, all this must be confessed.</p>
            <p>§. 43. 4. Yea, if it be said, That our Sin <hi>primo instanti</hi> deserved Hell, it must be confessed, and against all this there is no direct Justification.</p>
            <p>§. 44. But against these Accusations we must be justified: 1. If it be said, that we are of <hi>Right to be damned,</hi> or <hi>have no Right to Heaven</hi> but to <hi>Hell,</hi> this must be denied: And we must be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by these several Causes: 1. Because <hi>God's Iustice</hi> and the <hi>Ends of the violated Law</hi> are <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> by Christ, and by his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> a free Gift of Pardon and Life are merited for us: 2. And this free <hi>donation</hi> is the Law that we are to be judged by, which giveth us Christ to be our Head, and <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>§. 45. 2. If it be said, That we are <hi>Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, impenitent</hi> or <hi>unholy,</hi> and did not fulfill the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and be justified against this by our <hi>Faith, Repentance</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> it self; or else we must be condemned and perish; for nothing else will do it.</p>
            <p>§. 46. And seeing it will be the work of the day, to judge men as performers or non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the said Conditions of the Law of Grace,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59334:157"/>
therefore it is that the Scripture speaketh so much of inherent or performed <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and of Christ's judging men according to their works, that is, their works which are the performance of that Condition.</p>
            <p>§. 47. To be <hi>judged according to our Works,</hi> is to be <hi>justified or condemned according to our Works:</hi> For to be <hi>judged</hi> is the <hi>genus,</hi> and to be <hi>justified</hi> or <hi>condemned</hi> are the <hi>species. Iudging</hi> is <hi>justifying</hi> or <hi>condemning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 48. While all are agreed, that <hi>all men shall be justified</hi> or <hi>condemned according to their Works,</hi> it is unreasonable to quarrel at that height that many do, about the syllable [<hi>BY</hi>] (<hi>whether</hi> men be justified and condemned <hi>by</hi> their works) as if [<hi>according to them</hi>] and [<hi>by them</hi>] had a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sence; when as to judicial justification the sence is the very same, though as to the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of men just,</hi> the sence may differ.</p>
            <p>§. 49. We are commonly agreed, that no man is <hi>justified by Works</hi> in any of these following sences.</p>

               <item>1. No man is justified either <hi>constitutively</hi> or <hi>judiciarily</hi> by his Works done according to the <hi>Law of Innocency,</hi> that is, by perfect <hi>personal Obedience</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> (because we have it not.)</item>
               <item>2. No man is justified constitutively or judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, by his Works done according to the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Iewish Law</hi> as such.</item>
               <item>3. Much less by any Works of his own or other mens invention, which he accounteth good and are not so.</item>
               <item>4. No man is justified by any Works set in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to or competition or co-ordination with Christ, but only in <hi>subordination</hi> to him and his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59334:157"/>
Righteousness by which we are redeemed, and for which we are all first conditionally pardoned and justified by the Law of Grace.</item>
               <item>5. No man could be justified by his Gospel-Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or his Faith, if he were to be judged by the Law of Innocency, as not redeemed.</item>
               <item>6. No man's Faith or Obedience will justifie him in Judgment against this accusation, [<hi>Thou art a Sinner</hi>] or this [<hi>Thy sin deserved Death.</hi>] Nor as one that hath fulfilled all the <hi>preceptive part</hi> of the law of Christ.</item>
               <item>7. No Works do justifie us, as meriting Life of God in proper commutative Justice.</item>
               <item>8. No man is justified by <hi>Tasks of working,</hi> as contradistinct from believing and trusting on Free Grace: or by external works, without Christ's Spirit and spiritual Evangelical Duties.</item>
               <item>9. No good Work or Act of Man was a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's giving us a Redeemer, or giving us a conditional justifying Law of Grace.</item>
               <item>10. Man's true Faith and Repentance is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Grace which worketh it, and therefore is no Condition of that Grace.</item>
               <item>11. Man's antecedent common Works, while he is impenitent, merit not properly the special Grace which causeth Faith and Repentance.</item>
               <item>12. We have no Works that are acceptable to God, but what are the fruits of his Spirit and Grace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>§. 50. And on the other side we are agreed, 1. That we are justified by the <hi>Works of Christ,</hi> as the Meritorious Cause of our Justification.</p>
            <p>2. That the Justification purchased and given us by Christ, is given us by a Law or Covenant of Grace, which giveth (as God's Instrument) Right
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59334:158"/>
to <hi>Impunity</hi> and to <hi>Life</hi> to all true <hi>penitent Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi> And therefore he that is justified according to this Law of Grace, from the charge of <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> and <hi>Unbelief,</hi> must be justified by his <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> materially, as being the Righteousness in question, as is aforesaid.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>without Holiness none shall see God:</hi> And if any be accused as unholy (and on that account no Member of Christ or Child of God, or Heir of Heaven) his <hi>Holiness</hi> must be the matter of his Justification.</p>
            <p>4. That though our Faith, Repentance and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness be no <hi>universal</hi> absolute Righteousness, yet they are that on which the judiciary Scrutiny must pass, and which will be the question of the great day, on which our Life or Death will depend as on the <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>moral Qualification</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That in this sence all men shall be judged, by Justification or Condemnation <hi>according to their Works,</hi> or what they have done; that is, as they have performed or not performed the Conditions of that Law of Grace which they were under (as aforesaid.)</p>
            <p>6. That therefore they that will be justified at last, must <hi>trust in Christ</hi> that redeemed them, and be careful to perform the Conditions of his Law of Grace, and both must concurr.</p>
            <p>7. That that which is the Righteousness which must justifie us in Judgment, is the same that must now <hi>constitute us just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. That when our Right to Salvation is the thing in question to be judged, that which justifieth our Right to <hi>Salvation,</hi> justifieth the <hi>Person</hi> as to that Right; and so far the same thing is the Condition
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59334:158"/>
of our Right to Salvation and to our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>9. And if any with <hi>Augustine</hi> will mean by [<hi>Iustification</hi>] <hi>God's making us such as the Iudge will justifie</hi> by <hi>Sentence</hi> and <hi>Execution,</hi> then our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> is part of that Justification.</p>
            <p>10. That Scripture sometimes taketh Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that sence, and most frequently by [<hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>] meaneth that which consisteth in our Acts and Habits: In all this there is no place for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie or Disagreement.</p>
            <p>§. 51. They that say, That we must have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and performed Righteousness, but that no man is at all justified by it, must take <hi>justifying</hi> in some <hi>particular limitted sence,</hi> (which therefore they should <hi>explain</hi> by distinction) or else they speak gross contradiction: For it is no Righteousness if it constitute not the owner <hi>righteous,</hi> so far, or in that point; nor yet if the owner may not be justified by it in <hi>Iudgment,</hi> against the accusation of being in that point or so <hi>far unrighteous.</hi> If he that doth Righteousness is righteous, that Righteousness will materially justifie him against the false accusation of the contrary.</p>
            <p>§. 52. Yea, while they make Faith, Repentance and Holiness but <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> of our right to Life-eternal, they thereby allow it some place in Justification: For <hi>Evidence</hi> hath its place in Judgment: And they are <hi>moral Evidences,</hi> and not <hi>physical</hi> only.</p>
            <p>§. 53. If men understood how atheological and perilous it is to conceit, that either <hi>Faith</hi> or any thing of ours, (no though we were innocent,) is any proper efficient Cause of God's own internal acts in our Justification, and would understand that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59334:159"/>
all can be no more than <hi>dispositio receptiva,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> calls <hi>causa dispositiva,</hi> a meer <hi>receptive Aptitude,</hi> which is but the Qualification <hi>causae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialis,</hi> that is, of the Subject to be justified, it would presently lead them out of their vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Gospel-Obedience</hi> herein, and shew them how each in several respects and instances qualifie Man for the <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of Justification, or for Right to Glory.</p>
            <p>§. 54. It seemeth strange to some, to find the whole Old Testament, and all Christ's Sermons, and all the other Apostles, inculcating <hi>inherent</hi> and <hi>performed</hi> Righteousness, as that which Men must be judged about, to Life or Death, and yet to find <hi>Paul</hi> so oft pleading against Justification by Works. But if we will take the Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not by incoherent scraps, the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is evident.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Man is now sinful, and condemned by the first Law, and is now under a Law of Grace, that freely giveth Pardon and Life through a Redeemer, to those that <hi>believingly accept the Gift according to its nature, and consent by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to turn to God, and live a holy life in sincerity:</hi> Now God doth through all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tell us, That <hi>no one shall pass with God for a just man, or be saved, that will not do this,</hi> but shall be condemned further for refusing it: And thus he that doth Righteousness is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and all shall be judged according to their works, thus required by the Law of Grace.</q> To deny this, is to deny the scope of the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Government of God.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But <hi>Paul</hi> disputed against those that taught that the Gentiles must be proselyted, and keep the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or else they could not be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59334:159"/>
accounted just men, nor be saved: And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that the Gentiles being under the Law of Grace, may pass with God for just men and be saved, if they [<hi>Believingly accept the Gift of Grace according to its nature, and consent by Repentance to turn to God, and live a holy life in sincerity</hi>] though they keep not the Jewish Law: Yea, further, that though the Jewish Fathers were obliged to keep that Law, it was as it belonged to the Covenant of Grace and of Faith, and that before that Law was given <hi>Abraham</hi> and others, were just and saved by Faith, according to the universal Law of Grace; and that the Task of Works, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> will of it self make no man just or savable, and consequently no other Task of Works, which would make the Reward to be not of Grace but of Debt, and is opposed to, or separated from Redemption and the free condonation and donation of the Covenant of Grace.]</q> This is the plain drift of <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 55. Works of Evangelical gratitude, love, and obedience, according to the Law of Grace, subordinate to, and supposing Redemption and the free gift of Pardon and Life to penitent believing Accepters, are those that Christ and <hi>Iames</hi> and all the Scripture make necessary to Salvation; and our Consent and Covenant so to obey is necessary to our first or initial <hi>Iustification;</hi> and our <hi>actual Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of it. But a Task of Works either of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law or any other set against Redemption and free Grace, or not as aforesaid, duly subordinate to them, is disclaimed by <hi>Paul</hi> and all Christians, as that which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59334:160"/>
can constitute no man just in God's account, nor such a one as hath right to Salvation.</p>
            <p>§. 56. I verily think, that were their verbal and notional differences discussed, and men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood themselves and one another, it will prove, that this aforesaid is the true meaning of almost all Christians, and that they agree in this sence, while they mischievously contend about ill or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explained words.</p>
            <p>§. 57. What I have said of Justification, is mostly true of Pardon of Sin: Pardon is threefold, 1. Constitutive, which is God's giving us a <hi>Right to Impunity:</hi> This is God's act by the pardoning Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Law of Grace. 2. By <hi>Sentence,</hi> judging us so pardoned. 3. <hi>Executive,</hi> taking off, or not inflicting Punishment deserved.</p>
            <p>§. 58. God's <hi>non punire,</hi> and <hi>nolle punire, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punishing</hi> and his will not to punish, are true <hi>pardon</hi> when the Sinner, and <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent:</hi> But they are no pardon before; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not capable of such a <hi>relation</hi> and <hi>denomination</hi> for want of a <hi>real terminus.</hi> Therefore God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>will to pardon,</hi> or his <hi>not punishing</hi> man from Eternity before Man was <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>sinful,</hi> must have no such name; which <hi>afterward it may have</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change in God, but in man only.</p>
            <p>§. 59. Some worthy men say, that Pardon is not Justification, nor to be pardoned is to be righteous; and that Righteousness is never taken in Scripture for Pardon, but many score or hundred times for our performance of our Duty according to the Law of Grace: Therefore they would have Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Pardon still distinguished.</p>
            <p>§. 60. But I have plainly before proved, that Righteousness hath many <hi>parts,</hi> and the word many
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59334:160"/>
sences, and though <hi>Pardon</hi> be not that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which consisteth in a Conformity to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, (and so is not our <hi>universal Righteousness</hi>) yet Pardon is (passive) that <hi>Righteousness</hi> which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in our <hi>right to Impunity</hi> both as to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Loss</hi> and <hi>Sence:</hi> And <hi>Pardon</hi> with <hi>Adoption</hi> or the Gift of Life, is that Righteousness which consisteth in our <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Life</hi> eternal.</p>
            <p>§. 61. 1. All mens sins are pardoned <hi>potentially</hi> and <hi>conditionally</hi> in the Law of Grace. 2. No mens sins are pardoned <hi>actually</hi> (as to a <hi>right of Impunity</hi>) till they are penitent Believers, or consent to the Covenant of Grace (if at age.) 3. These peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believers sins are <hi>pardoned virtually</hi> before they are committed, supposing them but Sins of Insir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but this is properly no <hi>Pardon,</hi> nor so to be called, because it is but the position of those things which will cause Pardon hereafter. To be only <hi>virtual,</hi> is not to exist, but to be <hi>in causis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is too grosly inferred hence by some, That it is not God then that actually justifieth, but Man that performeth the Condition; as if the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is but a suspension of the Donation, (and the performance a removal of the suspending Cause) were the donative Efficient; and so the Receiver were the Giver. As if he that opened the window were the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>efficient Cause of the Light;</hi> or he that lets off a <hi>Crossbow</hi> by removing the <hi>Stop,</hi> were the <hi>spring</hi> that <hi>effecteth</hi> the motion of the <hi>Arrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 62. Neither Pardon nor Justification are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before death: For there are some <hi>correcting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi> to be yet born, some <hi>Sins</hi> not fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, some Grace yet wanting, more Sins to be forgiven, more Conditions thereof to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The final and executive Pardon and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are only perfect.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the Imputation of Righteousness.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THE great Contentions that have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Point, tell us how needfull it is to distinguish between real and verbal Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies: The opening of the Doctrine of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption before, <hi>Chap.</hi> XI. hath done most that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the solution of this Case, we are commonly agreed in these following Points.</p>
            <p>§. 2. 1. That no man hath a Righteousness of his own performance, by which he could be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, were he to be judged by the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; that is, all are Sinners, and deserve ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Death.</p>
            <p>§. 3. 2. That Jesus the Mediator undertook to fulfil all the Law which God the Father gave him, even the Law of Nature, the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that which was proper to himself, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God's Wisdom, Goodness, Truth, Justice, and Mercy, might be glorified, and the ends of God's Government be better attained, than by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the sinful World; and all this he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in our <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>suffered for us in our stead;</hi> and was the second <hi>Adam,</hi> or Root to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>§. 4. 3. That for this, as the <hi>meritorious Cause,</hi> God hath <hi>given him power over all Flesh, that he might give eternal Life to as many as are drawn to him by the Father, and given him,</hi> Joh. 17. 2. <hi>He is</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:59334:161"/>
               <hi>Lord of all, and all power in Heaven and Earth is given him,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. and <hi>he is made Head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1. 22, 23. Rom. 14. 9: And for these his <hi>Merits,</hi> a <hi>Covenant, or Law of Grace is made to sinful Man,</hi> by which all his sins are <hi>freely pardoned,</hi> and <hi>Right to Impunity and Life is freely given him,</hi> if he will <hi>accept it, and penitently turn to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. 4. <hi>Whenever</hi> a man is <hi>pardoned and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> (or hath Right to Life) this <hi>Law of Grace doth it,</hi> as God's <hi>donative Instrument:</hi> And whoever is so pardoned and justified, it is <hi>for and by these Merits of Christ's Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 6. 5. But Christ doth initially pardon and justifie none by this Covenant but <hi>penitent Believers,</hi> and therefore hath made it our Duty to repent and believe, that we may be forgiven, and have right to life; as the Condition, without which his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native and condonative Act shall be suspended.</p>
            <p>§. 7. 6. God never judgeth falsely, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things to be what they are: And therefore he <hi>reputeth</hi> Christ's <hi>meritorious Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to be the <hi>meritorious Cause</hi> of all mens Justification, who are justified (and of the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Pardon</hi> of all the <hi>World,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20.) and as <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> to the <hi>assigned ends,</hi> as our <hi>own personal righteousness</hi> or <hi>suffering</hi> would have been, and <hi>more</hi> (though it be not so ours, as that of our <hi>own performance</hi> would have been, nor so <hi>immediately</hi> give us our Right to Impunity and Life, but <hi>mediately by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>)</p>
            <p>§. 8. 7. And as God reputeth Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to be the <hi>prime meritorious Cause</hi> for which we are justified by the Law of Grace, as afore-said,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59334:162"/>
so he truly reputeth our <hi>own Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> (or <hi>Covenant-consent</hi>) to be our <hi>moral Qualification</hi> for the <hi>gift,</hi> and our <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Perseverance</hi> to be our <hi>moral Qualification</hi> for <hi>final Iustification and Glory;</hi> which Qualification being the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Command</hi> of the Law of Grace, and the <hi>Condition</hi> of its <hi>Promise,</hi> is so <hi>far our righteousness indeed,</hi> and oft so called in the Scripture, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
            <p>§. 9. 8. Therefore God may in this Sence be truly said, both to <hi>impute righteousness</hi> to us, and to <hi>impute Christ's righteousness</hi> to us, and to <hi>impute our Faith for righteousness</hi> to us in several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
            <p>§. 10. Thus much being commonly agreed on, should quiet the Minds of Divines that are not <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>righteous overmuch;</hi> and it beseemeth us not to make our arbitrary Words and Notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Doctrine of our Peace with God, to be Engines to break the Church's Peace, seeing Angels preached to us this great Truth; That Christ came into the World for <hi>GLORY to God in the highest, and for PEACE on Earth, and for GOOD-WILL</hi> or <hi>LOVE</hi> from God to <hi>Man</hi> (or <hi>mutual compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ency;</hi>) and his Servants should not turn his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel into matter of strife.</p>
            <p>§. 11. That which we are yet disagreed about, is the Names and Notions following: As, 1. What is meant by the Phrase of [<hi>Imputing</hi>] in several Texts of Scripture; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. [<hi>That righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness might be imputed</hi> (or reckoned) <hi>to them also.</hi>] <hi>Ans.</hi> The words seem to me to have no difficulty, but what men by wrangling put into them. To have <hi>righteousness impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to them,</hi> is to be reputed, judged, or accounted as righteous
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59334:162"/>
Men, and so used (the <hi>cause</hi> being not in the <hi>Phras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it self,</hi> but fore-described.)</p>
            <p>§. 12. So what is meant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. by <hi>imputing righteousness without works? Ans.</hi> Plainly, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or judging a man righteous without the works which <hi>Paul</hi> there meaneth.</p>
            <p>§. 13. So what is meant by <hi>Not imputing sin,</hi> Psal. 32. 2. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Rom. 5. 13. Lev. 7. 18. 1 Sam. 22. 15. 2 Sam. 19. 19. Rom. 4. 8? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not-judging a man as a Sinner guilty of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not charging his sin upon him in Judgment; which is as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because he is not truly guilty; or as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because he is forgiven.</p>
            <p>§. 14. 2. What is meant by [<hi>imputing our Faith to us for righteousness?</hi>] But of that more purposely anon.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 3. Whether <hi>imputing Christ's righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to us,</hi> be a Scripture-phrase? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not that I can find.</p>
            <p>§. 16. 4. Whether it be a fit or lawful Phrase, and whether in so great matters, departing from Scripture-phrase, and pretending it necessary so to do, be not adding to God's Word, or the cause of Corruptions and Divisions in the Church, and an intimation that we can speak better than the Holy Ghost? <hi>Ans.</hi> God hath not tied us to use <hi>only Scripture-words</hi> or <hi>Phrases;</hi> and use may make them convenient and needful for some times and places, which else are less significant or congruous. And in this case I see not, but that the Phrase is lawful well explained. But if any will pretend their own Phrases to be more necessary than they are, and will calumniate those as not Orthodox, who will not use them, or subscribe to them, I
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59334:163"/>
cannot justifie such from the guilt of Presumption, and Injury to the Church, the Truth and Christ, and the Love of Brethren.</p>
            <p>§. 17. 5. Whether they that affirm, That Christ's Righteousness is imputed to us, or those that deny it are to be accounted Orthodox?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Perhaps <hi>both,</hi> if they both hold the same sound Doctrine under various Phrases: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps neither, if by their various Phrases, each mean something that is unsound.</p>
            <p>§. 18. They heinously err, who deny Christ's Righteousness to be so far imputed to us, as to be reputed the <hi>meritorious Cause</hi> of our Pardon and Right to Life (or our Justification) performed by our Mediator, as the <hi>Sponsor of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> (for our <hi>sakes,</hi> and his Sufferings in <hi>our stead</hi>) as is afore-expressed.</p>
            <p>§. 19. And they heinously err, and subvert the Gospel, who say, that Christ's Righteousness is so imputed to us, as that God reputeth, or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christ to have been <hi>perfectly holy and righteous</hi> (or obedient) and to have suffered, though not in the Natural, yet in the <hi>Legal</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Person of the <hi>Sinner</hi> or <hi>Believer,</hi> as their <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Representer;</hi> and reputeth us to have been <hi>perfectly holy, righteous,</hi> or <hi>obedient</hi> in <hi>Christ, as our Representer,</hi> and so to have <hi>our selves fulfilled all righteousness in</hi> and by <hi>him,</hi> and in him to have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Justice, and meri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed Eternal Life, and Christ's Righteousness to be ours in the same sence of Propriety, as it was his own: For his Divine Righteousness is the Essence of God, and his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane his <hi>Habits, Acts,</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> which are the Accidents of his own Person only as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and cannot be in another (as is after shewed.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:59334:163"/>§. 20. Though most of us now leave this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the <hi>Antinomians</hi> or <hi>Libertines,</hi> yet so many Protestants formerly have seemed to own it by their unmeet Phrases, in extreme opposition to the Papists, or at least to come too near it, as hath greatly scandalized and hardened their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and injured the Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>§. 21. The Person of our Mediator was neither in the Sence of the Law, or in God's account, properly the person of the Sinner; Christ and we are distinct persons.</p>
            <p>§. 22. Had we been <hi>perfectly holy, innocent, and obedient in Christ,</hi> it would follow, 1. That we are justified by the Law of Innocency, as having perfectly done all that it commanded us, which is not true: It is by the pardoning Law of Grace that we are justified.</p>
            <p>§. 23. 2. That we have no need of Pardon, nor of Christ's Sufferings for our Pardon, nor of Prayer for Pardon, nor any means for it; for he needeth no pardon that is perfectly innocent.</p>
            <p>§. 24. 3. Therefore they assert Contradictions when they say, that we both perfectly obeyed by, and in Christ, and yet suffered or satisfied in, or by him for our Disobedience.</p>
            <p>§. 25. 4. It would follow, that all penalties (even corrective) laid on us by God, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, or no penalties, because we are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>§. 26. 5. And that God's denying us any helps of his Spirit, and permitting the remnant of our Sin yet unhealed, and the weakness of our Graces, are an injurious denying us our Right.</p>
            <p>§. 27. 6. It would follow, that we have present Right to the present possession of the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59334:164"/>
both Grace and Glory, and that our delay is our wrong; because he that is supposed to have done all that the Law maketh his Duty from his Birth till his Death, hath right to the Reward by the Law or Covenant.</p>
            <p>§. 28. 7. And it would follow, That no Duty could be required of us as a Condition of any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit purchased by Christ, nor any sin charged on us so far as to be indeed our sin, because we are reputed perfectly holy and innocent.</p>
            <p>§. 29. Many other such Consequents I pass by, and other Arguments against this Opinion, and the Confutation of the contrary, because I have done it all elsewhere, especially in a peculiar Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse on this <note n="*" place="margin">Against Dr. <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s Accusations.</note> Subject, and in my Disputations of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>§. 30. Christ's own Righteousness habitual or actual, is not ours, as it is his, in strict sence <hi>in it self,</hi> as if we were the <hi>Proprietors,</hi> the Subjects of his Habits, or the Agents of his Acts: For it is impossible that the Accidents of several Subjects should be the same.</p>
            <p>§. 31. And the <hi>form</hi> of Christ's Righteousness is therefore no more <hi>ours,</hi> than the <hi>Matter:</hi> For Righteousness in Christ, and Righteousness in each Believer, are distinct Righteousnesses.</p>
            <p>§. 32. Many Divines have pleaded, That Christ's Righteousness is the <hi>form</hi> of ours; and others, that it is the <hi>Matter;</hi> and others, that it is the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cause;</hi> and have too much troubled the Church with Logical Notions. The meritorious Cause it is undoubtedly; and they that say, That it cannot then be the <hi>material Cause,</hi> must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59334:164"/>
that we mean, that it is the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>meritorious Cause:</hi> And had we been <hi>innocent our selves,</hi> would not our <hi>Innocency</hi> have been both the <hi>Matter</hi> of our <hi>righteousness</hi> (or <hi>Merit</hi>) and the <hi>meritorious Cause</hi> of our <hi>right to Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 33. But this supposeth that the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Gospel subordinate righteousness which consisteth in that Repentance, Faith, and Holiness, which is required in us to our right to life, is to be found in our selves, and not in Christ for us.</p>
            <p>§. 34. But the <hi>form</hi> of Christ's righteousness cannot be the form of ours, as is aforesaid; but it is the form of that which is the meritorious Cause of ours: But what need have we of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>§. 35. The <hi>Not imputing of sin,</hi> is called also by some, the <hi>Form of Iustification;</hi> and by others, <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>Imputation</hi> of <hi>righteousness</hi> conjunct; and by others, <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>God's accepting us</hi> as <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi> others call these the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Iustification;</hi> and thus mens Logick, ill-managed, troubleth the Hearers, which I would not mention, had it not been necessary to disintangle them.</p>
            <p>§. 36. They that will dispute what is the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Iustification,</hi> must first confess the Ambiguity of the Word, and tell us in which Sence they take it: There are so many things that are truly the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Iustification</hi> taken in many Sences, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such distinguishing to dispute of the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Iustification,</hi> is worse than to say nothing: <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> taken <hi>actively,</hi> as the <hi>Act of the Iustifyer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>ch of these are subdivided into <hi>many Acts,</hi> and <hi>many Effects,</hi> which have each their <hi>form.</hi> The Act of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59334:165"/>
               <hi>pardoning sin,</hi> is one <hi>thing,</hi> and therefore hath one form: The Act of making us inherently righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or performers of the Condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace hath another form: The Act of <hi>esteeming</hi> us righteous, hath another: The Act of our Advocate defending our righteousness, another. The Act of Justifying-evidence and Witness, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: The Act of sentencing us righteous, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: And the Act of executive Justification, or rewarding and saving us, as righteous, another. And accordingly <hi>Iustification passively</hi> taken, hath as many <hi>forms</hi> as it signifieth various Effects. To be in a state of <hi>conditional Iustification,</hi> to be <hi>Performers of the Condition of the Law of Grace,</hi> to have <hi>jus impunitatis, right to Impunity</hi> (that is, to be pardoned) and to have <hi>jus Doni &amp; Praemii reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni coelestis,</hi> a <hi>right to Glory,</hi> as a <hi>gift,</hi> and as a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> (in several respects) are all Effects of God's foresaid Acts, and every one hath its proper Being and Form: And all this as given us; for the Merits of Christ's righteousness, concur to make up <hi>our whole Iustification</hi> as <hi>constitutive and virtual in Law;</hi> and each <hi>part</hi> hath its proper form: And then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologetick, Judiciary (or Sentential) and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justification, are also various <hi>Species,</hi> which have their Forms.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>One Iustification</hi> is but <hi>one thing;</hi> but there are divers things so called, even in Scripture. When Christ saith, <hi>By thy words thou shalt be justified,</hi> Mat. 12. and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that we are <hi>justified</hi> by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59334:165"/>
have <hi>one form,</hi> and yet its <hi>many parts</hi> have <hi>many forms:</hi> Our <hi>righteousness</hi> taken for the <hi>whole</hi> of it, is <hi>one whole,</hi> whose form is signified by that general Name of our <hi>total righteousness;</hi> and yet its <hi>parts</hi> are all those before-mentioned, which yet each severally are commonly called <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> But of these things before.</p>
            <p>§. 37. Either then let us meddle as little as may be, with arbitrary Logical Notions in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, or let us handle them exactly, or else un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful using them in weighty matters, becomes a vain entangling of poor Souls, and a childish way of troubling the Church of God. The truth is, the <hi>forms</hi> of such <hi>Acts</hi> are best known by their bare <hi>Names,</hi> if they be <hi>rightly named;</hi> and by the <hi>Name</hi> many understand what they are, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>they</hi> nor their <hi>Teachers</hi> can find other words by which to give you a fair Definition of them, which maketh me think of some of our <hi>over-wise,</hi> and <hi>over-righteous Catechizers</hi> of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, who use to turn plain, honest persons from the Sacrament of Communion, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell them what <hi>God is, what Holiness is,</hi> what <hi>Faith, Repentance, Sanctification, Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Adoption</hi> is, by some congruous Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when yet a wise Examination might shew, that by the <hi>Name</hi> they understand the Matter it self, though not by distinct Notions; and when the Catechizer too often would be found shamefully to seek, if he were put to answer his own Questions by a true Definition (as I have tried.)</p>
            <p>§. 38. To conclude, there are many sharp Volumes written of late, which reproach <hi>Imputed</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:59334:166"/>
               <hi>Righteousness,</hi> to which they seem induced by some mens misexplication of it; and by such unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words as some Independents use of it, in their Savoy-Confession: And they dream that we deny all necessity of Personal fulfilling the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Law of Grace, as a means of our Justification and Salvation: But they utterly wrong the generality of Divines of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and notice: And I must tell them, for the Independents, that they did not subscribe or <hi>vote</hi> that Confession, as some present assure me, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very few men brought it in and read it, and none spake against it: And some worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of that Assembly, upon conference, assure me, That how ill soever it be worded, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did mean it as I and other Protestants do, and did disclaim the obvious ill sence.</p>
            <p>And I add, Had these Contenders but taken up with the distinction of Imputation which Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> giveth in the Preface to his <hi>reconciling Tractate of Iustification,</hi> it might have quieted them; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, in what sence Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is imputed to us, and in what not: And they would have seen that which is not ours, as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries</hi> of the thing it self <hi>in se,</hi> may be called <hi>ours,</hi> because the <hi>Effects are ours,</hi> and it was <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God,</hi> for the meriting of those Effects <hi>for us.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> How Faith justifieth; and how it is imputed to us for Righteousness.</head>
            <p>§. 1. ABout this also there are many needless notional Controversies among men that are agreed in the matter it self: As whether <hi>Faith justifie as it receiveth Christ in all his mediatorial Office,</hi> as <hi>Prophet, Priest</hi> and <hi>King?</hi> Or only as in his <hi>Priestly Office?</hi> And whether, as it receiveth him in all the <hi>parts of that Office,</hi> or <hi>which?</hi> Or as it receiveth his <hi>Righteousness</hi> only? Whether Faith justifie us as an <hi>Instrument</hi> only? Or as a <hi>Condition?</hi> Or as <hi>meritorious?</hi> Whether it justifie us by being it <hi>self imputed</hi> to us for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or it be <hi>Christ's righteousness only</hi> that is so imputed? Whether Faith alone justifie us, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Repentance, Desire, Hope, or any other acts of the Soul towards Christ? Whether only Faith in Christ justifie, and not Faith in God the Father, or belief of the Promise, or of Heaven? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of all which briefly.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I. The word [<hi>Receiving</hi>] (Christ, Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) hath two different sences necessarily to be distinguished: 1. <hi>Physical Receiving</hi> is the strict sence, as <hi>pati</hi> and <hi>recipere</hi> are all one: Which is, 1. To receive the meer Act of the <hi>Agent ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively;</hi> or, 2. To receive a <hi>further effect</hi> of that Act.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59334:167"/>2. <hi>Moral receiving</hi> is nothing but accepting of an offered thing by <hi>consent</hi> of <hi>Will:</hi> And so to <hi>receive</hi> supposeth an <hi>offer,</hi> and is nothing but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>§. 3. To <hi>receive Grace</hi> in the strict <hi>physical</hi> sence, is to be made <hi>gracious,</hi> or to be the Patients of the Operation of <hi>Grace</hi> if it be real: But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>relative Grace physically,</hi> is nothing but to be made so <hi>related:</hi> So to receive <hi>Sanctification</hi> is to be sanctified, and to receive Justification or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, is nothing but to be justified or pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But how is Christ <hi>himself</hi> physically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? That were easily known, if you knew how he is <hi>physically given.</hi> But for a Gift of <hi>Christ's person</hi> by <hi>physical attingency,</hi> we can say nothing of it by Scripture-warrant, that I know of: It is no matter for our Disputes. But in two sences Christ is said to be given to us: 1. In <hi>Relation,</hi> as a <hi>King</hi> to his Subjects, or a <hi>Husband</hi> to his Wife: And so we <hi>physically receive</hi> those <hi>Relations,</hi> as aforesaid: That is, we are made <hi>related to him.</hi> 2. In the <hi>real Communication</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> to us: And so we <hi>physically receive</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> in its <hi>operations;</hi> that is, He worketh them on us: This is the <hi>first sence</hi> of <hi>Receiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 4. But <hi>morally</hi> to <hi>receive Grace,</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> is but to <hi>consent</hi> that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> be ours: As a <hi>Subject,</hi> a <hi>Servant,</hi> a <hi>Wife, consent</hi> to their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is our <hi>Faith,</hi> and not the former.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Where note, That <hi>moral Receiving</hi> (or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>) is but a <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>physical Receiving</hi> (or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>) and a means which maketh not the <hi>thing ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> any otherwise, than as the <hi>Will of the Giver doth appoint,</hi> and give it its Power thereunto.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59334:167"/>
This <hi>moral receiving</hi> or <hi>accepting</hi> is but <hi>dispositio recipientis,</hi> as to <hi>having</hi> or <hi>physical reception;</hi> as there must be in all things <hi>dispositio materiae ad formam recipiendam:</hi> He that will not accept the Gift, is accounted by the Giver <hi>morally unfit</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>§. 6. But this is not spoken of <hi>every Gift;</hi> but of such as are offered by the Giver on the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thankful acceptance.</hi> For God giveth <hi>many</hi> things <hi>absolutely;</hi> as Christ was given to be Man's Redeemer, and Christ gave his <hi>Covenant, Gospel,</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and sendeth the <hi>word</hi> to many that before have it not, and giveth the first Grace, which causeth mens <hi>acceptance</hi> of the other, and all this not on the <hi>Condition</hi> of their acceptance: But the Gifts bestowed by the <hi>Baptismal Covenant</hi> of Grace, are all given on Condition of our <hi>moral receiving</hi> or <hi>acceptance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. This necessary distinction of <hi>receiving</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing premised, I answer the question as followeth: 1. To be justified, is to be the <hi>physical Receiver</hi> of <hi>Goa's justifying act,</hi> and nothing else in proper sence.</p>
            <p>§. 8. 2. No man physically receiveth Christ's Person (as far as we can prove or understand) nor <hi>Christ's own Righteousness in it self;</hi> but we <hi>physically receive our relation to Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits operations,</hi> and our Right to <hi>Impunity</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. 3. We at once <hi>sensu physico,</hi> receive our <hi>relation</hi> to Christ as our Head, that is, our <hi>redeeming Owner, Ruler</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> as <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>King;</hi> and not to one first, and to another after.</p>
            <p>§. 10. 4. In the same instant of time that we receive our <hi>relation to Christ,</hi> as aforesaid, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>with him,</hi> as his <hi>Grace,</hi> by the same <hi>donative</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:59334:168"/>
               <hi>act</hi> of the Covenant, our Right to <hi>Impunity</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> even to the complacential special Love of the Father, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost, and so are justified.</p>
            <p>§. 11. 5. Our <hi>moral receiving</hi> of Christ himself as our Saviour, is the antecedent Condition of our foresaid physical reception or participation, being appointed by God to that use or office.</p>
            <p>§. 12. 6. This <hi>moral receiving</hi> is that <hi>Faith</hi> which I before at large described, and is sometime called <hi>Believing,</hi> and sometime <hi>Trusting,</hi> because it is in whole a <hi>believing fiducial Consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 13. 7. This Belief and Consent or Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, hath essentially for its object <hi>all that is essential to Christ,</hi> as our Saviour; his Natures, Person, his Humiliation, Obedience, his Sacrifice and Resurrection, his Intercession, Dominion, Judgment, together with his Doctrine, Promises, and Grace; besides God himself and the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory: And it is not true Faith that hath not all this, at least confusedly and in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>§. 14. 8. They that say, <hi>Faith justifyeth as it receiveth Christ's Righteousness,</hi> and not as it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>Christ himself in relation,</hi> or at least not as <hi>Teacher, Lord, Intercessor, &amp;c.</hi> do draw men into deceit by a Phrase which intimateth a false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or two, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. It is false that <hi>Faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth us,</hi> if they mean <hi>efficiently;</hi> as shall be shewed anon. But it is true, (though some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it) that <hi>Faith justifyeth constitutively,</hi> so far as it is it self our <hi>personal inherent Righteousness,</hi> (of which after): But this they mean not: Nor is <hi>Faith in Christ's righteousness</hi> any more our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteousness than Faith in his Promises,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59334:168"/>
his Intercession or his Government, or in God the Father. 2. It is false, that Faith <hi>as Faith</hi> doth justifie; either as it is Faith in this or that or the other part of the Office of Christ; for then we should be justified, as they call it, by that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o credere;</hi> and then if God had not made <hi>Faith</hi> the Condition of Justification, yet <hi>qua talis</hi> it would have justified.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 9. But the Case is very plain: There is considerable in Faith, 1. <hi>Its Nature,</hi> and that is only its <hi>material Aptitude</hi> to its Office: 2. The <hi>Office it self,</hi> and that is to be the <hi>Condition</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God the Donor, of our Interest in his Gifts (and so of Justification). Now it justifieth not <hi>efficiently</hi> at all (unless you take Justification for making us <hi>Holy</hi>). But it is the <hi>Condition</hi> of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and so we are said to be justified by it as by a <hi>Condition;</hi> but it is not a Condition, <hi>qua fides,</hi> or as it receiveth Christ's Righteousness, but as it is <hi>made by God</hi> a <hi>Condition in his Covenant.</hi> But <hi>Faith, as Faith in Christ,</hi> is the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>this Condition:</hi> Or its <hi>Aptitude</hi> to its <hi>Office</hi> is in Faith <hi>qua talis:</hi> And no other had been so fit: But then it is not only our belief or acceptance of Christ's Righteousness that is this Aptitude: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>entire Faith in its essentials</hi> is this <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>aptitude,</hi> and the formal reason of its place or office about our Justification, is its being the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> appointed thereto in the Instrument of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>§. 16. 10. Were the Question about <hi>physical Receiving,</hi> it were true, that a man is justified <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus,</hi> as he <hi>receiveth</hi> Justification, and adopted as he <hi>receiveth</hi> Adoption, and sanctified as he <hi>receiveth</hi> Sanctification, and glorified as he <hi>receiveth</hi> Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59334:169"/>
and not something else; as he is rich as he receiveth Riches, and honourable as he receiveth Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>moral acceptance</hi> of <hi>one thing</hi> is oft made the <hi>Condition</hi> of our <hi>having another thing;</hi> and here our acceptance of <hi>whole Christ</hi> is our <hi>undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Condition-title</hi> to <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>Gifts.</hi> We are no more justified for or by consenting to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, than for or by consenting to be sanctified, and to learn of <hi>Christ,</hi> and obey him.</p>
            <p>§. 17. Yea more; men use to put that into the Condition of something which the Person fain would have, which he is more backward to, and would not else do or have. A Physician useth not to say, <hi>Thou shalt be cured if thou consent to be cured; but if thou consent to take my Medicines and follow my Prescript.</hi> A Father will not say to the Child, I will give thee this Apple if thou wilt have it; but if thou wilt thank me for it, and do thy Duty: So if we might make a difference in the reason of the thing, we should say, That God saith not only, <hi>Thou shalt have Christ's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> or <hi>justification by it, if thou wilt have it;</hi> no more than [Thou shalt be saved from Hell if thou wilt] (and who would not be forgiven?) But [<hi>thou shalt have Christ and Life, Pardon, Grace and Glory, if thou wilt thankfully take them together as they are,</hi> or <hi>wilt</hi> be <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>ruled</hi> by Christ, and renounce the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and take God and Glory for thy all.]</p>
            <p>§. 18. Christ's <hi>own righteousness</hi> being not <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially given</hi> to us <hi>in it self,</hi> but <hi>given for us;</hi> and <hi>to us in the Effects,</hi> to say, That the <hi>receiving of that which is not given,</hi> is the only <hi>justifying act</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is to say, That we are not justified by <hi>Faith</hi> at all. But if they mean the <hi>Effects of Christ's Righteousness,</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59334:169"/>
then it is but to say, <hi>We are justified by no act of Faith, but by consenting to be justified by Christ's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi> Which is not true.</p>
            <p>§. 19. They contradict themselves that make Christ's Priestly Office the <hi>only Object</hi> of Justifying Faith, and yet make his <hi>whole Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> that Object: For who knoweth not, that all Christ's Righteousness was not performed by him only as Priest.</p>
            <p>§. 20. And Christ's Priesthood hath many other actions belonging to it, besides his Merits offered for us: Even his present <hi>Intercession:</hi> Which must be excluded, if Christ's Righteousness here, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, were the only Object of this Faith.</p>
            <p>§. 21. II. The second Question I had never troubled the World about so much as I have done, had I not found too many Protestants scandalize the Papists, by laying too much on the Nation of <hi>Instrumentality,</hi> ill explained. But the judicious are here all in sence of the same mind.</p>
            <p>§. 22. For by an <hi>Instrument</hi> they mean not, 1. an instrumental efficient Cause of Justification: 2. Nor of making Christ's Righteousness ours: For we give it not to our selves. 3. But they take the word <hi>Instrument</hi> mechanically or less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately, and tell us, that they mean <hi>a receiving Instrument,</hi> as a Boy <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Kendal.</hi>
               </note> catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Ball in his Hat: But so as that it is a <hi>moral Instrument,</hi> that is, both <hi>materially</hi> a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral act,</hi> and the Instrument of a <hi>moral</hi> not <hi>physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 23. But when they have all done, they do but entangle and trouble themselves and others with an unapt Logical notion: For (as it is so easie to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59334:170"/>
confute the gross Conceit, That Faith is an <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental efficient Cause</hi> (either God's or Man's) of our Justification; (which I have done so oft, that I will here pretermit it, so) this Notion of a <hi>Passive Instrument</hi> is unapt, because, 1. The Act of <hi>Assent</hi> is essential to this justifying Faith, as well as <hi>Acceptance;</hi> and so is <hi>Trust,</hi> which yet are no more <hi>Instrumental</hi> in reception, than many other Acts, even Love, Desire, Hope. 2. Because our <hi>Consent</hi> to other things, as well as to be <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and our <hi>Faith in God the Father,</hi> are as truly the Condition of our <hi>Iustification,</hi> as our <hi>Consent to be justified.</hi> 3. And because this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical use of the Word <hi>Instrument,</hi> leadeth peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to dream of proper Instrumentality, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadeth them from the apter Notions: The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Donation is the justifying Instrument.</p>
            <p>§. 24. I conclude therefore summarily, 1. <hi>Faith, as Faith in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> in the Sence of the <hi>Baptismal Covenant,</hi> is the <hi>apt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to be the Condition of our Justification by the Gift of that Covenant.</p>
            <p>2. If Justification be taken for <hi>making us just Performers</hi> of the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace; so Faith justifieth us, 1. Constitutively <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> as it is the beginning of that Righteousness it self. 2. And by a <hi>moral efficiency,</hi> as it is a cause of <hi>Love and Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If Justification be taken for the <hi>Gift,</hi> or <hi>right to Impunity and Life in and with Christ,</hi> so Faith is the <hi>Condition</hi> of it, and no otherwise justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>4. But if any will call this by the name of a <hi>Submerit,</hi> with the Ancients, meaning but that it meriteth Justification, as a Child meriteth a piece
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59334:170"/>
of Gold from his Father, by putting off his Hat, and saying, I thank you, and humbly taking it, instead of scornful or neglectful refusing it, I will not quarrel with any such.</p>
            <p>§. 25. But remember, that as wise men seldom make any thing a <hi>Condition of a gift,</hi> which hath <hi>no worth</hi> in it to <hi>please</hi> them; so God <hi>saw,</hi> and <hi>put</hi> such a <hi>worth</hi> or <hi>aptitude</hi> in Faith, or else he had not so much as <hi>commanded it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 26. But yet a <hi>Condition</hi> simply as such, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth neither <hi>Merit</hi> nor <hi>Causality</hi> at all; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the terms on which the gift shall be suspended, till they be performed:</hi> And so the performance of a <hi>Condition</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> is no <hi>efficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of the <hi>gift,</hi> but a removing of the suspending impediment.</p>
            <p>§. 27. Therefore Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> oft calleth Faith <hi>Causam dispositivam justificationis,</hi> which belongeth not to the efficient, but <hi>material</hi> or <hi>recipient</hi> Cause; and the true <hi>Legal</hi> Notion of its next Interest in our Justification, is its being [<hi>Conditio praestita</hi>] and the true <hi>Logical</hi> Notion is to be [<hi>Dispositio moralis materiae, sive subjecti recipientis</hi>] call it <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam vel Conditionem dispositivam,</hi> as you please: And I think this Question needs no more.</p>
            <p>§. 28. III. As to the third Question, the truth is obvious, That <hi>Christ's righteousness is imputed,</hi> and yet <hi>Faith is imputed to us for righteousness</hi> in several Sences; that is, each is reputed to be to us what indeed <hi>it is.</hi> Two things make up the Sence of <hi>Faith's being imputed to us for righteousness:</hi> 1. Faith is really the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, which whoso performeth, he is <hi>righteous</hi> against the Charge of <hi>Non-performance</hi> of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and it is reputed our <hi>subordinate, Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:59334:171"/>
               <hi>personal, righteousness:</hi> 2. And supposing Christ's Merits and our Redemption by him, this Gospel-righteousness is all that is required <hi>of us on our parts,</hi> instead of all that perfect Obedience which the Law of Innocency required. So that our Faith (taken in the Scripture-sence) is our <hi>real righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> related to the Condition of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and <hi>instead of a more perfect righteousness of Innocency;</hi> forasmuch as after Christ's Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, is required to be performed by our selves.</p>
            <p>§. 29. This, no Christians that are sober, can deny, as to the thing: And as to the <hi>Name,</hi> it is plain to the impartial that will see that <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4. 22, 23, 24. and <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 23. by <hi>Faith</hi> means <hi>Faith</hi> it self indeed, and not only <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as some affirm, with too great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal: read over the Texts, and try what Sence it will be, if you put [<hi>Christ</hi>] instead of [<hi>Faith.</hi>]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 30. Obj.</hi> But it is not Faith in, and of it self that's meant, but as connoting the Object.</p>
            <p>Ans. The latter clause is true: it is Faith, as <hi>connoting</hi> the <hi>Object,</hi> Christ: But the former is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For <hi>Faith</hi> it self <hi>essentially</hi> connoteth the <hi>Object:</hi> If you speak not of <hi>Faith in genere</hi> (for it is not <hi>any</hi> kind of Faith that is our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) but of the <hi>Christian,</hi> or <hi>New Covenant Faith in specie,</hi> who knoweth not that the Object specifieth it? And therefore if it be <hi>Christian faith,</hi> as connoting the Object, it is <hi>Christian faith</hi> as <hi>Christian faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 31. But will any sober Christian deny, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>§. 32. IV. As to the fourth Question, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. We are all agreed, That God will not pardon, justifie, or save any, without both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi> as necessary moral Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Receiver: And this shall serve turn, if any like not the term [<hi>Condition</hi>] and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be quiet.</p>
            <p>§. 33. 2. Faith in a narrow Sence, as signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>meer Assent,</hi> is distinct from <hi>Repentance;</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi> in that sence as is meant in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and hath the Promise of Justification and Life, is more the same with Repentance than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perceive. For <hi>Repentance</hi> is the change of the mind from <hi>evil to good?</hi> And the Good necessary to our Salvation, is a <hi>fiducial practical Consent</hi> to the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> or a <hi>practical Faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</hi> And to <hi>turn to this,</hi> is to repent and be converted; even to turn from the contrary Acts and Objects to this fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial consenting Belief in God the Father, Son, and Spirit; and what else is <hi>repenting,</hi> but <hi>this Change?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 34. 3. It was never <hi>Paul's</hi> meaning, under the name of <hi>Works,</hi> to exclude <hi>Repentance,</hi> and all Acts of Faith, save one, and Thankfulness, and Desire, and Hope, and Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while they keep their place in subordination to Christ: They do but confound sacred Doctrines and mens minds, that so imagine.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of Assurance of our <hi>Justification,</hi> and of Hope.</head>
            <p>§. 1. ASsurance of <hi>Perseverance</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> is not here to be spoken of, but only of our <hi>present Iustification:</hi> And they are distinct Questions. 1. What Assurance <hi>is desirable.</hi> 2. What Assurance is <hi>attainable.</hi> 3. What Assurance we <hi>actually have,</hi> and who have it. 4. What is the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>grounds</hi> of this Assurance.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I. Some pleaded so much for the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Uncertainty</hi> and <hi>Doubting,</hi> as if it were the safest condition to keep us humble and watchful, as excited <hi>Luther</hi> and other Reformers to take them for utter Enemies to Christian Comfort. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Assurance</hi> is a most <hi>desirable</hi> thing; it kindleth in us the <hi>love of God;</hi> it maketh <hi>Duty sweet;</hi> it maketh <hi>Sufferings easie,</hi> and <hi>Death less terrible,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> more <hi>desired,</hi> and consequently cureth an <hi>earthly Mind,</hi> and leadeth man to a <hi>heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> and <hi>putteth Life</hi> into all his <hi>Endeavours:</hi> Whereas a man that is still <hi>utterly in doubt</hi> of his state of Salvation, and right to Life, will be loath to die, and therefore <hi>love this present World,</hi> and have less thankful and loving Thoughts of God and his Redeemer, and so all sin will have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and Holiness a great impediment. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel will confess, that such <hi>Assurance</hi> is exceeding desirable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:59334:174"/>§. 3. II. And no doubt but a comfortable <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of Assurance is <hi>attainable,</hi> or else God would never have so fully differenced the Righteous and the Wicked, and commanded all to examine and try themselves, and to make sure: But this I have often elsewhere proved.</p>
            <p>§. 4. III. But all true Believers have not As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of their Justification, because they are not certain that their Faith is such as hath the promise of Justification: He that believeth perceiveth that he believeth, but yet may be uncertain that his Faith is so sincere, as no unjustified man can have.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Their Justification is real, or true, or certain in it self; but the Evidence of it may be dark, and their perception of the Evidence defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; from whence it is to them uncertain; that is, not known with that full satisfaction of mind, which we call Assurance.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Yea, Experience telleth us, That it is but a <hi>small part</hi> of the most <hi>religious Christians,</hi> who will say themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they are <hi>certain</hi> of their <hi>Iustification;</hi> and of those few that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest to <hi>say so,</hi> all have it not.</p>
            <p>§. 7. Therefore <hi>justifying Faith</hi> is not <hi>Assurance</hi> that we <hi>are justified;</hi> otherwise all should have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that have Faith; and <hi>justifying Faith</hi> in order of Nature, goeth <hi>before Iustification,</hi> but <hi>Assurance</hi> that we are <hi>justified,</hi> followeth it; we cannot be <hi>assured</hi> that we are <hi>justified,</hi> but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assured that we <hi>believe:</hi> But it's absurd to say, [I am assured I am justified, because I am assured that I am justified.] But this is only against the <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:59334:174"/>§. 8. No man hath <hi>perfect</hi> Assurance, that is the highest degree in this Life: For if <hi>all our Graces</hi> be <hi>imperfect,</hi> our Assurance must needs be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>§. 9. IV. This <hi>Assurance</hi> then is not properly <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> or a <hi>Belief of God's Word;</hi> but it is a clear and satisfying perception of our own Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, because we are clearly satisfied, that <hi>God's Promises are true,</hi> and that <hi>we are true</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>§. 10. This Certainty is not by an <hi>immediate Word</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Spirit in us; but yet the Spirit is all these ways the cause of it in the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 1. The Spirit working us to <hi>God's Image and Will,</hi> is our <hi>assuring-Evidence,</hi> or the <hi>Minor</hi> in that Argument, whose Conclusion we are assured of (as the Spirit in the Word is the <hi>Major.</hi>) 2. The Spirit in Believers helpeth them to <hi>perceive</hi> his <hi>own Works</hi> in them, and know their Evidence: 3. And also to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in that perception. This is the Witness of the Spirit which we mean, and not <hi>immediate Revelation.</hi>

            <p>§. 11. Though <hi>Hope</hi> be sometimes about things certain, yet it is often also about that which we are <hi>not certain</hi> of: And more have <hi>true Hopes</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> than have <hi>Assurance</hi> of it, or of their Title to it: For <hi>Hope</hi> may be exercised upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, and most usually it is so.</p>
            <p>§. 12. <hi>Strong Probability,</hi> with <hi>little reason of doubting,</hi> may cause such strong <hi>Hopes</hi> as may cause us to live and die with comfort: If <hi>doubting</hi> be <hi>small,</hi> and <hi>Hope be great,</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> will be greater than the <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi>

            <p>§. 14. While we are <hi>certain</hi> that <hi>this World</hi> is <hi>fading Vanity,</hi> and that there <hi>is no hope</hi> of <hi>Felicity on Earth,</hi> and that therefore Godliness can cost us the loss of nothing but <hi>Vanity,</hi> a <hi>Faith short of Certainty,</hi> and mixt with <hi>doubting,</hi> about the very <hi>Truth of the Promise it self,</hi> and <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> may engage a man savingly in a holy Life, and the forsaking of all for the hopes of Glory: And such doubting, even of the Life to come, or of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as keepeth not men from trusting to it for their Felicity, and seeking it above all, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking all for it, will keep no man from Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it be his sin, and the cause of other sins.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of good Works and Merit, and trusting to any thing of our own.</head>
            <p>§. 1. HEre are several Controversies that trouble our Peace, but few of them that are so great as they are commonly imagined:
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59334:175"/>
As, 1. What are good Works (which indeed is of great weight, and the chief in which we really differ about Works.) 2. Whether they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Justification or Salvation. 3. Whether they are meritorious or rewardable. 4. What place they have, and what is their use and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. 5. Whether we may trust to them.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I. It is one of the Devil's chief Policies in the World, to cast out Christ's Interest by its <hi>Counterfeits:</hi> To expugn true Wisdom by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Wisdom, and true Faith by counterfeit Faith, and true Zeal and Piety by counterfeit Zeal and Piety, and true Unity, and Concord, and Peace, by their Counterfeits, and true Worship, Ministry, Discipline, by their Counterfeits; and true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by counterfeit Comfort; and so also it is by <hi>counterfeit good Works,</hi> that <hi>good Works</hi> are oft cast off.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The measure of all created Goodness, is the <hi>Will</hi> of the Creator, who is the prime, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Good; and no Work of Man is morally good, but what is made so by the <hi>Will</hi> of God; that is, 1. <hi>Efficiently,</hi> by his <hi>operative Will:</hi> 2. <hi>Directive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> by his <hi>commanding Will:</hi> And, 3. <hi>Finally</hi> and <hi>Objectively,</hi> by his <hi>pleased, or fulfilled Will.</hi> Man's <hi>Wit, Will,</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi> cannot serve to make any action morally good.</p>
            <p>§. 4. He that <hi>intendeth God's Honour,</hi> and the <hi>pleasing of his Will,</hi> and the good of his own or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Souls, or the safety of Religion, or the Church, or State, and <hi>useth means</hi> hereto, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or any way appointed him of God (much more if directly forbidden) doth not a Work that is truly good, but only <hi>secundum quid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:59334:176"/>§. 5. Could we be sure that such a Work would <hi>save Souls,</hi> or save <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> or our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours lives, it would not make it <hi>morally</hi> a <hi>good Work;</hi> but only make the <hi>Effect</hi> to be <hi>physically good</hi> to others that are benefited by it.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Therefore to <hi>build Churches,</hi> or <hi>Hospitals,</hi> to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>cloath</hi> the Poor, to save Mens <hi>Lives,</hi> to <hi>preach the Gospel,</hi> are all such as finally do a <hi>physical good,</hi> and they are the <hi>matter of moral good;</hi> but <hi>forma denominat:</hi> Those Actions are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good, unless, 1. done <hi>in obedience</hi> to God's commanding, or <hi>ruling</hi> Will: 2. And <hi>finally to please his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. Those Priests therefore that set carnal, ungodly Sinners (Fornicators, Murderers, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Drunkards, Lyers, Perjured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating their Sins by <hi>good Works,</hi> without teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perswading them to that <hi>internal repentance,</hi> and <hi>Conversion of their Wills,</hi> and <hi>holy devotedness to God,</hi> by which their <hi>Works</hi> must have a right <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, End,</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> do but delude men, and cheat them by flattery into perdition.</p>
            <p>§. 8. Much more pernicious is it, to take <hi>Sin, Folly,</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> for <hi>good Works,</hi> and look to be saved by that which deserveth Damnation, and to expiate sin by sin; such are the Works of <hi>Persecuters</hi> that think they serve God by unjust kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or imprisoning his Servants, or causeless si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing his faithful Ministers; such were the Wars of the <hi>Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59334:176"/>
Kings of <hi>England;</hi> such hath been the zealous killing of Kings, and burning of honest desirable Dissenters; and such is the alienating <hi>Mens Estates</hi> from <hi>better Uses,</hi> to maintain a supernumerous sinful, vicious, idle Monastery, or their prelatical needless Pomp and Pride; or to buy Pardons or Masses for <hi>departed Souls;</hi> or to build <hi>useless Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> to the Honour of some Saint or Angel; or to set up useless Formalities and Shadows, as Candles by day-light, and abundance such: And such are long <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> to the Shrines of such as the Pope hath Canonized, and to visit Relicks, and the carrying about of Relicks, with an ungrounded carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence in them; with many such like.</p>
            <p>§. 9. So wosully hath the Papal Party, and not they only, but in too great a measure, the <hi>Greeks, Moscovites, Armenians, Syrians, Coptics, Abas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,</hi> and most of the Churches corrupted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion by their useless or seducing Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries called <hi>good Works,</hi> that they have among them defiled its Purity, rejected its Primitive Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, obscured and dishonoured its Glory, and made it seem contemptible to <hi>Mahometans</hi> and Heathens; and made it less fit to destroy sin, and frustrate Satan, and to please God, and to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and save mens Souls.</p>
            <p>§. 10. II. Were all Sects and Parties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, well agreed what <hi>Works are truly good,</hi> it would be a shame to us, should we not agree in the main <hi>how far they are necessary,</hi> when the Case is so plain throughout the Scripture: I think we are commonly agreed as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:59334:177"/>§. 11. 1. <hi>Perfect Obedience</hi> is not of absolute necessity to Salvation, because we are under a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that hath easier terms.</p>
            <p>§. 12. 2. The Works of the Mosaical Jewish Law, are neither necessary <hi>necessitate praecepti vel medii,</hi> that Law not binding us as such.</p>
            <p>§. 13. 3. Obedience to Man's Laws is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, when the matter is forbidden us by God's Laws, or when they are Laws without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that is, such as men have no Authority to make.</p>
            <p>§. 14. 4. No Works of special Grace are ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently necessary to our reception of that Grace, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of its necessary means.</p>
            <p>§. 15. 5. No <hi>external acts of sincere Obedience,</hi> distinct from internal Faith, and Repentance, and Consent, are necessary before to our first Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; that is, to our right to Impunity and life in Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 16. 6. Even <hi>internal Obedience to Christ as Christ,</hi> distinct from our Obedience to God as God, and our <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> (or Consent to be his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and obey him) is not before necessary to our part in Christ, or our Union, or Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in its first state or beginning.</p>
            <p>§. 17. 7. Therefore if we should suppose that a Man should die immediately upon his first <hi>internal Faith and Consent</hi> to the Covenant, before he had time to do one Act internal or external of formal <hi>Obedience to Christ, as Christ,</hi> that Man would be saved. But the Supposition is so utterly improbable, that it is not to be put as a matter of Dispute: The Thief on the Cross per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed some Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:59334:177"/>§. 18. 8. No Works of Man's are necessary to profit God, or can add to his Perfection or Felicity: He needeth not us nor any of our doings.</p>
            <p>§. 19. 9. No Works of ours are necessary to make up any defects in the Merits of Christ, or to any use which is proper to Christ or his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or efficacious Grace.</p>
            <p>§. 20. 10. No <hi>preparatory Works</hi> of Man's (I think) are <hi>absolutely</hi> before necessary to God's effectual converting of him, (unless you will call the Acts of Nature, by which he is fit to hear and think, preparatory Works unfitly): For God <hi>can give</hi> his Grace to unprepared Souls.</p>
            <p>§. 21. On the affirmative also we are agreed, 1. That all Mankind are under God's Government by some Law, and owe Him Obedience to that Law.</p>
            <p>§. 22. 2. That it is only Disobedience that God punisheth according to the Penal part of that Law which men live under.</p>
            <p>§. 23. 3. That it is only <hi>Obedience</hi> which God rewardeth, according to the rewarding or promissory part of the Law that men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>§. 24. 4. That the Law of Grace (and not only that of Innocency) hath its Commands of Obedience, and Promises of Reward.</p>
            <p>§. 25. 5. That men must believe that there is a God before they can believe that Christ is the Anointed of God and the Mediator between God and man; and therefore must first believe God's Soveraign Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:59334:178"/>§. 26. 6. God <hi>commandeth men</hi> to believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> (and so maketh it their Duty) and to take him for their Lord and Saviour by Faith.</p>
            <p>§. 27. 7. Men ought thus to believe in Christ and accept him, in <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>this Command of God,</hi> believing that it is <hi>his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 28. 8. Therefore there is some sort of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in God,</hi> and <hi>Obedience to God,</hi> which is in order before our <hi>Faith in Christ:</hi> And <hi>Faith in Christ as it is voluntary</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> is an Act of such <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 29. 9. Yet is it the <hi>antecedent Teaching</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (by <hi>Nature,</hi> by the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>all</hi>) by which we now come to know God to be God, and that he is to be believed and obeyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ is mens <hi>Teacher,</hi> and thereby <hi>bringeth them to believe first in God,</hi> before he is <hi>known to be their Teacher,</hi> and <hi>believed on himself.</hi> As the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams before its rising give some Light to the Earth.</p>
            <p>§. 30. 10. God hath commanded men that hear not of Christ, the use of some means, which Mercy hath (through Christ) afforded them, which have a tendency to their Salvation, and should be used to that end. And his bare Command to use such means (much more as seconded with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Mercies) tell us, that he bids not men use them in vain, or without any hope of good success (of which before).</p>
            <p>§. 31. 11. He that <hi>heareth</hi> of Christ and <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not,</hi> or <hi>believeth uneffectually,</hi> and is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted sound Believer, is under God's Command to use certain means allowed him, to procure <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>true Conversion,</hi> and that not without all hope of good success.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:59334:178"/>§. 32. 12. It is God's ordinary way to give his <hi>first special converting Grace,</hi> to <hi>predisposed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> prepared by his <hi>commoner Grace;</hi> in which Preparation some Acts of Man have their part: And the unprepared and undisposed cannot equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect it.</p>
            <p>§. 33. 13. Faith and Repentance are Acts of Man, and pre-requisite to Justification: Therefore as <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> are words of the same sence, so <hi>Works,</hi> even <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Special Grace</hi> are pre-requisite to Justification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But not as Acts, but for the Object?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That's a contradiction. Christ is Christ whether we believe in him or not; and it's one thing to say <hi>Christ is necessary,</hi> and another thing to say, <hi>Believing in him is necessary:</hi> It is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary meerly as an <hi>Act in genere,</hi> but as <hi>this Act in specie;</hi> and it is specified (as is aforesaid) by its Object. Not only <hi>Christ</hi> believed in, but <hi>Believing in Christ</hi> is pre-requisite as a <hi>moral disposition</hi> to Justification: And in that sence a <hi>Work</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of Man.</p>
            <p>§. 34. 14. It is before shewed, that this Faith is a <hi>moral Work,</hi> containing (not one only, but) <hi>many physical acts:</hi> He that <hi>believeth in Christ,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him as sent of God, to reconcile us to God, to bring us to Glory, to save us from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Sin,</hi> and <hi>Enemies,</hi> to sanctifie us by his Word and Spirit, with many such acts that make up the Essence of Saving-Faith: <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe on him whom the Father hath sent,</hi> Joh. 6. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>§. 35. 15. The Faith that hath the Promise of Justification, is essentially a <hi>subjecting our selves to Christ;</hi> that is, a taking him for our Lord and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59334:179"/>
Saviour by Consent: Which is a Consent to obey him for the future.</p>
            <p>§. 36. 16. Though this <hi>actual Obedience</hi> to Christ (besides <hi>Subjection</hi>) be not pre-requisite to our first being justified, it is requisite to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our Justification: For we consented to obey, that we might <hi>indeed obey,</hi> and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idious if we do not.</p>
            <p>§. 37. 17. The <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> will judge us much according to our Works.</p>
            <p>§. 38. 18. The same Law of Grace being the Rule of <hi>Duty</hi> and of <hi>Iudgment, God will judge all men according to their Works,</hi> required by that Law, by justifying or condemning them.</p>
            <p>§. 39. 19. Final justification and glorification are the Rewards of Evangelical Obedience; and the reason rendered of Christ's justifying Sentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. (<hi>&amp; passim</hi>) is from such acts of Man, as qualifying them for the free Gift of God.</p>
            <p>§. 40. 20. There is a <hi>moral goodness</hi> in these Works of Man, by which through Christ, they are <hi>pleasing to God,</hi> which is their aptitude to this acceptance and reward.</p>
            <p>In all this I think all sober Christians must needs confess that they agree.</p>
            <p>§. 41. III. And as to the Case of <hi>Merit,</hi> a few words with understanding men may dispatch it. We are agreed on the negative; 1. That no Man or Angel can <hi>merit</hi> of God in proper Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative Justice, giving him somewhat for his Benefits that shall profit him, or to which he had not absolute right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:59334:179"/>2. No man can merit any thing of God, upon the terms of the Law of Innocency, (but Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment)</p>
            <p>3. No man can merit any thing of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be supposed first to be a <hi>free Gift</hi> and <hi>merited by Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 42. And affirmatively we are (I think) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed; 1. That God governeth us by a Law of Grace, which hath a Promise or Premiant part, which giveth (not the <hi>antecedent,</hi> but many <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> benefits) by way of <hi>Reward:</hi> To deny the <hi>rewarding act,</hi> is to deny God's <hi>Law,</hi> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Government.</p>
            <p>§. 43. 2. That God calleth it <hi>his Iustice</hi> to reward men according to his Law, and give them what it gave them right to. Insomuch, that it is made the second Article of our Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. to believe that <hi>God is the rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently seek him.</hi> And he giveth it <hi>as a righteous Iudge,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>§. 44. 3. That this supposeth that such Works of Man have a <hi>moral Aptitude</hi> for that <hi>Reward;</hi> which consisteth in these things: 1. That they are <hi>efficiently</hi> from God's Spirit. 2. They are in their measure agreeable to God's governing Will. 3. They are done in Love, to his glory, and to please him. 4. They are done by a Member of Christ. 5. They are <hi>profitable to Men,</hi> our selves and others. 6. The Habits and Acts are God's <hi>own Image.</hi> 7. They have the Promise of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. 8. They are washed in the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> that is, <hi>Their faultiness is pardoned</hi> through his <hi>Merits.</hi> 9. They are presented to God by <hi>Christ's Intercession.</hi> 10. And lastly, they are Man's <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> for the Reward in their <hi>very nature;</hi> yea,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59334:180"/>
               <hi>part of it</hi> themselves as they are of God; <hi>Holiness</hi> being the <hi>beginning of Happiness,</hi> or of that <hi>love of God</hi> which in its <hi>Perfection</hi> is <hi>Heaven it self:</hi> Such an <hi>Aptitude,</hi> as that <hi>a holy person</hi> cannot be <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> nor can God hate and damn a holy Soul that truly <hi>loveth</hi> and <hi>obeyeth him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 45. 4. This <hi>moral Aptitude</hi> for the Reward is <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>pleasing to God;</hi> and therefore he calleth the Reward in the Gospel usually <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which properly signifieth <hi>Wages,</hi> which men give by <hi>Commutative Iustice:</hi> But that is only <hi>metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,</hi> because God that cannot be <hi>profited</hi> by man, is yet <hi>pleased</hi> in that which <hi>profiteth our selves</hi> and one another, and <hi>glorifieth him</hi> by declaring his Perfections: And as if this were <hi>profiting him,</hi> he calleth it <hi>Wages,</hi> for some similitude, but not in proper sence.</p>
            <p>§. 46. 5. This <hi>moral Aptitude,</hi> for the Reward is called oft in Scripture <hi>Worthiness,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is of the same signification with <hi>Merit:</hi> To be <hi>worthy</hi> and to <hi>deserve,</hi> are here all one: So that so far <hi>Merit</hi> (Worthiness) is a Scripture Phrase.</p>
            <p>§. 47. 6. This <hi>Worthiness</hi> or <hi>Merit</hi> is only in point of <hi>Paternal Governing-Iustice,</hi> according to the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> ordering that which in <hi>it self</hi> is a <hi>free Gift merited by Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 48. For no Man or Angel can have any thing of God, but by <hi>free Gift:</hi> What have we which we receive not, when our <hi>being</hi> is of God? Therefore it must be of <hi>governing ordering Iustice</hi> only: The <hi>thing</hi> is a <hi>Gift;</hi> but God will give this Gift to his Children so wisely as to the <hi>Order</hi> of it, as shall be fittest to attain his ends. Therefore it is not by Governing Justice after the Law of Innocency or Works, but according to the <hi>Law of</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:59334:180"/>
               <hi>Grace.</hi> So that the sum of the Solution is, That 1. the Good received in its <hi>value,</hi> as <hi>Good</hi> is of God as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> and a <hi>free Gift.</hi> 2. But in <hi>Order of Collation,</hi> it is of God as a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Governour,</hi> even a <hi>governing Father,</hi> and so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a Reward, and so it is <hi>merited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 49. This is easily understood by <hi>Parens,</hi> who intend to give their Children freely, out of meer love, their <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and what else they want: And yet they will give them Gold or Clothes or Food, in so wise a manner, as shall engage them to their Duty, and will say, <hi>Put off your Hat and thank me,</hi> or <hi>Do this or that</hi> (which is for their own good) <hi>and I will give you this.</hi> Here it is a <hi>Gift</hi> as to the <hi>Goodness,</hi> and a <hi>Reward</hi> as to the <hi>order of giving it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 50. 7. The ancient Christians (as the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of all the Ancients commonly shew) did use the word <hi>Merit</hi> without any scruple; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that any Christians did ever gainsay it or take the use of it for a fault: Yet did they contradict mens carnal erroneous Conceits of <hi>Man's Merit,</hi> as well as we: Yet now our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to <hi>Popery</hi> hath brought the word into so great distate with many good Protestants, as that they take it to signifie some dangerous self-arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Doctrine: So great is the power of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Contest.</p>
            <p>§. 51. It is true, That when Hereticks have put an ill sence upon a good word, we must use it more cantelously than at other times and places: But if thence we absolutely reject and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccuse it, we shall harden our Adversaries, and strengthen the Error which we oppose, by running into the contrary extream, which will soon disgrace it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:59334:181"/>§. 52. It is a great advantage to the Papists, that many Protestants wholly disclaim the <hi>word,</hi> and simply deny the <hi>Merit of Gospel-obedience:</hi> For hereupon the Teachers shew their Scholars, that all the <hi>Fathers speak for Merit,</hi> and so tell them, that the Protestants Doctrine is new and heretical, as being contrary to all the ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: And when their Scholars see it with their Eyes, no wonder if they believe it, to our disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>§. 53. All Orthodox Christians hold the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>described Doctrine of <hi>Merit</hi> in sence, though not in words: For they that deny <hi>Merit,</hi> confess the [<hi>Rewardableness</hi>] of our Obedience, and confess that the Scripture useth the term [<hi>Worthy</hi>] and that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be translated <hi>Meriting</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> as well as <hi>Worthy</hi> and <hi>Worthiness;</hi> and we think it fitter to <hi>expound</hi> such <hi>Scripture-words</hi> than to <hi>accuse and reject them:</hi> And they all confess, that <hi>man's Duty hath God's Promise of Reward,</hi> and that <hi>Holiness</hi> in its nature is suitable to the End or Reward, as disposing us to enjoy it, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto God and glorifieth him: And this is all the same thing in other words, which the ancient Christians meant by <hi>Merit.</hi> And to hear many godly persons at the same time, most earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol Holiness, and desire that Preachers should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the People that the <hi>Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour,</hi> and yet denying all <hi>Merit,</hi> and reviling all that assert it; this doth but shew, that they understand not the word; and think others also misunderstand it: And so we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching one another, where we are agreed and know it not: Like the Woman that turned away her Servant upon the Controversie, Whether the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59334:181"/>

            </p>
            <p>§. 54. And the partial Teachers are the Cause of all this, while instead of opening the Doctrine truly to the People, in what sence we have or have not any <hi>Worthiness</hi> or <hi>Merit,</hi> they without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cry down <hi>Merit,</hi> and reproach those that do otherwise: And if they do but say, [<hi>Such a Man</hi> or <hi>such a Book speaketh for Merit and Free-will</hi>] they have sufficiently rendered him odious or much suspected with their followers; when yet all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christians in all Ages have been for <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Free-will</hi> in a sound sence: And is not this to be Incendiaries and Adversaries to Truth, and Love, and Peace?</p>
            <p>§. 55. I have formerly thought, that though we agree in the thing, it is best omit the <hi>name,</hi> because the Papists have abused it: And I think so still, as in such Companies and Cases where the use of it not understood will scandalize men, and do more harm than good: (For why should I use words against mens edification?) But in other cases I now think it better to keep the word, 1. lest we seem to the ignorant to be of another Religion than all the ancient Churches were. 2. Lest we harden Papists, Greeks and others, by denying sound Doctrine in <hi>terms,</hi> which they will think we deny in <hi>sence.</hi> 3. Because our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enury of Words is such as for my part I remember no other word so fit to substitute instead of [<hi>Merit</hi>] or [<hi>Desert</hi>] or [<hi>Worthiness.</hi>] The word [<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable</hi>]
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59334:182"/>
is long and oft harsh: And what other have we? And it is nothing else that we mean.</p>
            <p>§. 56. Some Papists are against the very word [<hi>Merit</hi>] also. Some own the word, but differ not from the Protestants about the Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some of them ignorantly drive the poor People by ill preaching into carnal Conceits of their own Works, and to trust an hundred Fopperies for Salvation: But he that readeth most of their School-Doctors, must either confess, that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us about the <hi>meritoriousness</hi> of true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-obedience, rather in <hi>words</hi> than <hi>in deed;</hi> and that we really mean the same thing, or else he must see with <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worser</hi> Eyes than I do (I speak not this of them all.)</p>
            <p>§. 57. And <hi>Romaeus,</hi> who prateth of Merit in point of <hi>commutative Iustice,</hi> disclaimed by the rest (and some such other ignorant Scriblers) are not to be taken for the <hi>Index</hi> of their Doctrine, nor yet their superstitious, abusive Application; no more than our <hi>Deniers</hi> of <hi>all Merit</hi> are the <hi>Index</hi> of <hi>ours;</hi> nor the prophane ones abuse of it, who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when we perswade them to a holy Life, to tell us, That God saveth not Men for their Holiness or <hi>Works,</hi> and that <hi>ours deserve</hi> no more than theirs, but he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy; and it is not of him that <hi>willeth</hi> or <hi>runneth.</hi>

And as to the <hi>Sence,</hi> one Writer understands what he saith better, and another worse, and several men may have several Sences; but they mostly seem to mean, That <hi>holy Obedience is in the very nature of it so pleasing to the most holy God, as rendereth it apt to be the matter of that Condition on which his Covenant promiseth to reward us, the Imperfection being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and we and our Works accepted, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by the Merits of Christ, and upon his Intercession, and presenting them to God.</hi> And is this to be denied by any Christian? Doubtless there is something in the very Nature of <hi>Divine Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> which maketh it fitter to be accepted and rewarded, than Infidelity, Hatred of God, and Sin, or Rebellion. Speak Christians, is it not so? And yet it is from God's Promise and meer Bounty only, that our <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Reward</hi> result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, though the <hi>material Aptitude</hi> be in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to which that promise is made: All this is plain and sure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 60. Obj.</hi> But some talk of a Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Work and the Reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We commonly hold <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Holiness;</hi> and if any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busive Doctor mean any more, that's nothing to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59334:183"/>
the rest. And it's pity that Men that are agreed, should hate or revile each other as differing.</p>
            <p>§. 61. <hi>Vasquez</hi> the Jesuit is one that is supposed to say most for Merit, who saith so much against it, as I dare not say: For he tells us, That God doth not reward us at all as an Act of Justice, either <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative,</hi> or <hi>Distributive: Commutative Iustice</hi> he easily disapproveth, and in that we all agree: But the generality of Christians, Papists, Protestants, <hi>Greeks,</hi> &amp;c. hold, That God rewardeth us in <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning-paternal-distributive Iustice, as a Father giveth Benefits to a thankful Child that humbly taketh them, and not to the contemptuous or rebellious that spit in his Face.</hi> But <hi>Vasquez</hi> saith, That God hath not so much as <hi>Distributive</hi> Justice in our Rewards. And yet, I think, he differeth but in <hi>words,</hi> and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaneth as we all do. And he that dare for <hi>Words,</hi> revile Consenters, is bolder than I would have any good Man be: And yet I doubt not but <hi>I and this Writing</hi> shall be so reviled by many that differ not from me, when they think they do, (through Faction and Prejudice) when I am dead, even for these words.</p>
            <p>§. 62. IV. The fourth Point is so far dispatched in the second, that I need here but to say; 1. That our Obedience to God is a Duty resulting from our very natural Being, and cannot but be so while we are Men: 1. As it is God's due. 2. As it is part of the right Order of the Universe, and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to common Good. 3. As it is our own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Rectitude and Health.</p>
            <p>2. That Christ is the Saviour and Physician to give us this Health, which is the end of his medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:59334:183"/>3. That the Soul cannot be complacentially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable to God, nor fit for Communion with him here or in Heaven without it. Resignation to God our Owner, Obedience to God our Ruler, and Love and Praise to God our Father, and the infinite Good, make up that Holiness which is our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self, and the Image and Glory of God upon us.</p>
            <p>§. 63. V. About the next Question I may yet be shorter, <hi>How far any Works of ours may be trusted in?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think all agree, 1. That nothing of ours (or any Creature) should be trusted to for any thing <hi>proper to God,</hi> or <hi>proper to Christ,</hi> or any thing that belongeth not truly to it self. He that ascribeth any thing to our Faith, Love, or Obedience, which is proper to <hi>Christ's Merits,</hi> or <hi>God's Mercy,</hi> and so <hi>trusteth</hi> them, doth greatly sin, and he that trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them for <hi>more than</hi> God hath assigned to them to do.</p>
            <p>§. 64. 2. That we must take heed of <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Language,</hi> and therefore must not talk of <hi>trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on any act of our own, when it is like to be understood, as put in Competition with God or with Christ's Merits; as if the Question were, Whether we must <hi>trust God,</hi> or <hi>our selves, Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> or <hi>our own?</hi> For our <hi>own</hi> is not in the least measure to be <hi>trusted</hi> for that which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only to <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> to <hi>be,</hi> or <hi>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 65. 3. That yet it is a <hi>great Duty</hi> to trust <hi>every means</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> appointed by God, in its <hi>own place,</hi> and for its <hi>own part</hi> alone, even to <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sacraments, Afflictions,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly to <hi>trust</hi> our <hi>own Faith, Love, Prayer, Obedience,</hi> so far as they are <hi>Means,</hi> and have God's Promise,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59334:184"/>
and no further; which is no more than to <hi>trust in God,</hi> that he will bless such means. He that trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Sword, doth not trust it to fight of it self, without his Hand. When God hath promised Mercy upon <hi>Prayer,</hi> and to the <hi>Obedient</hi> or <hi>Penitent,</hi> for a man to think that God will yet do no more for us, if we <hi>repent, pray,</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> than if we do not, is to be <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> and say rebelliously, <hi>It is in vain to serve the Lord.</hi> He is so far to trust to <hi>Faith, Repentance, praying, hearing, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, diligence,</hi> as to trust that God will bless them, and reward them, and look for more from him when we use means, than when we do not.</p>

            <p>§. 1. I Shall reduce all that needs to be said on this point to these following controverted Questions: <q>1. <hi>Whether all</hi> Grace procured and given by Christ, <hi>be such</hi> as is never lost? 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that degree of Grace be ever lost, which giveth the <hi>posse credere</hi> without the act of Faith (commonly called sufficient Grace) in Adult or Infants? 3.

Whether any degree of this be ever lost? or all special Grace have such Confirmation as the Angels have? 6. Whether, if Holiness be never lost, it be <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> to lose it, and be in danger? 7. Whether
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59334:184"/>
there be a state of confirmed Persons besides the meerly sanctified, that from the degree or kind of their grace, never fall away? 8. Or whether Perseverance depend on meer Election and God's Will, which secureth only some of the justified? 9. Whether all, or most, or many Christians are themselves sure to persevere? 10. Whether Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of perseverance be fit for all the justified? 11. Whether it be unfit for all, and a more unsafe Condition than doubting? 12. Whether the Comfort of most Christians lie upon the Doctrine of such Certainty? 13. Whether the Doctrine of Eventual Apostacy infer any mutability in God? 14. Why God hath left this point so dark? 15. What was the Judgment of the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches after the Apostles? 16. Whether it be an Article of such evidence and weight, as to be put into our Church-Confessions, and we should force men to subscribe to it, or make it necessary to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, Communion, or Christian Love and Concord?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 2. Q. I.</hi> Whether all Christ's Grace given us, be such as is never lost?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No: except <hi>Iansenius</hi> and his Followers, I know of no Christians that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver affirm it; and he doth it on this false supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the <hi>common Grace</hi> which worketh only <hi>preparatorily</hi> by <hi>fear,</hi> is not the <hi>Grace of Christ,</hi> but a grace of <hi>other Providence,</hi> and only <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>grace of Christ.</hi> But it is injurious to Christ, who is the Lord, and Light, and Saviour of the World, and God's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator-general, into whose Hands all Things and Power is given, to say, That since the Fall <hi>there is any Grace in the World that is not his Grace;</hi> and that our preparatory grace, and all that's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59334:185"/>
is <hi>aliunde,</hi> some other way. He that readeth <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, and 10. may see the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 3. Q II.</hi> Whether sufficient grace to believe, which giveth the meer power of believing to Infants or Adult, be ever lost?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> These Questions sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that there are these several sorts of Graces disputed of by Divines: 1. <hi>Common grace:</hi> 2. <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to believe and repent:</hi> 3. <hi>Actual Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> given by that called <hi>special Vocation:</hi> 4. <hi>The Habit of love and all grace, called Sanctification:</hi> (to pass by <hi>Relative grace,</hi> as Justification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 5. <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of these Habits. And we now speak only of the second: And the very <hi>Being</hi> of that Grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, Whether God ever give (besides the <hi>natural Power</hi>) a <hi>moral Power to believe, to any that never do believe?</hi> And, 1. it is certain by <hi>Adam</hi>'s instance, that he gave him a power to have <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed,</hi> when he did not: 2. And therefore no man can prove, that now<note place="margin">Of this more before.</note> he giveth no man a <hi>moral Power</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> that doth not. 3. But it seemeth most probable that he doth, because his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Man's Nature</hi> are not, <hi>tota specie,</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 4. And it is certain that still all men have power <hi>to do more good than they do.</hi> 5. And even the <hi>Dominicans</hi> grant this <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of grace. 6. But yet for my part, I am <hi>not certain</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But if <hi>there be such</hi> a power given, which never acteth Faith (which I think most probable) it is either in the <hi>Adult</hi> or <hi>Infants:</hi> if in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult,</hi> no doubt it's lost; for they that <hi>will not believe</hi> (to the last) retain <hi>not still the moral power</hi> in their Rebellion.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That a common <hi>uneffectual Faith</hi> may be lost, is no doubt: But concerning the other, there are three Opinions. 1. Some say, No; it cannot be lost, because that Faith hath the Promise of the <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as well as of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>right to Life.</hi> Therefore seeing habitual Holiness is not lost, that which hath the <hi>Promise</hi> of it, is not lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:59334:186"/>2. Others say, That <hi>actual Faith</hi> at <hi>first</hi> is like <hi>Adam's loseable Grace;</hi> and that it giveth us actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pardon and right to Life, if we <hi>so die,</hi> and right to the <hi>Spirit</hi> (in relation) to sanctifie us in time, and by degrees: But that every one that hath the Spirit, hath not the <hi>Habits</hi> of Love and Holiness, but he sometimes is causing many Acts before he produce a Habit (<hi>ad modum acquisitorum.</hi>)</p>
            <p>3. Others say, That both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>habitual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> are oft lost. I delay the solution till the rest be considered.</p>

               <hi>§. 9. Q. IV.</hi> Whether habitual Love, <hi>or</hi> Holiness <hi>(or the Spirit)</hi> be ever lost?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That there is a <hi>confirmed state</hi> or <hi>degree of Holiness</hi> that is <hi>never lost,</hi> I do hold; and that this is <hi>attainable,</hi> and in that state men may be <hi>certain of Salvation:</hi> But whether the <hi>least degrees</hi> of <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual grace</hi> be utterly loseable, which prove a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent right to life, till they are lost, I must plainly profess I do not know; much may be said on both sides: And if my Ignorance offend any, it offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me more: but how shall I help it, I think it is not for want of <hi>study,</hi> nor of impartial willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to know the Truth: And Ignorance of the two is safer than <hi>Error,</hi> by which we trouble and seduce those about us. And in this case so many great and excellent Men have <hi>erred</hi> (either <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> with the generality of the ancient Churches, or <hi>Calvin, Zanchy,</hi> and most of the Reformed) that my <hi>Ignorance</hi> is <hi>pardonable</hi> where their <hi>Error it self</hi> is <hi>pardoned.</hi> But let those that are wiser rejoyce in the greater measure of their Wisdom: But yet think not, that taking up either Opinion upon the trust of their Party, is such.</p>

            <p>§. 10. Q. V. To the next, some have said, That had <hi>Adam</hi> done but one act of Love or Obedience, he had been <hi>confirmed</hi> as the Angels in a state of Impeccability: And that so are all that once truly believe in Christ. But Experience ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly confuteth that: For all men sin after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
            <p>§. 11. Others say only, That men may sin, and may lose <hi>acquired Grace,</hi> but no <hi>degree</hi> of that which is <hi>infused:</hi> But we have small reason to think that our <hi>encreased degrees</hi> are not <hi>as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi> as the <hi>first degree</hi> was: And yet Experience proveth, that such added degrees may be lost.</p>
            <p>§. 12. Others say, <hi>All added degrees</hi> may be <hi>lost,</hi> but none of that which was <hi>first infused:</hi> Indeed could we prove, that God alwaies at first infuseth only the least degree consistent with Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then this must be held by all that deny that any fall from Justification: But for ought we know God may the first minute give one man more Grace than to another in long time, and that <hi>first degree</hi> may be lessened by his sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 13. Q. VI.</hi> Whether it be possible to lose that Holiness which never will be lost?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The word [<hi>Possible</hi>] respecteth either a Consequence in Arguing, and is a <hi>Logical Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> or it respecteth the <hi>natural power</hi> of <hi>Causes,</hi> and is called, <hi>Physical Possibility.</hi> In the first sence it is <hi>impossible</hi> that any thing should come to pass that doth not; because God <hi>knoweth it will not:</hi> And it is a good consequence, <hi>God knoweth that this will not come to pass; therefore it will not:</hi> And it is <hi>impossible</hi> that this Consequence should be false.</p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>natural Possibility,</hi> no doubt but

               <hi>Power,</hi> but of <hi>Impotency,</hi> or from a defect of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:</hi> And the <hi>Habit given</hi> us is not a sufficient Power to ascertain <hi>our Perseverance of it self.</hi> But if you speak with respect to the <hi>Power of God,</hi> by which we are preserved, we must thus answer: That it is <hi>impossible</hi> for us or any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>overcome</hi> God's Power or Will: And if it be first proved, that God will cause us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe by the way of <hi>Physical irresistible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Power,</hi> then it must be called <hi>Impossible</hi> to fall away, or commit any Sin which he so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us from. But if he keep any as a <hi>free Agent</hi> by the <hi>sapiential disposal</hi> of his <hi>Free-will,</hi> and so procure the <hi>event</hi> of a contingent action, then it must be said, that this and many things are <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> which never come to pass, That God only decreeth, that <hi>we shall not fall away,</hi> and not, that <hi>it shall be impossible:</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans themselves use to speak: But for my part I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake God's manner of working on and for us, to be so <hi>unsearchable,</hi> and this notion of <hi>Possibility</hi> or <hi>Impossibility,</hi> of so little moment when we are agreed <hi>what will be the event,</hi> that I think the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverfie not worth the handling, but made among other snares of Satan, to trouble the Church, and draw us to vain Janglings about words that edifie not, from the Simplicity that is in Christ.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Undoubtedly there are some Christians that are <hi>strong, rooted, settled, established;</hi> and some that are weak, and like Children toss'd up and down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 14. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>

            <p>§. 15. 2. It is agreeable to Scripture, Reason and Experience to judge, that <hi>strengthened Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> stand faster than the <hi>weak,</hi> and that it is in it self more <hi>unlikely</hi> that they should be seduced and forsake Christ.</p>
            <p>§. 16. Seeing it is so doubtful, whether <hi>any</hi> that are sincere fall away; we have great reason to think that it will hardlier be proved of the <hi>Confirmed:</hi> I know that <hi>Strength</hi> hath several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and it's hard to determine just what this <hi>Confirmation</hi> is, but I am perswaded, that <hi>abundance of confirmed Christians</hi> there are, who have taken hold of Christ by Faith and Love, and have clear <hi>light</hi> and great <hi>experience,</hi> and so much Grace, as that from that <hi>Confirmation</hi> it may be inferred, that they never fall away and perish: and consequently that <hi>Certainty of Salvation,</hi> and not only of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Justification, is attainable in this Life. And some of the Papists themselves are of this mind, though others of them say, That even a state of <hi>Confirmation</hi> may be lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 17. Q. VIII.</hi> Whether Perseverance depend on meer Election?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It was <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Judgment (and his Followers) That <hi>Election</hi> is the ascertaining Cause of Perseverance, giving the special <hi>Grace of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;</hi> but what that Grace was besides Divine <hi>Volition</hi> and <hi>Preservation</hi> (whether any special <hi>confirming degree</hi> or <hi>kind</hi>) it is not easie to gather out of him: And I think it past doubt, That God
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59334:188"/>
doth <hi>elect some to Perseverance,</hi> and all <hi>persevere whom he so electeth,</hi> and <hi>because he electeth them</hi> and <hi>no other:</hi> But whether many also are truly <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> and <hi>justified</hi> that are <hi>not elect,</hi> and so <hi>do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> held, I said before, I do not know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 18. Q. IX.</hi> Are all or most Christians certain that they shall persevere?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No: For, 1. <hi>most</hi> Christians in the World hold, that Perseverance is uncertain to the godly; and how can they be certain of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
            <p>2. Most that hold otherwise, hold it but as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,</hi> and are not themselves certain that it is true, though they call it <hi>certain:</hi> I am uncertain: And I find not by other signs that the most have more knowledge than my self: And he that is not certain of the <hi>Premises,</hi> is not <hi>by them</hi> certain of the Conclusion.</p>
            <p>3. Most Christians are uncertain that they are <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>justified:</hi> And such cannot be certain to persevere in that which they are not certain that they have.</p>
            <p>§. 19. Q. X. Certainty of their <hi>present state of Iustification</hi> is not fit for those that <hi>sin as much,</hi> and <hi>are as bad</hi> as ever will stand with sincerity (till they repent:) Therefore <hi>certainty of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> must needs be unfit for them. And therefore God never giveth it to such.</p>
            <p>§. 20. Q. XI. <hi>Certainty of Grace, Iustification</hi> and <hi>Perseverance</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> is a most excellent desirable thing, above all the Treasures of the World, and to be earnestly sought by all: and tendeth not of it self to <hi>carnal security,</hi> but to fill the Soul with holy Love and Thankfulness and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59334:189"/>
Joy, and make our Lives likest to Heaven on Earth: O blessed are they that do attain it: And woe to them that dispraise it and perswade men to causeless doubting. It is the height of our attainment here in it self, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and maketh us live a Heavenly Life, and long to be with Christ: But we cannot therefore say that those have it that have it not: But all should promote and seek it.</p>
            <p>§. 21. Q. XII. They that are certain that all <hi>true Believers persevere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> have one great help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own Consolation: But if they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, that they <hi>themselves are true Believers,</hi> this will not comfort them. As they that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded only that all Confirmed Christians perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, must know that <hi>they</hi> are confirmed before this can give them the comfort of Assurance.</p>
            <p>§. 22. But I have elsewhere fully proved, 1. That most Christians have not the comfort of their own certain Perseverance, for want of the Certainty of their Sincerity, if not of the Doctrine it self. 2. And that thousands and millions of Christians live and die in Peace and Comfort, that have not a <hi>proper Certainty of Salvation.</hi> 3. Much more may such live in Joy that are sure of their <hi>present state</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> though not of their <hi>Perseverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 23. For Experience telleth us, that though most of the Christian World are against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Certain Perseverance of all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yet many of them live and die in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>§. 24. And Church-History and the Ancients Writings tell us, That though for many hundred years the Christian Doctors commonly held, That
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59334:189"/>
some lose true justifying Faith, and perish, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es.</p>
            <p>§. 25. And we see in all things that men are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected according to what is <hi>predominant;</hi> and he that hath far more <hi>Hope</hi> than <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>doubting,</hi> will have more <hi>joy</hi> than <hi>sorrow,</hi> though he be not <hi>certain,</hi> but some doubting do remain.</p>
            <p>§. 26. It is <hi>certain in it self,</hi> that God's Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the Gospel are all true: But every one that truly believeth it, is not properly <hi>certain</hi> of it, past all doubt: And he that hath the least doubt of the truth of the Gospel, must needs doubt as much of that Salvation which is expected on the Gospel-Promise: And yet such Believers may have Peace and Joy according to the measure of their Faith and Hope.</p>
            <p>§. 27. We see among men no Wife is certain one day or night that her Husband will not forsake or murder her; no Child is certain that his Father will not kill him; nor any one of his dearest Friend: And yet we can have Love, Peace and Comfort in our Relations, without such <hi>certainty:</hi> For it's melancholy folly to live in fears of things utterly <hi>unlikely,</hi> and to cast away the Comforts of great <hi>probability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 28. Yea, no godly man is <hi>certain</hi> that he shall not fall into such <hi>hainous Sin</hi> as <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Peter</hi> did; or that he shall not kill his dearest Friend, or himself: And yet when a man is conscious that his Nature, his Reason, his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and his Resolution, do all make him hate such a wicked act, and that there is no probable cause to move him to it, and when we know God is ready with his Grace to help us, how few lose
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59334:190"/>
the Comfort of their Lives, by fear of such impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable things? Certainty therefore is very <hi>desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but a <hi>hope of great probability</hi> may give us <hi>joyful thankful Hearts,</hi> or else few Christians would have such.</p>
            <p>§. 29. And the Doctrine of <hi>Perseverance</hi> hath its difficulties too as to mens comfort: For he that holdeth, That no man falleth from a state of Grace, and seeth many, that to all possible humane judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were once excellent persons, fall quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, can himself have no assurance that he is so much as justified at the present, unless he be sure that he is better than the best of all those persons ever were, which doubt the other side are not cast upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 30. Q. XIII.</hi> Whether the Doctrine of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy infer any mutability in God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No: there's no shew of it, unless you hold, that his absolutely <hi>Elect fall away.</hi> It was no change in God when he gave us grace, and justified us; and it would be no more if he <hi>cease,</hi> than it was to <hi>begin.</hi> It was no change in God when I was born, and it will be no more when I die: The Change is only in <hi>Man,</hi> and his <hi>receptive Disposition.</hi> Even the Law of the Land, without any Diversity or Change, doth virtually condemn a thousand Malefactors, and justifie the Just; and will cease to justifie them, and begin to condemn them, if they cease to be just, and begin to be Offenders. The Changes that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self maketh in all the World, are made without any Change in him: Therefore what man doth, or undoth, cannot change him.</p>

               <hi>§. 31. Q. XIV.</hi> Why did God ledve this Case so dark?</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not fit for us to call for any reason
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59334:190"/>
of his doing, but what he hath given us: But while he hath made it sure to us, that he will cause all his Elect to persevere, and will deny his Grace to none that faithfully seek it, and will save all that do not wilfully and finally reject it, and giveth us no cause to distrust his Mercy, his holy Ends are by this attained in his Peoples Uprightness and Peace: And he seemeth by leaving the rest so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, to tell us, that it is not a matter of so great use to us, as some imagine, and that it is not a point fit for to be the measure of our Communion or Peace.</p>

               <hi>Ans. Vossius</hi> in his <hi>Pelagian</hi> History, hath truly told you, and copiously proved it in the main. Before <hi>Augustine</hi>'s time it was taken commonly as granted, That men might fall away from a state of Grace, and that many did; but the Case was not curiously discussed: But some thought that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Christians never fell: But upon <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Disputes, <hi>Augustine</hi> defending the honour of Grace, laid all upon Election, and maintained, That though the Non-elect did fall away from the <hi>Love</hi> of God and Justification, and a state in which they had been saved, had they died; yet none of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect did fall so as to perish, but that the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Grace in perseverance, was the fruit of Election. Thus <hi>Prosper,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> after him; and some Passages in him and <hi>Macarius,</hi> and some others, intimate that they thought there was a <hi>confirmed</hi> degree of Grace, which was never lost; but they all took it for granted, that <hi>some fell</hi> from a <hi>state of Iustification</hi> and perished: And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

to be of the contrary mind for a thousand years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the writing of the Scriptures, nor any mention of any Christian that was so; unless <hi>Hierome</hi> be to be believed of <hi>Ievinian,</hi> who saith, that he held, That the <hi>godly could not sin;</hi> which Report is much to be suspected on many accounts.</p>
            <p>§. 33. What Use is to be made of this, I leave to others; but it beseemeth no good Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave or deny the Truth of such History: And some great Divines are to be blamed for reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Vossius</hi> for a true Historical Report, when they neither can confute him, nor attempt it. Two or three Sentences out of <hi>Austin</hi> are cited by some, but meerly mistaken, as if they spake that of all the Justified, which he speaketh only of the Elect.</p>
            <p>§. 34. Q. XVI. By all that is said, it is past de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, that Certainty of perseverance should be most earnestly sought, and that state of Confirmation which is likest to obtain it; but that few have it, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of Repentance; late Repentance; the time of Grace, and of the unpardonable Sin.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>REpentance,</hi> as a <hi>Pain,</hi> and <hi>involuntary,</hi> is part of the Punishment of sin by the Law of Works; but <hi>Repentance</hi> as a <hi>returning to God,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:59334:191"/>
and a <hi>recovery</hi> of the Soul, is a <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> proper to the Subjects of the Redeemer under the Law of Grace.</p>
            <p>§. 2. Yea, it is a great and excellent part of the Law of Grace to give Repentance unto life, and to admit of Repentance after sin, which the Law of Innocency did not admit of.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> and Christ himself did preach the Gospel or Law of Grace, when they preached Repentance; which was a great part, even of Christ's own preaching.</p>
            <p>§. 4. Therefore the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Libertines know not what they talk of, when they call it Legal Preaching, and set Repentance as in opposition to Faith, as if Faith were all that the Gospel did command, or Repentance did not belong to Faith.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Yet it must be confessed, that of late times many have laid more upon the sorrowing, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fearing part of Repentance, than was meet, and said too little of the turning of the Soul from worldly and fleshly sinful Pleasures, to the delightful Love and Praises of God, and willing Obedience and Conformity to his Will, which is the principal part of true Repentance. And, I think God permitted the <hi>Antinomians</hi> to rise up, and cry up <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> and call the Ministers <hi>Legallists,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke our Error in this point, and to call us to preach up his Grace more plentifully, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider better that Gospel-obedience doth chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in <hi>Thankfulness, Love</hi> and <hi>Ioy,</hi> and in the <hi>words of Praise,</hi> and <hi>Works of Love.</hi> I am sure this use we should make of their Abuses.</p>
            <p>§. 6. <hi>Repentance</hi> is either <hi>general,</hi> or <hi>particular;</hi> General (or Universal) <hi>Repentance is a turning of</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:59334:192"/>
               <hi>the Understanding, Will, and Practice</hi> (with repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sorrow) <hi>from the inordinate Estimation, Love, and seeking of temporal Things for the Pleasure and Prosperity of the Flesh</hi> (or <hi>sensual powers</hi>) <hi>to God, his Will, and Service, and the Hopes of everlasting glory, through Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 7. This <hi>Repentance</hi> is the same thing with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> and as I said before, <hi>Faith it self includeth Repentance</hi> in its Essence, as denominated from the <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> it being a Turning from <hi>Unbelief</hi> to God by <hi>believing</hi> in him <hi>as God,</hi> and to Christ by believing in him, as our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and to the Holy Ghost by believing in him, as the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Witness</hi> of Christ and our Sanctifier.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>Particular Repentance</hi> is <hi>our turning with Sorrow from a particular Sin, to our contrary obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. Without that universal Repentance or Conversion, which turneth the Mind, Will, and Life to God, from created Vanity and this World, no Man can be saved; because he continueth an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater and Rebel, and doth not indeed take God for his God, nor Christ for his Saviour, nor the Holy Spirit for his Sanctifier; but is an ungodly Man, and a Forsaker of God and his own Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>§. 10. <hi>Repentance,</hi> as <hi>towards</hi> God, is sometime distinguished from <hi>Faith in Christ:</hi> And then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is our <hi>turning</hi> to God, as <hi>God,</hi> by Faith (Trust) Love, and Obedience, resigning our selves to him as our <hi>Owner, subjecting</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> to him as our <hi>Ruler,</hi> and loving him as <hi>our Benefactor,</hi> and chiefly as the <hi>Infinite Good in himself,</hi> our <hi>ultimate objective End.</hi> And this is the greater Duty respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting God, <hi>as our End,</hi> even the same with <hi>Love</hi> to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59334:192"/>
God, for the procuring of which <hi>Christ</hi> came into the World, and <hi>Faith</hi> is given us: And then <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> is the <hi>mediate</hi> grace and duty by which we are brought to this Repentance.</p>
            <p>§. 11. Not that any man can truly take <hi>Christ</hi> for his <hi>Saviour,</hi> before he taketh <hi>God for his God,</hi> (for the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>End,</hi> is before our <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Use</hi> of the <hi>Means:</hi>) But Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Teacher first</hi> bringeth us to <hi>assent</hi> to the Truth of <hi>God's Perfections</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> to us, and then to the Truth of his own <hi>Gospel,</hi> and by this <hi>Assent</hi> bringeth us (first to a <hi>common,</hi> and then) to a <hi>special Consent at once,</hi> that <hi>God be our God, and Christ our Saviour;</hi> but so that we <hi>desire God</hi> as <hi>our End,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> as the <hi>Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 12. <hi>Universal Repentance</hi> (or <hi>Conversion</hi>) doth <hi>virtually</hi> contain all <hi>particular future Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but not <hi>actually.</hi> Therefore where this is, that Soul may be saved without <hi>actual Repentance</hi> for <hi>some particular sins</hi> (or sorts of sin): As, <hi>e. g.</hi> if we are ignorant that such or such a thing is sin, for want of necessary Instruction, or if in a crowd of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness some sinful Thought, Passion, or Word pass unobserved, or if we do our faithful endeavour to find out a sin, and cannot, remember it (as who can remember at Conversion one of many that he has committed in Unregeneracy, and after many are forgotten:) And every Man dieth in some sin, which he hath no <hi>time</hi> here to repent of; <hi>viz.</hi> in some sinful imperfection of all grace and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and omission of due degrees of Love, and other Acts: For all which <hi>virtual repentance</hi> will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>§. 13. But <hi>great</hi> and <hi>heinous sins</hi> must needs have <hi>actual repentance,</hi> because it will not consist with the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59334:193"/>
Truth of Holiness to be so indifferent or eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as not to observe them, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them: And if they be <hi>known</hi> and <hi>remembred,</hi> they <hi>will be</hi> repented of, when the Soul hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to consider what it hath done. For <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual repentance</hi> is necessary to Salvation; and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits will act</hi> when they are not extraordinarily hindred, having notable Objects and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Yet some sins that are <hi>great materially</hi> in their nature, may be lessened much to some persons by unavoidable ignorance, and so may not have an actual <hi>repentance:</hi> As, <hi>e. g.</hi> in times of <hi>War,</hi> to <hi>kill men</hi> in <hi>a wrong Cause,</hi> is one of the greatest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ins in the World; and yet when by the darkness of <hi>State-cases,</hi> the Question <hi>who is in the right,</hi> is so difficult, that very few can decide it; and after their utmost search, each Party thinks that God bindeth them to fight for their <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> such persons cannot have a <hi>particular repentance,</hi> while they are not able to see that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>§. 15. It is therefore a Case of exceeding diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, <hi>what sins may stand with Iustification, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly repented of,</hi> and what <hi>not;</hi> or as some speak, which are <hi>mortal,</hi> and which <hi>venial sins,</hi> or sins of <hi>Infirmity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. But he that hath a care of his Salvation, must hate all sin in the general as sin, and keep up his watch, and be willing to know all the worst in himself, and diligently use the means to know it, and resolve to forsake it to his power, when he knoweth it, that so he may not be <hi>wilfully impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> And he that will sin as far as he thinks will
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59334:193"/>
stand with grace, either hath no true grace, or shall not know that he hath it.</p>
            <p>§. 17. The <hi>time of repentance</hi> or mercy, may be said in two Sences to be past; 1. When a man shall not be accepted and pardoned, though he should repent: And so the Day of grace is never past in this Life (and the Damned do not truly repent in our present Sence;) so that for a penitent person to fear that the Day of grace is past, or his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance too late (if true) is to contradict the Scope of the Gospel, which giveth pardon to every one that truly repenteth. 2. When a man that <hi>before</hi> had some <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> to repent, and obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resisted them, shall be given up to his Obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and never have such <hi>motions</hi> more. Thus the Day of grace may be past with many: And such persons turn from God to Wickedness, and are hardened in the love of sin, and usually blinded to defend it, and hate a holy Life: But those that do repent, or fain would repent, or yet feel God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to repent, have no cause to think that God hath thus forsaken them. For it is only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate and continued forsaking God, that is the sign of one forsaken by him.</p>
            <p>§. 18. And this also is no proof to us, that such a Person is <hi>finally forsaken.</hi> For many that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected grace many years, are afterward converted by that grace: So that all that we can say, is, That such as God hath forsaken, do continue to the end to reject his Mercy, and prefer their Lusts; but that he will so continue to the end, no man himself can tell before the end.</p>
            <p>§. 19. About the <hi>unpardonable sin</hi> there are two Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:59334:194"/>That <hi>final impenitency</hi> is unpardonable, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted: But the sin in question is called, <hi>The Blasphemy against the</hi>

            <p>§. 20. But, 2. the Papists and many Ancients say, That by [<hi>not forgiven</hi>] is meant only [<hi>very hardly and rarely;</hi>] but most Protestants expound the words absolutely, as they run; which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will think most probable, I leave to his consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>§. 21. Some think that the <hi>Novatians</hi> denied all pardon to such as committed any great sin after Baptism; but <hi>Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
