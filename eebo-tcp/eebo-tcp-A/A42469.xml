            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The main difference between thoſe two <hi>Twins,</hi> as he terms them, is not concerning the <hi>Subject</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> ſimply conſidered, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Extent</hi> of it, and matter of <hi>Appeal</hi>; the one ſide including the entire and abſolute <hi>power</hi> of a <hi>Presbyterie</hi> ſo compoſed, within the liſts and limits of <hi>a particular Congregation,</hi> without admittance of <hi>Appeal</hi> unto any other <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> in caſe of <hi>pretended grievance or male adminiſtration</hi>; in regard whereof alſo themſelvs term it an <hi>Independent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; the other allowing in ſuch and the like caſes <hi>Appeals</hi> to a <hi>Claſſis,</hi> or <hi>Convent</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> of

either kind abovementioned, ſelected out of the <hi>Particular Congregations</hi> to that purpoſe combined: and the <hi>Title</hi> of the Presbyterians doth therefore as fitly, and as fully <hi>competere,</hi> that is, <hi>agree</hi> (if it do not rather <hi>propendere,</hi> that is, <hi>weigh down,</hi> this latter way) unto the one as to the other.

            <p>But whatſoever the difference otherwiſe may be between theſe <hi>two Twins,</hi> ſure it is, that they do both unanimouſly concur and accord in oppoſition to Mr. L. and his Complices, and in diſcovery and deteſtation of their diabolical practiſes.

            <p>But leaving his ſpite in particular at John Calvin, lets rake a little further into the dirt and mire of his malignant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, in his rambling excurſions, and ramping incurſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor <hi>Presbyters,</hi> whome he ranked even now among the great <hi>Potentates</hi> of this world, which <hi>Joves</hi> office is to protect. <hi>The Scottiſh Nation,</hi> ſaith he; (that is, the <hi>ſillie Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Presbyterie,</hi> or, <hi>the Presbyterians and their Proſelytes,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Scottiſh Nation,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>began firſt the late War,</hi> and that <hi>onely upon pretence of a Semipopiſh Common-Prayer Book impoſed upon them.</hi> Concerning which buſienes, being neither <hi>Stateſman,</hi> nor deſirous to deal in <hi>State-affairs,</hi> I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but referre my Reader, if he deſire to be acqainted therewith, unto the writings of thoſe, who ſeem to have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and accurately related the original, progres and iſſu of the affairs concerning that war with Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which who ſo iſt to read, may find at large recorded in the <hi>Hiſtory of the

late affaires in</hi> Scotland, ſet forth under the name of <hi>Irenaeus Philalethes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Original of the War here with us, by whome was it on the defenſive part begun? was it by the <hi>Miniſterie,</hi> or the <hi>Magiſtracie</hi>? by the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchie,</hi> or by the <hi>Civil Autoritie</hi>? was it not by the joynt <hi>Vote</hi> and concurrence of both <hi>Houſes of Parlament</hi>? or was it by them undertaken (as this vain pratler ſpeaks) upon the <hi>prating and pretended Gloſſes of thoſe we cal Miniſters</hi>? See what aſperſions this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſticks not to caſt upon the whole body of the <hi>State,</hi> ſo that ſome of his gall and venome may withal light upon the Miniſterie; as if in this late War, wherein ſo large an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of bloud hath ben ſpilt, they had taken up arms, upon the meer motion onely of the <hi>Miniſterie</hi> by ſome <hi>prating and pretending Gloſſes</hi> inciting them thereunto. It is tru indeed, that an <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> was called to meet: but to what end? to debate of military matters? nothing les. but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> affairs, and the ſettling of matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Doctrine and Diſcipline according to the rule of Gods Word.</hi> Its tru likewiſe, that while the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> ſat, the War being now not begun onely, but purſued with much heat, and grown on either ſide to a great height, ſome of the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> were with ſome other <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> ſent into Scotland, to treat with the <hi>Scots,</hi> about conjoyning with our <hi>State,</hi> and entring into a joynt <hi>League</hi> for mutual defence with us: nor were they of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> partie alone (as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly termed) that were employed in that buſienes. But that <hi>the Parlament took up arms,</hi> and <hi>embroiled themſelvs in ſuch a bloudy war, upon the motion of the Miniſterie, by their prating and pretending gloſſes encited thereunto,</hi> as this hath prooved, it is a notorious calumnie in regard of the <hi>Miniſterie,</hi> and a foul imputation laid upon the <hi>State,</hi> as having raiſed a War of that importance on ſo weak and unwarrantable a ground, and a charging of the guilt of ſo much blood, as hath in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine and unnatural War ben ſhed, upon both.</p>
            <p>Yea but what was it, that mooved thoſe <hi>prating Miniſters</hi> to ſtir up the <hi>State</hi> to embroil it ſelf in ſuch a War? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, ſaith this babling makebate, <hi>that they might Lord it and domineer like pettie Tyrants over the Commonalty and Gentry</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54907:15"/>
why did he not adde <hi>over the Nobility</hi> too? Its indeed not untru, that under the <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> ſome of their favourits ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and backed by ſome great ones among them ſo did as is here ſaid. Yea they had begun by vertu of the <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court</hi> and the power thereunto annexed, to be tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with ſome of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> that complied not in all things with them. But what hope or likelihood was there, or could there be, for the <hi>Miniſterie</hi> ſo to domineer as this man tels you, that they intended to do, when that power and autoritie was taken away, by means whereof much abuſed ſome had formerly ſo done?</p>
            <p>As for his moſt uncharitable and Satanical cenſure of Gods <hi>Miniſters</hi> in general, that <hi>they care not for the good of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but themſelvs,</hi> it may well claim a place among the hideous croakings of thoſe filthy <hi>frogs,</hi> that <hi>iſſued out of the mouth of the Dragon and the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 16.13. the Divel himſelf could hardly have vented or invented a fouler or falſer ſlander againſt them.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that divers both with us and abroad, have not ſpared to tax the <hi>Presbyterian Government,</hi> as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending its du bounds, and encroaching upon the <hi>Civil Power</hi>; as appeers by the writings of the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> partie, whome the <hi>Arminians</hi> alſo in part ſeem to ſide with againſt the <hi>Contra Remonſtrants,</hi> or <hi>Netherland Presbyterians.</hi> But that they ar juſtly ſo charged, will not eaſily be made good, ſo long as they keep within compas of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures,</hi> which with good warrant from <hi>Gods Word,</hi> were in thoſe times alſo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, wherein no <hi>Civil Power</hi> embraced the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion.</hi> Whereunto may be added, that when ſome not long ſince among us, thinking thereby to ingratiate themſelvs with the <hi>State,</hi> had broached ſome things bending and tending to the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> way, its wel known, that they were as eagerly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Independent</hi> partie, as by any of thoſe that go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> But this mans main end, his malice being eqally againſt either, is, as plainly appeers, to diſgrace the whole body of the <hi>Miniſterie,</hi> and to bring them, as much as in him lies, into hatred with the people, as regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing at all of their ſpiritual good, but ayming onely at their own pride and profit, to make a gain of them, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54907:16"/>
to tyrannize over them at their pleaſure. But let him take heed, leſt by withſtanding Gods faithful <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as <hi>Jannes and Jambres</hi> did Moſes, 2 Tim. 3.8. and by oppoſing himſelf againſt them in this baſe ſcoffing manner, as <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer did to Pauls preaching, Act. 13.8. he procure to himſelf from God that heavy doom that Paul paſſed then upon <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and that diſmal judgment, or the like, if not a wors and more dreadful, that was thereupon preſently inflicted on him, Verſ. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>But let us hear yet a litle more, tho it reqire ſome patience, of his raving and ranting rhetorik, that either he muſt be ever and anon venting, or els he ſhal burſt with it, his heart and ſtomak is ſo ful and over-fraught with gall and rancor againſt this ſo extreamly hated <hi>Miniſterie.</hi> Having done with the <hi>Moon,</hi> he comes to <hi>the great Eclips of the Sun,</hi> and here again he goes on to foretel, what without need of ſpectacles or proſpective he ſaw ful before his face already.<note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54907:16"/>
Civilians, Clergie men and Divines.</hi> And yet afterward, where he is pleaſed <hi>further to expatiate his mind</hi> (for I give you his own terms: and where, think we, did ever any man read ſuch either Engliſh or Latine before?) <hi>concerning the greatnes of the Effects of this great Eclips,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it is in the laſt degree of the Decanate of Aries, which ſecond Decanate, is Nobilitatis, Altitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis, Regni, &amp; magni Dominii imago, the image of Nobility, Greatneſſe, Dominion, extraordinary Rule</hi>; (for <hi>Kingdome,</hi> or <hi>Reign,</hi> he had no mind to expres) <hi>the ſhape and form whereof the Ancients</hi> (ſome old Wizards he means) <hi>repreſented under the enſuing Image</hi>

            <p>But one thing further is here worthy our Obſervation.

            <p>Yea but thoſe <hi>ſtupid Annotations,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Good Sir, be pleaſed, I beſeech you, to tel us, who told you all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, I beleiv, you never read any great part of the whole <hi>Commentarie</hi>; it may be ſcarce had the patience to run over the whole <hi>Annotation</hi> to an end: for you complain els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where of the length of it; and ſay as litle to that concerns you in it, as if you had never read word of it. Beſides, be it that you had turned over the whole <hi>Commentarie</hi> from the firſt <hi>Note</hi> to the laſt; yet I ſuppoſe, you wil hardly make many, if any at all, beleiv, that you ar ſo wel acqainted with <hi>all Antiqitie,</hi> or ſo wel verſed and skilled in the <hi>Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and genuine ſenſe of the Text,</hi> as to pas out of your own knowledge ſuch a cenſure as this upon any mans work. and he were indeed a very ſelie man, and wel worthy of much pity, that would deem your cenſures of much worth or weight in a buſines of this nature. As for the <hi>Annotater</hi> and his work ſuch as it is: albeit he doubts not, but that many wants and weakneſſes, defects and defaults may by a qick and peircing ey be deſcried in it,<note place="margin">Sophocles. Vid. Cic. <hi>de Sen.</hi> Plut. <hi>de ſen. Polit.</hi> Ariſtoph. <hi>Schol.

And this yet I ſhal make bold to adjoin, that they have ſo far forth attained approbation both at home and abroad, that the <hi>Annotater</hi> hath ben importuned, both by divers of his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend brethren here, and ſome alſo from forain parts, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the like pains on ſome other parts of Scripture: unto whome his anſwer hath ben, that neither his age or ability wil bear it, nor is it ſo needful for him to undertake ought further therein, ſince that ſome of the other parts have ben more exqiſitely, tho with les prolixity, delt in by others (it being not every ones facultie, not his he is ſure, to write ſuccinctlie, and compriſe much matter in few words) by whom ſuch an employment, having fewer yeers and larger abilities
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54907:19"/>
may much better be performed. But, Sir, whatſoever the <hi>Annotater</hi> may have done els-where, ſure he is, that what he hath <hi>on Jerem.</hi> 10.2. concerning the <hi>vanitie and impietie</hi> of your trade, is neither <hi>contrary to the current of Antiqitie,</hi> nor <hi>to reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>to the genuine ſenſe of the words of the Text</hi>; but conſonant to <hi>the doctrine of the Ancient Fathers,</hi> the <hi>ſounder and greater number of lerned writers,</hi> both of former times and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes, as wel <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the ſetled <hi>diſcipline in the Chriſtian Churches,</hi> the <hi>Decrees and Sanctions of Chriſtian Emperors,</hi> and the <hi>Canons and Conſtitutions of</hi> whole <hi>Councels</hi> not a few, even to that of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, as hath formerly ben ſhewed. And for this <hi>puddle of non-ſenſe,</hi> as you ar pleaſed to ſtyle it, (from whence you ſhould have done wel to have related ſome few at leaſt particular paſſages or ſentences of <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> picked out of the whole <hi>puddle</hi>) it hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſeems, ſo puzzeld you and diſturbed all your ſenſes, that you have not ſo much as one wiſe word to return in way of defence unto any peice of the <hi>Exceptions</hi> therein taken to your own <hi>Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> related out of your own writings; onely the very ſight of it ſeems ſo to have troubled your ſtomack, that it hath made you bring up much gall, and ſpit out a great deal of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, which being unaccuſtomed to ſuch ſcurrilous language, I ſhal pas by, and leav to you, to reſume, if you pleaſe, as dogs ſometime do their vomit, and to reſerv it by you, until you have further uſe of it. Mean while, that the <hi>Autor of that Annotation,</hi> which you ar pleaſed ſo to beſpatter, is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his work, but is willing to have it pas the more general trial, whether it be ſuch <hi>a puddle of non-ſenſe</hi> or no; in regard that the whole work, whereof his labors ar but a parcel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of <hi>two</hi> great <hi>volumes,</hi> and the price conſeqently corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, not every mans money, and in fewer hands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; in conſideration hereof he hath cauſed that <hi>Annotation,</hi> excerpted from the reſt to be printed apart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with this, that the more eyes of all ſorts may readily ſee what it is, whether it, be ſuch as you ſay, and how nothing (a few ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous terms onely excepted) you have in your own defence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thereunto.</p>
            <p>One thing I had overpaſt, which I deem not amiſſe to give

For in an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> prefixed to his <hi>Worlds Cataſtrophe,</hi> which came lately to my hands, he tels his Reader that <hi>the Fraternity of the Clergie</hi> ar an <hi>Envious generation,</hi> and this diſeaſe of <hi>envie</hi> is with them <hi>hereditarie.</hi> And what is the ground, think we, of this grievous charge, which he enters upon with ſuch a paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Exclamation? <hi>Oh men of Envie!</hi> forſooth, <hi>they have for ſo many ages envied mankind the knowledge of lerning, that have cloiſtered up books, and ſuffered them to periſh in their cloſets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opened, becauſe all ſhould be ignorant but themſelvs.</hi> and <hi>had not ſome Gentlemen of divine Souls, and many worthy and gallant Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians preſerved Arts and publiſhed their admirable conceptions, he is confident to this very day, the Fraternity of Clergie-men would have kept us at a diſtance, and without the knowledge of many lern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we now know; for which at ſometimes theſe malevolent chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and envious Clergiemen ſnarl at the Autors.</hi> But what ar the Books, that theſe <hi>men made of envie,</hi> have thus mured up, of ſet purpoſe to keep men in ignorance? Is it Gods Word, think we, and the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> or <hi>the Law and the Gospel,</hi> or <hi>the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles?</hi> theſe indeed under the <hi>Papacie</hi> were locked up and ſealed up: and men inhibited from looking into them. But theſe ar not the <hi>Books</hi> Mr. L. ſpeaks of: theſe rather he could be content ſhould be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: they ſpeak no good of him and his trade; tho the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> and <hi>Aspects</hi> of them (as we have elswhere obſerved) <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> no ill at all to <hi>Wizards,</hi> whatſoever to others they do: yet theſe denounce much evil both to them, and to thoſe that ar deluded by them. But what ar they then? ſuch as treat of Mr. Ls. trade; ſuch as the <hi>profeſſors and practiſers of ſuch

arts,</hi> when they turned tru <hi>Chriſtians, burnt</hi> at Epheſus, Act. 19.19. Ah what an <hi>envious</hi> man was Paul, that would ſuffer them ſo to do? But more particularly, that by ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we may know what books he means, <hi>There ar books</hi> (ſaith he from <hi>the Lord of Marchiſtone</hi> writing <hi>on the Revelation) among the Jews, containing doctrines, as they alledge, proceeding from the mouthes of the Patriarks, affirming every great Angel of ſeven to rule the world</hi> 490 <hi>yeers.</hi> and in particular, <hi>a Book of the Government of the VVorld by Angels</hi>; which M.

And what is all this, but to do as Satan did with God to our firſt Parents, who charged him with envieng man <hi>divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> becauſe he inhibited him the forbidden fruit? For therefore, ſaith.

               <hi>skil in the Oriental toungs</hi> I never did, nor do profeſſe; a litle ſmattering onely in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> of <hi>the Bible</hi> I acknowledge. neither needs there any great depth of skil in thoſe <hi>Oriental languages,</hi> for the expounding of that <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Jeremie,</hi> that ſtrikes at Mr. Lilies trade.</p>
            <p>And if that his other <hi>Advocate,</hi> whome he qotes and ſo highly extols, do <hi>for yeers eqal the Annotater,</hi> why may not he ſo aged fall under his Clients cenſure of <hi>Senes bis pueri,</hi> as wel as his <hi>Antagoniſt?</hi> for how Mr. L. ſhould come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with ſuch a faculty as whereby to judge of <hi>tru Divinity,</hi> is a point, I confes, beyond my skil to conceiv.

(and ther ar, I hope, yet living that might ſee that) <hi>there was ſuch a terrible and horrid Eclips of the Sun, as had not ben ſince</hi> 1544. <hi>nec etiam multis futuris ſeculis, nor for many enſuing ages ſhould be.</hi> And yet there hath not one entire <hi>ſeculum,</hi> or <hi>age,</hi> as himſelf renders it, who yet thus ſaith, much les <hi>many,</hi> as ſome other, paſt over our heds between this and that: unles they wil make ſhorter <hi>ſecula,</hi> or <hi>ages,</hi> as did the Emperour Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius for his <hi>Ludi ſeculares,</hi> or <hi>Secular Interludes,</hi> but was laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at for his labor,<note place="margin">Suet. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. c. 21.</note> by many of thoſe that had ſeen them, ſome that had acted in them, yet ſurviving, when the <hi>Common Crier</hi> proclaimd ſuch <hi>Diſports</hi> to be exhibited, <hi>qos nec qiſqam spectaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, nec ſpectaturus eſſet, as no man then alive had ſeen, or ſhould ſurvive to ſee again</hi>: or as the Popes do their <hi>Jubilees,</hi> which they have drawn down from 50. <hi>yeers</hi> to 25. to draw the more money from poor people, whome they laugh at the whileſt for their lightnes of belief. But whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Lilie or Leovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius were here in the <hi>Error,</hi> let others decide, and let him for me lay it on whether of their two ſhoulders he liſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as concerning the <hi>ſite</hi> of the <hi>light</hi> continued du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>conjunction</hi> of thoſe two <hi>Luminaries</hi> in the late <hi>Eclips</hi>; M. L. with divers other of his felow <hi>Prognoſtiks,</hi> were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly miſtaken. for in his delineation thereof, as divers other alſo of them, he places the light part, ſuch glimmerings at leaſt of it, as he is pleaſed to afford us, below; whereas it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to any ey ſedulouſly obſerving the apparition, that the <hi>light</hi> part was above: which I hope, he himſelf wil not have the face to deny.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for the ſumming up of the parts (as to us) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured;<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> calling in Captain George Wharton <hi>an excellent</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culator, he determines from him, who (he ſaith) had <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and lernedly delivered it,</hi> that <hi>the body of the Sun would be eleven digits and fifty five minutes eclipſed.</hi> Where I wonder why Mr. Lilie ſo great an Artiſt, as he profeſſeth himſelf to be, ſhould be ſo diffident of his own skil, that he ſhould not dare to venture or hazard it upon any Calculation of his own, but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54907:22"/>
refer himſelf to Capt. G. W. his <hi>calculation</hi> herein, whom howſoever he pronounces in his <hi>calculation exact</hi>; and doth not les, I hope, conſpire with in his <hi>Prognoſtiks</hi> for the <hi>effects</hi> or <hi>events</hi> of it, yet as miſdoubting the ſucceſſe and iſſu of the buſienes, he ſeems ſo cautelouſly to have thus delivered it, that if any error came to be diſcovered in it, it might rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his frend the <hi>Calculator,</hi> from whome he had taken it upon truſt, then be charged upon himſelf. But that the <hi>Calculations,</hi> whether the ones, or the others, or agreed upon by both, is not ſo <hi>exact,</hi> is by others not a few, deemed in theſe points very skilful, agreed, and by M. L. himſelf in part alſo, but covertly, confeſt. For ſome here at London, as I am enformed, do affirm, that the obſcuration in ſome <hi>digits</hi> fel ſhort of that their account; and that by the obſervation of thoſe at Oxford, and of a prime man among the reſt in M. L. his own account, it miſſed much at leaſt in the <hi>minutes</hi>; for by their <hi>Calculation</hi> it was but <hi>eleven digits, and one fourth,</hi> which I conceiv to be <hi>fifteen minutes,</hi> the <hi>fourth part of a digit,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>ſixty minutes</hi>; which why M. L.<note place="margin">Ephemer. ann. 53.</note> is pleaſed to cal <hi>fifteen ſeconds,</hi> I wot not. but by that <hi>calculation,</hi> which M. L. himſelf in his late <hi>new Ephemeris</hi> would ſeem to accord with, it came as far ſhort for <hi>minutes</hi> in the former account, as <hi>fifteen</hi> and <hi>fifty five</hi> ar aſunder. But I wil not take upon me to decide the difference between them; I content my ſelf with M. L. his own grant here.</p>
            <p>Onely by the way, I ſhould, if I might be ſo bold, demand of Mr. L. whether this <hi>excellent Calculator,</hi> Capt. <hi>G. Wharton,</hi> be not anagrammatiſed the ſame with <hi>Naworth of Oxford.</hi> I ſhrewdly gues them to be one and the ſame. and ſome frends aſſure me, that he himſelf in ſome of his writings hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as much. Which if it ſo be; I ſhould then further demand, (for I am in theſe matters but a Qeſtioniſt) how it is come about, that <hi>Naworth that ABC felow of Oxford,</hi> (for ſo M. L. ſtyles him in the very entrie to his <hi>Ephemeris for the yeer</hi> 47.) is now ſo ſodainlie become <hi>Capt. G. Wharton that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Calculator</hi>? Surely there muſt needs be ſome grand myſterie in it. Is the tranſpoſition of a few letters, think we, ſo efficacious in this their <hi>new Magik,</hi> that the change of the <hi>name</hi> ſhould ſodainly produce ſuch a ſtrange change in the

man? Or may we not deem rather that his reconcilement to Mr. Lilie hath effected the alteration, and made the <hi>Abce Scholler</hi> ſuch an <hi>accurate calculator?</hi> and then the <hi>Annotater</hi> may not be wholie out of hope, but that if he would recant and claw Mr. Lilie a litle, M. L. as the Proverb is, would <hi>claw him again,</hi> and ſo he might of <hi>Thomas Wiſeaker, that old doating Duns,</hi> become ſodainly <hi>Mr. T. G. an excellent Divine,</hi> or, as Marcilius Ficinus, becauſe he writes for thoſe of his coat (for no other lerning is M. L. privie to in him) <hi>an excellent lerned Preiſt.</hi> Yea what might not thoſe poor Snakes the ſilie ſnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whether Engliſh or Scottiſh hope to prove, if they could be ſo happy, as to make their peace with M. L. and be admitted to kiſſe the hand of this <hi>Great Mogul</hi>? But neither is the <hi>Annotater,</hi> nor ar the <hi>Presbyerians,</hi> he hopes, ſo baſe minded, to ſtoop ſo low, as to bear a taper before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, to gain a degree in his Academie, and to attain a new Title in M.

Did ſo ſmall a diſtance of place, think we, alter the face of the sky? or hath the variation of the <hi>Scene</hi> on the earth here below, produced a variation of the <hi>Scheme</hi> above in the heavens? But I make litle doubt, had they then ben both together, when they wrot ſuch different <hi>Prognoſtiks,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their M. L. with M. N. at Oxford, or M. N. with M.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (you have his own wiſe terms) <hi>as if it threatned danger unto thoſe, that ſhould be about their labors, or other like affairs abroad</hi>: and there wanted not indeed of his felow wizards, that adviſed people by any means to keep their families, young children eſpecially within dores, and preſcribed cordials to be given them, as preſervatives againſt the harm and diſaſters, that from this dreadful occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent might accrew to them. but M.

            <p>Yea but our <hi>Engliſh Merline</hi> tels us in his late <hi>New Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meris</hi> for the yeer 1653, to ſalv his credit in this particular, that <hi>thouſands in London did then behold the Planet of Venus and many fixed Stars as cleerly as in the darkeſt night.</hi>

            <p>He told us awhile ago, that he doubted we might not ſee them for the darknes of the day,<note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> which Saturns melancholie and malevolent look might produce: now he tels us <hi>they were ſeen</hi> by many <hi>as cleerly as in the darkeſt night</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the darknes of the day belike would hinder the ſight of that, which the darknes of the night would help to improov. Or doth the man, trow we, mean, and ſo with an <hi>Eqivocation</hi> (ſuch as <hi>the Wizards Oracles</hi> much abounded in of old) delude us? that as he who preſenting one for a degree in the Univerſitie, on his word averred him to be, <hi>tam doctrinâ, qam moribus idoneum, as wel for lerning as for life and cariage fit to have that degree conferred on him</hi>; that is, as he after expounded himſelf, <hi>alike</hi> fit <hi>for either,</hi> in plain truth <hi>for neither.</hi> So our Merlines meaning may be, that thoſe his <hi>thouſands ſaw thoſe Stars as cleerly as in the darkeſt night,</hi> wherein there is no Star at all to be ſeen. and then we ſhal as eaſily beleiv him herein, as thoſe did the <hi>Maſter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi> concerning the <hi>Scholler preſented</hi> by him, who know wel

enough what he was. Otherwiſe how thoſe <hi>thouſands in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> attained to ſuch an eminent degree of perſpicacitie above ſo many other thouſands in and about the Citie, that could deſcry no ſuch matter, the ayer and skie being alike affected unto either partie in thoſe parts, it is not eaſie to apprehend, unles they ſhould all borow and make uſe of Mr. Lilies ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which he ſhould be very free of to lend to ſo many. Yet, it may be ſome two or three of our Merlines clients, to cheer the man up, perceiving how he was in his dumps, upon notice taken that his predictions concerning this dreadful <hi>Eclips</hi> had not in all points accordingly faln out; and ſore vexed, that the <hi>Mercuries and ballat-ſingers,</hi> whome he greivouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, had ben ſo bold with him; might come to him and tel him, that they had ſeen ſome ſuch matter, (for, it ſeems, he dares not, does not at leaſt, ſay, that he ſaw them himſelf) whome by the help of ſome multiplieng glas he might raiſe up to that <hi>hyperbolical</hi> number of <hi>thouſands</hi>: unles it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as may not unjuſtly be ſuſpected) by the <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> or <hi>mendacium,</hi> a couple of <hi>tropes</hi> too freqent with thoſe of his trade.</p>
            <p>But to let theſe unwonted ſights pas; for <hi>the greatnes of the obſcurity,</hi> many <hi>thouſands,</hi> I doubt not, wil avow, and my ſelf among the reſt, that they have full oft known the skie, through the thicknes of clouds overſpreading the places of their aboad, much darker, upon ſome approaching ſtorm eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then they found it at the higheſt or deepeſt degree (chooſe whether you pleaſe to term it) of this <hi>dreadful Eclips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea but, howſoever it was with the <hi>Eclips</hi> here about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, our Merline enforms us, that <hi>by letters from Scotland and Ireland, and ſome of ours on ſhip-board,</hi> it appeers, that <hi>the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was far more dreadful in thoſe parts where they then were, ſo as they could not ſee to write or to barb without candle; and no man ever ſaw the like in thoſe qarters</hi>: inſomuch that in ſome places <hi>all the poor people caſt themſelvs down on their backs</hi> (they might have done better to have lien groveling on their bellies) <hi>with their eyes towards heaven, moſt paſſionately praying, that Chriſt would let them ſee the Sun again.</hi> They were ſome belike of the progenie of that people, that were wont to howl hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and make greivous lamentation at the daily <hi>ſetting of

the Sun,</hi> as miſdoubting that he would never riſe again with them. But, it ſeems, that ſpiteful Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent aſpect Mr. L. miſdoubted might by clouding the day, hinder the ſight of the Stars with us, did on the other ſide produce that hideous and dreadful darknes with them; and we may hope therefore, that thoſe direful and diſaſtrous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which this darkning of our day-light, either doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, or is to produce, wil light upon thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or at the moſt and worſt, on our ſhipping at Sea, where the darknes was ſo exceeding deep and diſmal; not upon us in theſe parts, where it was nothing ſo dreadful. I might wel adde, that its to wel known to be a common ſlight of our <hi>Mercuries</hi> (and why not of our <hi>Merlines?</hi>) to date and divulge letters from forain parts and remote regions, that have indeed ben as wel coined and endited, as printed and publiſhed here at London.</p>
            <p>But leaving theſe things, as by-matters to my main intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at preſent (mentioned onely to retund a litle this mans inſolent vauntings of his tranſcendent skil in the <hi>Sideral</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) to be made out, and made good by him as he ſhal deem himſelf able; I ſhall proceed unto that, which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly propounded to deal in a while with him, concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of theſe <hi>Eclipſes</hi> the main <hi>matter</hi> of his <hi>Book.</hi> And here in the firſt place, I would gladly know, for my better lern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from him and his Complices what reaſon in <hi>Nature</hi> they can give us (for in his late <hi>Ephemeris</hi> he tells us they go <hi>in a natural way</hi>) of thoſe dreadful <hi>effects</hi> or <hi>events,</hi> that to theſe <hi>Eclipſes</hi> they aſcribe. For to pres that Argument againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any the meaneſt capacity may be able to apprehend.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54907:26"/>
why ſhould not the total want of the <hi>Sun-light</hi> for divers hours together, having no <hi>Moon-light</hi> at all to ſupply the want of it, either <hi>the night next before this Eclips,</hi> or <hi>the night next after it,</hi> portend as dreadful matter, or produce as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Effects,</hi> as the greateſt darknes that to us it ſuſtained, laſting (Mr. L. himſelf ſaith it) <hi>not above a quarter of an hower</hi>?</p>

It was in its own nature, as we ſaid before of the <hi>Eclips,</hi> a work admirable, that the <hi>Sun</hi> did <hi>riſe and ſet, at his du ſet and wonted time,</hi> either <hi>the day before,</hi> or <hi>the day after</hi> his <hi>ſtay</hi> at the one time, his <hi>retrograde motion</hi> at the others, then that for ſo ſmal an interval he <hi>ſtopt</hi> and <hi>ſtaied</hi> his uſual <hi>progres</hi> in either.

               <note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> with telling us, that we <hi>blame Aſtrologie, becauſe it is beyond our capacitie; whoſe error he therefore pitieth, becauſe grounded rather on malice and ignorance, then on any ſound enqirie.</hi> But we ſhal entreat him, tho we come never ſo far ſhort of him for matter of skil in this his profound <hi>Art,</hi> not to repute us meer bruits or irrational creatures.

to be tru which I ſay. About the time that Socrates lived at Athens was Archelaus King of Macedonie; who upon <hi>an Eclips of the Sun,</hi> that fell out in his reign, <hi>cauſed his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to be ſhut, and his ſons hed to be ſhaven</hi>; as in great dangers and diſtreſſes, or greifs and calamities was wont to be done. and whence, ſaith Seneca, who relates it, proceeded all this dread, but from his <hi>gros ignorance of the nature of the creatures?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sen. <hi>de benef.</hi> l. 5. c. 6.</note> for had he had Socrates with him, whome he invited to repair to him, but for ſome conſiderations refuſed ſo to do, he would, ſaith my Autor, <hi>have drawn him out of that corner or covert, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for fear he had hid himſelf, and bad him</hi> be of <hi>good cheer,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him that it was <hi>no defection of the</hi> Sun, <hi>but a paſſage of the Moon,</hi> that <hi>keeping a lower way, came between it and the earth,</hi> and <hi>ſo hid the body of the</hi> Sun <hi>from our ſight</hi>; that thoſe <hi>two celeſtial bodies would by the ſwifter motion of the one be ſoon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again,</hi> and <hi>that light of the Sun reſtored to the Earth, which the intervention of the Moon, in manner of a cloud, had ſuſpended for a time.</hi> Which laſt clauſe of his, doth well intimate that which is indeed moſt tru; to wit, that as great darknes for <hi>ſun-light</hi> is oft produced by <hi>thick clouds</hi> and miſty fogs as by any <hi>Eclips,</hi> and as much diſmalnes and danger conſeqently in the one as in the other.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſome may moov qeſtion, whether Socrates his skill would have prevailed ſo far with Archelaus, as to reduce him ſo perplexed and amazed to a ſettled poſture of mind again, tho it be apparent that his ignorance had caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that fit of fear, we wil pas on to another inſtance.<note place="margin">Plut. in <hi>Pericl.</hi>

Yet ſuch is the fury and obſtinacy of <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> backed with <hi>error</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> that the rude multitude at Athens, being a popular State, would have had Anaxagoras condemned as an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> for diſcovering the <hi>tru nature</hi> of ſuch occurrents unto them, and were like to have carried it againſt him, had not Pericles oppoſed it, and protected his Teacher.</p>
            <p>To this of Pericles we ſhall add from the ſame Autor two other inſtances, in two likewiſe military Commanders, neer about the ſame times, but men of divers diſpoſitions, and accordingly of divers carriages, with no les divers event. The one of them was Nicias,<note place="margin">Plut. in <hi>Nic.</hi> Thucyd. l. 7.</note> who being ſent from Athens with ſome Forces into Sicilie to aſſiſt one party of the Ilanders (for the Iland was divided into factions) againſt the other, at firſt prevailed much and was very ſucceſſeful in his deſigns; but after the acceſſe of ſome Spartan forces, thoſe of the Iland deſerting him, and timely ſupplies failing, he and his were both by Sea and Land ſo beſet, that there ſeemed no way to eſcape but by a clancular flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this when they were now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing themſelvs unto and had fitted all things for it,<note place="margin">Thucyd. &amp; Plut. <hi>ibid.</hi> Plin. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>a Lunar Eclips</hi> came in the way: Whereupon Nicias a man of himſelf timorous and ſuperſtitious, being miſled by ſuch wizards as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54907:28"/>
he had then about him, who (contrary to the wonted opinion of others of that profeſſion, that, as Autoclides reports of them, confined the <hi>diſmal effects</hi> of ſuch occurrents but to <hi>two or three dayes</hi> at moſt) enlarged the <hi>danger and diſaſtrous events</hi> of them to <hi>a moneths</hi> time at leaſt, would not be perſwaded ſo much as to entertain any deliberation concerning ſtay or flight, untill <hi>the ful Moon</hi> came about again; but in a fond manner ſat ſtill ſo long idling and trifling out the time in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious rites, until the enemy having gotten further hed and ſtrength by new ſupplies, had ſo cloſely environed and overpowred him and his forces, that no way or meanes were now left for eſcape, and prooved the utter deſtruction both of him and them. all which miſcheif and miſery had with no great difficulty (ſaith mine Autor) ben prevented,<note place="margin">Plut.

            <p>The other Inſtance is of Dio, who ſetting out from Zant with forces againſt the Tyranne Dionyſius,<note place="margin">Plut. in <hi>Dion.</hi>
               </note> was nothing at all troubled, either he or his company with a like <hi>Lunar Eclipſe</hi> that then fell out; but launched out undauntedly, put over into Sicilie, there landed his forces, ſurpriſed Syracuſa, and drave out the Tyranne. and what was it, think ye, that kept Dio and his folowers from that terror and dread that ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nicias and his aſſociates upon the ſelf ſame occaſion? Plutark tels you. It was, ſaith he, <hi>Dices familiarity with Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> who had <hi>aright enformed him of the tru cauſe of ſuch occurrents,</hi> whoſe <hi>fame and note</hi> alſo, having received it from Socrates, <hi>gained</hi> generally <hi>more credit</hi> to his doctrine in ſuch matters, then Anaxagoras before him could attain; who therefore durſt not open his judgement therein ſave to ſome ſpecial frends, ſuch as Pericles was. yet tru it is withal, that to ſtay
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54907:29"/>
the minds of ſuch among them as might not be wholy free from ſuch frivolous ſuperſtitions, one Miltas, that took upon him to be no mean <hi>Wiſard,</hi> calling the company together, told them, that that <hi>defection of the Moon</hi> did <hi>portend the deficiency of ſome great illuſtrious perſon, ſuch an one as Dionyſius.</hi>

            <p>And I have, as I conceiv, very juſt cauſe to doubt, whether

ſuch a <hi>Garment,</hi> as his <hi>picture</hi> here gives us, were in faſhion among the old <hi>Britons</hi> in the time of his great grandfather <hi>Merlin,</hi> whoſe name he ſo much affects, and bears, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſumed, as one either of his <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>adopted ſons</hi> (which honor and title, whither way of the two he lay claim to it, none, that I know, need or wil envie him) or in the daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him of the <hi>Incubus,</hi> of whome they ſay he was begotten, and endued him, it ſeems, with ſuch <hi>prophetical skill,</hi> as from the Satyriſt ye heard Tireſias of old had, and M. L. ſucceeds him in, as his rightful heir, and a genuine bird of that kind. But it may wel be, as ſome other would have it, that that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus,</hi> of which his <hi>Anceſter Merlin</hi> was bred, was no other then ſuch an one, as our old Poet Chaucer in his <hi>Canterburie Tales</hi> ſaith in his days were ſo riſe and ready at hand in moſt places, that for looſe creatures, ſuch as belike Merlins mother was, <hi>no other Incubus</hi> then ſuch then needed.

And howſoever theſe buſineſſes were then carried concerning his <hi>Progeniters</hi> breeding or birth, Mr. L. wil hardly enduce any man to beleiv, that thoſe <hi>Brittiſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> uſed to go in our <hi>Lawyers</hi> or <hi>Judges gowns,</hi> ſuch as this <hi>Long Robe</hi> comes neereſt to, or did wear <hi>Roſes</hi> upon their <hi>ſhoes.</hi> Theſe his <hi>Ancients</hi> therefore muſt of neceſſity be of a lower date, of a later Edition, ſome <hi>old Magitians</hi> of ſome younger times.

            <p>But methinks, Mr. L. here much forgat himſelf, and did not remember the old rule, that ſays, <hi>Oportet mendacem eſſe memorem.

But how Mr. Lilies fancies came thus to alter, unles it were that he took a nap between the one and the other, and in his ſecond ſleep had a new dream; or that his hed was ſo ful of his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>rams horns,</hi> (for on the <hi>ram aſcendent,</hi> or <hi>rampant,</hi> if you wil, it is ſtil that he runs) that it cauſed his wild notions, <hi>arietare,</hi> as the Latines ſpeak, that is, <hi>to run ful but,</hi> as <hi>rams,</hi> or <hi>tups,</hi> uſe to do, one againſt another in his brains.</p>
            <p>But leaving him to part theſe his repugnant fancies, and to make them agree as he ſhall ſee good, let us pas to his next <hi>picture</hi>; (for with <hi>pictures</hi> it is no new thing with him to plie us) of that he tels us,<note place="margin">Pag. 38.</note> that <hi>Joannes Angelus</hi> (a Bavarian Wizard, of as good credit in this kind as himſelf) repreſents the tenth <hi>degree of Aries</hi> (the <hi>Ram,</hi> that ſo variouſly affects his thoughts) <hi>wherein this Eclipſe fals out to be, by a Souldier riding a Bull, with its horn in his one hand, and his ſpur on its ſide, and a spare horſe led by him with his other hand</hi>

And tho his <hi>VVizard</hi> by his <hi>Motto</hi> added to expres the meaning of his thus riding, ſay, <hi>Homo malitioſus erit.

Notwithſtanding all this, M.

            <p>I hope I may be ſo bold here, as to qeſtion Mr. L. his skill a litle in Latine.

His <hi>Rider,</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi> had he conſulted them, could have enformed him, that not <hi>ſtrutius</hi> indeed, as his Autor the Bavarian, after Iſidore, barbarouſly writes it, but <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius,</hi> or <hi>Struthio</hi> rather, in Latin was an <hi>Eſtridge</hi> or an <hi>Oſtridge.</hi>

               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54907:36"/>But to let his Latin lerning paſſe, till we come to compile ſome new <hi>Gloſſarie,</hi> and touch a litle upon his <hi>Emblematical</hi> skil: I remember, when I was a School-boy, after the affront and defeat given Monſieur Francis Alanſon the French Kings brother at Antwerp, which he attempted to ſurpriſe, that there was a <hi>Picture</hi> drawn by ſome ſhrewd unhappy head, wherein the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were repreſented as <hi>a Cow,</hi> becauſe abounding <hi>in milk and butter, which King Philip rid and ſpurd,</hi> as the <hi>Cavalier</hi> doth here the <hi>Bul, the Prince of Orange milked, an old woman Qeen Eliſabeth fed with a lock of hay,</hi> ſo much as might keep her in life, and the <hi>French Monſieur pulling by the tail,</hi> ſhe all to beſpattred with her filth. Now whether this <hi>Souldier,</hi> or <hi>Cavalier riding an ox</hi> or <hi>a bul, with his spur on its ſide,</hi> might not rather intimate, that the <hi>Cavalier</hi> or <hi>Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> the war continuing, ſhould neceſſarily vex the poor huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, reſembled by the <hi>Ox</hi> that helps to til the ground, by qartering upon him, and with his horſe treading down his gras and his corn; fit as wel, at leaſt, with the type, as that far fetcht <hi>explication</hi> and <hi>application</hi> that this our Wizard makes of it, ſo many miles wide of his Autors acknowledged <hi>expoſition,</hi> I dare permit to the judgment of any one, that hath not captived his ſenſes to aſſent unto and aſſert whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Wizard ſhal ſay.</p>

As for mine own, either this or the former; howſoever he ſhal think good to deal with them otherwiſe; I ſhal adviſe him now as a frend, that he take heed how he make any mention, or have any word, of <hi>the good Angels</hi> he told us were <hi>the firſt Teachers of his Trade.</hi> For I can aſſure him, there ar not a few of the mind that he is as wel able <hi>to eat a whole cart-load of logs,</hi> as to make his word good concerning thoſe <hi>good Angels,</hi> by any ſound proof or authentick record. But their ſhalow capacities, it may be, ar not able to reach the vaſt extent of Mr. L. his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or to conceiv, what great matters, eſpecially by the help of ſuch his <hi>good Angels,</hi> he is able to effect. And if he can do it, and wil be pleaſed ſo far to condeſcend to their weaknes, as to do us the favor, to make his power herein to appeer, I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him on mine honeſt word, that when he ſhal have ſo done, I wil both ſolemnly recant all that I have written againſt him,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54907:51"/>
and by this my preſent hand-writing oblige my ſelf, never to open my mouth any more to ſpeak an ill word of him. Mean while, if he ſhal find, that either by his own skil, or by any ſuch aſſiſtance, in a work deemed ſo weighty, and in other mens eyes ſo difficult, he is of force ſufficient, to make that his <hi>aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> good, mine inſtant reqeſt then is to him, that it may be one with the firſt of his next Herculean labors, to do it, for the maintaining of his own credit, that avers it, and the repute of his <hi>Art,</hi> which for want of better grounds, is by him founded upon it, and the gaining of a <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> yea of many an one, I doubt not, to his <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> if the thing be once atcheived.</p>
            <p>Now if it ſhal by any be demanded, how it comes to paſſe, that this <hi>Vindication</hi> of mine <hi>Annotations</hi> came no ſooner abroad, and why like <hi>Homers Litae</hi> it lags ſo long after M. Ls. <hi>Ate,</hi> that hath ſo blaſted it?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer; Firſt, as in the <hi>Entrance</hi> into it I formerly intimated, it was long, being confined and mured up, as I ſtill am, ere I heard ought of Mr. Ls. ſnarlings at my <hi>Notes</hi>; ſome ſpace of time after that, ere the <hi>Book</hi> came to my hands; and when upon view of it, I found that for <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it, I was put off to ſome <hi>Nameles Autor,</hi> or <hi>Autors</hi> that were to come out: and yet a longer time, ere by enqiry of frends I could come to be enformed of any of them that had appeered in print, much leſſe to gain the ſight of their works. Mean while thoſe that know, what the ſtate of my family then was, partly by a grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and tedious malady, that having long afflicted my deer conſort and faithful yoakfelow, was then grown to an height with her; and partly through her deceaſe enſuing thereupon, that filled my heart with much greif, and my hed with many cares, wherewith in times paſt, while ſhe enjoyed life with health and ſtrength, and I her, I was altogether unacqainted, wil eaſily gueſſe, how litle mind, ſo affected and diſtracted, I might have to mind ought of this nature. Beſides that, I had other irons in the fire, that I was to look after. I had ſome Works of better uſe, I hope, in the Pres, both here in the City, and elswhere, which are now abroad: the one whereof draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then neer to the birth, a new task unexpected, but by others much deſired, that it might more compleatly came forth to the light, and be the more uſeful, when it came out, I cannot ſay, interrrupted me, in the midſt of my work, but enforced me to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54907:51"/>
lay it aſide, having not as yet made any great progreſſe in it, until that were diſpatcht. Theſe <hi>remoraes</hi> either keeping off at firſt, or breaking off afterward, together with mine own weakneſſe, ſlacking my pace, and the want of a Scribe that might have furthered the diſpatch, as alſo the work it ſelf growing under my hand, while one thing fetches in another have much retarded the finiſhing of it. And yet may it well come abroad timely enough, in regard of the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> that this man handles in this <hi>Book,</hi> wherein he falls foul on me and my <hi>Notes</hi>; to free mens minds from ſuch frivolous frights and groundles fears, as he ſeeks to poſſeſſe them with, from the ſeveral <hi>Eclipſes</hi> that have faln out this yeer, and that eſpecially of the <hi>Sun</hi>; ſince that he withal enformed us, that theſe <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> begin not uſually to work theſe their <hi>diſmal effects</hi> till <hi>eight moneths</hi> after, and then continu for a <hi>two or three yeers,</hi> or ſo long as theſe their deſigners liſt. So that the main matter of thoſe fals fears, which he would affright people with, being as yet moſt of it come, according to his computation, the work comes ſeaſonably enough, if it ſhal prevail with any, by the diſcovery of the vanity of the pretended cauſes thereof, either to preſerv them from entertaining ſuch fond conceits, or to purge them out, where they have ben entertained already. And ſo I ſhall paſſe from <hi>Mr. W. Lilie,</hi> to <hi>Mr. John Swan,</hi> one, it ſeems, of his <hi>Advocates.</hi>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54907:52"/>
this of <hi>Mr. Swan,</hi> on which alſo it was long ere I lighted. Him therefore I deemed to be one at leaſt, if any more uncertain, foretold ſhould be Mr. Ls. <hi>Advocates</hi> or <hi>Patrons,</hi> unto whom as having undertaken the defence of him and his cauſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by him, againſt mine <hi>Annotations</hi> on that portion of Scripture, I found my ſelf by him there referred. That which the rather I had cauſe to beleiv, becauſe I found his diſcourſe concurring with a paſſage concerning the ſame Scripture by Mr. L. related out of <hi>a Nameles Autor</hi> much magnified of him, whoſe work yet, be it <hi>Sermon,</hi> or <hi>Commentarie,</hi> or what ever els, whether it ever ſaw the publick light, is to me as uncertain as what is at this day done at Rome. And if it be ſo, as may moſt probably be deemed, it may ſeem, that either M.L. about that time did by the Stars foreſee, that <hi>ſuch a Sermon on ſuch a Text</hi> ſhould be <hi>preached on the</hi> 28. <hi>of March,</hi> and ſhould afterward come out in print; or elſe that Mr. Swan before that time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving penned it, and deſtinated it to that day, did tender a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of it to M.<note place="margin">Laert. l. 2.</note> L. his Client, (as Lyſias did an <hi>Apologie</hi> to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates penned for him, to make uſe, if he thought good at his Trial) with a purpoſe to diſpoſe of it, as he ſhould either like or miſlike it. With this <hi>Sermon</hi> of Mr. Swans therefore, and that parcel of that other party, whom M.L. ſo highly extols I ſhal deal in this preſent <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> as with two of M.Ls. either <hi>Patrons</hi> or <hi>Advocates</hi> made choiſe of by him, to maintain him and his cauſe, againſt whatſoever in that <hi>fruitles and ſenſles An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation</hi> (as Mr. L. ſtyles it) which I yet am not aſhamed to own, may concern either. wherein how they have either <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted their Client,</hi> or <hi>acquighted themſelvs,</hi> the ſeqele ſhal ſhew.</p>

So here, he that ſhal tell a thing for a certain truth, which he hath no certain ground for, tho the thing it ſelf be never ſo certainly tru in it ſelf, yet is not thereby ſaved from being a lier. If I ſhall avow that at this inſtant the Pope at Rome is either ſinging Maſſe in S. Peters, or ſitting in Conſiſtorie with his Cardinals, tho the thing were never ſo tru, yet were I a lier in averring what I had no notice of. Nor will it therefore help Mr. L. to free him from lying and cheating, when having taken mens mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that repair to him, to help them to their loſt linnen pewter, plate and other goods again, he telleth them it is ſuch a perſon that hath them, or they are in ſuch and ſuch a place, if it ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward fall out ſo as he told, ſince that he could not have certain notice of, or ground for any ſuch thing, unles from the Divel, or by compact from ſome other third partie. Nor will it proov him to be a <hi>true Prophet,</hi> or ſave him from being juſtly reputed <hi>a falſ Prophet and a liar,</hi> becauſe <hi>his judgement concerning the effects of ſome Eclipſes</hi> have proved as he ſaith, <hi>rather Prophetical then then predictive,</hi> unleſs he could upon good and certain grounds aſſuredly know that Eclipſes do neceſſarily produce ſuch Effects, which doubtles he neither could, nor will ever be able to do, much les any where hath done. for it is but a poor ſhift, to tel us, as the whipper his worthy friend doth for him, that he conceals his reaſons in Art for ſome of his judgements, <hi>(O envious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that charges the <hi>Clergie-men</hi> ſo deeplie with the ſelf ſame fault) that he may <hi>not make every man at wiſe as himſelf.</hi> The

            <p>Hitherto then we have examined the <hi>Reaſons</hi> rendred by Mr. Lilies two <hi>Advocates,</hi> why God by his Prophet ſhould forbid his People <hi>to be afraid of the Signs of Heaven, as the Heathen were.</hi> the one in regard of the qalitie of the fear; becauſe it was a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maying dread</hi>; which yet we have ſhewed it might juſtly have ben, were the <hi>Signs</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Signs of Gods heavie indignation</hi>: the other taken from the <hi>unavoydable fatalitie,</hi> aſcribed by the <hi>Chaldee Wizards</hi> unto thoſe diſmal Events and Effects, that the Signs did preſage and produce, wherein we have ſhewed, that our <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> alſo go along in eqipage with them.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now proceed to ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what the true ground and reaſon is of this <hi>Prohibition</hi>; and why theſe Signs ought not at all to affright or trouble Gods People, expreſſed in the Text; which theſe men were very ſhie of, loath to take notice of, or once to touch upon. And this had Mr. Swan and his aſſociate eaſily apprehended, had they ben pleaſed ſeriouſly to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, either the <hi>firſt branch</hi> of this <hi>ſecond Vers,</hi> or the <hi>ſentence next enſuing,</hi> which the <hi>cauſal particle</hi> prefixed ſhews to belong unto this, tho in way of tranſition, as a middle term, coming between the ſubject matter of <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> here intimated, and that of <hi>Idolatrie</hi> entred upon in the <hi>third vers,</hi> it be in diſtinction of <hi>verſes</hi> faſtned unto the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:54907:61"/>For the former Branch; <hi>Learn not,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>the way of the Heathen,</hi> where by <hi>the way of the Heathen,</hi> what can be ment, but ſuch courſes as the Heathen held and took, either concerning <hi>the Signs of Heaven,</hi> which they ſuperſtitiouſly regarded, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their <hi>idols,</hi> which having framed they adored, and we ſee <hi>the learning of their way, and the dreading of the ſignes,</hi> to be <hi>two</hi> diſtinct <hi>branches</hi> of the preſent <hi>Prohibition,</hi> the former whereof theſe <hi>Patrons of Aſtrologie</hi> ſlightly paſs over, or ſlily paſs by, as a needleſs branch, or a luxuriant ſprig, not worthy of regard, but ſuch as might wel be ſpared, and would therefore the more handſomely to conceal it and keep it out of ſight, involv and wrap it up in the ſame ſentence with the next: as if the meaning were no more then this, <hi>Learn not the way of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, nor be diſmayed</hi>; that is, <hi>Learn not to be diſmaid.</hi> It is tru indeed, that ſometime <hi>two Verbs</hi> either <hi>ſtanding looſe,</hi> as Pſal. 51.2. and 106.13. Hoſh. 9 9. or <hi>knit together with a copulative,</hi> as Gen. 26.18. Dan. 9.21 <hi>may be combined into one ſentence</hi>; that which by many inſtances I ſhew both in ſome part of my <hi>Cinnus,</hi> and in divers places of mine <hi>Annotations</hi> among thoſe <hi>fruitleſs Criticiſms,</hi> that Mr. Lilie finds there. But that will not hold here for two cauſes. 1. It is not an <hi>Injunction,</hi> but an <hi>Inhibition.</hi> Its one thing to ſay, <hi>Learn, not to fear</hi>: another thing to ſay, <hi>Learn not, to fear</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the former is an <hi>injunction</hi>; and the negative particle therefore adheres not to the <hi>imperative</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, but to the <hi>infinitive</hi> ſubſeqent, the latter is an <hi>inhibition,</hi> and the <hi>negative</hi> therefore muſt be joyned to the <hi>imperative</hi>; which being here done would produce a ſtrange ſenſe, inhibiting, not ſimply to be afraid, but to learn to be afraid; <hi>Do not learn to be afraid.</hi> But 2. the <hi>two Verbs</hi> here have <hi>two</hi> ſeveral <hi>ſubjects</hi> that they paſs unto. the <hi>Heathens way</hi> is the <hi>ſubject not to be learned; the Signs of Heaven</hi> ar <hi>the Subject not to be dreaded.</hi> and if any ſhall ask what is meant by <hi>the way of the Heathen,</hi> the other branch in the frontiſpiece of the 3 <hi>vers</hi> will tel us; to wit, that this <gap reason="foreign">

terms lead us to it. So that its clear enough to any the meaneſt capacitie that, by <hi>way</hi> is here ment, ſuch <hi>rules, documents,</hi> or <hi>leſſons,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldean Wizards</hi> taught the Heathen people concerning the <hi>Signs of Heaven,</hi> and their diſmal operations, which produced in them ſuch trouble and conſternation or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of mind. God would not have his people to learn or regard the one, that they might not be afrighted and diſmaid with the other. And this Branch therefore would not have ben either ſlily ſlighted, or wholy overſlipt by thoſe, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly undertaken the diſcuſſing of the <hi>Vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is another Branch, which tho it be crowded into the next <hi>verſe,</hi> yet, (as the <hi>rationative particle</hi> appearing in its front ſhews) hath reference unto this. If we ſhall demand then why Gods people ſhould <hi>not learn this</hi> Heatheniſh way, the reaſon is ready at hand, we need not go far to ſeek for it, the Prophet himſelf rendreth it; <hi>for the rules</hi> or <hi>leſſons,</hi> that the Heathen are taught by and take out from their <hi>Wizards,</hi> ar <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>vanitie,</hi> as the word is in the <hi>abſtract,</hi> that is, <hi>very vain,</hi> as <hi>vain</hi> as <hi>vanity</hi> it ſelf. So that if Mr. Swan had ben pleaſed to ſtep but one ſtep further, and no long ſtride had needed, or to have caſt but his eye to the very next line to his <hi>Text,</hi> he had there lighted on the true cauſe, why <hi>neither this way of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> is to be <hi>learned</hi> by Gods people, they are not to take out ſuch leſſons as the <hi>Wizards</hi> would learn them; nor their minds conſeqently to be poſſeſſed with ſuch frights and fears, as by telling them of the <hi>direful effects</hi> of the <hi>celeſtial Signs</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to work into them; to wit, becauſe theſe things among other were meer <hi>Heatheniſh vanities</hi>; and a moſt vain thing therefore to be affected therewith. For to the former <hi>way,</hi> muſt this <hi>vanity</hi> neceſſarily have reference, and that <hi>way</hi> to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits concerning the <hi>Stars,</hi> that produced ſuch fears with them, unleſs we will ſay of the paſſages of Gods Prophets,<note place="margin">Sveton. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>53.</hi>

            <p>And if Mr. Swan had inſteed of all this long diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>dreadfulneſſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Celeſtial Signs,</hi> and in what manner they were and were not to be feared, had but preached

to his people Mr. Lilies <hi>dictates</hi> and <hi>documents</hi> (and he might as well have preached them to them as the groundleſs conceits of Sir Walter Ralegh and others, tho of better note then he) to wit, that the horrible <hi>Eclipſe</hi> that was to appear the next day <hi>could do no harm to any that were about their uſual imployments</hi> of ploughing and carting, or hedging and ditching <hi>abroad,</hi> as ſome of his fellow Wizards had <hi>unadviſedly affirmed</hi> it might, but that it <hi>portended</hi> much ill, that either would or might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them ſome eight moneths after, or the yeer enſuing at that time twelmonth, or two year after: howſoever it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what effect it might have had with them, for the time of the <hi>Eclipſe</hi> preſent, for that the verie ſight of it, being a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and unuſual, might aſtoniſh them, as it did many other prepoſſeſſed with that fond conceit which Mr. Lilie himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, in regard whereof ſome hath related to me, that in ſome Countrey towns where they then reſided, not two of fourtie or more would either do ought themſelves, or ſuffer ought to be done by their ſervants abroad; and I remember that an ancient Doctor of Phyſik of prime note in the Citie coming over ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to Clapham to viſit a Patient, and being importuned to ſtay dinner with them, would by no means be perſwaded to condeſcend thereunto, there was he ſaid <hi>an Eclipſe of the ſunne to fall out that forenoon, and he would be at home before that ſhould come, and keep within till that was ever.</hi> Howſoever, I ſay therefore that for the time preſent it might affright them, yet for the latter part of the ſtorie, and the tale told them of evils that ſhould thence flow and enſue ſo long after, they would have eaſily ben induced to believ, that all ſuch tittle tattle were indeed no other then meer <hi>vanity,</hi> as the Prophet here pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it. Mean while ye ſee by what hath ben before delivered, what verdict the Spirit of God hath paſt upon theſe <hi>Chaldee VVizards obſervations</hi> and <hi>dictates</hi> about the <hi>Celeſtial Signs</hi>: and yet Mr. Swans main ſcope throughout this whole Sermon is to diſprove that which is here ſo peremptorily pronounced of them, to give the Holy Ghoſt the ly; to prove that they are not vanities,<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> but <hi>divine Oracles,</hi> condemning the wiſer ſort of the Heathen that ſet light by them, eſteeming of them what they ar here affirmed to be; and ſuch Divines as are likewiſe minded concerning them, as no better both, then men out of their wits,

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note>The firſt Weapon we find here darted againſt us, is from a word in rhe <hi>Text</hi>; which to make ſtrike home and pierce the deeper, is welded with the arm of Melanchthon, <hi>a great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Divine.</hi> The word in the <hi>Text</hi> is <hi>Signa, Signes</hi>; that is, the ſteel head of the pile or the ſpear, which hence hedded Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, and Mr. Swan from him thus enforces upon us. <hi>Non ait nihil eſſe Signa Coeli; imo cum nominat Signa, portendi aliqid affirmat.</hi> So preciſely Melanchthon, as Mr. Swan reports him; (for I have not the Book; and it is ſaid to be in a <hi>Preface</hi> to one of their Autors) who alſo thus renders him, <hi>The Prophet doth not ſay, they ſignifie nothing; (ar nothing,</hi> ſaith his Autor) <hi>Nay rather, in naming them Signes, doth declare that they ſometimes ſignifie, or threaten great and ſad things.</hi> that is ſomewhat more and ſomewhat leſſe too then his Autor ſaith. For his Autor ſaith indefinitely, <hi>in naming them ſignes he affirms, that</hi> (not <hi>ſometimes,</hi> but) <hi>ſomewhat is portended by them</hi>; that is, <hi>ſome ſad matter is threatned,</hi> as Mr. Swan renders the word of <hi>portending</hi> not amiſs.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54907:64"/>
But I demand of Mr. Swan, or of Mr. Swartert either; (for that was his Dutch name, until Luther cauſed him to exchange it for a Greek one) and tho Mr. Lilie when he hath nothing els to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Calvin in defence of his trade, tel us onely that <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, as grave a Divine, and more learned, as moſt hold</hi> (but who thoſe be I know not; compariſons are odious; and it might well be a meaſuring caſt between them) <hi>was a friend to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtudent in it,</hi> yet great names do not daunt us: I demand, I ſay, of either of them, is it of the very eſſence of a <hi>Sign,</hi> to <hi>portend</hi> or <hi>threaten</hi> ſomewhat? Some kind of language that Mr. Lilie uſes might a little help here; tho one of his <hi>axiomes</hi> would again hinder as much as the other had holpen. He told us that <hi>the darkneſſe portended in the Solar Eclipſe,<note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> would not be ſo great as ſome imagined.</hi> So that according to his language, ſomewhat <hi>preſent</hi> may be <hi>portended,</hi> as wel as ſomewhat <hi>future.</hi> But that is of the ſame ſtamp with that other of <hi>expatiating himſelf,</hi> and his <hi>penna ſtrutii,</hi> rendred a <hi>cock-ſparrows qil.</hi> I was taught when I was a ſchool-boy, from Servius <hi>on Virgil,</hi> that <hi>portendere</hi> was <hi>porrò tendere, to tend</hi> or <hi>reach forward</hi> to ſome <hi>further</hi> or future thing; as alſo that <hi>expatiari</hi> was a <hi>neutral deponent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 63.</note> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he tells us in his <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> that <hi>The application of Planets ſhews what is to come, the ſeparation what is past.</hi> So that there may be <hi>ſignes</hi> by Mr. Lilies grant, as well of things <hi>paſt</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> as <hi>to come.</hi> And indeed how many <hi>ſignes</hi> ar there ſo named and recorded in Scripture, that neither did, nor do <hi>portend</hi> ought, either good or evil to come.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rainbow</hi> was appointed by God to be a <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> of that <hi>Covenant</hi> which God made with Noa in behalf of the whole world, that it ſhould never be univerſally drownd again. Gen. 9.11, 12. Yet what future good or evil doth <hi>the Rainbow portend,</hi> ſo oft as it appears, to enſue ſhortly thereupon? nor let any imagine that it will ſuffice to ſay, that in the nature of it, it may conjecturally forewarn this or that, a ſudden ſhowr, or the like; the qeſtion being, not what in the courſe of nature it did or might either before or after foreſhew; but what by vertue of that uſe, that God then made of it, or power that he then imparted to it, to be a pledge of his promiſe and the performance thereof, which it yet retaineth unto this day, and in regard whereof it is ſaid to be a <hi>ſing,</hi> it is enabled to <hi>portend.</hi> In like manner God
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54907:65"/>
ordained <hi>Circumciſion</hi> to be a <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> that he made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his iſſue, either according to the fleſh, or according to the faith, Gen. 17.11, 13. Rom. 4.11. Yet did not <hi>Circumciſion</hi> therefore <hi>portend</hi> unto each one that was circumciſed, what ſhould betide or befall him either for good or evil, through the whole tenor of his life, either of it ſelf, or in reference to the day of the week on which, or the hour of the day in which he received that rite. Of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> it is ſaid by God himſelf, that it is a <hi>Sign between him and his people, that he hath ſanctified them</hi>; that is, ſeparated them unto himſelf. Exod. 31.13, 17. Ezek. 20.22. Yet did not each <hi>Sabbath</hi> in that regard <hi>portend</hi> ought in particular to fall out the week following; it having rather relation to the week paſt, that it concluded, then to that inſuing, as being another, a new week.

The like may be ſaid of thoſe other <hi>ſignes</hi> that God wrought in Egypt by the miniſterie of Moſes, the Frogs, the Lice, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, the Flies, the Hail and the reſt, Pſal. 78.43. and I ſuppoſe men may ſtrain the ſtrings of their wits till they crack, before they wil be able to ſhew, what thoſe ſeveral <hi>plagues</hi> did particularly portend;<note place="margin">Oper. <hi>Tom.</hi> 9.</note> albeit ſome have fondly applied them <hi>to the ten precepts of the Law,</hi> and have foiſted into Auguſtines works a ſapleſſe diſcourſe of that ſubject;<note place="margin">De Civit.

               </note> and others as frivolouſly would have them prefigure <hi>the ten primitive perſecutions</hi>; which Auguſtine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates indeed, but withall rejects as vain and ridiculous. The <hi>Suns ſtanding ſtill</hi> in Joſhuas dayes, Joſh. 10.12, 13. was it not a <hi>ſign,</hi> and a ſtrange one too? it furthered Gods people in purſuit of their adverſaries: but what further matter did it <hi>portend</hi>? The <hi>Miracles</hi> that our Saviour wrought, of which more hereafter, were they not <hi>ſignes</hi>? or ar they not ſo termed? Act. 2.22. And here by the way I ſhall make bold with my Reader to ſtep aſide a litle, to remove a common errour, by Mr. Junius in his <hi>Parallels</hi> before me obſerved. It is by the moſt conceived from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54907:65"/>
thoſe words of our Saviour. Matth. 12.39.40. <hi>There ſhall be no ſign given to this wicked and baſtardly race<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ask a ſign of me, ſave the ſign of the Prophet Jonas. For as Jonas was three dayes and three nights in the belly of the Whale, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> It is, I ſay, hence by the moſt generally concluded, that Jonas his being for ſuch a ſpace of time in the <hi>Whales</hi> belly, was a type intended to prefigure Chriſts abiding for the like time in <hi>the grave.</hi> But the context wel weighed wil ſhew, that no ſuch matter is therein intended. For look to the demand; and it will thence appear what the words of Chriſts anſwer thereunto do import. It is a ſaying of Auguſtine, that the man, who after the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſo at firſt by miracles confirmed,<note place="margin">De civit. Dei l. <hi>22.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> and ſince that by ſuch means, and in ſuch manner ſpred over the whole world, <hi>the whole World now believing, doth yet reqire a miracle that he may believ, may juſtly go for a miracle himſelf.</hi> Yet after that our Saviour had wrought ſo many and ſo great miraculous works, as that the Phariſees themſelves could not but be convinced in Conſcience, as one of them alſo ingenuouſly and freely confeſſeth, John 3.2. that he was no counterfait, nor one that wrought by the Divel, as they bore the people in hand, Matth. 12.24. but was a <hi>Prophet</hi> at leaſt ſent <hi>from God</hi>; yet ſome of them come to him, and crave a <hi>ſigne</hi> of him; by <hi>ſigne</hi> underſtanding as our Saviour, where he ſaid, John 4.48. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe ye ſee ſigns and wonders ye will not believe</hi>; not ſome <hi>type</hi> to be told them out of Moſes, as that of the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> John 3.14, 15. but ſome <hi>miraculous work</hi> at their reqeſt wrought then in their ſight, as Herod hoped to ſee ſome miracle done by him; Luk 23.8. But our Saviour putteth them off with a negative anſwer, telling them withal what manner of people they were that <hi>asked</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſigne,</hi> and that he would not at preſent ſhew any ſuch <hi>ſigne,</hi> but refer them onely to one that hereafter ſhould be ſhewen, and that juſt ſuch another as Jonas his was, ſuch an one as was ſometime wrought upon him. That which the Evangeliſt Luke delivers more cleerly, Luke 11.29. <hi>For as Jonas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was a ſigne to the Ninevites</hi>; not by <hi>typifying</hi> Chriſt, whom he preached not to them, out that which had befaln him, coming ſome way to their notice, &amp; being thereby aſſured that the meſſage he brought came from God,) <hi>ſo ſhall the Son of Man</hi> (Chriſt himſelf riſing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54907:66"/>
again from the dead, after part of <hi>three dayes</hi> ſpent in the grave) <hi>be a ſigne</hi> (no type, but ſuch a miraculous evidence ſufficient to teſtifie what he was, as no other ſhould need) <hi>unto this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yea and to the ages enſuing alſo; it being a far greater matter for him,<note place="margin">Avg. <hi>de temp.</hi> 174.</note> as ſome of the Ancients have well obſerved, <hi>De ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cro reſurgere, qam de patibulo deſcendere; to riſe up from the grave, then to come down from the croſſe</hi>; on which latter condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ingaged themſelves to believe on him if he would do it. Matth. 27.42. but tho more regarding his Fathers pleaſure, and our welfare, then their ſcoffing reqiries, he did not that, yet he did in ſteed thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a work much more miraculous, which he here ingaged himſelf to do.</p>
            <p>Ye ſee how many <hi>ſignes</hi> here of either ſort, and yet not one <hi>portending</hi> ought: and the weakneſſe conſeqently of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whither as Melanchthon himſelf delivers it; <hi>When he calls them ſignes, he affirms them to portend ſomewhat</hi>; which reduced to a Syllogiſm, muſt thus be framed, <hi>All ſignes portend ſomewhat, but theſe are ſignes. Ergò they portend ſomewhat.</hi> or as Mr. Swan delivers it, <hi>In naming them ſignes, he declares they ſometime ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie or threaten great and ſad things</hi>; which ſyllogiſtically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, muſt run on this wiſe; <hi>All ſignes ſometimes</hi> (for if ye give it onely, <hi>ſignes ſometimes</hi> the ſyllogiſm will conſiſt all of particulars, and be of no force or worth) <hi>ſignifie or threaten great and ſad things, but theſe ar ſigns, ergò ſometimes they ſo do.</hi> For whether way of the two we take it, the <hi>Propoſition</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly untrue in either. It is not of the nature or propertie of a <hi>ſign</hi> to <hi>portend</hi> ought; <hi>ſignes</hi> not a few do not, much leſſe <hi>to threaten great and ſad things</hi>: the contrarie whereunto by the inſtances above given doth moſt evidently appear.</p>
            <p>Yea but ſaith Melanchthon, <hi>the Prophet doth not ſay, they are nothing.</hi> Yes, he doth ſay, <hi>they are nothing,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe wherein the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that an idol is nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.4. that is, a thing of nothing, as good as nothing, of no uſe, no worth, no regard, no weight, for he ſaith, <hi>the ſignes,</hi> wherewith the Wizards affrighted them, ar meer <hi>vanitie</hi>: and that is as much as <hi>nothing,</hi> Eſay 41.29. I might ad, that it follows not, that they are <hi>ſignes</hi> indeed, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt uſes this term of them. For the Holy Ghoſts uſage is, to ſpeak oft of things, not as they ar in truth, but as men vainly eſteem of them, It were no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54907:66"/>
good Argument to proov Epimenides <hi>a Prophet,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith of him, <hi>One of their own Prophets,</hi> Tit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.12. or the Divel to be <hi>a God,</hi> becauſe the ſame Apoſtle calls him <hi>the god of this world,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.4. And again there are <hi>lying and fals,</hi> as wel as <hi>tru ſignes.</hi> 2. Theſ. 2.9. Nor will it take off the edge of this inſtance, to ſay, that the <hi>ſignes</hi> here ſpoken of, are called <hi>the ſignes of Heaven.</hi> which name Moſes alſo uſeth of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen. 1.14. (of which more anon) and that they are ſomewhat therefore. For were not <hi>the Sun, the Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Stars, the ſignes of Heaven,</hi> amongſt thoſe <hi>Idols</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of? and yet the Apoſtle ſaith of them, <hi>they ar nothing in the world.</hi> as they ar idolized they ar nothing; there is nothing worthy of any regard, much leſs of any divine worth in them, and in like manner the Prophet of <hi>the ſignes of Heaven,</hi> as they are by theſe Wizards abuſed to put people into fals fears, they are nothing but meer <hi>vanitie; lying ſignes</hi> void of all truth; or <hi>the ſignes of the lyers,</hi> as Eſay termeth them, Eſay 44.45. even like thoſe whoſe <hi>ſignes</hi> they are.</p>
            <p>And ſurely ſince that Mr. Swan himſelf grants that the Text ſpeaks of <hi>Astrological Predictions,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Chaldee Wizards</hi> then uſed; and the Prophet pronounceth thoſe he ſpeaks of to be very <hi>vanities</hi>;<note place="margin">Pag. 7.8.</note> I ſee not by what art or flight he will be able to keep them from coming within the verge of thoſe <hi>ſuperſtitious or lying vanities,</hi> as himſelf renders it; which the Pſalmiſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to abhor, together with all thoſe that regard, or <hi>hold of</hi> them; Pſal. 31.6, 7. more then <hi>ſalts falling towards one,</hi> or <hi>a Ravens croaking over one,</hi> or <hi>an hares croſſing the way before one,</hi> and the like; which fond fancies, together with thoſe that fear or regard them, he brings within compaſs of Davids doom, as both deſervedly worthy of deteſtation and hate.

They ſay Herodote made his <hi>History</hi> ſomewhat the more delightful, by ſtepping aſide <hi>to tel a tale or two</hi> now and then. Not long before my leaving of <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> in the reading time, one that had brought Mr. Reader veniſon, being an ancient man and one of ſome faſhion, was entertained with ſome other at Mr. Readers board; where ſom table talk falling in about <hi>Candlemas day,</hi> &amp; a word or 2 caſt out by occaſion thereof concerning the <hi>vanitie of ſuch obſervations,</hi> their old gveſt very ſagely told them, that he was <hi>a Keeper</hi> himſelf, as alſo had his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ben before him, and he had conſtantly obſerved ſo far as he was able to remember ought, that on <hi>Candlemas day,</hi> if the Sun ſhone out, and it were afaire day, the Deer (contrary to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſage) would keep cloſe in the covert; whereas if it were a cloſe and gloomy day, they would come abroad and be frisking upon the lawn; as preſaging that winter was in a manner gone, and litle hard weather behind, and that this had alſo ben obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his Father before him, as alſo by other <hi>Keepers</hi> as wel as himſelf. Now when I perceived this his relation to take with ſome of the company, and one among the reſt had paſt his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, that <hi>there might be ſomewhat in it</hi>: conceiving it no fit cours to debate any further by way of argumentation in the buſineſſe, I thought better as Socrates ſometime dealing with the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his time, to move a qeſtion onely to the Keeper (tho Mr. Lilie tax me for that cours, and would have puzzeling qe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions debarred from theſe diſputes.)

Again, neither is Mr. Swan able to make good what he here avows, and the contrary alſo to what he affirms, hath by others been averred, as formerly I have ſhewed.

            <p>But we wil admit Mr, Swans Verſion without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.

The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was a <hi>ſign,</hi> as was alſo <hi>the Temple,</hi> Heb. 10 1. but can it thence follow, that every <hi>loop,</hi> or <hi>tach,</hi> or <hi>pin,</hi> or <hi>ſtake,</hi> or <hi>ſocket,</hi> or <hi>cord,</hi> or <hi>curtaine,</hi> and the <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>bredth,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> of each, or <hi>coupling</hi> of them one to another, or <hi>distance</hi> of them one from another, or <hi>ſituation</hi> of them one againſt another, or <hi>taking</hi> of each <hi>down,</hi> and <hi>folding</hi> of it up when they were to remov. or <hi>unfolding</hi> of each again, and <hi>ſetting</hi> it <hi>up,</hi> when they were to make ſome ſtay, were all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſignificant alſo and myſterious? that men ſhould imploy their wanton wits (as it were to be wiſhed that ſome did not) in picking ſtrange matters and deep myſteries out of each of them.

What we find in Scripture noted as <hi>ſymbolical</hi> in it, that with good ground we deem ſignificant.

As for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations</hi> being meer contrivances of mans fancie, to what end ſoever at firſt framed, or to what other good purpoſe ſoever ſtill retained, for the better obſervation of <hi>the motions riſing</hi> and <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of each of them, and the diſtinguiſhing of them one from another, to mak <hi>myſterious ſignes</hi> of them, or attribute ought to them, in regard of ſuch Figures as mans fancy hath framed them unto, what can it be les then meer <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and a palpable abuſe of them? Can not the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars ſpeak unto us,</hi> unles they ſpeak unto us by al theſe particulars?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, do not the <hi>Stars ſpeak</hi> at all unto us, unleſs they ſpeak to us in <hi>the Wizards language</hi>? This is juſt like to the <hi>Patrones</hi> of <hi>Popiſh ſuperſtitions,</hi> and of that monſter more particularly of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>; who becauſe they find <hi>the Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood</hi> oft termed a <hi>Myſterie,</hi> and a <hi>great Myſterie</hi> in the writings of the Ancient Fathers, would thence conclude it to be a <hi>Miracle,</hi> or a <hi>miraculous Myſterie,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Myſterie</hi> as they would have it to be. For ſo doth Mr. Swan reaſon, and Mr. Lilie before him; <hi>The Sun, Moon and Stars ar ſignes: therefore Fortune-telling ſigns, foretelling the ruine of Kingdoms and States or ſuch ſignes as we Wizards will have them to be.</hi> But this is to reaſon <hi>a genere praedicato ad ſpeciem ſtatuendam, A Myſterie</hi>; and therefore a <hi>miraculous Myſterie? A ſigne; therefore a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious or portending ſigne</hi>: as if one ſhould thus reaſon; <hi>A man is an animal; and therefore a bruit</hi>: or, <hi>An aſſe is an animal: and therefore a reaſonable creature.</hi> And as we therefore anſwer thoſe <hi>Romiſh Factors,</hi> that <hi>the Sacrament of Baptiſme is a Myſterie, and yet not a miracle; the Element of water in it is mysterious, yet no miraculous matter. no ſuch eſſential change in the one, as from the word Myſterie they would infer in the other.</hi> So may we juſtly return the like anſwer to theſe <hi>Wizards</hi> and their <hi>Factors,</hi> that the <hi>Rainbow, Circumciſion, the Paſsover, the Sabbath,</hi> divers other were, and our <hi>Sacraments</hi> ar <hi>Signes</hi>; and yet neither ſuch <hi>prodigious</hi> or <hi>portending ſignes,</hi> as from this term

given them, or office thereby aſſigned them, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe to be.

            <p>But Mr. Swan proceeds to demonſtrate unto us, taking in Sr.<note place="margin">pag. 20</note> W.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54907:73"/>
them:) [Hence ſaith he, it comes to paſs, that in places where the preſent ſtate of things is apt to kindle into a combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there Mars being powerful in operation, doth ſometime ſow the ſeeds of War; or the Aire being out of tune by bad influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Planets, cauſes not onely many ſickneſſes, but ſtrange diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of minds, which breaking out into act, do many times di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb States, tranſlate Kingdomes, &amp;c. For when the Aire is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperately heated, then it is for certain very apt ſo to diſorder and drie up the bloud, as to breed much choler red and aduſt; this ſtirs up to anger, with thoughts of furious and violent actions; whence War, from War Victorie, from it change of Common-Weals, and tranſlations of Kingdomes, change of Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, New Lords, new Laws.</p>
            <p>Have we not an ocular demonſtration of whar was before ſaid, of the <hi>Power that the Stars have over Perſons and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Kingdomes and States?</hi> But I ſuppoſe we ſhall not need to borrow great Alexanders whiniard to cut this <hi>Gordian knot</hi> aſunder, any ſory whittle will ſerve the turn. In a word Sir, you beg ſtill the qeſtion, you preſume what you ſhould prov, that which you know is denied, and muſt ſtil be denied until it be proved, that the Stars <hi>have ſuch bad influences,</hi> that is, as before you explaind your ſelf, <hi>Powers and faculties ſtampt in them by God.</hi> Now this we deny, and for us to deny it, is enough. You that avow it, mvſt prove it. And this Mr. Swan will as well be able to prove, as Mr. Lilie his Client, that <hi>the good Angels told holy men ſo</hi>; or Mr. Johnſon his <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> that <hi>God told it to Adam.</hi> Now this barely denied, cuts clean away the dependance and conſecution of all that follows after and is inferred thereupon. Here therefore we might juſtly without more ado ſet down our reſt, and eaſe our ſelves of further labor: Howbeit to manifeſt the impietie of this groundleſſe conceit, and the frivolouſneſſe of theſe ſpecious pretences, we ſhall take a little pains to wade ſomewhat further in diſcuſſion of theſe their <hi>Aſſertions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, whereas Moſes tells us, and God himſelf by Moſes, that God at the firſt made <hi>all things good,</hi> yea <hi>very good,</hi> Gen. 1.30.

Now conſider we ſeriouſly, and ſadly withall, what an height of impietie this may raiſe up mens ſpirits, prone enough by nature to entertain and imbrace any conceit tho never ſo vain tending thereunto. For when any ſuch judgement in an exceſſe more then ordinary, of mortalitie, famine, war forain or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, ſhall befal a people, and Gods faithful Miniſters ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, as Paul thoſe at Corinth, 1.

What Engine more efficacious could the whole Court of Hell deviſe, to keep men from <hi>repentance</hi> for their ſins, when God by his judgements cals upon them for it then this? Which we may therefore deſervedly deem to have come out of the Divels Forge; for this end and purpoſe there contrived, by holding men in <hi>impenitencie</hi> to help to fil Hel.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54907:77"/>
had to ſay for it, was that <hi>He had received it from an ancient Phyſitian of long experience, and had himſelf found it very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful.</hi> and that is juſt as much as Maſter Swan hath ſaid, for the matter of <hi>Eclipſes.</hi>

Nor were it a hard matter indeed to fil up not ſome few pages, but <hi>many</hi> large folioes with inſtances of this Nature. But I will content my ſelf with a few, and thoſe out of one Autor, Rodolph Goclein the younger, (in whoſe ſteps Maſter Swan treades much) a ſtout maintainer of, and ſedulous practitioner in this pretended Art and Trade, as the like in other vanities of the ſame ſtamp with this. In his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranoſcopie,</hi> among many other, in the firſt place he preſents us with the <hi>geniture</hi> of a young man a Dane, that ſuffered death for a murther: <hi>That,</hi> ſaith he, having erected a Figure of his Nativitie, <hi>who could not but ſee, to be portended by the Stars, from the combination of Mars with a violent Star called the head of Algol? For the Luminaries having Mars mingled with the head of Meduſa</hi> (a Monſter which they have given a room in the Heavens) <hi>doth ſignifie according to our Aſtrological Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes,</hi> (which muſt paſſe for Divine Dictates) <hi>ſuch as ar to be beheaded</hi>: (not hanged then belike) <hi>and our jovial men could not prevail to ſave him, interceeding for his life, becauſe Jupiter was but weak in his geniture, and in an abject part of Heaven: nor could the VVomen, albeit they alſo aſſayed what they could, doe him any good, becauſe Saturn made the miſchief the more, being retrograde in the aſcendent, and Mars ſeated in his eſſential dignitie,</hi> &amp;c. An other <hi>geniture</hi> he gives us of an other murtherer. <hi>In this Mars,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>culminating in the Weſt with the Stars of Cancer, did ſtrongly ſignifie bloodſhed, and meeting his Horoſcope, did beſides murther to be committed by him, portend impriſonment for it, which for ſix Moneths he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained: yet for this Trigon of the Moon, Mercury, and Saturn
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54907:77"/>
and Jupiter then Lord of the twelfth Houſe, great Iovial men interceeding for him, he was at length ſet at libertie.</hi> But to let all the reſt paſſe, concerning his own geniture, whereof he hath drawn a Scheme, he tels us, that <hi>certain malignant Stars ſcituate in the Angle of the Earth, and afflicting the Moon in the qadrate Angle of the Weſt, did portend him great danger by ſlips and fals from aloft</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he adds, that accordingly he had had <hi>two grievous fals, whereby his feet were hurt</hi>; (ſome ſuch <hi>malignant Stars</hi> in likelyhood had Mephiboſheth in his <hi>Geniture.</hi> See 2.

            <p>But <hi>ſuch a one,</hi> Maſter Swan ſaith,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>he thinks was Pericles that great and famous Athenian.</hi> he ſhould rather have ſaid, that <hi>crackbraind fellow, one that wanted a little Hellebore to purge his brains, and that loved to play the fool with his own fond fancies and frumps.</hi> For ſuch they are among whome he ranks Pericles. for which his cenſure of him, ſome it may be will deem that himſelf may need as much Hellebore as all Anticyra will yield. The Story of him he relateth in effect as I have before delivered it in dealing with Maſter Lilie, the cloſe whereof is, that when upon a <hi>Solar Eclipſe</hi> falling out as he was ſetting foot on ſhipboard, the Maſter of the Ship was therewith much diſmaid, he caſt his cloke over his face a while, and then taking it away again, askt him [If he had <hi>ben ever</hi> a whit the worſe for ir: <hi>or, as Maſter Swan renders it,</hi> whether it portended ought, which the Maſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, no more ſaid he, doth this Eclipſe; <hi>or rather,</hi> there is no difference between the darkneſſe cauſed by the Eclipſe, and that which was cauſed by his cloke, ſave that there was a greater body between the Sun and his ſight in the one, then
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54907:79"/>
there was in the other.] Now howſoever Maſter Swan is pleaſed to taxe this in Pericles that noble and intelligent Greek, as <hi>ſurely an over bold preſumption</hi>; yet doth not Maſter Swans Sentence ſo peremptorily pronounced ſo aſſure me of the eqitie and reaſonableneſſe of it, but that I dare undertake the juſtification of him therein, and profeſſe my ſelf to be therein of the ſame mind with him, eſpecially had he put but ſome <hi>thick cloud,</hi> or the body of the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the room of his <hi>cloake.</hi> To which purpoſe, having ſome neighbours at Supper with me the evening before that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>Black Munday,</hi> when upon ſome ſpeech of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe,</hi> that was to fall out the next day, I perceived ſome of them ſomewhat fondly affected therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told them that there would be <hi>an other Eclipſe, within leſſe then</hi> 24. <hi>howers after it, that would be far greater then it, and would laſt at leaſt twice as long as it.</hi> Which when they wondred much at, I aſſured them it would ſo fall out, albeit that their <hi>Almanackes</hi> had tooke no notice, nor made mention at all of it. In fine, to put them out of their wonderment, I told them, [We were already then entred into ſuch an Eclipſe; yea had ſuch an one every night in the yeer. the one being no other then a depriving of us of the Sunne-light in part for a while by the intervention of the body of the, Moon paſſing between us and it; the other a depriving of us of the ſame Light totally, for a farre longer ſpace of time, by the interpoſition of the body of the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Sunne. And there was therefore no more matter of dread, or diſmall preſage in the one then in the other.]</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note>Yea but, ſaith Maſter Swan, <hi>the effects of this Eclipſe brought not onely miſerie upon his own Countreys and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon himſelf, but did put even all Greece under the ſad calamities of a long laſting war.</hi> And Maſter Lilie his Client begins his <hi>Dark yeer</hi> with the ſame obſervation. [It was (ſaith he) as wiſely as truly obſerved by the learned Thucydides, that ſome yeers before thoſe three and twentie yeers Peloponneſian wars of the miſerable Greeks among
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54907:79"/>
themſelves; wherein every Citie or Common-Weale of Greece, was in one kind or other engaged; that thoſe things which in former times there went onely a fame of, tho rarely in fact confirmed, were then made credible, by the enſuing wars of the Grecians one with another. the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of which qarels he ſayes were theſe; Earthqakes generally to the greateſt part of the World, and moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent withall, Eclipſes of the Sun oftner then is reported of any former times, great droughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Our firſt work here ſhal be, to rectifie the relation, and deliver the truth of the Storie. Thucydides therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to ſhew, that the <hi>War,</hi> which he intended to write of, was in divers reſpects not matchable onely unto, but even greater then any that had gone before it in Greece, whereof any record was extant, ſaith, that <hi>Poets</hi> by their <hi>Fictions</hi> uſed much to enhance the greatneſſe of thoſe <hi>Wars</hi> whereof they wrote; and <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> alſo themſelves oft times rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many things upon <hi>bare reports beſides the truth of the things reported.</hi> But thoſe ſtrange occurrents before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned made this Story the more remarkable, not that <hi>were fore runners,</hi> as Maſter Lilie renders him, or, as he ſaith, <hi>went ſome yeers before,</hi> that is but his own gloſſe; but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that did together with that VVar fall in or fall out,</hi> (for the Greek word will bear either, of Maſter Lilies notions neither) were not the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners,</hi> but the <hi>concomitants</hi> of it, or <hi>concurrent</hi> with it. But what do I talk to Maſter Lilie of Thucydides his Greek, who underſtands not ſo much as one of his own fellow Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards Latine, as hath formerly ben ſhewed. Now among thoſe things that fell out during the time of that War, or that <hi>fel in with it,</hi> ar reckned up, <hi>Solar Eclipſes</hi> more freqent then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: the more in likelyhood then obſerved in regard of the preſent ſtate &amp; condition of the times wherein they fel out; whereof a onely ar by Thucydides mentioned, the one in the <hi>firſt,</hi> the other in the <hi>eight yeer</hi> of that War; <hi>Earthqakes</hi>; whereof <hi>one,</hi> thar did much miſchief, in the <hi>ſixth,</hi> &amp; <hi>two</hi> other leſſe conſiderable in the <hi>tenth yeer</hi> of that War: <hi>droughts</hi>;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54907:80"/>
and <hi>dearths</hi> following them, now and then lightly touched. But one of the moſt remarkable Occurrents of thoſe times was <hi>a Peſtilential diſeaſe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which taking its riſe in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> fell down from thence into <hi>Egypt</hi>: then out of <hi>Africa</hi> ſtrook over into <hi>Aſia</hi>; whence croſſing the <hi>Midland Sea</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> it arrived at <hi>Athens</hi> in the <hi>ſecond yeer</hi> of that Warre; where it continued for <hi>two yeers</hi> in great force; and in the <hi>fifth yeer</hi> breaking out again, continued about a twelve-moneth; yet not ſweeping away ſo many as formerly it had done; the manner of it being by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, better diſcovered, and means of remedie and recoverie, accordingly deviſed and made uſe of with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Occurrents therefore, as appeares by Thucydides his expreſſe terms, ſeconded with his punctual Relations, were <hi>Comitants</hi> of that Warre; and <hi>fell within</hi> the limits of it, not <hi>forerunners</hi> of it, and that <hi>by ſome yeers fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,</hi> as Maſter Lilie, or the partie from whom he had it, do miſreport and belie that Noble Hiſtorian. But with the reſt of thoſe Accidents at preſent we have nothing to do, with the <hi>Eclipſe</hi> onely we now deal. <hi>The Effects whereof,</hi> ſaith Maſter Swan <hi>brought miſerie upon Pericles Countrey, diſhonour upon him, and the Calamities of a long laſting Warre upon all Greece.</hi> Where I might aske Maſter Swan what diſhonour it brought upon Pericles, who lived and died in high repute.</p>
            <p>It is true, that after the VVarre was begun between the two prime States in Greece, jealous either of others great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, having now found occaſions to picke Qarrels either with other, and the Spartanes having invaded the Attike Territories, Peticles perſwaded the Athenians to ſit qietly, fortifie the Citie, ſend out onely ſome to make light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, and intercept their ſtraglers, but to bend their main Forces by Sea to invade the Spartanes and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, which would make the Enemies Countrey the ſeat of VVarre, and enforce them to call home their Forces. To which purpoſe himſelfe in Perſon ſet out with a great Fleet:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54907:80"/>
And howſoever Plutarch ſaith, that in that Expedition <hi>he performed nothing worthie of ſo great a Preparation, nor did anſwer the Peoples Expectation</hi>; yet doth Thucydides a judicious VVriter, approove of his Advice; and affirms that he did more dammage and detriment to the adverſe Partie, by waſting their Countrey, before he returned, then to his Countrey men they by their incurſion had done. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the people indeed more ſenſible of preſent loſſe, then of future emolument, and of their private affairs then of the publicke concernment, the VVarre ſtill continuing, began to mutinie, and to exclaime againſt Pericles; the poorer ſort, in regard of the dammage they ſuſtained, and the difficulties they were driven to in retiring to the Cittie, the richer ſort, becauſe their Countrey Farmes were ſpoyled, underhand inciting the rude multitude to crie out againſt Pericles, as if through his evill advice they ſuſtained all that they ſuffered. VVhereupon by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor number of <hi>Votes,</hi> (for it was <hi>a Popular State</hi>) Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles was at the preſent put beſide his Command, and Fined in a great ſumme of money, which he inſtantly making no reckoning of it, did not unwillingly pay, but according to the mutable minds of the multitude, readie to turn to and fro as variably as either VVinde or Tide is wont, at a ſecond Court or meeting not long after was the ſame Pericles created <hi>the Commander in Chiefe,</hi> of all the Athenians Forces: in which Command he continued to his dying day; and ſo prudently mannaged the Affairs of that State, that Thucydides, tho a prime Man of a contrarie Faction, by Pericles prevailing exiled, and in that his Exilement writing his Storie, this part of it at leaſt, after Pericles his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſe, and no partiall Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeqently in his behalfe, ſticks not to affirme, that the ſwarving from thoſe courſes that Pericles had ſet on foot while he lived, by thoſe that ſucceeded him in place of Command, but not in Pollicie and prudent diſpoſall of Affaires, brought not diſgrace and diſhonour onely, but deſtruction upon divers of them, and utter ruine almoſt

Nor was Thucydides ſo ſelie as theſe men would make him, as to aſſcribe either the <hi>VVar</hi> it ſelf, or the continuance thereof unto ſuch occurrents as were but the <hi>concomitants</hi> thereof. Yea ſuppoſe we, that that violent <hi>earthqake,</hi> and that terrible <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> had both faln out before that war was begun. as it had ben abſurd to ſay of ſuch an <hi>Earthqake,</hi> or of any <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qake</hi> whatſoever, that it had by an innate efficacy produced that <hi>VVar</hi> that then enſued; or that any <hi>earthqake</hi> hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred faculty, by vertu whereof it is able to produce <hi>VVars,</hi> as <hi>drought</hi> doth <hi>dearth,</hi> yea and neceſſarily in the courſe of nature ſo doth: In like manner is it no leſſe abſurd for any man to attribute the like efficacie to that, or to any other <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> unleſſe he be able to render ſome reaſon as wel for the one as for the other.

night folowes the Sunſet, and day the Sunriſing, and to light upon ſuch people and places and perſons as theſe men have aſſigned them unto, without any regard of their doing wel or ill. For it is obſerved by Thucydides, that in that ſtrange infectious ſickneſſe, wicked wretches, when they ſaw that it ſurprized and ſwept away, as wel good as bad, all ſorts alike, they grew to this reſolution, <hi>Let us get what we can by hook or by crook, by right or by wrong, and make merry with what we have got while we may.</hi> and wil not men be prone to make the like inference from theſe Wizards principles? <hi>Theſe evils attend Eclipſes in as certain a courſe as the Eclipſes themſelvs come; and there is no means to eſcape or avoid them by any religious courſe or change of life, no more then by any ſuch courſe the coming of the Eclipſe it ſelf; and it is in vain therefore, whatſoever Mr. S.</hi>

with us denote the moſt <hi>unſeaſonable time of the yeer</hi> with us for <hi>diſtemper of heat,</hi> and infirmities in mens bodies proceeding from the ſame; whereas yet that affection ariſeth not from any power of the <hi>Dog-ſtar,</hi> of which that great Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian M.

            <p>But if all this wil not ſerve, which is all as light as a little thiſtle down or a feather, to infer or enforce ought that Mr. S. ſhould proov and would have, you ſhall have a convincing place, that wil hit the nail on the hed, and ſtrike all ded, and that out of the ſame Book, Job 9.7. where God is ſaid <hi>to ſeal up the Stars.</hi> And here indeed Mr. S. gives us the words of <hi>the Text</hi> aright: but with ſuch an expoſition, as neither he is able to prove, nor would at all avail him, albeit he could

make it good. The ſenſe of the place is, as plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, ſo as ready at hand, as is rain-water in a ſhower. Let the ſimpleſt man almoſt, of any the meaneſt underſtanding, read but the whole verſe; <hi>To the Sun he ſaith,</hi> (to wit, <hi>ariſe not</hi>) or, <hi>he ſpeaketh, and it ariſeth not: he alſo ſealeth up the Stars</hi>; and he wil eaſily and readily at the very firſt ſight ſee, that <hi>clouding</hi> and <hi>darkning, withholding</hi> or <hi>withdrawing of light,</hi> is intended as well concerning the <hi>Stars</hi> in the one branch, as concerning the <hi>Sun</hi> in the other: It is a plain parallel to thoſe places, Eſay 13.10. <hi>The Stars of Heaven, and its Ceſilim</hi> (the brighteſt of them) <hi>ſhal not give their light: the Sun ſhal be darkned in his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out: nor ſhal the Moon cauſe her light to ſhine forth.</hi> Ezek. 37.7, 8. <hi>I will cover the heavens, and make the Stars thereof dark: I wil cover the Sun with a cloud; nor ſhall the Moon give her light: all the lightſome lights of Heaven wil I darken over thee; that I may ſet darkneſſe upon thy land.</hi> and Joel 3.11. <hi>The Sun and the Moon ſhal be darkned; and the Stars ſhal withdraw their ſhining.</hi> It was to the very letter ſo in Pauls voyage from Jewrie to Italie; wherein <hi>neither Sun, nor Stars, for ſo many dayes appeered.</hi> Act. 27.20. To cite for this Interpretation a multitude of writers (which otherwiſe were not difficult) would be but a great deal of loſt labor, as much as to ſet up a torch or taper at cleer noon-day light, and to caſt ſome good ſtore of water into the Sea.</p>
            <p>But let us hear M. Swans <hi>expoſition. God,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note>

            <p>I will not preſſe Mr. S. to produce ſome <hi>Autors</hi> of note, that in this his <hi>expoſition</hi> concur with him. which yet if either the courſe of the <hi>context</hi> did back, or other <hi>Parallel</hi> paſſages of Scripture did ſecond, I ſhould not in that regard refuſe to admit and embrace.

We read in this very Book of Job in Elihues diſcourſe, Chap. 36.27, 28. <hi>Drops of water the clouds do dril, diſtil, and pour down abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi> And Chap. 27.10, 11. <hi>God in watering the earth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the thick cloud, and ſcatters the lightſome,</hi> or <hi>lightning, cloud</hi> as alſo in Gods own words to Job, Chap. 38.34. <hi>Canſt thou
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54907:85"/>
lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of water may cover thee?</hi> So Pſal. 77.17. <hi>The clouds poured down water.</hi> and Pſal. 147.8. <hi>who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth.</hi> and <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.3. <hi>When the clouds be full of water, they empty themſelvs upon the earth.</hi> and Eſay 5.6. <hi>I will command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it.</hi> But I no where find it ſaid, that <hi>the Stars pour down rain</hi>; or that <hi>the Stars are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to give it,</hi> or ſaid to be <hi>reſtrained from yeelding</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Interpretation</hi> therefore having no ſtrength at all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>the tenor of the context,</hi> or other <hi>paſſages of holy writ,</hi> cannot in reaſon be urged for ground of an argument. Nor again were it admitted, would it help Mr. S. or thoſe whoſe Advocate he is. For what manner of argument wil this be? <hi>God ſeals up the Stars, by keeping back the rain, from watering the earth: Ergò the Stars have a power to work upon the ſons of men, to diſpoſe them in their genitures, ſome to one vice, and ſome to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to expoſe them to caſualties of divers kinds, and to deſign them unto ſundry ſorts of ill ends.</hi> Would it not be, as they uſe to ſay, to reaſon <hi>a baculo ad angulum, from the cudgel to the corner</hi>?

And yet (which may wel be wondred at) M. Swans Arguments are moſt of them of the very ſame ſtamp, as if the one had taken them from the other. unto whom, leaving M.

            <p>But Mr. Swans <hi>inference</hi> from it let us hear too; as much to the purpoſe as M.

It is undoubtedly a ſtrong Argument of a weak and bad cauſe, that muſt be ſupported and born out with lies, with <hi>Solomon ſaith</hi> what he never ſaid, and backt with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Teſtimonies; and thoſe ſuch alſo, as being admitted to ſpeak, ſpeak nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note>Yea but, <hi>Adam before he fel, knew the nature of every thing; inſomuch that he gave names to all the living creatures.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeqently as much as ever Salomon did, and this <hi>Art</hi> of theirs among the reſt. which muſt needs therefore be good (for this ſeems to be that, which Mr. S. drives to) and <hi>we may lawfully
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54907:88"/>
ſeek by all good means what Salomon prayed for, and had, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of what was loſt in Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might demand, how Mr. S. can proove, that <hi>Adam knew the nature of every thing.</hi> his reaſon annexed will not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince it. his <hi>nomination of the creatures</hi> intimated rather his intereſt in them, and power over them, then an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the natures of them; of which we have diſcourſed more at large elſewhere. But if <hi>he knew the nature of every thing that he named</hi>; (for the reaſon ſubjoyned will reach no further,) and the <hi>Stars</hi> come not within that compaſſe; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be of the number of <hi>living</hi> creatures, as ſome both of the Jewiſh and Gentile Maſters have held; and of thoſe <hi>living</hi> creatures, that were convented before Adam, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, to be named by him, how is it hence proved that <hi>he knew the nature of the Stars</hi>? Again, ſuppoſe he did know the nature of them: what then? why? then he muſt needs be very skilful in our <hi>Wizards Art</hi>: and the art muſt needs then be very good. But to omit, that they preſume <hi>the nature of the Stars</hi> to be ſuch, as they pretend it to be; and Adam therefore knowing the nature of them, muſt needs know them to be qalified ſo as they ſay; which is nothing elſe but to beg the main point in controverſie. Might not Adam know it, and know it to be <hi>vain</hi> and frivolous? as God, who knew it undoubtedly, doth pronounce it here to be, Jer. 10.3. as he is ſaid <hi>to know the thoughts</hi> of wicked men, and withal <hi>to know them to be very vain.</hi> Pſal. 94.11. But if Adam knew this their <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Aſtromancie,</hi> as he knew the nature of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom he gave names unto, as Mr. S. ſeems to import, how doth Mr. Johnſon, another Maſter of that Science, but M. L. his antagoniſt and of the royal party, ſay, that <hi>God taught it Adam</hi>? for if he knew it before, what needed he be taught it? unleſſe we ſhal ſay, that Adam by his fall forgat all that ever he knew before: as the Jews fable, that whoſoever by ſtealth having gotten into the inmoſt receſſe of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the ſecond Houſe, had read the <hi>Fower-lettred Name</hi> with its Vowel-points there engraven upon <hi>a ſtone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Raymund. <hi>Pug. fid.</hi> part. 2. c. 8.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54907:89"/>
at the door of the Sanctuary ſet for that purpoſe, that they clean forgat what they ſaw or read there. But not unlike to theſe fancies is that of Mr. Ramſey, another bird of the ſame feather, who making up a liſt of the <hi>Patriarks</hi> of their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> begins, as the Autor of the ſacred <hi>Annals</hi> doth, with <hi>Adam, Seth, Enoſh,</hi> and ſo on; as if all the Holy <hi>Patriarks</hi> had ben ſuch <hi>Wizards</hi> as they profeſſe themſelvs to be. And the truth is, with as good reaſon as any that is by Mr. S. or M. L. with the reſt of them, here alledged, a man might prove that <hi>Adam and Salomon</hi> had <hi>ſkill</hi> in <hi>Palmeſtrie,</hi> and <hi>Metopoſcopie,</hi> and <hi>Geomancie,</hi> and <hi>Sorcerie,</hi> and <hi>Auſpicie,</hi> and <hi>Aruſpicie,</hi> and <hi>Inchantments,</hi> and <hi>Necromancie,</hi> and <hi>Witcherie,</hi> and approved all theſe ſuperſtitious and impious vanities, as that they did the like of their <hi>divinatorie Aſtrologie.</hi> for the <hi>Argument</hi> wil folow as firmly for any one of thoſe as for this.

Knaves have done abomination. for if we confound Arts with the abuſe of them, we ſhal in ſhort time obſcure and burie all kind of good lerning, and drown the world in ignorance; and that is juſt as the Devil would have it, that he may lead men about which way he pleaſeth.</hi>

            <p>But I would gladly demand a qeſtion or two of Mr. S.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Why he hath not folowed this advice himſelf; and why he hath laboured ſo eagerly throwout this whole Sermon, to diſſwade men from diſregarding, and checked them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and deriding that which the Prophet in the very next words to his <hi>Text</hi> pronounces to be meer <hi>vanity,</hi> and ſuch <hi>chaffe, droſſe and filth</hi> conſeqently as himſelf ſaith, ought to be <hi>purged away and caſt out?</hi> alſo why he hath not more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed himſelf whether he deem the doctrine of <hi>geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> ſuch as hath ben ſhewed, and courſe of profeſſing to <hi>tell by the Stars which way mens goods are gone,</hi> are of the <hi>chaffe and droſſe,</hi> or of the ſolid <hi>grain</hi> and pure <hi>oar</hi> of that praiſe-worthy <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> which in a confuſed generality he ſeems to maintain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What one ſound <hi>Argument</hi> he hath brought to proov thoſe practiſes which he pleads for, not to be <hi>chaff</hi> and <hi>traſh,</hi> and <hi>droffe,</hi> and <hi>dirt,</hi> that being reduced to the form of a <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm,</hi> wil not preſently appeer to be a meer Paralogiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Who thoſe be, that <hi>promiſcuouſly, and without difference or diſtinction, out of ignorance or over-nice ſcrupuloſity confound lawful and praiſe-worthy knowledge with that which is impious and diabolical, and condemn indifferently the one with the other.</hi> It is tru indeed that a German Biſhop ſometime in the days of deep darkneſſe by one of the Popes, is reported either out of ignorance or malice to have ben condemned of ſuſpition at leaſt of Hereſie, for the ſtudying of <hi>Aſtronomie,</hi> and holding a very ſtrange point, and dangerous error, that there were <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes,</hi> men living on the other ſide of the earth, and ſtanding or walking with their heels againſt ours. But did any of thoſe <hi>ancient Philoſophers,</hi> Anaxagoras, Eudoxus, Panetius, Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, Caſſander, and others that rejected this <hi>Aſtromancie</hi> or <hi>Fortune-telling Aſtrologie</hi>; or do thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Writers,</hi> that have profeſſedly handled this Argument either in former times, as Abulenſis, Picus and Savanarola; or of later times,

And indeed ſo palpable is the diſtinction between the one and the other, that even thoſe blincking and blundering <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> Papias and Balbus, that lived in one of the obſcureſt ages, wherein all good literature almoſt was buried in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, yet by that duskie twilight, that thoſe times afforded, were able to diſcry a difference between thoſe two above mentioned: whence that diſtribution in their <hi>vocabularia,</hi> as they termed them, annexed to their <hi>Grammars, Know,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that Aſtrologie, is partly natural, and partly ſuperſtitious: natural and tru, that handles the courſe of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the certain ſtations of the times: ſuperſtitious that which the Mathematicians folow, that divine by the Stars, dispoſing the</hi> 12. <hi>ſigns according to the ſeveral parts of ſoul or body, and by the courſe of the Stars foretelling mens nativitie, and their manners.</hi> which, tho ſomewhat rawly delivered by them, yet ſhewes that they conceived a <hi>diſtinction</hi> of theſe things; which the lerned in times of cleerer light, did both much more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend, and ever evidently expreſſe.

               <hi>Thus then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſee, that as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54907:94"/>
Dogs bark at them they know not, ſo ſome among men condemn and hate the things they thoroughly underſtand not.</hi> which ſatyrical ſnarling cenſure, I eſteem no other then as ſuch another <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Dog</hi> ſet over the <hi>Poſtern,</hi> as we before ſpake of, when we met with this <hi>Motto</hi> in the Frontiſpice before; and ſo let it paſſe, yet preſuming that ſome at leaſt of the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned who have oppoſed and condemned theſe practiſes, had as much skil and knowledge in the deep <hi>myſteries</hi> thereof as Mr. S. that doth maintain them. And for <hi>Scrupuloſities,</hi> thoſe that are any whit <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> concerning them, are like to find litle eaſe of their <hi>ſcruples</hi> from Mr. S. who is ſo far from giving ſatisfaction therein, that he may rather improov them, by ſuch reaſons as he renders for the condemning and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome other ſuperſtitious conceits, which (as hath ben ſhewed) wil hold as wel in the one as in the other, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeqently with eqal ſtrength conclude againſt either.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it be not <hi>juſt as the Divel would have it,</hi> ſo to blend theſe things the one with the other, to induce men to admire and ſwalow down both together? as with the tru wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and doctrine of Chriſt, he mingles many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious rites, idolatrous practiſes and erroneous conceits, ſuch as may eat out the very heart of ſound piety, and make the profeſſion of Chriſtianity a meer matter of formality, a ſhel without kernel, a ſhadow without ſubſtance, a title with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out truth, that under pretence of the one he may draw on the other. Nor are men to be blamed, becauſe they refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive both <hi>promiſcuouſly without diſtinction,</hi> as Mr. S. would here have us to do in the Doctrine of <hi>Star-Divinitie.</hi> Wil he needs enforce us, becauſe we like wel of the <hi>wine,</hi> to drink up the Dregs too?</p>
            <p>For as for his fear of <hi>burying all good lerning, and drowning the world in ignorance, by condemning of lawful Arts together with the abuſe of them.</hi> (as Saravallius ſometime charged Sixtus of Sene as <hi>an enemy to all good Arts,</hi> becauſe he averred <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> to be <hi>no Art,</hi> but a <hi>fallacie, and a deteſtable impoſture</hi>) there is no ſuch matter intended, nor fear of danger thence to enſu, by diſcovery of abuſes in <hi>Arts</hi> and in the practiſe of them, or of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> falſly pretended to be ſuch, when as indeed they are no other then cheating tricks, having no matter of

ſound <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> truly ſo termed in them. far was it from thoſe good Chriſtians their intention to <hi>bury,</hi> or <hi>burn, al good lerning,</hi> that made a <hi>bonfire</hi> (we may well ſo term it) of thoſe their <hi>books</hi> of ſuch ſuperſtitions at Epheſus, Act. 19.19. And ſo far is it from that which Mr. S. would herein intimate, that the oppoſing and rejecting of theſe fanatical and ſuperſtitious fancies ſhould either ariſe from <hi>ignorance,</hi> or endanger the bringing in of <hi>ignorance,</hi> much leſſe <hi>drowning</hi> the <hi>world in it</hi>; that ſuch frivolous conceits and ſuperſtitious practiſes have ben never more rife, then in times of ignorance, and when the world was drownd in darkneſſe; whence it is, that ſince the light of Gods ſaving truth and knowledge hath ſhined more cleerly among us then among moſt abroad, and the ſtudy of <hi>Arts and Sciences</hi> in theſe later times ben improoved and flouriſhed with us, this <hi>pretended Art,</hi> or <hi>cheating Trade</hi> rather, hath lien till of late, ſo neglected and diſregarded among us, that Mr. Lilie is enforced pitifully to complain, (would to God we were ſo happy,<note place="margin">Preface to Eng.

And if it be demanded how we may here diſtinguiſh the one from the other. Mr. S. himſelf gives us a good <hi>rule, negative</hi> at leaſt, tho given for no great good end; where, to encite men to <hi>dive</hi> as far as they can into the <hi>depths</hi> of this <hi>ſtudie,</hi> he tels them,<note place="margin">Pag. 22.23.</note> 
               <hi>It is a thing wel worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that by the underſtanding the uttermoſt activitie of Natural Agents, we are aſſiſted to know the Divinity of Chriſt; the works he did being thereby underſtood, to be beyond the terms and limits of Natural Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>a good rule,</hi> I ſay, in the <hi>negative,</hi> tho not in the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative. It is not conſeqent, that whatſoever a creature in his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt activitie of natural power is able to do, that he ſhould do.</hi> For it is not neceſſary that a creature in working ſhould alwayes put it ſelf out to the utmoſt of his natural power. elſe the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> would be good, <hi>A lazie man doth no more then as if he were aſleep</hi>: therefore he can do <hi>no more then he does.</hi> or, <hi>A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe frend, tho preſent, ſtands a man in no more ſteed, then if he were abſent: therefore he can do no more then he doth.</hi> But in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> it holds wel, for <hi>what the creature in its utmoſt activitie cannot do, that without miracle cannot be done.</hi> And this very conſideration furniſhes us with a weapon of ſteel to diſpatch that moſt frivolous and fabulous conceit of a <hi>Solar Eclipſes working ſuch diſmal effects ſo long after it is over,</hi> as Mr. S.<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> before informed us. for if it be <hi>beyond the uttermoſt activity of the total interception of the Sun-light for divers howrs from us,</hi> by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power to produce ſome diſmal effect <hi>a ſevennight,</hi> or <hi>fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or a month after,</hi> then undoubtedly it is much more <hi>above and beyond the uttermoſt activity of the interception of the Sun-light for a far ſhorter ſpace,</hi> by its natural power to produce the like diſmal <hi>effects, a twelv-month or two after.</hi> No wiſe man, I think, wil deny <hi>the truth of the Antecedent,</hi> and no reaſonable man, I ſuppoſe, wil deny <hi>the neceſſity of the Conſeqence.</hi> If Mr. S. imagine he may, when he ſhal afford us his reaſon, if it appeer to be ſound, I ſhal begin to make doubt, whether I were in my right wits, or had any reaſon within my brain-pan, when I writ this.</p>

thereupon, not onely that our Saviour was to be <hi>born of a Virgin,</hi> becauſe <hi>the firſt face of Virgo was then aſcending,</hi> whoſe proper image is <hi>a Virgin nurſing a Child</hi>; but that alſo he ſhould be both <hi>a Preiſt and a Prophet,</hi> becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi> was then <hi>in the ninth Houſe,</hi> and <hi>in the Sign of Gemini</hi>: (whereas yet, ſaith the L. Howard, their great Baſſa Abraham the Jew is of the mind, that <hi>whoſoever finds Saturn at his birth ſo conſorted, ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proov a good Chriſtian</hi>) and that he was to <hi>ſuffer a violent and bloudy death,</hi> becauſe <hi>Mars</hi> was then <hi>in the houſe of death.</hi> In which both his calculations and obſervations upon them, although that Honorable Perſon control him, as miſtaken in the one, nor folowing the principles of his own Patriarks in the other: yet let them go for currant, be they right or wrong in either: it being nothing to the particular that we are now upon. Onely thus much, that if theſe grounds be firm and ſolid, we may through Cardanes miſreckoning miſſe of the aſſurance of our Saviour: and whether his reckoning be right or no, we may come to have many Saviors, that is, many ſo peculiarly qalified, as he was, who was alone to be our Savior; ſince that it is ſcarce imaginable but that ſundry ſhould be born in divers places at or about the ſame inſtant in which the <hi>Virgin</hi> his <hi>Mother</hi> was delivered of him, and conſeqently under the ſame ſituation of <hi>the Stars</hi> at his birth.</p>
            <p>To this may be added that, whereas there are two univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and moſt miraculous deſtructions of the whole World, the one paſt by <hi>Water,</hi> the other future by <hi>Fier</hi>; there want not thoſe addicted to this pretended <hi>Star-divinitie,</hi> that attribute either to <hi>the Stars.</hi>

            <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>THus ſaith the Lord, Learn not the way of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>] Becauſe the Jewiſh people, were a great party of them to go into captivity into Babylon, and other the regions adjacent, yea, many of them in likelihood were there in captivity already, (See ver. 11. Chap. 24.1. &amp; 29.1, 2.) God by the Prophet endeavoureth to confirm and ſtrengthen them, the pious eſpecially among them, (for ſuch alſo there were there of them, Chap. 24.5. Ezek. 11.16.) againſt thoſe ſuperſtitions and vanities that were rife in thoſe parts; and they might be in danger, being exiles and captives in a ſtrange land, to be ſtrongly tempted unto: Heb. <hi>Learn not to the way</hi>: where either the particle is ſuperfluous, omitted therefore, Pſal. 106.35. Chap. 12.16. or elſe it may be rendred, <hi>Accuſtome not your ſelves to the way of the heathen</hi>; and ſo ſome render it; <hi>do not imitate them,</hi> See Chap. 9.5. their <hi>way</hi>; that is, their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious courſes, Lev. 18.3. &amp; 20.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>and be not diſmaied at the ſignes of heaven</hi>] The firſt head of ſuperſtitions, which he beginneth with, is <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> a ſtudy and practice ſo rife among them in thoſe parts, Eſay 47.13. that the profeſſors and practiſers of it, not with them alone, Dan. 2.2. &amp; 5.7. but among other nations alſo, are generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the name of <hi>Chaldeans</hi>; See Strabo l. 17. Cicero of <hi>divination,</hi> l. 2. Pliny l. 6. c. 26. <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> I ſay, not that which we commonly term <hi>Astronomie,</hi> whereby the true nature and motion of the celeſtial bodies are by grounds of reaſon, and rules of art thence taking their riſe, enqired into, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but that <hi>Judiciary Aſtrologie,</hi> as it is uſually ſtyled, whereby men take upon them, from the poſtures and aſpects of them, to foretel the iſſu of humane affairs, either publike, or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54907:99"/>
private, and what caſual events, ſhall befal either perſons or people: a practice grown of late with us into great eſteem, being either countenanced or connived at, by thoſe in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with us, tho having entred themſelves, and cauſed others with them, to enter into a religious bond of a ſolemn oath and <hi>covenant,</hi> to endeavor the <hi>extirpation</hi> of all thoſe things among us, that are <hi>contrary to ſound doctrine, and the power of godlineſſe,</hi> whereof this is none of the leaſt. For the original whereof, (ſince it hath not, nor can be ſhewed to have any ground from the light of nature, or natural reaſon) we ſhal not need to go far to find it out: We have a blind, but inſolent, buzzard (I may wel ſo term him) among us, one that profeſſeth himſelf no ſmall Doctor in theſe impoſtures, and dotages (wherewith he hath bewitched not a few with us, eſteeming his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as no other then divine oracles) and taketh upon him by the Stars, to ſteer the affairs of our State, pretending <hi>to read in the Book of Heaven,</hi> all that he writes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who will ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us herein. Now this man, to juſtifie the warrantablenes of this his practice, telleth us, that <hi>the good Angels of God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, at firſt by perſonal conference, acquainted the ſons of men with this learning of the Stars</hi>; and <hi>thoſe holy men,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo inſtructed, living many years, and in purer airs, where they curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved the Planets and their motion, brought this Art to ſome maturity, without the leaſt hint of ſuperſtition.</hi> But <hi>as the ſons of men fell from God in divine worſhip, ſo in flitting and ſhifting their habitations, they forgat the purer part of this art; and in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries added ſuperſtitious conceptions.</hi> The holy Angels then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like by this mans relation, did at firſt inform thoſe holy men, which they could not otherwiſe have known, of the nature of the Planets; to wit, that <hi>Saturn</hi> was <hi>a melancholick malignant</hi> planet, <hi>Mars, a cholerick and litigious</hi> one, <hi>Mercury, a theeviſh, Venus, a laſcivious and wanton</hi> one: and that they do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affect and diſpoſe ſuch people, or perſons, as are either bred under them, or whom they have ſpecial relation unto. For theſe, and the like ridiculous fopperies, and impious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations of thoſe glorious creatures, are with them, as the Popiſh <hi>Purgatory</hi> with the Papiſts, the main grounds and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their whole Art, which being taken away, the whole fabrick and frame of their ſuperſtitious ſuperſtructures, will
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54907:99"/>
preſently fail and fall flat to the ground; as with thoſe other, all their maſſes, dirges, obites, pardons, and indulgences, if you deny them their Purgatory; which becauſe they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no clear Scripture for, they run with theſe men to their forged revelations. But whence theſe frivolous conceits, and irreligious ſurmiſes concerning thoſe celeſtial bodies, (which if you queſtion, you ſhake the ground of all their conjectural skil,) had their original, may wel be conjectured from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry names, the heathen impoſed upon them, being borrowed from their counterfeit deities, whom they deemed ſo qualified: aſſure our ſelves we may, that Gods holy Angels never raiſed any ſuch foul aſperſions and groundleſſe defamations, upon thoſe pure and ſpotleſſe creatures, far from, and wholy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any tincture of ſuch vicious diſpoſitions. But all that this man relateth, we may if we pleaſe, and be ſo ſelie as ſo to do, take upon his credit; for he telleth us not what times thoſe were, wherein it was thus, or who thoſe holy men were, unto whom the holy Angels at firſt revealed thoſe things; or out of what records he hath theſe relations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch pretended revelations. And as litle reaſon have we, to engage our faith to his Antagoniſt, another fowl of the ſame feather, that flieth yet ſomewhat higher then he, and pretending <hi>his predictions, to be grounded on Art and Nature,</hi> telleth us (that we may not miſ-doubt or queſtion his Art) that <hi>this art was deduced from God to Adam, to Seth, to Abraham</hi>; for proof whereof, he referreth us to a Knight of note, for his ſtudies in this kind; who in favour indeed of this Art, which he was overmuch addicted to, and beſotted with, affirmeth in part what he ſaith, but bringing no better proof of it, then a tale out of Joſeph the Jew, who in his <hi>Antiquities</hi> l. 1. c. 3. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that <hi>thoſe of Seths iſſue living long and without diſturbance, gave themſelvs to the ſtudy of heavenly things, and the conſtitution or adminiſtration of them; and becauſe Adam had foretold, a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold deſtruction of the world that ſhould come, the one by water, the other by fire; they left the ſumme of what they had, of that kind of learning obſerved, engraven on two pillars, of brick the one, of ſtone the other</hi>: but neither is any word in the Jew, of this their <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Aſtrologie,</hi> nor of any skil in this kind or any other by God
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54907:100"/>
imparted unto Adam, which they yet father upon him: and the whole relation of the <hi>two pillars</hi> ſeems as tru, as that which he addeth of the continuance of the latter of them in Syria unto his time. And indeed, if any ſons of Adam ever had any ſuch immediate communion, either with God himſelf, or his holy Angels, it muſt be thoſe Ancient Patriarks, Abraham, Iſaak, and Jacob, and thoſe Prophets of God among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; unto whom God uſed ſometime immediately, ſometime by the Miniſtery of Angels, to impart his mind, concerning future events, as well publike, as private: but no where in Scripture read we, that God did this, either by the natural courſe of the celeſtial ſigns, or, as from thence to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; nor undoubtedly had any ſuch art and skil, been taught the godly ones among Gods people, whether by God himſelf, or his Angels; would they either have concealed it from them, or much-leſſe committed it unto Paynims, and Pagans, and by ſuch, have tranſmitted it unto poſterity, for from ſuch in corrupt times, it crept in among Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet ever among them liable to cenſure; nor was any in the Ancient Church, that had profeſſed ſuch arts, admitted into the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, unles that firſt they renounced thoſe damnable practices, and recanted ſuch their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceits. But men may eaſily gueſſe what Angels they were, that acquainted men at firſt with theſe things, and ſet them on work, to buſie their brains about ſuch matters, as neither light of nature, nor grounds of reaſon, were able to inform them of, but muſt have ſome revelation; either Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or Angelical, or Diabolical rather, for the finding of them out. So far are God himſelf and his Prophets, from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice hereof, as ſome ſuch heavenly diſcovery, or giving any approbation thereunto, that God by them ſometime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideth it, Eſay 44.25. &amp; 47.13. and ſometime diſſwadeth and condemneth it, as an heatheniſh practice, not befitting his people to heed; as here, ſo elſewhere, Deut. 18.10—14. From the Prince of the air therefore, it may juſtly by this mans own grounds and grants, be deemed to have proceeded; at firſt by him taught the heathen that were ruled and ſwaied by him; and from them, together with the worſhip of them in their
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54907:100"/>
dols, conveyed unto Gods own people: For what of further obſervation he ſubjoyneth; to omit, that thoſe ridiculous principles muſt firſt be made good, ere any obſervation can be grounded upon them: the like did the Heathen Magicians report of their charms, and other ſuperſtitious divinations by the flight of fowls, and from the bowels of beaſts; to wit, that obſervations had been made of them, for many hundreds of years. See Pliny l. 28. c. 2. and this and thoſe may well go together, one with the other, unto him, that was the firſt founder of them, <hi>the father of lies,</hi> Joh. 8.44.</p>

Howbeit, ſigns there are of two ſorts; firſt, natural, and ordinary, the Stars themſelves being ſet in the skie, to diſtinguiſh the times and ſeaſons of the year; to which may be added, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of them one with another, or oppoſitions of them one to another, whence the Eclipſes of ſome of them at ſome time do proceed; and theſe are thoſe ſigns, which coming in a conſtant courſe, and continued tenor, (in regard whereof men skilful therein, are able either going backward, to tel how it hath been with them for thouſands of yeers paſt, or looking forward how it will be for as many, if the world it ſelf ſhould ſo long continue:) God would not have his people to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or affrighted with, as if in regard of them, or from them, any evil in the ſucceſſe of their affaires could betide them: other <hi>ſigns</hi> there are extraordinary, in dreadful appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, beſides the ordinary courſe of the creature, by which the Lord doth ſometime give notice unto his people, of his diſpleaſure, and warning of enſuing wrath; and theſe God doth not inhibit his people to be affected with, and taking of them unto heart.
