            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the time that the Ieſuites, my liege L. are buſy with our K. I held it my duety to ſhew readynes to combate with them. And becauſe the Apocalyps revealeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual wrath of God vpon Rome for killing of Chriſt as was told by Balaam, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. I made two Engliſh Commentaries vpon that book: one brief, to ſhew the harmony of the viſions: the other large: ſhewing how God in one word lappeth the whole tenour of Romes badnes. Becauſe it is not fit for me to ſteale a victory: I would make two Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaryes moo: in tongues which the Pope is bound to vnderſtand: one in Ebrew vpon an Ebrew tranſlation: an other in Greek vpon Iohns owne ſtyle. The Hebrew would yeeld this commodity. The Apocalyps in two ſorts draweth all the law to it. It ſheweth Chriſt from all the law and prophets: and the curſe of Rome from all the old curſed ſince the ſerpent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Eve. This cannot be ſo well done in any tongue as in Ebrew: as Iohn tranſlateth Ebrew moſt ſtrictly: and this would winne millions of Iewes, which grone to be taught. Sr Iohn Forteſcue of honourable memory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Hebrew books which I printed vpon myne own charges, told the meſſenger co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently, that he would obteyn of the K. a very great ſtipend to go forward. But the very aged honourable gentleman was prevented by death: that the K. might ſhew himſelf willing of himſelf: in his enemies cauſe: that the Pope may be known of all Iewes that he is the taile of the old Dragon. So both Iewes and Papiſts ſhalbe together here benefited. Yea and Turks too. Of which argument I may here lay down part of a letter of the Lieger at Conſtantinople, written to M. Richard Stapers merchant. Theſe be his words.

            <p>I was at Baſil when the Iewes letter, and the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours came to my hand: and I printed the Iewes letter: and others in Ebrew to Archb. Whitgift, and in Greek to the reſt of the Biſhops. And when they deſpiſed the cauſe: they and the like ſped never the better: and vpon myne own charges I printed, and ſcattered books. I wiſh your Maieſties charges to clear all the Bible ſo. And this much for Hebrew handling of the Apocalyps. Now for Greek. The Caeſars wickednes ſhould be told briefly: whereby they are ſo hatefull to God: from Greeks, beſt in their own tongue: and the Popes continuall trechery to overthrow the Eaſt Empire, ever ſince great Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine left hated Rome: and I would expound in Greek all the Apocalyps for Graecia: and choſe out of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries all that is good.
