         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

ADVERTISEMFNT TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Treatiſe hath been written ſeveral Years and kept cloſe, becauſe the Government would not bear ſuch Prints, and might ſtill have lain ſnug, but that I daily ſee great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by various Prints and Pamphlets, caſting falſe gloſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a good Cauſe, deſigning to bring us back to Onyons and Garlick, and to Popery, the worſt of Tyranny. Among which Prints the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> at firſt view, ſeems to carry in it's Front for its better countenancing of <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> the moſt flouriſhing ſhew of our <hi>Articles, Injunctions, Canons, Homiles, Liturgy, both our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, Biſhops, Martyrs, Confeſſors,</hi> &amp;c. Which at firſt view preſents a wonderful and an amazing cloud of <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> ready to confound the <hi>Doctrine of Reſiſtance and Defenſive Arms</hi> without farther Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to make good that enſlaving <hi>Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience abſolutely abſolute without reſerve,</hi> of which I ſhall make but one or two plain Remarks, leaving the reſt to better Pens. 1. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Quotations to be true, yet are they to be underſtood of <hi>private Men,</hi> and of <hi>private Authority only,</hi> and not of <hi>Ordines Regni,</hi> States, and Kingdoms, and Commonwealths. 2. <hi>Calvin,</hi> though quoted in this Hiſtory as an Aſſertor of ſuch <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> of which he Treats very Learnedly, giving it all its juſt Allowances and Dimenſions, yet concludes, notwithſtanding all thoſe ſpecious Expreſſions which ſeem to favour Paſſive Obedience, <hi>That he is to be underſtood always ſpeaking of private Men: For if there be at this time any Magiſtrates for the behalf of the People, as the</hi> Ephori <hi>amongſt the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>or</hi> Tribunes <hi>at</hi> Rome; <hi>as the</hi> Demarchi <hi>at</hi> Athens; <hi>or the ſame Power alſo, which peradventure as things are now, the</hi> Eſtates <hi>have in every Realm when they hold their Dyets, Parliaments, principle Aſſemblies; he doth not forbid them according to their office to withſtand the outragious licentiouſneſs of Kings. And farther he affirms, That if they wink at Kings wilfully ranging over and treading down the poor Commonalty, their diſſembling is not without wicked breach of Faith, becauſe they deceitfully betray the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the People, whereof they know themſelves to be Protectors, appointed by the Ordinance of God.</hi> Calvin, Inſtit. lib. 4. c. 20. par. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58061:4"/>
Likewiſe his Quotation of Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> in the Chapter of the Bounds of Chriſtian Obedience, will ſerve his turn as little as that out of <hi>Calvin;</hi> for in the ſame Chapter, <hi>p.</hi> 929. it being objected to him by the Author of the <hi>Prince and Prelate,</hi> That many beſides the Separatiſts and Enthuſiaſts, many of note in reformed Churches have publiſhed in writing, that Kings and Princes may in ſome caſes be depoſed; which, ſaith Dr. <hi>Jackſon, if ſpoken univerſally, their Doctrine is falſe; and for ſuch condemned by our Church, if thus they taught indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only, as that ſome Kings, ſome chief Magiſtrates may be depoſed, he knows no Church that juſtly condemns them: But for Divines to determine or diſpute what Princes in particular may be depoſed, or in what caſes, is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without their Commiſſion, unleſs commanded by their Princes,</hi> p. 927. And I think he knew the Doctrine of this and other Churches as well as the Author of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>So Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> explains St <hi>Paul and himſelf</hi> in the very ſame Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>viz.</hi> That whoſoever ſtriketh with the Sword by <hi>private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> ſhall periſh with the Sword; which Opinion, if rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is the ſenſe or meaning of all, or moſt, of this Hiſtorians <note place="margin">

Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> (how ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever repreſented by this Hiſtorian) was as profound a Scholar and Divine as ever ſate upon that See: in his Book of <hi>Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and Unchriſtian Rebellion,</hi> treats of nothing elſe but of <hi>Paſſive Obedience and Non-reſiſtance</hi> at large, and no Man better or more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly in defence of them, yet will not raſhly pronounce all that reſiſt to be Rebels. <hi>If a King ſhould go about to ſubject the Kingdom to a Foreign Realm</hi> (which happily is not much diſſimular to our preſent conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tranſactions) <hi>to change the Form of a Commonwealth from Impery to Tyranny or neglect the Laws eſtabliſhed by common conſent of Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to execute his own pleaſure: in thoſe and other caſes, if the Nobles and Commons join together to defend their Ancient Liberties, Regiment and Laws, they may not well be accounted Rebels,</hi> (very modeſtly expreſſed) <hi>p.</hi> 520. And more at large to the ſame purpoſe may be read in ſeveral places of this Book; which Opinion of theſe great and learned Men, are a juſtification of the preſent Tranſactions of our <hi>Ordines Regni,</hi> who have ſo conſiderable a ſhare in the Government, that no Law can or ought to be made without them. And I may truly ſay, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that thoſe very Authors (being all of the Hiſtorians own quoting) have written as profoundly and ſolidly for <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> as it will bear, or that all his other Quotations do or can make out: And Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> that great Scholar and Divine, printed his Book 1585. and dedicated it to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of ever bleſſed Memory, whoſe happy Government was ſuch, as ſhe did not think ſuch Reſiſtance unlawful, and therefore ſhe ſoon promoted him to be Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Anno 1595. and ſoon after, <hi>viz.</hi>

Beſides, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did not only approve the publication of ſuch Doctrines in her Government, but being willing to avoid the Curſe, that <hi>bitter Curſe of Meroz,</hi> on her and her Kingdom, ſhe gave this farther Teſtimony and Demonſtration, by her owning and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing ſuch Reſiſtance, and by her en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſure this Hiſtorian will not deny, that the <hi>Queen,</hi> and her <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> and <hi>Convocations,</hi> were true Church of <hi>England</hi> Men: ſo he may make it the <hi>Corner-Stone,</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing Character,</hi> if he pleaſe, of a true and of a mungril Church of <hi>England</hi> Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if he do, I doubt he will approve himſelf no <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> no true Church of <hi>England</hi> Man. To what then doth all this <hi>Bravado of Articles, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Homiles, Liturgies,</hi> &amp;c. tend? but to the beſpattering of the pureſt Church in the World with ſuch Doctrines as ſhe is no ways guilty of, and to introduce and uſher in <hi>Popery</hi> again, which was ruſhing in upon us with a mighy torrent by the ſlight of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicating wits that lay in wait to deceive, until his Majeſty did <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare ſe magiſtratu:</hi> but thanks be to God we are not ſuch Children, as to be toſſed to and fro, and carried away from the Truth with ſuch cunning Craftineſs.</p>
            <p>Happily King <hi>James</hi> I. if conſulted, may be found to favour the ſame Opinion, when in his Speech in Parliament 1603. <q>declares himſelf to be a Servant, and that as he was Head and Governor of all the People in his Dominions, who were his natural Vaſſals and Subjects, conſidering them in Number and <hi>diſtinct Ranks;</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:58061:5"/>
conſidering the whole People as one Body and Maſs, then as <hi>the Head is ordained for the Body, and not the Body for the Head,</hi> ſo muſt a righteous King know himſelf to be ordained for his People, and not his People for him: and therefore profeſſeth, that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be aſhamed to confeſs it, to be his principal Honour, to be the Servant of a Commonwealth, and ever to think the Proſperity thereof to be his greateſt Felicity. And in his Speech at <hi>White-hall, Anno</hi> 1609. <hi>March</hi> 21. ſaith, That every juſt King, in a ſettled Kingdom, is bound to obſerve the Paction which God made with <hi>Noah</hi> after the <hi>Deluge;</hi> therefore a <hi>King</hi> leaves to be a <hi>King,</hi> and degenerates into a Tyrant, as ſoon as he leaves off to Govern by his Laws: as the poor Widow to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> Either Govern according to your Laws, <hi>Aut ne Rex ſis.</hi> Therefore all <hi>Kings,</hi> that are not Tyrants or Perjured, will be glad to bound themſelves within the limits of their Laws: And they that perſuade them to the contrary are Vipers, and Peſts, both againſt them and the Commonwealth.

            <head>AN ADMONITION TO ALL Chriſtian EMPERORS, KINGS, PRINCES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ALL <hi>Emperors, Kings, Princes and Governors,</hi> ought moſt ſeriouſly to conſider, That tho' by the Providence of God, and good will and choice of Men, they are ſet on high, yet they are <hi>not Kings and Lords and Princes</hi> in their own right, and in ſuch manner as that they are not obliged to acknowledge a Superior Dominion. What are they but <hi>Vaſſals to God,</hi> by whoſe Providence they hold their Crowns and Scepters, Lives and all, by fealty and homage? And what are they but <hi>Adminiſtrators and Truſtees of the Governed,</hi> to ſee the Laws made by them indifferently and equally exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for the Peace and Happineſs of whole Kingdoms? And who knows not that in recompence of their Care and Pains, that this is one of the chief Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Laws of Subjects, that they do <hi>Support their Kings and Governors,</hi> and that they keep Fidelity with, and pay Tribute, Reverence, and Service unto them? So ſtrict is this Obligation, that in all caſes of danger Subjects are bound to aid and aſſiſt them, and to yield all the Duties of Honour, Friendſhip, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Reſpect, and to take up Arms on their behalf, againſt their very Bretheren and Children, and <hi>to pay them Tribute for their Grandeur and Support:</hi> where Faith and Honour are concerned, an Eternal blemiſh will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on the violation thereof. If they offend their Kings by unjuſt contrivances, and blemiſh their Dignity and Honour by unjuſt aſperſions; if they plot, contrive and wage War unjuſtly againſt them; if they deſert them in a time of danger; if they treacherouſly conceal any that endeavour to kill, impriſon, or damnifie them, if they do not deliver them when in danger, if it be in their power to do it, they are then guilty of Treaſon. Seeing therefore <hi>Kings</hi> require ſo much Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity from their Subjects, for defending their Perſons, States, and Dignities, (who are but Men on both parts) in how much greater Obligations, and under what ſeverer Penalties are Kings themſelves bound towards the giver and bequeather of their Crowns and Scepters, for the defence of his Kingdom and People, againſt all Rebels and Traitors to his and their Laws. But ah the miſery of human blindneſs! All Princes are ready to cry out, that when any Man becomes guilty of ſuch breach of Faith towards them, it is a Crime unpardonable; and that it muſt be puniſhed with the loſs of Goods, Lives, and Eſtates. Men to Men ſtill. But when they themſelves break Faith, plighted to <hi>God and Men by Solemn Oaths,</hi> and do things ten thouſand times worſe, againſt their Supreme Lord and Maſter, and the Governed; yet ſuch is the wonderful perverſe ends of their Judgment, that they imagine themſelves to be innocent and unaccountable: Whereas by right they ought to hazard and ſpend their own Lives and Scepters in Defence of his Glory, from, and under whom they hold thoſe Lives and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and for Defence, Support, and well Governing of the Governed, that they may live in Wealth, Peace, and Godlineſs, they being the Church of God, whoſe Nurſing-Fathers and Mothers, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> and all other <hi>Rulers,</hi> as <hi>in duty

bound of right ought to be;</hi> more eſpecially, if they confer Honors, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Places of Profit, on any of their Subjects (Prerogatives given them even by the Governed) if they ſay not as they ſay, and do not obey all their Commands right or wrong, what a huff and Fuſtian fume are they in? What? eat of their Bread, drink of their Drink, and live at Eaſe, and in great Plenty and Pleaſure, by their Favors and Graces beſtowed on them, and yet ſo ungrateful as not to ſubordinate their wills to the wills of their Princes. Which ariſes from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature and their own great miſtake. For <hi>Kings themſelves,</hi> and all their Officers, are the <hi>Kingdoms Officers,</hi> cloathed with their Fleece, warmed with their Wooll, fed with their Bread, their Oyl, and their Wine, and paid with their Tribute: And is it not much more ſinful and ungrateful in them to do violence, or oppreſs any of them? Do they not Dig and Delve, Plow and Harrow, Sow and Reap, Plant and pull up with the labour of their Hands, and ſweat of their Brows? and all this to pay them Tribute, that they may live in great Glory and Plenty; that they may <hi>eat the Fat, drink the Sweet, lie upon the Soft, chant to the ſound of the Vial, drink Wine in Bowles,</hi> that they may be <hi>gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly clad, and fare deliciouſly every day?</hi> Is it not therefore much more abominable, wicked, and ungrateful in them, to oppreſs or violate the Laws of them that ſet their Crowns on their Heads, and maintain them in all their Glory and Exceſſes, not only for neceſſity, but for delight? Conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelves, whilſt you are yet on this ſide the Grave: <hi>(For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome, in the grave,</hi> Eccl. <hi>9. 10.)</hi> And all your <hi>Pomp muſt be brought down to the grave, even Lucifer, the Sun of the morning, who did weaken the Nations,</hi> how <hi>did he fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and <hi>was cut down to the ground?</hi> Iſaiah <hi>14. 12.)</hi> That you cannot op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Governed without being guilty of Ingratitude (the vileſt and baſeſt of Crimes) in the eſteem both of Heathens and Chriſtians, and by the practice even of Bruits and Beaſts. Firſt, Gratitude is natural (and therefore ungratefulneſs muſt be unnatural) witneſs Beaſts themſelves, not only tame and domeſtick, but even wild and cruel; among whom there are many excellent and true examples, as <hi>of the Lyon towards the</hi> Roman <hi>Slave. &amp;c. Officia etiam ferae ſentiunt:</hi> even wild Beaſts are ſenſible of good and evil done unto them; by which it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to gueſs how unnatural, how unpleaſing and odious, how baſe and villanous Ingratitude is unto all Men; <hi>quatenus</hi> Men only. <hi>Dixeris maledicta cuncta cum ingratum hominem dixeris:</hi> thou ſpeakeſt all the evil that may be ſaid of a Man, when thou calleſt Man ungrateful: It is againſt Nature, and therefore <hi>Plato,</hi> ſpeaking of his Diſciple <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> calleth him <hi>an ungrateful Mule:</hi> it is without all excuſe, and cannot come but from a wicked Nature. So <hi>Seneca, Grave vitium intollerabile quod diſſociat homines.</hi> A grievous vice and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, which breaketh the Society of Men. If by the inſtinct of Nature, and the examples of Bruits, unreaſonable Creatures, Ingratitude be ſo vile a Crime, that it becomes a reproach to Men, as being reaſonable Creatures, how much greater reproach is Ingratitude in Men as Chriſtians? God's Commands are, <hi>Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you, that you may be children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh the ſun to riſe on the evil and the good; and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> Matth. <hi>5. 44, 45.</hi> So <hi>Luke 6. 27, 35. for he is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil.</hi> So ought all Kings and Rulers to love their People, though Enemies, out of gratitude they owe to God, who hath both commanded us ſo to do, and whoſe daily practice it is. How doth God upbraid and reproach the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>Jews! Hear, O heavens, and give ear O earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken: I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me: the Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib; but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider, &amp;c. Iſaiah 1.</hi> What
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58061:6"/>
Reproaches and Woes are pronounced againſt thoſe ungrateful <hi>Jews,</hi> for whom God had done ſo much <hi>(when</hi> Iſrael <hi>was a Child then God loved him, and taught</hi> Ephraim <hi>alſo to go, taking them by the Arms, drew them with Cords of a Man, with Bands of love, and was to them as they that take off the Yoak on their Jaws, and laid meat unto them,</hi> &amp;c. Hoſ. <hi>11.</hi> All the Prophets teſtifie throughout the whole Bible that Gratitude is the univerſal Precept and Command of God himſelf, and he is the Avenger of all Ingratitude and Diſobedience: <hi>Do you thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?</hi> Deut. <hi>22. 6.</hi> God is ſo gracious as to let <hi>the Sun ſhine on the Juſt and on the Unjuſt, to requite good for evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ought Kings then as his Miniſters, his Vicegerents, not to requite evil for good, but good for evil? How much more are Kings then obliged to God and Man by their greater Obligation to keep Faith and Covenant with their People, who chooſe them from among themſelves to be their King, ſetting them on Thrones in a more Eminent and glorious Station and Figure above all themſelves, paying them all the Enſigns of Honour, Duty, and Majeſty, giving them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Tribute to ſupport the ſame? What to do? to tear them with Thorns and Briars, or whip them with Scorpious, or grind their Faces as many have done; no, no, but to have their Laws run in their Names, and executed by legal Powers in their Names, that Juſtice might be equally and indifferently adminiſtred to all: They claim and glory in the Title of being <hi>Gods Vicegerents</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and therefore their Miniſtrations ought more eſpecially to be for the happineſs and Salvation of their Kingdoms; if otherways, know, <hi>that God will cut off the Spirit of Princes, he is terrible to the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. <hi>76. 12.</hi> and in his due time <hi>will relieve the oppreſſed and afflicted.</hi> If we make dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and exact Scrutiny into other Relations of human and civil dependencies, our Judgments may be aſſiſted for the more clear apprehending of truths of Government, wherein we ſhall find ſome obligations between them ſo ſtrictly enjoyned, that they cannot be violated without the brand of Impiety, as between Parents and Children, Husband and Wife, Maſter and Servant, <hi>Col. 3. 18, 19. 20, 21, 22. Job 31. 13.</hi> between whom, although by the Laws of God and Man there be many reciprocal Duties; yet are they nothing if weighed in a juſt Ballance, in compariſon to what Kings themſelves owe to God and the Governed, who are alſo <hi>the Church of Chriſt:</hi> for what ever injury is done to a <hi>Chriſtian Commonwealth,</hi> is at the ſame time done againſt the <hi>Church of God,</hi> whereof Chriſt is Head, and King, and thoſe whom we call Kings thereof are but his Subſtitutes, and Vicegerents, and ought to govern as he hath commanded, and as he will do when he ſhall come again in Glory to reign on Earth. Beſides they are conſtituted and ordained by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, under Conditions, Covenants, and Agreement; not that themſelves may live at eaſe only, and command, and rule at Pleaſure, but as Gods Vicegerents, and as Truſtees and Adminiſtrators of the Governed, to rule and govern accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his and their own Laws <hi>(quas vulgus eligerit)</hi> for what a madneſs ſhould we esteem it in human Affairs, if Deputies, Viceroyes, and Lieutenants of Earthly Kings, ſhould for their own private ends and intereſt prefer them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Honour, Glory, and Service of their Kings. They who ſo adminiſter Affairs, take not right meaſures of their Maſters Glory, and the Peoples good, but comply with the flatteries of their own Luſts, their particular Advantages, ſinful Ends and intereſts, or hatred, furiouſly tranſporting them to the publick ruin, <hi>privati Commodi vel odii pertinacia in publicum exitium ſtimulante.</hi> Tacit. lib. <hi>1.</hi> hiſt.

Tho you will neither turn nor repent, yet how ſhall I give thee up?</hi> So deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is he of his Peoples Repentance, that <hi>he beſeecheth them till he is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of repenting,</hi> Jer. <hi>15. 6.</hi> even paſſionately with Oaths doth he expoſtulate with Sinners, his great Enemies, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the Wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die?</hi> Ezek. <hi>33. 11.</hi> Would ye would but conſider the price and value of this his fondneſs, you wovld never harraſs his People as you do; God <hi>himſelf thought it worth the Incarnation of his own Son,</hi> by <hi>ſending him out of his own boſom: and ſo the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> Joh. <hi>1. 1.</hi> of which God gave abundant and ſignal Teſtimony, when <hi>he ſmote</hi> Egypt <hi>in their Firſt born, and brought op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi> Iſrael <hi>from among them, with a ſtrong Hand and ſtretched out Arm, and divided the Red Sea into parts, and made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to paſs through the midſt of it; but overthrew</hi> Pharoah <hi>and his Hoſt in the Red Sea; who led his people through the Wilderneſs, and ſmote great Kings, and ſlew famous Kings,</hi> Sihon <hi>King of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>and</hi> Og <hi>King of</hi> Baſhan, <hi>and gave their Land for an Inheritance, even an Heritage to</hi> Iſrael <hi>his Servant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them from their Enemies,</hi> Pſal. <hi>136.</hi> Thus hath God done, and thus will God do when he ſhall ſtand up in the <hi>quarrel of his Covenant,</hi> and ariſe to ſhake terribly the Earth: The whole Hiſtory of the Bible is full of ſuch exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſhments, and of frequent delivery of his oppreſſed People. And as God, ſo ought all his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> to be tender and watchful over all their Governed. So <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom <hi>Philo</hi> reckons among <hi>Kings,</hi> as doth the Scripture, Deut. <hi>33. 5.</hi> And he was <hi>King in</hi> Jeſurun; for tho he had not the name, yet he had the Power and Authority; yet even in that Power he was no more Regal then in his Tenderneſs over the People, which was ſo great towards them, that at <hi>Tabera,</hi> becauſe he could not do them ſo much good us he deſired, <hi>he beſought the Lord to kill him out of hand,</hi> Num. <hi>11. 15.</hi> At another time he was ſo concerned with the fear of their deſtruction, that <hi>he requeſted of God, either to forgive them their ſin, or to blot him out of the book of Life,</hi> Ex. <hi>32. 32.</hi> hereby ſhewing himſelf, not only the <hi>Miracle of Nature,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> calls him, but of Grace too, in plighting for them that which was more worth than his life, his very Salvation. So tranſcendent is the Example of <hi>David,</hi> who (beſides that he urgeth it in moſt Pſalms, <hi>the peace of Jeruſalem, the ſalvation of Iſrael, the Felicity of Gods choſen, the bleſſing of the people) wreſtled with God near the threſhing floor of</hi> Araunah, <hi>(2</hi> Sam. <hi>24 16, 17,)</hi> for his mercy and favour towards his People, that he cries out, <hi>It is I, even I that have ſinned and done this evil, &amp;c. let thine hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me and my Fathers Houſe, but not on thy people, that they ſhould be plagued, 1</hi> Chro. <hi>21. 16, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider yet farther, how paſſionately fond <hi>God (who is jealous even to fury for the good of his people) hath demonſtrated himſelf for his People,</hi> over whom he hath made you his <hi>Vicegerents.</hi> Did he not ſend his own Son out <hi>of his own boſom, to take on him the form of a ſervant, and to become o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient unto the ſhameful death of the Croſs, both for them and you?</hi> Can Kings then imagine, that if they oppreſs them by violent perverting of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Judgment, or multiply unjuſt Exactions, or chaſtiſe them with Whips or Scorpions, that they ſhall eſcape unpuniſhed? I tell them nay, that except ſuch Kings that ſo tyrannize, do repent, the time will come that they ſhall bemoan themſelves in vain, when <hi>their groans ſhall be as the groans of a deadly wounded man, and their hopes as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> Was not Chriſt our Common Purchaſer?

juſt Rights and Liberties, by condemning many more Righteous than your ſelves to Inquiſitions, Goals, Gallies, to beg their Bread in ſtrange Countries; Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with Whips and Scorpions, and with divers ſorts of Tortures, as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous as tearing their fleſh with the Thorns and Briars of the Wilderneſs: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, I ſay, well with your ſelves, and that in very good earneſt, (it being your trueſt Intereſt, and of everlaſting Conſequence, whilſt you are on this ſide Hell and the <hi>Grave, in which there is no wiſdom.)</hi> How contrary do Kings, Tyrants, act and govern to God Almighty, whoſe Precept and Practice it always hath been, and ſtill is, <hi>to do good for evil, and not evil for good,</hi> as all Tyrants do. Hath he not mitigated the rigour of the Law, which was once publiſhed <hi>with thunder, fire, tempeſt, and darkneſs, by removing the curſe from it, as it was a killing Letter, and Miniſtry of death? And hath he not publiſhed it in the hand of a Mediator?</hi> Doth he not woo us by his Spirit, tho we reſiſt it?

            <p>In the Kingdom of Inſidels, who have no right knowledge of God, nor of his Laws, the Supreme Law is only the ſafety of the Civil State, and its Temporal Happineſs: but when a Gentile State becomes Chriſtian, then conſequently it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes alſo <hi>a Church;</hi> whereby it loſeth nothing which it had before but acquires a new Perfection by accrument of Divine Powers added to the Civil; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a greater Duty incumbent on the Governors thereof, to ſeek and procure the Welfare and Happineſs: Such Kingdoms, ſo united and ſo interwoven, are in a more ſpecial manner the Inheritance and Kingdoms of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which his Father gave him as the Purchaſe of his bitter Paſſion; <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſalm <hi>2. 8.</hi> And Chriſt doth imbrace the Glory of this his Kingdom, ſo incorporated, with ſo much more tenderneſs and affection, than the Pomp and Pride of all earthly Kingdoms, as that he threatneth thoſe Kings, Nations and Kingdoms, that will not ſerve him, <hi>ſhall periſh and be utterly waſted,</hi> Iſaiah <hi>60. 12. Speak every man truth in his heart to his neighbour: execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: therefore love the truth and peace,</hi> Zechar. <hi>8. 16, 19.</hi> are Divine Oracles, and ſhall challenge Obedience from every Individual; but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and eſpecially, they ſeem to have reſpect unto thoſe that ſit at the Helm, that execute the Judgment of Truth and Peace in the Gates.</p>
            <p>It is, no doubt, as great a fault to be ſilent when one ought to ſpeak, as to ſpeak when one ſhould hold his peace: ſins of Omiſſion being no leſs dangerous than ſins of Commiſſion. I think I do no diſ-ſervice to the Publick, or tranſgreſs the duty of Honeſty or Loyalty, if I endeavour by Pen to ſet the Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a ſure and right Foundation, when I ſee daily ſo many falſe Principles, exorbitant Powers, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naccountableneſs, attributed to Cheif Magiſtrates, as may make very Saints to tranſgreſs in Government, that happily otherwiſe would not; and theſe not Written by vulgar Pens only, but Preached and Printed by Miniſters of the Goſpel, that they might be delivered with the better grace and greater authority, though not without moſt palpable wreſting of Scripture to wrong ſenſes and purpoſes; which in Miniſters of the Goſpel is the more abominable: <hi>but God ſhall cut off all flattering lips, and tongues that ſpeak proud things,</hi> Pſalm <hi>12. 3.</hi> There are ſo many Sermons full fraught with ſuch Principles, that they who are eſteemed the Governors of our Church cannot be ignorant of them; yet they, (whom it moſt concerns to take notice of true and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>falſe Doctrines) being ſilent, (which ſeems to argue conſent) hath encouraged me to put Pen to Paper, to aſſert the truth. It ought not to be imputed as a Crime to any, who bring the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Princes, Popes or Prelates, to the Touch-ſtone of Truth. Truth, (though it begets hatred to the Aſſerters thereof, yet) like the Sun, is a publick good, which neither exempteth Princes, Popes, private Men, no, nor Angels, from her Laws. I have followed, as near as I can, the Beams of that Sun, by adhering cloſe to true Principles of Nature, of Reaſon, and of Scripture: If any Light I have given hath diſcovered falſe Gloſſes, or Truth from Error, no reaſon to quarrel either with the Truths themſelves, or with the Aſſertor of them. <hi>Truth, ſeaſonably ſpoken, can hurt no Body.</hi> If falſe Principles are cenſured and adjudged by Divine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58061:9"/>
by Laws of Nature and Reaſon, and diſapproved by Chriſtian Religion, be pleaſed or diſpleaſed who will, it matters not, the care is taken; It <hi>being more than human Tyranny, to deprive Faith and Truth of Tongue or Pen</hi> for <hi>their Defence:</hi> where <hi>Truth maketh no diſtinction of Perſons, I dare not; I only condemn what ſhe doth,</hi> without reſpect had to Perſons great or ſmall, if they claſh with Truth, or endeavour to obſcure her brightneſs. To aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Truth, is no point of Arrogance; and to ſearch for Truth when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, is the beginning of Charity; and to aſſert it with conſtancy when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, is the conſummation of Charity; and to walk in the Light thereof, is the beginning and conſummation of Happineſs. For who can be more bleſſed than he who enjoyeth Truth in its Excellency, Conſtancy, and Immutability? I am not ignorant, that Fear, Honour, and Reverence are due to Magiſtrates, but more to Truth; <hi>for God is Truth.</hi> Nor is it Reverence, with baſe flattery, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant blindneſs, to hide the publick Blemiſhes and Miſcarriages of the Actions of great Men. No, no, it's downright flattering Profaneneſs, diſſembling and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the Truths of God. It's much more Chriſtian Honour, to declare them with Chriſtian Charity, and reprove them with Chriſtian Modeſty. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart: thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin to fall upon him,</hi> Levit. <hi>19. 17.</hi> whether he be of a great or little Figure in the World, it matters not. <hi>Go tell Judah of her ſins, and Iſrael of her tranſgreſſions,</hi> be who will pleaſed or displeaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. By which it appears, that though Reproofs and Admonitions have been the Duty of every perſon from the very beginning of Religion <hi>(Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, ſpare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet,</hi> (proclaim defiance, ſound a challenge, and charge againſt them;) <hi>ſhew the people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins,</hi> Iſaiah <hi>58. 1.)</hi> yet they are ſeldom or never acceptable; but on the contrary, get hatred to thoſe that diſcover their <hi>Dalilah's,</hi> their boſome ſins: but their comfort is, that by reproving, they fulfil God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, <hi>and he that hateth reproof erreth, is bruitiſh, and ſhall die,</hi> Pro. <hi>10. 1. 15.</hi> Pro. <hi>12. 15.</hi> Pro. <hi>10.</hi> A moſt ſtrange and unhappy temper, to return hatred for good will, to hate thoſe that ſhow the greateſt kindneſs that poſſibly mortal Man can ſhow: <hi>he that regardeth reproof ſhall be honoured, and is prudent,</hi> Prov. <hi>13. 18.</hi> Pro. <hi>15. 5. He that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own ſoul: but he that heareth reproof, getteth underſtanding,</hi> ver. <hi>32. As to deſpiſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and ſpeak evil of Dignities, is a great Crime, to be puniſhed by the Judges; ſo there is a wo to them who call evil good, and good evil; that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs,</hi> Iſaiah <hi>5. 20.</hi> Wherefore if they whoſe immediate Duty it is to tell <hi>Judah</hi> of her Sins, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of her Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, will by a ſinful compliance be ſilent, or daub with untempered Mortar, not daring to declare plain Truths; which is <hi>tant à monte,</hi> a tacite giving conſent and countenance to publick Sins and Injuries, by ſuch their connivance and diſſimulation: I hope they will not blame thoſe who dare call Vices by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names.</p>
            <p>I am ignorant of ſuch quirks of Conſcience, which ſo much injure Juſtice and Piety, as by ſuch perverting the plain Truths of Religion, and prevaricating with God Almighty, by pleaſing Men rather than Truth, as if both might not, and ought not to ſtand together; as if a due reſpect to Men, even to great Men, and a juſt cenſure of Sin and Wickedneſs, might not juſtly be maintained. So that if any thing in this preſent diſcourſe ſeem more harſh or ſevere than uſual, it is intended againſt the Vices and Abuſes of the Powers, not againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor any juſt Powers. If they are Truths that I have declared, I ought not to be blamed; if Errors, they'l eaſily be diſcovered and refuted, and the greater Truth will appear. If I have committed Errors, and injured Truth, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of my own Infirmities; and that Reaſon is ſeldom ſo perfectly reduced to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but that I and all others may be miſtaken: <hi>Humanum eſt errare.</hi> Let

            <p>In ſumm, All the Glory of Kings and Kingdoms ought to ſerve God, (by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſly, by countenancing the Faithful of the Land, and not ſuffering the Wicked to influence their Councils, and by walking wiſely in a perfect way, and by <hi>hating the Works of them that turn aſide,</hi> and by not ſuffering thoſe that have high Looks and proud Thoughts,) as being made choice of by him to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in his Kingdom, as <hi>Nurſing-fathers of his people,</hi> Iſaiah <hi>49. 23.</hi> God, bleſſed for ever, who ſetteth up Kings, and removeth them, doth only love the Principality and Kingdom of his own Eternity, and himſelf continually addeth to the Glory and Enlargement thereof, but willeth and expecteth the ſame from all Kings, Princes, and Governors of Temporal Scepters, to do the ſame, and that under ſevere Menaces and Penalties.

For as God (who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the only Monarch of the World, and whoſe underſtanding is infinite) in the Government and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this inferiour World, deſigned his own Glory, together with the Good and Salvation of the whole Race of Mankind; ſo he expects ſubmiſſion and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience unto his Laws, Statutes, and Judgments</hi> from all Kings, Princes, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, as his Miniſters: <hi>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings, be inſtructed ye Judges of the Earth, and ſerve the Lord with fear</hi> in all your Adminiſtrations according to the purport of his Laws, and for the ends deſigned, leſt the ſad Fate of <hi>Solomon</hi> betide you, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 11. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt not kept my Covenants, and my Statutes which I have commanded thee, I will ſurely rend thy Kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy ſervant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Now without all peradventure the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is the beſt and moſt equal Law, and moſt fit to be imitated; which being ſtrictly obſerved, nothing can be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any body, and what every one hath is his own for ever: For as thoſe who preſide over Celeſtial Bodies are bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and juſt minds and Spirits, and every one doth moſt juſtly govern his own Body; ſo Nature being derived from thoſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour juſt Souls, keepeth the moſt juſt and equal order in all her actings, which ſhe makes known to all the World. Now the nearer all human Laws do come to the Laws of God and Nature, the more certain and the more glorious muſt their way of living be, who live and are governed by ſuch Laws. Unto theſe Laws had thoſe ancient Law-givers reſpect, which eterniz'd their Names and Memories famous to all ſucceeding Ages: Above the reſt are celebrated the Laws of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> by <hi>Licurgus;</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Solon;</hi> of the <hi>Locrenſes</hi> (a Town in <hi>Italy)</hi> by <hi>Zalencus;</hi> of the <hi>Thurii</hi> (a City in <hi>Greece)</hi> by <hi>Garondas;</hi> of the <hi>Getae</hi> (a People of <hi>Scythia</hi> in <hi>Europe)</hi> by <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molxis</hi> a Scholar of <hi>Pythagoras:</hi> and Divine <hi>Plato</hi> commends the Laws of <hi>Crete; Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> above all, the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, by the Judgment of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybiis</hi> do excel. Theſe Laws of theſe Law-givers, tho not the ſelf-ſame but differing one from the other, yet they all tend to one and the ſame end, the Peace, Happineſs, and welfare of the ſeveral Nations and People, tho they did not march all in one and the ſame Road and Path thereunto. The firſt <hi>Law givers</hi> had always the <hi>Laws of Nature</hi> (in which there's nothing unequal to be found) before their Eyes, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and conform to them as near as they could: but when they made <hi>Judicial Laws,</hi> as they were not all under one Climate, nor ſuckt the ſame Air, ſo they had not all the ſame Reaſon, the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judgment, which made the difference in their Laws; but yet <hi>they all tended to the good and happineſs of the People and Nations for whom they were made:</hi> All right being either from the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> (which is the Law of God) or from Cuſtom, or from <hi>Human Laws.</hi> The <hi>right of Nature</hi> always ſtands on its own Legs by its ſelf, without the aſſiſtance of Cuſtom, or of other Laws, and always points and leads to happy life and condition, which every Man, Society, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might enjoy, if they would but follow her Dictates, and take her for their Guide and Rule to walk by. But above all Laws no Laws like to thoſe of the Almighty, who is the Lord alone of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, for they had reſpect not to <hi>this life only,</hi> but to <hi>that of a better,</hi> even to Eternity, which no other Lawgivers had: therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorted the <hi>Iſraelites, that when they ſhould poſſeſs the Land whether they were going, that they ſhould keep and do the ſtatutes and judgments as the Lord had commanded him, and it ſhould be their wiſdom, and their underſtanding in the ſight of the Nations which ſhall hear all thoſe ſtatutes, and ſay, ſurely this great Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding people: And what Nation is there ſo great, that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous as all this Law, which I ſet before you this day, Deut.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Having declared the neceſſity, uſefulneſs, and benefit of Government, and the final end thereof, it is now requiſite to ſhow the <hi>true and efficient cauſe and right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where, and in whom the juſt right of appointing Governours and Government is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly inherent and inſtated. God,</hi> beyond all contradiction, reigns by his own Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary Power, and <hi>doth whatſoevor he pleaſeth in Heaven above, and in Earth beneath, and in the Waters under the Earth; Kings</hi> and other Governours only <hi>precariò,</hi> at the good will and pleaſure of others; <hi>God</hi> by himſelf, <hi>Kings by God</hi> and the Governed; <hi>God</hi> by his own Juriſdiction, <hi>Kings</hi> by deligated Authority from others: the Juriſdiction of God is immenſe, that of <hi>Kings</hi> limited: So the power of God infinite, that of Kings not ſo; the Kingdom of God endleſs, boundleſs, that of Kings, limited to certain Regions, and fading.

For though a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> be <hi>relata,</hi> yet there can be no King if he want People and Subjects, but there be many People in the World that lack a Head; wherefore I will never be aſhamed to confeſs it my principal honour to be <hi>the great Servant of the Commonwealth,</hi> and ever think the Proſperity thereof to be my greateſt Felicity, 494, 495.</q> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is demonſtrable, <hi>viz.</hi> God, not the King, made the People, and thoſe all equally of one and the ſelf-ſame Mould, but the <hi>People make Kings;</hi> Nature was Father to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the People make ſome of themſelves Kings, and are the <hi>rightful Patrons of all</hi>

               <p>It is clear, that the <hi>Jews</hi> in their <hi>Sanhedrim Melec,</hi> and other parts of their <hi>Talmud</hi> with the Writers thereon, that it was the Law and Cuſtom of their Kingdom, that their Kings (of the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> eſpecially) were to be judged as well as to judge.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58061:17"/>
which is unjuſtly uſed. He that doth violence to the life of a man, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed, <hi>Gen. 9. 6. Lawful power of Life and Death, Kings cannot now perſonally and immediately have from God, and therefore muſt have it from, and by conſent of the governed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what Powers Kings thus have, the ſame have all other Forms of Government: Therefore it is eaſily granted, that Men having no ſuch Power, cannot transfer any ſuch, and that they that do are but <hi>felones de ſe,</hi> and ſin as much as they that fall on the points of their own Swords; for that which is not permitted to us to do againſt our ſelves, we cannot juſtly commit to others to do: ſo that upon the whole matter <hi>it is the Law that hath the power of Life and Death, to which both Governors and Governed are alike ſubject.</hi> And they that live under another Government, as moſt Heathens do, do not live, but languiſh, dwinder, and pine away. When the <hi>People of Iſrael</hi> were governed <hi>by Judges</hi> about Four hundred and fifty years together, there was no King then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the Laws againſt Murder, &amp;c. were put in execution then; and why is it not as lawful now, as then, for any Form of Government (be it <hi>Ariſtocracy, Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or any other Form whatſoever) to execute the Laws (not contradicting the Laws of God and Nature) made by common conſent? And without all doubt, thoſe Kings ſit ſureſt on their Thrones, and ſerve God and their Subjects beſt, that ſo Reign, and ſo Govern by conſent of the People. So <hi>Jepthah by conſent of the elders of Iſrael, was made their head by covenant: and the Lord was choſe witneſs between them,</hi> Judg. 11. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And ſo is God ſtill Witneſs to this day between Kings and their People when they Reciprocally Swear to conditions: ſo <hi>the elders of the tribe of Judah anointed David King over the houſe of Judah,</hi> 2 Sam. 2. 4. which ſhewed their conſent, power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, though ſet over them by God's own appointment.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Saul,</hi> whom God did chuſe, yet he ſent him <hi>to all the People</hi> to have their conſent and approbation, which they unanimouſly teſtified and declared by their general ſhooting, and crying <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 24. <hi>And all the people made Saul King before the Lord in Gilgal,</hi> chap. 11. 15. whereby it is manifeſtly apparent that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent hath the approbation of God himſelf, the Judg of all the Earth,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is very well pleaſed. So when the <hi>Elders of Iſrael</hi> came to <hi>Samuel to Ramah,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 4, 6. when he was old and not like to live long, and his Sons not walking in his ways, and conſequently not likely to Govern as they ought; they deſired him to <hi>make them a King to judg them like all the Nations.</hi> Which thing not only diſpleaſed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> but even <hi>God himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for that they refuſed to be governed by God himſelf, who had delivered them out of the hand of their Enemies on every ſide; ſo that they dwelt ſafely under that Government that God had erected and eſtabliſhed: and though <hi>Samuel</hi> had told them, that the cuſtom and manner of thoſe Kings of Nations (Heathens, and who lived without God in the World, whoſe Government they were ſo fond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> off) was, <hi>to take their ſons and appoint them for themſelves, for their chariots, to be their horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, and to run before their chariots: And would appoint them captains over thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and over fifties, and will ſet them to ear their grounds, and to reap their harvest, to make inſtruments of war, and of his chariots. And would take their daughters to be confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, cooks, and bakers: and would take their fields, vineyards, and olive-yards, even the beſt of them, and give them to their ſervants: And would take their men ſervants, and their maid ſervants, and their goodlieſt young men, and their aſſes, and put them to his work: and would take the tenth of their ſheep,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. contrary to the Precepts God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for Kings to Govern by, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. A Government very ill becoming and befitting God's own People and Inheritance. But no ſooner had they experimented their new fancied Governments, but they were as ſoon weary of it, and then perceived and confeſſed, <hi>that their wickedneſs was great that they had done in the ſight of the Lord in asking a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and beſought <hi>Samuel</hi> to pray for them, <hi>that they might not dye, for that they added to all their ſins the great evil to ask a King,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. Of ſuch eſteem and prevalency is <hi>Publick Conſent,</hi> with God himſelf, that he waved his own Omnipotent Prerogative, to gratifie a rebellious and ungrateful Nation, in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Document to all Kings to hearken unto the publick deſires of their People: And alſo to conſider, that it was a Crime and a Wickedneſs in thoſe days to ſet up Kingly Government.</p>
               <p>Since the Days of the <hi>Prophets (which were until</hi> John, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 16.) It is manifeſt that God hath devolved the Right of chuſing Kings on the People. 1.

                  <hi>jews</hi> under the Prophets, and ſince. And not without this moral reaſon, That one from among themſelves being by their <hi>conſent and ſuffrages ſet King over them,</hi> that what Authority ſoever they grant unto Kings, they may acknowledge to have had it from the People; and therefore obliged more readily to imploy all their times, ſtudies, ſtrengths, and endeavours for the good of them, who ſet them over themſelves to take the burden of the Government upon their Shoulders: and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to pay them all Honour, allow them great Priviledges and Prerogatives, and give them Munificent Tributes and Maintainance for the Support of them and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m nt; and ſwearing Allegiance unto their Kings, and the Kings ſwearing unto the People, to keep Faith with them in the due performance and execution of the Laws already made, and to be made.</p>

And though</hi> David <hi>had promiſed his People that</hi> Solomon <hi>ſhould ſucceed him, and ſit upon his Throne, yet this was not ſufficient; and therefore</hi> David aſſembled all the Princes of Iſrael, and the princes of the Tribes, and the captains of the companies, and captains over the thouſands, and the ſtewards over all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the poſſeſſion of the King, and of his Sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men which bear any publick office, <hi>and as it were the</hi> repreſentative of all Iſrael; <hi>and conſequently had a</hi> ſhare in the Government, and in the Election, unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. <hi>This great</hi> congregation made Solomon the Son of David King the ſecond time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be chief Governour, and Zadock to be Prieſt, <hi>1 Chron. 28. 1. &amp; 29. 22, 24.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Solomon <hi>being dead</hi> all Iſrael came to Sechem to make Rehoboam King, <hi>1 Kings 12. 11. 2 Chron. 10. 1.</hi> Amaziah being ſlain, Uzziah his only Son was made King by all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>2 Chron. 26. 1. To what tended that ſaying of</hi> Huſhai <hi>unto</hi> Abſalom, <hi>nay, but whom</hi> the Lord and this people, and all the men of Iſrael chuſe, his will I be, and with him will I abide, <hi>2 Sam. 16. 18. but to demonſtrate that that</hi> King <hi>is rightly and lawfully</hi> conſtituted King whom the People chuſe? And all the men of Sechem gathered together, and all the houſe of Millo went and made Abimelech King, <hi>Judg. 9. 6.</hi> And he that was over the houſe, and he that was over the city, the elders alſo, and bringers up of the children, ſent to Jehu, <hi>ſaying,</hi> We are thy ſervants, and will do all that thou ſhalt bid us, we will not make any King: do thou that which is good in thine eyes, <hi>2 Kings 10. 5.</hi> And all theſe men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David King over all Iſrael: and all the rest alſo of Iſrael were of one heart to make David King, <hi>1 Chron. 12. 28. Several times the making of a King is aſcribed and given to the People,</hi> viz. <hi>Wherefore is it recorded,</hi> Deut. <hi>17. 14.</hi> when thou ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, <hi>if it were not</hi> their Right <hi>and Power to make a</hi> King? <hi>and without ſuch Power, no Law could be impoſed on them. Not to make a ſtranger King, and yet to chuſe one of their Brethren, is certainly a warrant from Heaven to chuſe, beyond contradiction.</hi> All the congregation made Jeroboam King over Iſrael, <hi>1 Kings 12. 20. So they have power both to make and not to make a King over themſelves; and alſo to limit and bound their Kings to what conditions they pleaſe,</hi> or elſe to fall from them, as the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael did from Rehoboam, and chuſe another, <hi>1 Kings 12. 19. Nor was</hi> Saul <hi>himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly</hi> King <hi>as ſoon as</hi> Samuel <hi>had anointed him, nor yet becauſe another Spirit was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in him,</hi> no, not until all Iſrael choſe him King at Mizpeh. Jehoaſh and Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord, and the king, and the people, that they ſhould be the Lord's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and between the king alſo and the people, <hi>2 Chron. 23. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which it appears, that though <hi>Kings</hi> were ſo conſtituted and influenced by the Prophets from God himſelf, yet not ſo abſolutely as to exclude common conſent, <hi>but that they were to be under Covenants and Agreements with the People,</hi> whereunto they were equally, ſtrictly, and reciprocally obliged to performance: and that their juſt right of admitting Governors over them was reſerved unto them upon their own Tearms and Conditions; even then, and certainly much more now: ſeeing God doth not now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately interpoſe in any ſuch choice, the ſame right by the Law of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo undeniably in them, that it cannot be denied unto them. And all Kings Governing otherwiſe than by the conſent of the People, are but <hi>Intruders, Uſurpers,</hi> and <hi>Tyrants.</hi> And whoever violates thoſe Covenants, in a high degree, are undoubtedly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to the Law;</hi> and <hi>whoever commits any unjuſt force againſt the Law, the defence muſt neceſſarily be juſt and warrantable before God and Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſult prophane Hiſtories, and it will be found the Power and Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is aſſerted and defended, and practiſed accordingly, even among the Heathens: And in all well-governed Kingdoms, <hi>the Children did not ſucceed their Parents, until the

People by their Magiſtrates had</hi> de novo <hi>inveſted them by the Diamond and Scepter.</hi> In Chriſtian Kingdoms which to this day Reign by ſucceſſion, the ſame is evident. The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. are all Inaugurated and Crowned by the <hi>Peers, Patritians, and Magiſtrates</hi> (repreſentatives of the Kingdom) no otherwiſe than the <hi>Emperors</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> are by the <hi>Princes Electors thereof,</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> by the <hi>Vayvodes or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines.</hi> Neither is their Kingly Honour owned in the free Cities till ſo Crowned, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and Confirmed; neither was the time of their Reign computed but from the <hi>day of their Inauguration;</hi> which manifeſtly appears in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and other Kingdoms, where the States often preferred a Kinſman before a Son, a younger Son before an elder: which Kingdom, by the <hi>Authority of the People,</hi> was tranſlated from one to another without regard had to the right Heir.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Franks,</hi> before they came into <hi>France,</hi> it's manifeſt that their petty Kings were ſubject to the <hi>Ordines Populi,</hi> as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>f.</hi> 57. <hi>De bello Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Ambiorix &amp; Catileucus Eburonum rex,</hi> (i e.

               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Franks</hi> and the <hi>Gauls</hi> became one, under the name of <hi>Franco-Galli;</hi> who, although they <hi>choſe their Kings</hi> firſt out of the Family of <hi>Merovey,</hi> then out of the Poſterity of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and after out of the Succeſſors of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> yet from the beginning they ſo conſtituted their <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that their Kings did not Reign only by the right of Succeſſion, but were alſo choſen <hi>Conſenſu Ordinum Regni.</hi>

               <p>After <hi>Pharamond</hi> they choſe one <hi>Daniel</hi> a Monk, whom they ſirnamed <hi>Chilperick,</hi> whom for his <hi>Debauchery they baniſhed,</hi> and choſe one <hi>Gillon</hi> or <hi>Gilles,</hi> a <hi>Roman Senator</hi> or Maſter of the <hi>Roman Militia,</hi> for their King; who Governing as ill as <hi>Chilperick,</hi> they ſent and intreated <hi>Sigibert, King of Metz,</hi> to take the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Crowned him.</hi>

Hiſtories are full of the like examples in other Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in the Poſterity of <hi>Pepin,</hi> who having been Ten years Maſter of the Palace to <hi>Childerick,</hi> a weak Prince, ſet up for himſelf, and by his Power and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, by the help of Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> his ghoſtly Father, diſpenſing with the Oath of Allegiance, which the People had Sworn to <hi>Childerick,</hi> the laſt King of the Race of <hi>Clovis,</hi> whom the People cauſed to be put into a Monaſtery.

               <p>At the end of the Race of <hi>Pepin, Lewis</hi> King of the <hi>Francs</hi> being dead, they being willing to transfer the Kingdom to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Auſtraſie;</hi> or, according to others, Duke of <hi>Lorrain:</hi> but whilſt he deferred his coming, <hi>Hugh Capit</hi> took poſſeſſion of the Crown.

For the <hi>French</hi> not being pleaſed with the Infancy and Weakneſs of <hi>Charles,</hi> Son of <hi>Loys de Begue,</hi> about Nine or Ten years old, choſe for their King <hi>Odon,</hi> Son of <hi>Robert Saxon,</hi> which was killed by the <hi>Normans</hi> in Battel; and that Two years after, they being diſpleaſed with the Government of <hi>Odon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they diſcharged him of the Government, and ſet up <hi>Charles</hi> again, who misbehaving himſelf was impriſoned; and they put in his place <hi>Raoul</hi> King of <hi>Bourgongue:</hi> by which examples it is apparent the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were Elective, not Hereditary. But after they obtained Hereditary Poſſeſſion of the Crown, the Cuſtom of the <hi>Election by the People</hi> (which had laſted long) being laid aſide, the <hi>Kings were Crowned and Choſen at</hi> Rhemes <hi>by the Peers of</hi> France, <hi>in the name of the Church, of the Nobles, and of the People.</hi> Bernard de Gerard.

               <p>In ſumm, <hi>All Kings were at firſt Elected and Choſen by the People:</hi> and though now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſucceed by Inheritance, as by much the better way, yet that way alſo is Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, Approved, and Confirmed <hi>by the People or their Repreſentatives.</hi> No Kings drop out of the Clouds, neither do they ſtart out of the Earth; though the <hi>People chuſe the Root,</hi> yet do they not ſo abſolutely chuſe the Stems or Branch, but if they do degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they in Prudence and Juſtice <hi>may make a better choice.</hi> The Heirs of ſuch Roots are not ſo much born Kings as adopted ſo, not ſo much Kings as fair Candidates for Crowns. <hi>Preſumptive Kings</hi> only where Succeſſion is not ſettled by Laws made by publick conſent.</p>

               <p>IT is true that <hi>Machiavil, Hobs,</hi> the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and others do inculcate, That <hi>Kingly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſo founded by God immediately, that there remaineth nothing human in it, and that publick conſent is nothing at all requiſite, and that Kings are reſponſible to God only:</hi> which is the ground of all Tyrannical, Arbitrary, and Unbounden Sway. For if Kingdoms by <hi>common conſent</hi> can neither ſet Bounds nor Conditions, nor judg of them when limited to Kings, but muſt conſider them as things <hi>meerly Divine</hi> (the greateſt tye in the World) <hi>above all human Laws, Conſent</hi> and <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> then all Nations are <hi>equally Slaves,</hi> and born to no more Liberty than the Subjects of <hi>Rex Aſinerum,</hi> whoſe Wooden Shoes and Canvas Breeches proclaim what a bleſſedneſs it is to be born under a meer divine Prerogative.</p>
               <p>But the ſureſt Baſis of all right Government is <hi>common conſent;</hi> and the moſt juſt and honourable End is <hi>common good,</hi> and not ſuch a divine Prerogative as none can underſtand, nor poſſible for any Mortal to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> is not more the <hi>Author of Regal</hi> then of <hi>Democratical, Ariſtocratical,</hi> or any other Form of Government or Power; nor more the <hi>Author of Supreme, than of Subordinate Powers: Subordinate Magiſtrates have their Power as much from God as Kings have, and as reſponſible to God only as they, and yet their Powers are not beyond human reprimand and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</hi> Laws are not now to be underſtood to be any ſpecial Ordinances imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent from Heaven, as of old by the Miniſtry of Angels or Prophets: they now can be nothing elſe amongſt Chriſtians but the <hi>Pactions and Agreements of ſuch and ſuch Politick Societies and Power;</hi> nay, the very <hi>Eſſence of Power is ſo Originally inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the People</hi> (that they cannot juſtly, without injury to God and Natures Law, <hi>devest themſelves</hi> wholly of it,) and it is nothing elſe but the <hi>Might and Vertue,</hi> which ſuch or ſuch a Society of Men contains in it ſelf; and when by ſuch and ſuch Laws of Common conſent and Agreement it is derived and deligated into ſuch and ſuch Hands; <hi>God confirms that Law,</hi> and ſo Man is the free, natural, and voluntary Author; the Law is the Inſtrument, and God is the Eſtabliſher of both. All other Powers, not derived from common conſent of the People, are but Sophiſticate and Adulterate in all Princes, and they that imbrace ſuch Powers, imbrace a <hi>Cloud</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Juno.</hi> The Fountain or Efficient Cauſe of Power is moſt certainly in the Governed: And from hence the inferrence is juſt, That Kings, though <hi>ſingulis majores,</hi> yet are <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis minores;</hi> for if the <hi>People</hi> be the true efficient cauſe of Power (as undeniably they are) its a Rule both in Nature and Politicks <hi>quicquid efficit tale eſt magis tale.</hi> Hence it's manifeſt, that as the <hi>Governed are the efficient cauſe,</hi> ſo they, and their <hi>happy eſtate</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi> are the <hi>final end of all Governments.</hi> And it were ſtrange, nay mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, that in conferring and deligating their own Power and Vertue to this or that Man, or to theſe or thoſe Perſons, to command in Chief for Order and Regulation ſake only, ſhould aim at any thing but at their own Good and Happineſs, both in the firſt and laſt place. Or to expreſs it in another Dialect, <hi>the Publick Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all Societies, is above every individual contained in the ſame Societies,</hi> of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever, <hi>Kings or not Kings.</hi>

               <p>All <hi>Imperial and Royal Dignities</hi> are inſtituted by the Commonwealth <hi>to preſerve it ſelf,</hi> and not erected to <hi>preſerve Royal Dignity</hi> otherwiſe or farther than it conduces to the Honour, Safety, and Happineſs of the Commonwealth.

Plea of Force or Conqueſt cannot acquit <hi>Princes</hi> of that which is due to the <hi>People,</hi> who are the Authors and Ends of all juſt Power, for meer force ought not to alter Laws of Nature, or fruſtrate the tenor of Laws of God or Man; and if it could, yet there were more reaſon why the <hi>People</hi> might juſtifie force to re-gain their undeniable Rights and Franchiſes, than the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> might to ſubvert the ſame. It being unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural that any Nation, by it's own inherent and natural Virtue and Proweſs, ſhould meerly eſtabliſh Tyranny, and countenance Slavery, and to make that which is moſt Excellent ſubſervient to that which is moſt Vile, or to advance one from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Throne,</hi> that they themſelves might be <hi>brought under Axes and Harrows.</hi> Even <hi>Heathen Princes,</hi> that have been Abſolute, have acknowledged themſelves Subject and Servants to the Publick, and born for that ſervice, as being well ſatisfied, <hi>Populi rem eſſe non ſuam.</hi> No Captain-General hath ſuch unlimited, and uncircumſcribed Power, but that, if he ſhould turn his Cannon upon his Soldiers, they were <hi>ipſo facto</hi> abſolved of all Oaths of Allegiance, and bound by a <hi>higher Duty, both to God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to preſerve themſelves by Reſiſtance and Defence: ſuch <hi>tacite and implicite Truſts and Reſervations</hi> are in all Publick Governments, though of the moſt Abſolute Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and there muſt be theſe neceſſary conditions, <hi>viz. that the Governed be Safe, Free, and Happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is in all Laws a literal and an equitable ſenſe. No Government did ever give Power to their Kings for their woe, but for their happineſs. If by the Letter of the Law Kings miſ-improve their Power againſt the equity thereof, then they give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the commanded to refuſe Obedience to the Letter: for the Law taking ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from its Original Reaſon, End, and Equity becomes a Shadow without a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a Body without a Soul; which diſtinction, if not allowed, the very end of all Laws (which is to miniſter impartial Juſtice indifferently to every Man, and to give bounds and limits to the exorbitant wills of Princes and Governors) will be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Salus Populi</hi> being the <hi>Suprema Lex.</hi> Execution of Laws according to their Equity and Reaſon is the Spirit; that gives life to Authority, the Letter kills. Equity is ſo naturally implied in all Laws, that are not meerly imperial from the Analogie, that all bodies Politick hold with the natural; whence all Government and Governors borrow a proportionable reſpect, except we deem Obedience binds Men to cut their own Throats or their Neighbours. For Kingdoms muſt not be without means to preſerve themſelves, which always is intruſted in ſome certain hand with a Power to provide in an orderly way for the good and ſafety of the whole.</p>
               <p>All the Priviledges, Prerogatives, and Authorities conferred on Kings by any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are but as ſo many Truſts repoſed in them to improve for the good and glory of King and Kingdom, and not to abuſe or uſe at their own pleaſure, what ever the exegency of the Kingdom ſhould be. If that were ſo, all our Laws would ſignifie little; and therefore if Kings Govern not according to Equity, and the Truſts repoſed in them, that Nation, or it's Repreſentatives, may demand an Account and Redreſs: For Kingdoms by no Law of God or Nature are to be left without a power and means to preſerve themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Charter of Nature</hi> entitles all Subjects of all Countries to ſafety and freedom by its Supreme Law.

The <hi>ſafety of Kingdoms</hi> is to be valued <hi>above any right of any Monarch,</hi> as the end is to be preferred above the means. It is not juſt, nor poſſible for any Nation ſo to enſlave it ſelf, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign its own Intereſt to the will of one or many Lords, as that they may deſtroy or abuſe it without Injury, and yet to have no right to preſerve, or right it ſelf: For ſince <hi>all natural Power is in thoſe that obey,</hi> they which contract to obey to their own Ruine or Slavery, or having ſo contracted, they which eſteem ſuch contract before their own preſervation, are <hi>fellonious to themſelves, and rebels to Nature.</hi>

It's true, after the <hi>Decemvirate</hi> was conſtituted (which was <hi>Anno</hi> 302.) <hi>no Appeal did lie from them to any other Magiſtrates:</hi> But when they alternately Governed, <hi>it was lawful to Appeal from the Judgment or Sentence of one to the Judgment and Sentence of another.</hi> So far unpleaſing was an unlimitted Power to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that at laſt the <hi>Decemvirate</hi> was forced to quit their Power.

                  <hi>Monarch,</hi> not only becauſe he was Lord of the whole World, but becauſe he choſe them to be his <hi>peculiar People,</hi> in that <hi>he gave them Laws by Moſes, and gave them the promiſed Land by Jeſhua,</hi> who governed them by <hi>Judges;</hi> at which time the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was <hi>Monarchical,</hi> tho by the Miniſtry of the <hi>Judges;</hi> which if Kings would now imitate and govern accordingly, there would be no need of theſe Diſputes, as it is now moſt neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Tho God appointed <hi>David King,</hi> yet he was to be <hi>choſen by the People,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1. So <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 22. and tho the Crown of right did belong to <hi>David</hi>'s Family, yet the <hi>People did chooſe which of the Family beſt pleaſed them,</hi> and that by a double Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as may appear by the Hiſtory of <hi>Joas,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 4. and 17. For the <hi>King and the People</hi> by a Solemn Oath, did promiſe to God, that they <hi>would keep his Laws</hi> both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil. Afterwards there was <hi>another Oath between King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> at which time there was a Right in the People (i. e. <hi>Ordinibus Populi)</hi> to call him to Account, whom they had ordained King if he performed not his Duty.</p>
               <p>Which is made out by Examples. If it were lawful for <hi>David</hi> to defend himſelf from the Tyranny of <hi>Saul,</hi> and for the City of <hi>Libnah</hi> (the City of the Prieſts and inferiour Magiſtrates only) to withdraw themſelves from the Obedience of <hi>Joram</hi> (the ſixth Succeſſor from <hi>David)</hi> becauſe he had forſaken the Lord God of his Fathers; which City belonging to the Prieſts, it is very apparent that their caſe was far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of the <hi>Idumaeans</hi> which hapned at the ſame time, under the ſame King; for it is not likely that the <hi>Edomites</hi> withdrew themſelves from the Subjection of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they might ſerve God whom they never ſerved, but hated him and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but deſired to free themſelves from thier Subjection.</p>
               <p>But the Prieſts and Inhabitants of <hi>Libnah,</hi> not being able to ſerve two Maſters, God and the Tyrant, threw of his Yoak, that they might the better ſerve God; will it not naturally follow, that the States of a Kingdom may lawfully defend and free themſelves from Tyranny? The Fact alſo of the Rulers over Hundreds, with the Captains, by the Advice of <hi>Joida</hi> againſt <hi>Athalia,</hi> and of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt <hi>Amaſia,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 19. whom they ſlew, which was not ſeditiouſly but lawfully done, for it is no where ſaid that <hi>Amaſius</hi> was ſlain by his Servants, (as it hapned to his Father <hi>Joas,</hi> and to <hi>Ammon</hi> the Son of <hi>Manaſſes)</hi> but <hi>by the common conſent</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that not treacherouſly (the end of moſt Tyrants) but by publick force, and publick Authority; not tumultuouſly, but after he had fled to the City <hi>Lachiſh,</hi> from whence his Body was carried to the Sepulchers of his Fathers; which is confirmed, for that after his death, we do not read of any Inquiſition made how he came to be ſlain, or that any Body was puniſhed or called in queſtion for it, either by the People, or his Children (as there was for <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Joas,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 10. &amp; 14. 5. &amp; 21. 24.) but on the contrary, in reſpect to Kingly Dignity and his Fathers Family, they choſe <hi>Azariah</hi> his Son King. Hence we may conclude, that the chief States or <hi>Ordines of Jeruſalem</hi> had a rightful Power to chooſe a King out of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> whom they pleaſed, and when elected, him either to eject or puniſh according as he did or did not obſerve the Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So the</hi> Danes <hi>dethroned and impriſoned</hi> Chriſtiern their Tyrant King <hi>till he dyed, and</hi> choſe his Uncle in his room.</p>
               <p>It is not unknown how <hi>Guſtavus Erickſon</hi> freed himſelf and his Subjects from their Subjection to the <hi>Danes,</hi> and alſo how they kept their <hi>King Captive</hi> for Male-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they tranſlated to his Brother.</p>
               <p>To ſay nothing of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland, Poland</hi> keeps its ancient Right of chooſing their Kings on certain Terms and Conditions, with this <hi>Salvo, That it may be lawful to be quit of their Oath if the King keep not his,</hi> as it may appear by their <hi>Election of Henry,</hi> Brother to the King of <hi>France,</hi> which agrees with <hi>Biſhop Valentine, Procurator</hi> for the King in that Election, who in his Oration to the People, publickly made and printed, commended them for that they did limit and circumſcribe the Power of the King by wiſe Laws.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe General Council hath Authority of chooſing their <hi>Duke,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Power to themſelves of depoſing or puniſhing them if he endeavour or do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing Tyrannically.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Venetians</hi> conſtitute their Duke, not as an Idol, but as a Prince and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, from whom, without any danger of Tyranny, all the Lawful Priviledges and Prerogatives of Kings do iſſue and flow. Now as their General Council have all the Authority of chooſing him (obſerving their ancient Rites and Cuſtoms uſed therein,) ſo the ſame Council retain to themſelves the Right of depoſing, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Take the ſad Example following of Perjury: <hi>Charles VII.</hi> whilſt yet the <hi>Dauphin</hi> moſt wickedly cauſed <hi>John</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> of the Stock of the <hi>Gallick Kings</hi> to be miſerably ſlain in his preſence, contrary to all Faith, Peace, and Friendſhip plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him a little before, near <hi>Melo dunum,</hi> i. e. <hi>Melun.</hi> This Perjury was afterwards expiated by the death of many Millions of Souls, almoſt to the ſubverſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf the <hi>King</hi> reduced to that miſery, that he was diſinherited of his Father, and ſaw his Capital Enemy Inaugurated by the Kingdom at <hi>Paris,</hi> and from thence was rather <hi>Rex Biturigum, i. e.</hi> King of a People of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> inhabiting <hi>Bourge,</hi> then <hi>King of France:</hi> at laſt was forced to redeem his Peace on ſhameful and diſhonourable Terms, as may appear in a treatiſe <hi>Apud Atrabates</hi> with the People of the Province of <hi>Artois;</hi> in which (the King himſelf treated with Duke <hi>Phillip,</hi> Son of the ſaid murdered <hi>John</hi> his Subject) this Clauſe was expreſſed, to which the King himſelf did aſſent, and by his <hi>Diploma</hi> approved of it. <q>
                     <hi>Which Tranſaction if violated by him, all his Subjects, Feudataries, &amp;c. both preſent and to come, ſhall neither obey nor ſerve him, but ſhall rather be ſubject to obey the Duke of</hi> Burgundy <hi>and his Succeſſors.</hi>
                  </q> Such was the iſſue of the violation of Royal Faith plighted. And may not all Kingdoms expect the juſt performance of their Oaths and Stipulations made by their Kings at their Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations, who are thereby made the Keepers and Protectors of their Laws? And what better Iſſue can any Kings expect that violate their Oaths and Truſts, though by Wiles, and Shams, and Royal Influences only on Judges and other Officers of their Kingdoms, through whoſe Hands the management of Laws do paſs Judges, Sheriffs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace, Conſtables, Privy-Counſellors, Juries? &amp;c.</p>

In ſumm, The chief Impery is ſo in Kings and other Supreme Magiſtrates, that if they tranſgreſs the Laws and turn Tyrants, and will not be governed by juſt Laws, unto which they have Sworn, it is the <hi>juſt right</hi> of Inferior Magiſtrates, and <hi>Ordines regni</hi> to hinder their Tyranny, and reduce the Government to its Priſtine State and Condition. And in ſo doing they are ſo far from being ſeditious or rebellious, as that they do but their Duty to God and their Country, as by the above-recited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples appeareth. The truth of which appears by many reaſons. 1. By the Law of Nature (on which depends the preſervation of all human Societies) of which there can be no doubt. In all Pacts and Contracts mutually made and conſented unto, the ſame Parties by whom the Obligation was made, have the ſame Power to diſſolve the ſame as often as juſt Reaſon ſhall require. So they that have Power to create Kings, have Power alſo to curb and cenſure them. So if the <hi>Eſſential Conditions of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> for which the Contract was made, be manifeſtly violated and broken, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract (as between <hi>Rahab</hi> and the Spies) is abſolutely void. Let thoſe that hold Kings accountable to God only, ſhew if they can, any Nation ſo fooliſh and unwiſe, that willingly and wittingly, without force or fear, ever ſubmitted ſo abſolutely to any King or Government, that they did not <hi>expreſly</hi> or <hi>tacitely</hi> provide for their own ſafety and good, by obſervance of their own good Laws. It a Conqueror oblige the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by Oaths, then according to the Civil Law, <hi>that thoſe that are extorted by force and unjuſt fear ought not to be accounted Lawful.</hi> I confeſs the <hi>Pulpits</hi> Preach a contrary Doctrine; but it is not poſſible that irreligious or unnatural Conditions, got by force, unjuſt fear, fraud, or wicked practices, ſhould be binding or eſteemed as Lawful, it being a general Rule of right and juſt founded on the common Principles of Nature, <hi>ſo firm and jure, that nothing that is manifeſtly adverſe and repugnant to the Laws of Nature, can be held for right and juſt amongſt Men.</hi> This is generally to be underſtood of Pacts manifeſtly unjuſt or irreligious, which no Man can juſtly require, nor any Man juſtly ſubmit unto, though required. Such was the reproachful condition required of them of <hi>Gabeſh Gilead,</hi> by <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> that he might <hi>thruſt out all their right eyes,</hi> 1 Sam. 11. 2.

The Law exempts his Majeſty from account in no other ſenſe than it exempts him from fault, becauſe he is to do publick Affairs of the Kingdom by his Officers and Miniſters of State, and not by himſelf, and they are to give an account of that which the Kings doth by them.

The Arguments brought for Kings being appointed by God only, and their Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him only, are grounded on ſome few wreſted and miſunderſtood places of Scripture,</hi> viz. By me Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice. By me Princes rule and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth, <hi>Prov. 8. 15, 16. which are applicable to all other Governments as well as Regal, and make only for</hi> the inſtitution of the Kingly Office, and nothing at all for the deſignation or application of the Perſon to the Office, or Gods immediate nomination or appointment of Kings, but for approbation of Kingly Government, among <hi>other Governments by Judges, or others; whereby it manifeſtly appears, that Kingly</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath no more of Divine Right than any other form of Government. <hi>And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all the World, That God did not of his own free choice primarily erect and eſtabliſh Regal Government (but that of the Judges) as the beſt Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but waved his own Prerogative and Wiſdom, and to gratifie the publick deſire of a froward, ungrateful and rebellious People, who were uſed accordingly by ſuch their choice, and felt the ſmart thereof accordingly as</hi> Samuel <hi>foretold:</hi> ſo indulgent was God himſelf to National deſires; <hi>which ſhould be a Document to Kings to comply very readily with the deſires of their People in Government of their Kingdom, as God here did. Beſides, I muſt repeat again,</hi> That no Man can have Lawful Authority to be King over any Nation, but he muſt have it either immediately from God Almighty <hi>(unto which there can be no poſſibility of pretence)</hi> or from the publick conſent of the Nation, <hi>therefore Kings muſt have their juſt Authority from the People. Let Scripture it ſelf be judge,</hi> all Iſrael made Omri (captain of the hoſt) King over Iſrael, not Zimri; and his Son Achab rather than Tibni the Son of Ginath, <hi>1 Kings 16. 16, 21, 22. And the</hi> People made Solomon King, not Adoniah, <hi>though he</hi> were the elder Brother, <hi>1 Kings 1. God by the Peoples free ſuffrages createth ſuch a Man King, becauſe by the Authoratative choice of the People the perſon is made of a</hi> private Man <hi>and</hi> no King, <hi>a</hi> publick Perſon <hi>and a</hi> crowned King, <hi>2 Sam. 16. 18.</hi> The men of Iſrael ſaid to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy Son, and thy Sons Son alſo. <hi>And</hi> all the men of Sechem made Abimelech King, <hi>Judg. 9. 6.</hi> So the elders of Giliad made Jepthah head over them, <hi>Judg. 11. 8, 9, 10, 11.

So in the change of Government, when</hi> Iſrael <hi>not pleaſed with their Government by</hi> Judges, <hi>whom God himſelf had appointed over them, but would have a</hi> King like other Nations: <hi>Wherein God ſo far waved his Prerogative, that he complied with their publick deſire, and gratified them therein, though contrary to his own Infinite Wiſdom.

                  <hi>A</hi> People <hi>may be without a</hi> King, <hi>but there can be no</hi> King <hi>without a</hi> People, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Kings <hi>not particularly and immediately named by God, muſt own their Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Inthronization to the</hi> People, <hi>and ought to be accountable in ſome caſes to them;</hi> for they that give Power are by juſt Reaſon accounted greater and more honourable than they that receive it, <hi>according to that old Maxime,</hi> Quicquid efficit tale eſt magis tale: <hi>and though</hi> Kings <hi>are to be accounted</hi> ſingulis majores, <hi>yet are</hi> univerſis minores: <hi>For</hi> Kings are not Patrons of their Kingly Power, but Adminiſtrators and deputed Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thereof.</p>
               <p>Now it neceſſarily follows, that by the ſame Reaſon Kings have their Authority from the People; ſo to them they are of right to be accountable, for they chuſe them, and covenant with them for their own good. If by God Kings do reign, by God alſo the People have right, and liberties to be governed how they pleaſe; for the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate appointment of Kings, by God himſelf by his Prophets, being now ceaſed, the application of the Powers of the governed to this or that Perſon is left wholly to the common conſent of themſelves. Be the right of Kings and of the People what it will, from God they both equally derive it. Wherever the People create themſelves a King, by the ſame right he is accountable to them; and it participates as much of Divine right for the People to curb and oppoſe oppreſſing wicked Kings as to make Kings, according to the 149 <hi>Pſalm</hi> 8, 9. <hi>To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron. To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his Saints.</hi> Nay, God's own People (on whom he had ſet his Love) had his own Command, that when he had brought them into the Land whither they were going to poſſeſs, <hi>That they ſhould ſmite them, and utterly deſtroy them, and ſhew no mercy unto them,</hi> Deut. 7. 1, 2. Kings are conſtituted by God and Man <hi>to go in and out before them</hi> for Protection and Comfort, not for Violence and Oppreſſion; and <hi>it is by righteouſneſs that the Throne is eſtabliſhed; and iniquity will be the ruine of any Nation: fury is not in him,</hi> Iſaiah 27. 4. And God himſelf hath given no Power to Kings, Princes, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates

but what is juſt and honeſt; and hath tied them up, and bound them by Laws, <hi>viz. He ſhall not multiply horſes to himſelf, he ſhall not multiply wives to himſelf, that his heart turn not away: neither ſhall be greatly multiply to himſelf ſilver and gold. And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his kingdom, that he ſhall write him a copy of this Law in a Book: And he ſhall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and theſe ſtatutes, to do them: That his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren, and that he turn not aſide from the commandment to the right hand or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his Kingdom,</hi> Deut. 17. 16, 20. If they <hi>ſo Reign,</hi> then <hi>by me Kings reign</hi> is well applied; but if they walk contrary, then they are no more <hi>God's Vice-gerents, but the Devils.</hi> For God never gave encouragement to Princes to work wickedneſs, or to oppreſs, or harraſs Subjects, but puniſhed them for not Governing righteouſly.</p>
               <p>The Premiſſes conſidered will certainly yield this undeniable concluſion, That (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath given the governed Power and Inſtruction whom to ſet Kings over them, <hi>viz.</hi> this Man, not that, one from among their Brethren: not a ſtranger which is not their Brother,) therefore <hi>the People have a Power to chuſe this or that Man for their King.</hi> The Reaſons are clear; for that God's Law doth not impower an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> a <hi>non-ens;</hi> nor can God's Law countenance or abet an unlawful Power, or an unlawful Action, but interdict it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides, there being now</hi> no immediate inſpired Prophets, as <hi>Samuel,</hi> or <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to anoint <hi>David,</hi> not <hi>Eliab; Solomon,</hi> not <hi>Adoniah: nor any Man by</hi> Natures Law <hi>born with a</hi> Regal Diadem on his Head, or Scepter in his Hand; <hi>It muſt neceſſarily follow,</hi> That Kings muſt have their Power from the ſuffrages and conſent of the governed, <hi>if they will Govern Lawfully, and not be Uſurpers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was ſo from the firſt Inſtitutions of publick Government. For when the World began to multiply, and reciprocal Injuries, Injuſtices, and Oppreſſions did increaſe among them, the Light of Nature and common Senſe did dictate unto them, That there was no way to prevent and redreſs all evils of Oppreſſion, Injuſtice, &amp;c. incident to the whole Race of Mankind, but to come to an Agreement and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition among themſelves, by Conſtituting ſome kind of publick Government, and by ſubmiting themſelves thereunto; And that unto whom they granted Power and Authority, by them the Peace, Tranquility, and happy Eſtate of all might be procured.</p>
               <p>Men always knew, that when Force and Injury was done, they might by the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> defend themſelves: They likewiſe knew by the <hi>Inſtinct of Nature,</hi> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Men might ſeek their own profit and happineſs, yet if this were done with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury unto others, it was not to be ſuffered, but by all Men and all good Means to be withſtood. They knew alſo by the ſame Light, that no Man might in Reaſon take upon him to determine his own Right; and therefore debates and troubles would be endleſs, except they gave their common conſent, all to be ordered by ſome whom they ſhould agree upon; without which conſent there were no Reaſon that one Man ſhould take upon him to be Lord or Judge over another: and therefore for mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of this their Right, and peaceable Contentment on all ſides, the Aſſent of them who were to be governed became abſolutely neceſſary.

Kings are not immediately from God, but from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who may limit and bind Royal Power as they pleaſe.

               <p>SEeing Kings are conſtituted and appointed by the People, and for the People to preſide over them, and manage their own Government, and to defend them by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and out before them to fight their Battels, and to ſee that Judgment be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and indifferently adminiſtred, it naturally and undeniably follows, that whole Kingdoms are to be preferred before the Kings thereof; as the good of the whole is to be preferred before the good of any part.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Turner</hi> in his Sermon, <hi>September</hi> 9. 1683. though he extends Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Prerogative far beyond their juſt limits; yet ingeniouſly confeſſeth, That the Intereſt of Nations is to be preferred before the Intereſt or Welfare of any one Man; and grounds it on the Prophecy of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> John 11. 45, 50. <hi>That it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that one man ſhould die for the People, and that the whole Nation periſh not;</hi> which he accounts <hi>a ſure word of Prophecy,</hi> that is, the Teſtimony of God himſelf, that <hi>a greater Intereſt of Mankind is to be preferred before a leſſer,</hi> p. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Such force there is in conferring Authorities, that they <hi>who receive Authorities are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be eſteemed inferior to thoſe who give them. Potiphar</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſet <hi>Joſeph</hi> over all his Family. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> ſet <hi>Daniel over all the Province of Babylon,</hi> Dan. 2. 48. <hi>Darius</hi> ſet One hundred and twenty <hi>Preſidents over his Kingdom,</hi> and yet did not deveſt themſelves of the <hi>Dominion of their own Power and Authority.</hi> So the <hi>People ſet Kings</hi> over them as chief Miniſters of their Government, <hi>without deveſting themſelves of the vertual Power and Dominion thereof.</hi> Which title of Miniſter, good Kings refuſe not to acknowledge, but imbrace: and for ſome Ages among the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, none, unleſs manifeſt Tyrants (ſuch as <hi>Nero, Domitian, Caligula)</hi> would be called <hi>Lords.</hi> And therefore Holy Writ ſtiles them <hi>Shepherds to feed them,</hi> Pſalm 78. 79, 71, 72. <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to defend them;</hi> and go in and out before them, <hi>Miniſters of God for their good,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. <hi>Nurſing-fathers to carry them in their boſoms, as a Nurſing-father beareth the ſucking Child,</hi> Numb. 11. 12.

               <p>Seeing therefore <hi>Kings are made by the People,</hi> and for the good of the People, and cannot ſubſiſt without the People, and the end is more to be preferred than the means, Why ſhould it ſeem ſtrange to Chriſtians, rational Men, that <hi>Kingdoms</hi> are to be preferred before, and to be held Superior unto Kings? <hi>Kings</hi> are given of God, as gifts, for the preſervation, comfort, and good of his People, his Choſen, his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, the work of his own Hands, and the redeemed of his own Blood, to be <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-fathers</hi> to them, and therefore muſt be of leſs eſteem in the ſight of God than thoſe to whom, and for whoſe good and happineſs they are given, ſince the gift, as the gift is in worth much leſs than Kingdoms, for whoſe ſake Kings were given.

               <p>Moreover, <hi>The Royal Legiſlative Power is joint and co-ordinate with King and People,</hi> and conſequently the Power alſo, and ſo no neceſſity to fetch a <hi>Royal Power from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to be immediately infuſed in them, ſeeing the <hi>People have ſuch a Power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> The <hi>People</hi> in all well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>conſtituted Kingdoms, can and <hi>do limit, and bind Royal Power by Law;</hi> and thoſe who can limit, and take away, can give Power: and it <hi>is ahſurd to conceive that the People can put reſtraint upon Powers immediately derived from God.</hi> Though Kings command, in ſome ſenſe, the People by their executive Power of the Laws above them, yet the <hi>People have the Original and Natural Power above them,</hi> becauſe they make Kings: and in God's intention Kings are given wholly and intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their good; and if Kings do not ſo execute, they do, as much as in them lieth, make void <hi>and fruſtrate the whole deſign of their Government, inſtituted and eſtabliſhed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58061:26"/>
by God and Man,</hi> and forfeit their right of Governing. The People give to Kings a <hi>Politick Power</hi> for their own ſafety, and quiet living, and they keep their <hi>Natural Power to themſelves;</hi> of which they cannot deveſt themſelves, and they do not break their Covenant nor their Laws when they execute <hi>Natural Power</hi> for their ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>preſervation. The <hi>People</hi> by their <hi>Original or Natural Power</hi> make Kings after Kings, as when <hi>Saul</hi> died they made <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Hebron,</hi> after him <hi>Solomon,</hi> after him <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and ſo on. And therefore there is more Fountain and <hi>Natural Power</hi> of Royalty in the People than in <hi>David, Saul,</hi> or any <hi>King</hi> in the World: for it is not any where read that <hi>Saul,</hi> or any other <hi>King,</hi> made an other abſolute King. Thoſe Tribunals that make Kings muſt neceſſarily be above Kings: and though there be no Tribunals <hi>formally</hi> above Kings, yet there is <hi>naturally and virtually</hi> a Power in the People, in thoſe who have a joint co-ordinate Power in the <hi>Legiſlative Power,</hi> and ſhare in the executive part of the Laws (as all Officers of Kingdoms have) to erect a Tribunal over them. It is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>abſurd</hi> to conceive that any People have or can lawfully reſign their <hi>whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> into the Hands and Power of any Royal or other Government, it being <hi>againſt the Law of God and Nature ſo to do.</hi> Obj. <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet.</hi> For the People have not an abſolute Power to deſtroy themſelves, or to authorize Violence, Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Injuſtice, or other acts of Tyranny, and therefore cannot reſign it to any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: no more have Kings, for neither God nor the Law of Nature hath given any ſuch Power to Men. And God gives Kings as a Bleſſing, (and happily as the beſt of Governments;) but if thereby the ſtate of Slavery muſt uncontrolably be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon them, as it neceſſarily muſt be, if they renounce their whole Liberty, it's a Curſe rather than a Bleſſing; but they can no more give it away than they can give away their <hi>rational Nature,</hi> and deny themſelves to be reaſonable Creatures; for it is a <hi>Power natural, to preſerve themſelves eſſentially, adhering to every created Being.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, they cannot reſign their whole Power (as Prieſts would have them) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifeſt ſin.

Now, abſolute Power, above a Law, is a Power to do ill, and to deſtroy Nations; which no People have, it being againſt Nature, that any ſhould have a Power by the Law of Nature (which is the Law of God) to deſtroy themſelves. Therefore though the People ſhould inveſt Kings with all the Power that they have, yet if Kings Tyrannize over the People to their hurt and deſtruction, they uſurp a Power which the People never gave them, it not being in their Power to give them; <hi>the Power it ſelf being against the Law of Nature, and conſequently againſt the Law of God;</hi> for that all acts of Tyranny are Oppreſſion, and ſinful Injuſtice, and therefore cannot be from God. <hi>Dum contra officium facit, Magiſtratus non eſt Magiſtratus, quippe à quo non injuria ſed jus naſci debet;</hi> and conſequently they <hi>who reſiſt the tyrannous acts of Kings,</hi> do <hi>not reſiſt the Ordinance of God.</hi> What were it leſs than Blaſphemouſly to <hi>charge God with prevaricating with his People,</hi> if in Authorizing Kings to preſerve them, ſhould give them liberty without all Politick reſtraint to deſtroy them?

Moſt probably, nay, moſt certainly, the Covenant was made <hi>inter King, Prieſt, and People,</hi> for the more certain performance thereof, that if either the one or the other <hi>did the Work of the Lord negligently,</hi> or violate the Covenant, the other might force obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and performance, and be a check to each other: The Prieſt to teach them the Law. If the People tranſgreſſed, the King to uſe his Authority: if the King, the People to uſe their utmoſt, and all, <hi>to prefer the good and benefit of the whole</hi> before any private Intereſt whatſoever. Both King and <hi>Iſrael</hi> plighted their Troths together, not ſeparately.</p>
               <p>If two are joyned in Covenant of ſuch a nature as cannot be broken by the one, but the other muſt neceſſarily and unavoidably be damnified and endangered by ſuch breach, the injured Party may in common Juſtice, and by the Law of Nature, defend and right himſelf. <hi>If</hi> Iſrael <hi>forſake</hi> God <hi>and worſhip Idols,</hi> the King may puniſh. <hi>If</hi> Kings ſin <hi>after the ſame manner,</hi> Iſrael may reform by the ſame Law. Thou ſhalt make no Covenant with them, nor with their Gods; they ſhall not dwell in the Land, leſt they make thee ſin againſt me, <hi>Exod. 23. 32.</hi> But yee ſhall deſtroy their Altars, break their Images, cut down their Groves, &amp;c. <hi>Exod. 34. 13. Of the ſelf-ſame nature is the Covenant here treated of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God in his infinite Wiſdom thought it beſt not to commit the care and overſight of his Covenant, and of his Church and People, to the will and pleaſure of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon, but as both <hi>King and People are all the anointed of the Lord,</hi> and equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the keeping or violation thereof; and conſequently, in the Bleſſings and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings denounced on Mount <hi>Gerazim</hi> and Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> ſo his Charge was equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent both on King and People, that it being equally every Man's concern, ſo it is every Man's duty and care, both joyntly and ſeverally, that it be kept inviolably, and he will require performance accordingly at their Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> being conſtituted <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Iſrael, Samuel</hi> being <hi>Prieſt and Prophet of the Lord,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the Covenant, <hi>viz. If yee will fear the Lord, and ſerve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel againſt the Commandment of the Lord, then ſhall both yee, and alſo the King that reigneth over you, continue following the Lord your God. But if yee ſhall ſtill do wickedly, yee ſhall be conſumed both you and your King,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 14, 15, 25. By wickedneſs, in this place, is moſt eſpecially meant, in that they had rejected the Government which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had appointed, as beſt for them, and choſe a King to be ſet over them; and we rebelled againſt God. The reaſon aſſigned is, becauſe they were God's own <hi>peculiar People,</hi> hereby it's manifeſt, that both King and People were both equally joined in the Stipulation.</p>

                  <hi>So</hi> Aſa, <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>by the Prophecy of</hi> Azariah <hi>the Prophet, congregated all the People,</hi> viz. Judah and Benjamin, where were alſo many of Ephraim, Manaſſeh, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon, and made a ſolemn Covenant to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their ſoul: that whoever would not ſeek the Lord God of Iſrael ſhould be put to death, whether ſmall or great, man or woman, <hi>2 Chron. 15. 12, 13.

               <p>Theſe Examples, with thoſe before, and thoſe that follow, will juſtifie this Kingdom in all that they have done, to free us from unreaſonable and cruel Men, and Popiſh Tyranny; and alſo the Auxiliary Expedition of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to be the moſt glorious and moſt righteous Action that ever Prince undertook, becauſe he came to help the Lord againſt the mighty, who both at home and abroad, had in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and endeavours, deſigned the Inſlaving of all the Proteſtants of <hi>Europe;</hi> which Action God hath hitherto ſignalized by proſpering his Arms with very little Blood. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe and will obſerve theſe things, ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord,</hi> Pſalm 107.</p>

               <head type="sub">Whole Kingdoms and Nations have Power to reform. Faith equally plighted between King and People ought equally to be kept. Care of Religion, Peace, Juſtice, Safety, Liberty, &amp;c. are incumbent on all the People, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the <hi>Ordines Populi.</hi> The common and true Cauſe of Rebellion is abuſe of Power, not Diſobedience to the lawful Commands of Kings. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to unjuſt Commands of <hi>Ceſars</hi> is ſin, and to aſſiſt in ſuch is to make themſelves <hi>Participes Criminis.</hi> Oppoſition to Popes or Kings tyrannizing, is not Rebellion againſt Chriſt's Vicars or Vicegerents, but oppoſition to wicked Men acting wickedly. Defenſive Arms juſtified by Authorities.</head>
               <p>NOW, who ſhould have Power to reform things done amiſs by <hi>Kings</hi> but <hi>all</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> to whom he hath ſworn as ſolemnly, as they to him, and both to <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> who is <hi>witneſs between them.</hi> So <hi>Joſiah the King,</hi> with the <hi>Prieſts, Prophets, and all the People both ſmall and great went up into the houſe of the Lord, and made a Covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord, &amp;c. and all the People ſtood to the Covenant;</hi> 2. King. 23. 2, 3, 4. Why ſhould the <hi>Common conſent of all the People</hi> be ſo ſolemnly required? Why ſhould <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> be ſo ſtrictly <hi>obliged</hi> to the obſervation of Gods Holy Laws and Commandments? Why ſhould they ſo ſacredly promiſe to be the <hi>Lords People,</hi> unleſs Power and Authority were given to them alſo to free themſelves from <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>breaking</hi> and from <hi>Perjury,</hi> and to defend Holy Church? Wherefore was a Covenant made with the People, that they ſhould be the <hi>People of God zealous of good Works,</hi> if they muſt obey the unjuſt Commands of Kings, it may be to worſhip ſtrange Gods, or to permit monſtrous ſins to reign among them, <hi>if it be not lawful to put to their aſſiſtance,</hi> and endeavour to hinder and reform? And why ſhould they be blamed, or Judgments poured upon them if they have no Power from on High to perform what was ſo ſolemnly required, and ſo ſolemnly promiſed? that <hi>God ſhould ſo ſolemnly require their Vow and Promiſe, and yet not give them Power and Authority to perform, is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous to conceive.</hi> God never requires more than he gives; Brick without Straw, that is the Property of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hard <hi>Task-maſters:</hi> Its much more agreeable to truth, that all Covenants of like nature and purport are equally obliging both to King and People, and the care and Authority of each over the other for adjuſting of performances, is reciprocal and equal; it being a Goſpel Principle, That <hi>Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People</hi> (which are his true Church) <hi>ought to be ſollicitous, not only to abſtain from evil themſelves, but alſo to prevent it in otheers:</hi> A notable Example whereof is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>People of Iſrael, Joſh.</hi> 22. who out of abundant Caution, minding the Concerns of their Brethren as their own, when they heard that the <hi>Reubenites, Gadites, and half the Tribe of Manaſſeh</hi> had erected an <hi>Altar, not for worſhipping</hi> (as they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted) but for <hi>memorial and witneſs:</hi> So fearful they were of Gods Wrath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on them, that they ſoon diſpatched an Embaſſy to their Brethren to prevent their ſin as before. Hence it is that the Prophets of old ſtanding in the Gate of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the People, whereby their Kings came in, and by which they went out, did ſo often put them in mind of their Duty, <hi>and of keeping Covenant; and not only that they ſhould not ſacrifice to Baal,</hi> but that they <hi>ſhould deſtroy both Baal and his Prieſts, and root them out of the Land</hi> whether the King will or no; for when <hi>Ahab</hi> had killed the Prophets of <hi>God, Eliah the Prophet congregated all Iſrael, not tumultuouſly, but by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and common conſent, unto Mount Carmel, and the Prophets of Baal Four hundred and fifty, and the Prophets of the Grove Four hundred, which did eat at Jezabels Table, and had convinced them of their Idolatry,</hi> and to be falſe Prophets, <hi>the People at his command killed them all at the Brook Kiſhon,</hi> 1 King. 18. whereby it appears, that the <hi>King neglecting
his Duty, all Iſrael as obliged ought to diſcharge theirs.</hi> On the contrary, as often as Kings violated their Covenants, or profaned the Worſhip of God; and the <hi>People of Iſrael</hi> (as we ſaid before of Covenants, where the breach of one party manifeſtly prejudiced, the other Covenanters threatning Ruin and Deſtruction to the Innocent) through Negligence, ſinful Connivance, or any other ſiniſter By-end, or Reſpect did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him, their <hi>Judgments came alſo upon the People</hi> as well for their non-performance,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58061:32"/>
as on <hi>Kings</hi> for theirs, which moſtly hapned, for that the People are more apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Examples of their Kings, than to repent and amend, or mind him of the Errors of his ways. Wherefore did the <hi>Hoaſt of Iſrael, with Saul and his two Sons fall down ſlain in Mount Gilboa by the Philiſtines?</hi> 1 Sam. 31. Would God (think you) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Sins of the <hi>King</hi> upon the <hi>People</hi> if innocent? <hi>Far be it from the Judge of all the Earth to ſtay the Righteous with the wicked,</hi> Gen. 18. 25. or take vengeance on the People for the Sins of the King; <hi>the Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die,</hi> Ezek. 18. 4. Every Man ſhall be put to death <hi>for his own Sin,</hi> Deut. 24, 16. was it not rather becauſe the People did not reſiſt, or reſtrain, but aſſiſted <hi>Saul their King,</hi> violating the Law of God, and wickedly perſecuting the Man after Gods own Heart, and killing the Prieſts of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> deſiring to inlarge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Borders of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> at his entrance into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, broke publick Faith</hi> with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and deſtroyed many of them (the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> having ſworn unto them) by which he broke the third Commandment, <hi>God being witneſs to his Covenant with the Gibeonites:</hi> he broke alſo the ſixth Commandment, and ſo the breach of both Tables God himſelf would revenge; the breach of which Covenant and Oath was juſtly laid to <hi>Saul and his Family.</hi> Now <hi>Saul</hi> being dead, and <hi>David conſtituted King,</hi> 2 Sam. 21. 1, 2. <hi>God</hi> ſent a Famine in the days of <hi>David</hi> three Years, Year after Year upon the whole Land; and <hi>David</hi> inquired of the Lord, and the Lord anſwered, It was for <hi>Saul and his bloody Houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites,</hi> which Famine ceaſed not till <hi>David delivered ſeven Sons of Saul to the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, whom they hanged in Gibeah of Saul unto the Lord, v.</hi> 6. 8. But was the Famine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Land for <hi>Sauls</hi> fault only? No, both King and People were both puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the one for breaking Covenant, the other for not reſiſting, and not hindring the King, or as being acceſſary to do this Evil. How came it to paſs that God never puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſins of the King upon the People, nor the ſins of the People upon the King, and yet he ſent a Famine on the whole Land, <hi>Saul</hi> the chief Actor being Dead, (and conſequently <hi>Actio moritur cum perſona;)</hi> but becauſe the People ſuffered ſo manifeſt a Sin to be committed by their <hi>ſinful connivance,</hi> and uſed no endeavours to reſiſt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as they ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can Puniſhment by any right be inflicted on any for a Crime whereof they are not guilty? <hi>Alieni ſecleris quenquam poenas pati Jura non ſinunt,</hi> 2 Kings 14. 6. Wherein did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſin, if not by tolerating <hi>Saul</hi> to do as he did, when they ought and might have hindred him?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Menaſſeh</hi> had polluted the <hi>Temple of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſhed Innocent Blood, which the Lord would not pardon,</hi> 2 Kings 24. 4. why did the Lord threaten not only <hi>Menaſſeh,</hi> but his <hi>People with Judgments;</hi> but becauſe they being under the <hi>ſame Covenants with</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh, they would not reſtrain the King from perſiſting in his wickedneſs, but did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive, countenance and aſſiſt him in his Impieties, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned Chriſt, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> delivered him to Death; yet the <hi>Curſe fell upon the whole Nation;</hi> and why? becauſe the <hi>People</hi> might have delivered him as well as they did <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and did not, but impricated Curſes upon themſelves and their Children.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of all Nations to take care not only that Criminals be puniſhed, but that no Crimes be committed; which made <hi>Hezekiah pull down the Brazen Serpent, though ſet up by</hi> Moſes, (when it came to be abuſed:) 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. It being the <hi>duty of the People</hi> by <hi>common conſent</hi> to hinder Kings as much as in them lies, from violating the Law of God, and from injuring his Church and Saints; and if they do not, they are guilty of the ſame crime, and liable to the ſame puniſhment. Reſiſt they may, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing words to words, force to force, ſtratagem to ſtratagem, (always avoiding perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, which is always diſallowed and hateful to God and Man.) For in War it matters not whether it be managed by open Force or ſecret Stratagems. By People is not meant the Many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>headed-Monſter-Multitude, but by the Univerſal People is to be underſtood thoſe who have <hi>any ſhare in the Government,</hi> or any Authority from the People conferred upon them by any Laws made by publick conſent, as inferior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates either choſen by the People, or any other way conſtituted to take care of publick Peace, and concerns of the Laws of the Land, and worſhip of God in their ſeveral qualifications, be they <hi>Tribunes of the People, Ephori, Praefects, Praetors, Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, Conſtables, Captains of Thouſands, Captains of Hundreds, Captains of Fifties,</hi> or other inferior Officers or Magiſtrates, which are as Conſorts of the Empire, and are in the vacancy of the publick <hi>Sanhedrims, Dyets, Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c.

which ſort in a manner were the <hi>Seventy Elders in the Kingdom of</hi> Iſrael, among which there was a <hi>Chief Prieſt,</hi> which did judge <hi>de Arduis Regni,</hi> which were not to be Hobby-horſed in and out by the High Prieſt, according as they would or would not ſerve a ſiniſter turn; and they were choſen out of the <hi>Seventy Families</hi> which went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Elders of which were firſt choſen and made Heads over the People, Rulers of Thouſands, Rulers of Hundreds, Rulers of Tens, and the hard cauſes they brought unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 18. 25.</p>
               <p>We read often in Scripture of <hi>all Iſrael,</hi> of <hi>all Judah,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> &amp;c. when in all probability every Individual did not at all times meet, of which ſort and kind there is in all well conſtituted Kingdoms ſeveral Congregations of the Kingdoms, Officers of the Kingdom, as the <hi>Privy Council, Peers, Patricians, Judges, Seſſions, Aſſizes, Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Deputy Lieutenants, Mayors, Bayliff's of Towns and Cities,</hi> as the ordinary <hi>Councils and Officers of a Kingdom;</hi> and as Councils extraordinary choſen out of them all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>de Arduis Regni,</hi> which are Officers of the Kingdom, and called by ſeveral names in ſeveral Kingdoms, as <hi>Dyets, Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. which provide that no detriment come to either Church or State, in which tho' every individual be inferior to the King, yet the Joynt Body, being the <hi>Repreſentative of the whole Kingdom,</hi> is ſuperior, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before him. For as the <hi>Council of</hi> Baſil <hi>and</hi> Conſtance decreed, that a <hi>General Council was ſuperior to the Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> for that they which receive any Authority from any Company of Men, muſt needs be inferior to that Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though he be perſonally ſuperior to every Individual of that Society. So without all doubt, <hi>Iſrael</hi> which petitioned for, and <hi>choſe</hi> Saul <hi>from among themſelves</hi> to be their <hi>King,</hi> as a publick Actor for the common good of them all, was <hi>ſuperior to</hi> Saul. When we attribute any power to the <hi>People,</hi> it is to be underſtood of the <hi>Officers, Princes, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Parliaments, Dyets, that have a ſhare in the Government and in the Legiſlative Power.</hi> Take <hi>Athaliah</hi> 2 Chron. 24. <hi>for an Example,</hi> in which Act the <hi>Kingdom was</hi> not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but <hi>Tyranny;</hi> which Conſpiracy though acted ſo very privately, and as it were by ſtealth, yet blamed neither by God nor Man, but juſtified by all Writers both Sacred and Prophane, and the ſucceſs anſwered the end deſigned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the</hi> King, <hi>ſo</hi> all Iſrael <hi>as one Man, the ſeveral Cities as parts of the Kingdom, and their Magiſtrates</hi> did covenant <hi>with God to keep his Laws,</hi> &amp;c. Joſhua <hi>when old and near his end, congregated</hi> all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Sechem</hi> in the Preſence of the Lord, <hi>(for the Ark of the Covenant was there,) and called for the</hi> Elders of <hi>Iſrael, and for</hi> their Heads, <hi>and for their</hi> Judges, <hi>and for their</hi> Officers, <hi>and</hi> they preſented themſelves before God, <hi>Joſh. 24. 1. And he ſaid unto them,</hi> fear the Lord and ſerve him, &amp;c. and the People anſwered and ſaid, God forbid that we ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerve other Gods, <hi>ver. 14. 16. And</hi> Joſhua ſaid unto the People, ye are witneſs your ſelves, that you have choſen you the Lord to ſerve him. And they ſaid we are Witneſſes, <hi>ver. 22.</hi> So <hi>Joſhua</hi> made a Covenant with the Lord that day, and ſet them a Statute and an Ordinance in <hi>Sechem.</hi> And <hi>Joſhua</hi> wrote theſe words in the Book of the Law of God, and took a great Stone, and ſet it up there under an Oak that was by the Sanctuary of the Lord; and <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid unto all the People, Behold this Stone ſhall be a Witneſs unto us, for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he ſpake unto us, it ſhall be therefore a Witneſs unto you, leaſt you deny your God, <hi>ver. 24, 25, 26, 27.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is evident, that as <hi>every individual Perſon,</hi> ſo more eſpecially <hi>all Officers in a Kingdom,</hi> that have any publick Authority, ought every one in their ſeveral ſtations to take care that God's Law be fulfilled, and of the Peoples happineſs; which Officers are Officers of the Kingdom from whom they have their Authority, according to Laws of their own making, and <hi>to them they are accountable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the</hi> Ark of God <hi>be to be brought back, then</hi> all of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned and conſulted, and to give their help. <hi>1 Chron. 13. 2 Chron. 15. So if a</hi> Temple be to be built to the Lord, the chief of the Fathers and Prieſts of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Captains of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and of Hundreds with the Rulers are ſummoned, and moved to offer willingly, <hi>1 Chron. 29. So that there is</hi> no power committed to Kings to alter or change the Laws, Covenants, or Worſhip of God. <hi>So in the</hi> Covenants under <hi>Joah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah, between God, the King and the People,</hi> all the Kingdom were preſent, and all were particularly bound to keep and ſtand to the Covenant; <hi>ſo that not the</hi> King only, <hi>but the</hi> Kingdom, <hi>nor the</hi> Kingdom in general <hi>only, but</hi> all the Parts thereof, <hi>promiſe Faith and Allegiance to God Almighty. Not the</hi> King only, <hi>but</hi> Iſrael; <hi>not</hi> Iſrael only, <hi>but the</hi> Cities and chief Governours of them <hi>did</hi> ſecretly bind themſelves to God, to do him homage and leige Services againſt all Infractors of his Laws. <hi>2 Kin. 11. 23. 2 Chron. 23.</hi>

                  <hi>For Example,</hi> Libnah revolted from Jehoram, becauſe he had forſaken the Lord God of his Fathers, <hi>2 Chron. 21. 10. So</hi> Mattathias, <hi>and all they that fled from the Perſecution

of</hi> Antiochus, joyned themſelves together, and ſmote ſinful men in their anger, and wicked men in their wrath; and they purſued after the proud men, and the work proſpered in their hands. So they recovered the Law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of Kings; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffered they the ſinner to triumph, <hi>1 Macc. 2. 42, 47. ſaying,</hi> We will not hearken to the Kings word to go from our Religion, either to the right hand or to the left, <hi>verſe 22. So his Son</hi> Judas Maccabeus was valiant for the truth, and fought for the People and the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, ſo proſperouſly, <hi>Deo favente,</hi> againſt Antiochus, that he recovered Jeruſalem, and reſtored the pure worſhip of God from the Gentiles, <hi>1 Macc. 3. Though others took part and were obedient to</hi> Antiochus, <hi>and they fell together with the Perſecutor for their ſo doing by the edg of the Sword.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> Iſrael did evil in the ſight of the Lord, he ſold them into the hand of Jabin, King of Canaan, whom they ſerved twenty years, <hi>(a fair preſcription for a Kingdom) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping ſtrange Gods; among whom eſpecially were the</hi> Tribes of Reuben, Ephraim, Benjamin, Dan, Aſſer, &amp;c. <hi>who adhered to</hi> Jabin. <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> Deborah, who judged Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael at that time, levied force with the aſſiſtance of the other Tribes of Zabulon, Napthaly, and Iſſachar, over whom they made Barack Captain, and went along with them, being ten thouſand men, and diſcomfited the Hoaſt of Siſera, Captain of Jabin, and reſtored the true Worſhip of God to Iſrael: and then ſang Deborah, &amp;c. <hi>Judg. 4. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Happily ſome may ſay, that theſe Facts of <hi>Deborah, Jael, Mattathias,</hi> and <hi>Libnah,</hi> ought not to be drawn into imitation and practice, as being ſtirred up by motions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, like that of <hi>Phineahs,</hi> and the Book it ſelf but Apochypha, and not ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick as Scripture.

It's certain, that not only the King, but <hi>all Iſrael</hi> and the parts thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeveral Cities and their Magiſtrates (as in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.) covenanted before God, and did ſwear to worſhip the true God according to his Law; which <hi>Covenant is expreſly in force to this day in all Chriſtian Kingdoms, where King and People Covenant each with other,</hi> and tacitely or interpretatively; alſo where <hi>Kings</hi> Rule <hi>Vi &amp; Armis,</hi> or by fraud, or any other unjuſt way, which is down-right Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The <hi>People</hi> are the <hi>People of God,</hi> and obliged in the firſt place <hi>to God,</hi> and then to the Kingdom, and to the <hi>King:</hi> and though the <hi>King</hi> have the formality and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of Power (all Writs, Executions, Proclamations, &amp;c. iſſuing in his Name,) yet the <hi>People have the true Dominion originally.

               <p>Conſult all Hiſtories, ſearch all Antiquity, and you will find the true cauſe of <hi>all Rebellion,</hi> in all Ages, and in all Countries, to have riſen originally, and moſt eſpecially, <hi>from the abuſe of Power firſt,</hi> and not from the <hi>diſobedience of Subjects to the lawful commands of Kings.</hi> If <hi>Kings</hi> command unlawful things, as they have no Authority ſo to do, ſo Subjects have no Obligation to obey. When Covenants between Prince and People are of ſuch a nature as cannot be broken or violated by either King or People, without doing manifeſt Injury to the other: The injured party may ſeek his Redreſs and Relief, though it be <hi>vim vi repellendo,</hi> which is always to be underſtood of unjuſt Force. For if the <hi>Force be unjust,</hi> the <hi>Defence muſt be lawful;</hi> and, contrariwiſe, if the <hi>Force be just,</hi> the <hi>Defence muſt be unlawful.</hi> So that <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> if tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, are as <hi>truly Tranſgreſſors and Invaders</hi> againſt their <hi>Kingdom</hi> and their Laws, as the People are againſt them and the Laws when they tranſgreſs.</p>
               <p>Do Subjects obey the commands of their Princes, which they may lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and which they of right ought to obey, without intrenching on God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? Do they pay them Tribute, Sute, and Service, not contrary to God's Laws, as they ought? So to obey <hi>Ceſar</hi> is juſt, lawful, and praiſe-worthy. But to obey <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s, exceeding their juſt bounds, commanding without warrant of Law, affecting, and deſigning a greater Impery without the conſent of the governed; or, if they invade or violate the Laws of God, perverting the right Worſhip of God, (who is above all Kings and Governments) it is unjuſt; and to aſſiſt <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s in ſuch caſes is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and they that do, make themſelves <hi>partakers of other Men's Crimes.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, what Generation of Chriſtians in the World ſo void of Reaſon as to ſwear Fealty and Allegiance to Kings, except they again reciprocally ſwear to obſerve the Laws Divine, and of their Country. So the <hi>Rubenites,</hi> and the <hi>Gadites,</hi> and the <hi>half Tribe of Manaſſeh promiſed obedience to Joſhua, but as they did to Moſes, on condition that God be with him, as he was with Moſes,</hi> Joſ. 5. 17. If they can ſhew a Patent from Heaven, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> had, by an immediate Call, and God's Promiſe to be with them as he was with <hi>Moſes and Joſhua, never to fail them, nor forſake them,</hi> then may we all <hi>lay our hands on our mouths, and proceed no farther,</hi> Job 40. 5. And yet if they had the like Patents, yet from ſuch Patents, no Authority could be drawn to oppreſs or tyrannize over any People; but if not ſo, nor ſo, why ſhould not Chriſtians (in <hi>whoſe inward parts God hath put wiſdom; and who hath given underſtanding to their hearts)</hi> who make Kings from among themſelves, and take Oaths of them for performance of Agreements, maintain and defend their own juſt Rights and Liberties: God never broke his Covenants, but puniſhed the People that brake theirs; and why ſhould his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents break their Covenants, and yet be thought guiltleſs, or unqueſtionable?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> who were the moſt ſtif-neckt, moſt rebellious, and moſt ungrateful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Cope of Heaven, and provoked God to the uttermoſt (as if they did it purpoſely to <hi>non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>plus</hi> and poſe his very Mercy;) and they provoked <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo (the Man of God, and the meekeſt Man upon Earth) beyond all his Patience; ſo that he caſt the very <hi>Tables of the Teſtimony (the Work of God, and the Writing of God, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the Tables) out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount,</hi> Exod. 32. 11, 16, 19, 32. yet was he ſo far from oppreſſing or tyrannizing over them, that <hi>he wraſtled with God Almighty</hi> with ſtrong and importunate Prayers for their Good: <hi>Why doth thy wrath wax hot againſt this People?</hi> nay, ſo importunate was he for their Pardon, that though God had promiſed to make of him a <hi>great Nation,</hi> though he ſhould deſtroy

               <p>If Magiſtrates now adays had the like zeal for the good of the Bodies and Souls of their People, how happy would <hi>Kings,</hi> how happy would the <hi>People</hi> be? When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by reaſon of the ill Government of <hi>Samuels Sons,</hi> deſired a <hi>King</hi> like all the Nations, <hi>God</hi> (whom by ſuch deſires they had rejected, yet) told them the <hi>manner and cuſtom of thoſe Kings,</hi> (Heathens you may be ſure, who knew not God nor his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgments,) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11, 12, 13. was very Arbitrary governing by an Army, that they may go in and out before them, and fight their Battels, and judge them Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily; yet ſo peremptory were they, that they rejected the juſt, and a righteous, and eaſy Government that God had appointed over them: <hi>Nay but we will have a King over us as other Nations,</hi> and they had one that uſed them accordingly. Therefore <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> might well ſay as in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, I counſel thee to keep the Kings Commandment, for he doth whatever it pleaſeth him. Where the word of a King is there is Power, and who may ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> It being then the manner of the Kings of Nations (Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,) ſo to govern &amp; <hi>volenti non fit injuria;</hi> which manner remains even to this day among the <hi>Eaſtern Princes;</hi> and let them that delight to be ſo governed, have their Belly full of it. But God hath provided better Laws, Judgments and Statutes for his People, whom he hath choſen out of all Nations to be a <hi>Peculiar People,</hi> Redeemed by the Blood of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſed for ever. <hi>Where the Word of a King is there is Power, and who may ſay unto him what doeſt thou?</hi> This he wiſely adviſed to thoſe who would be ſo governed, and to Single Perſons, but not to <hi>whole Kingdoms,</hi> or their <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives;</hi> the practice was otherwiſe even by Gods own command. <hi>Eliſah told Ahab that he and his Fathers Houſe had troubled</hi> Iſrael, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 18. Samuel <hi>told</hi> Saul, <hi>thou haſt done fooliſhly,</hi> 1 Sam. 13. 3.

Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him,</hi> Levit. 19. 17. <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King thou art wicked, and to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ye are ungodly?</hi> Saith <hi>Job.</hi> 34. 13. <hi>Reprove not a Scorner leſt he hate thee, rebuke a Wiſe man and he will love thee.</hi> Prov. 9. 8. Theſe are prudential Documents how to manage rebukes, but exempts not Kings and Princes from being rebuked. <hi>He that rebuketh the wicked getteth himſelf a Blot,</hi> ver. 7. In ſuch caſe the Apoſtles give good Advice, <hi>Give not that which is holy unto Dogs, neither caſt Pearls before Swine, leſt they trample them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Feet.</hi> Indeed if <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> are ſuch <hi>Bruits,</hi> then <hi>Tophet is prepared for them,</hi> and ſhall be their Doom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 33. And Men will be wiſer than to run their Heads againſt Brick Walls: But <hi>Truths ſeaſonably ſpoken, can do no man no wrong,</hi> and ought graciouſly to be received. <hi>Solomons</hi> intimation is good, <hi>Where the word of a King is there is Power, and who may ſay unto him what doeſt thou?</hi> Eccl. 8. 4. Indeed it is a folly in any Man to contend with any Man, King or not King, that is mightier than he, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6. 10. But all theſe Apothegms relate chiefly to Private Perſons, not to whole States and Kingdoms, who have juſt Power to defend their juſt Rights againſt Princes that uſurp more Power to themſelves than ever God and the People gave them. And to urge <hi>Samuel a Prophet</hi> in a wrong ſenſe, is with the <hi>Witch at</hi> Endor, to raiſe a Falſe and Counterfeit Prophet. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 11, 12. Can it ever be imagined that God gave <hi>countenance</hi> or encouragement to Kings to work Wickedneſs, to oppreſs, or violate all Laws and Covenants, and yet be blameleſs and unaccountable here on earth? <hi>He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he given any man licence to ſin.</hi> Eccl. 15. 20. God never breaks his own Covenants, but keeps them for ever, and always puniſhed them that did; and ſhall they who call themſelves his Vicegerents, like Wild Boars of the Forreſt, or like Bears robb'd of their Whelps, break through all Laws and Bounds, and yet be blameleſs and unaccountable to them who made them Kings, deſignedly to be ſubject to Laws, and not to deſtroy them; or like Foxes of the Wilderneſs, by craft and ſubtilty, by ſhamming Laws, or perverting Righteous Judgment; or by packing an Alteration in Government, and ſlide thereinto inſenſibly by tricks and querks of Law; or to draw Arguments from the manner and cuſtom of <hi>Kings Heathen,</hi> for <hi>Jus Regium</hi> to be the Right of <hi>Kings Chriſtian to do as they liſt, quod libet licet,</hi> uncontrolably, is as much as in them lies to do as the Rebellious and Ungrateful <hi>Iſraclites</hi> did, vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, ſet at naught and reject the Government which God eſtabliſhed by his infinite Wiſdom.</p>

Where ſuch Doctrines are embraced as true, what better conditions are Chriſtians under than Heathens, nay, then Brutes? Did God, think you, create the whole Race of Mankind, without reſpect of Perſons, after his own Image, a little lower then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and crown them with Glory and Honour, and give them dominion over the works of his hands, and put all things under their Feet, and yet at the ſame time to ſubject them to Axes and Harrows, to Thorns and Briars, to the luſts and pleaſures of a few Kings, choſe by themſelves from among themſelves, for the ſake only of Order, Peace and Well-fare of them all?</p>
               <p>It's true, that ſeeing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (notwithſtanding God cautionating of them,) were ſo fool-hardy as to reject God in rejecting his Government, yet he did gratify them, but in his diſpleaſure, in what they deſired, and they felt the ſad effects thereof. But from <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14, 16. it may be gathered and concluded that the People have a juſt Right and Title to chooſe whether the Commonwealth ſhall be governed by one or more, and may change it from one kind of Government to another, as ſhall beſt pleaſe themſelves. But in all Governments God is always to be Preſident, <hi>i. e.</hi> His Laws are always to be had in remembrance and obſerved; and they who govern otherwiſe, are not to be accounted as <hi>Kings,</hi> but as <hi>Enemies,</hi> not as Gods Vicegerents, but as the Devils, and may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt accordingly.</p>
               <p>O, but <hi>ye ſhall be his Servants,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 17. Very well, and well they deſerved to be ſo, and <hi>Slaves</hi> to boot, as they afterwards were, that after <hi>Samuel</hi> from the mouth of God himſelf had ſolemnly proteſted unto them, read their deſtiny, ſhewed them what would betide them, and that when it did happen, though they <hi>ſhould cry out in that day becauſe of their King which they had choſen, the Lord would not hear them,</hi> ver. 18. that yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe forewarnings, would yet reject God's Righteous and eaſy Government for a Heatheniſh; they were but juſtly ſerved, and their uſage afterwards was but a juſt recompence and reward of their rejection and folly: for <hi>Saul</hi> had never been <hi>King</hi> if they had not choſen him, and it was in wrath and diſpleaſure that God gratified them therein, as a puniſhment of their Folly and Rebellion, which is no Juſtification, but a Condemnation rather of that kind of Arbitrary Government; and therefore the ſame <hi>Prophet</hi> told them alſo, <hi>That if ſtill ye ſhall do wickedly, ye ſhall be conſumed, ye and your King;</hi> and ſo it proved.</p>
               <p>Thoſe our Teachers are but falſe Prophets, that teach, that the Right of Kings is ſet down by <hi>Samuel,</hi> chap. 8. and ought to be puniſhed; for neither did the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ever allow; or the Kings avow any ſuch power to be their juſt Right, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Story of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Naboth.</hi> Some indeed did exerciſe it, but that is no more a proof of the right thereof, than their practice of Adultery, Idolatry, or of any other ſin, was of the lawfulneſs of ſuch ſins. When <hi>Cambyſes</hi> deſigned to marry his Siſter, his <hi>Magi</hi> told him that no Law did allow it, yet there was a Law which did allow the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to do what he would. Juſt ſuch <hi>Magi</hi> are our Prieſts, that teach that there is no Law for Kings to Tyrannize or Oppreſs, yet if he do, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable. If this had been the right of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>lex Regia</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and the ſtrict injoyment of the perpetual reading, peruſing and obſerving the Book of the Law, was in vain and to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>What if the Rebellious, Stubborn and Stiff necked <hi>Jews, a fooliſh People and unwiſe,</hi> had a mind to be ſo governed? what doth it concern Chriſtians, thoſe that know better things, have more wit and more grace, and willing to enjoy the liberty and freedom that God hath given them in a Government where their Kings are ſolemnly obliged by Laws and Oaths, as well as themſelves, whereby their duties become reciprocal, and obedience due, and expected accordingly.</p>
               <p>Beſides, is it rational to believe any People except <hi>Jews</hi> (that to day will <hi>have a King</hi> like other Nations, and to morrow <hi>will not have this man rule over them,</hi> and that with curſed Imprications, <hi>Let his Blood be on us and our Children,</hi> which is ſtill executing even to this very day,) to be ſo ſottiſh to give Kings ſuch vaſt Revenues, and ſuch abſolute unqueſtionable Powers, as to <hi>whip them with Scorpions, and tear their Fleſh with Briars and Thorns</hi> impune, and none to ſay unto them, Why do you thus? O, but the Prophet tells you, <hi>Ye ſhall be his ſervants,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 17. True; and the Prophet tells you, their <hi>Kings ſhall miniſter unto thee,</hi> i. e. to the <hi>Church,</hi> Iſa. 60. 10. And thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, (i. e.</hi> The Church which ſhall be gathered by the Preaching of the Goſpel, which Church we are) and they <hi>ſhall bring thy Sons in their Arms, and thy Daughters ſhall be carried on their Shoulders. And Kings ſhall be thy Nurſing fathers (to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them in their Boſoms, as Nurſing-fathers beareth the ſucking Child,</hi> Numb. 11. 12.) <hi>and Queens ſhall be thy Nurſing-mothers; they ſhall bow down to thee with their Face towards the

Earth, and lick up the duſt of thy Feet,</hi> Iſa. 49. 22. 23. in which <hi>Church Chriſt her Head</hi> is always included, and always to be underſtood. As for the place in <hi>Samuel, ye ſhall be his Servants,</hi> it is but a foretelling and premonition that he would make them ſo, be it right or wrong; not that they had any juſt right to make them ſo, but be it ſo, what then, even then alſo there is a reciprocal duty between Maſters and Servants: <hi>Servants are to obey their Maſters in ſingleneſs of Heart as unto Chriſt, with good will, doing ſervice as unto the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6. 5, 6, 7, 8. So the Maſters are to do the like things unto them, <hi>forbearing Threatning, knowing alſo that your Maſter is in Heaven, neither is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons with him,</hi> ver. 9. Such Service all Subjects owe to their Princes, and other Services no Prince ought to command. <hi>Job</hi> who was the greateſt man of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſolemnly proteſted to God his Integrity towards his very Servants, <hi>If I did deſpiſe the cauſe of my Man-ſervant, or of my Maid-ſervant when they contended with me; what then ſhall I do, when God ariſeth up, and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him? Did not he that made me in the Womb make him? And did not one faſhion us in the Womb?</hi> ch. 31. 13, 14, 15. By which it is apparent that there are reciprocal duties between King and Subject, between Maſter and Servant. So the <hi>Gibeonites, who were ſent from the Elders, and all the Inhabitants of their Country, became Servants unto Iſrael, with whom all the Elders of the Congregation made a League with them, and did ſwear unto them, which though the</hi> Gibeonites <hi>got ſurreptitiouſly, yet they ſolemnly kept it, and would not ſmite them when they came before their Cities, becauſe the Princes of the Congregation had ſworn unto them,</hi> Joſh. 9. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>As there were Laws for Children, Strangers, Men-ſervants, and Maid-ſervants, ſo there were Laws for Kings, Parents, and Maſters by Gods own preſcription, and to be reciprocally obſerved; <hi>If a Stranger ſojourn with thee in your Land, ye ſhall not vex nor oppreſs him, but he ſhall be unto you as one born amongſt you, and thou ſhalt love him as thy ſelf, for ye were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>I am the Lord your God,</hi> Exod. 22. 21. 19.

Laws for the King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 17, 18, 19, 20. So <hi>Jerem.</hi> 22. 3, 4. Call to mind the bondage and cruel uſage of Gods own People the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who becauſe they were under no reciprocal Covenants, nor had power to relieve themſelves, therefore God himſelf ſtood up in quarrel of his own Covenant, and pleaded their cauſe, and brought them out of that <hi>Iron Furnace with a high hand, and ſtretched out Arm,</hi> in deſpight of the Lawleſs Hectoring <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom neither the Plague of Frogs, nor Lice, nor Flies, nor Murrain of Cattel, nor Boyls, nor Blains, nor Hail, nor Locuſts, nor loſs of Cattel, of Fruits, of Water, and of the Firſt-born of all the Land could prevail with him to let go his ſin, nor the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but will once more ruſh into the midſt of a wonderful deliverance of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and venture his own and his Peoples Lives; and for what? for but the bondage of his Enemies, and ſatisfaction of his Luſts. And if <hi>Herods</hi> Son ſtand in the way of his ambitious ſecurity, it were better be his Hog than his Child. <hi>Melius Herodis Porcum eſſe quam Filium,</hi> Macr. Satur. 72. So that the Advocates of Arbitrary Power muſt juſtify <hi>Pharoah</hi> in all his oppoſition againſt God, and oppreſſion of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Moreover <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had more to ſay for the Juſtification of his Tyranny, than ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Zamzummims can pretend to, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was under no tyes of Civil or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious engagements, no reciprocal Oaths between him and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but having them in Bondage, he ſeems to have ſomething like a right of impoſing his will for Law upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet accounted this Tyranny and Wickedneſs in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 3. 7, 8.

               <p>We all naturally love Domination and our Luſts better than our Lands; we had rather part with Thouſands of Rams, and Ten Thouſand Rivers of Oyl with the Fruit of our Bodies, than with the Sins of our Souls, which was the Leaven which fermented and boyled in the breaſts of theſe Lawleſs Hectors. And doth not the ſame leaven of Haughtineſs, of Oppreſſion and Revenge, ferment and boyl in the Hearts and Breaſts of thoſe in our days, who ſo rule and ſo reign and ravage over whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their Subjects? Is it probable that God who having ſeen the afflictions of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and heard their groaning, and after he had ſhewed wonders and ſigns in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Red-ſea, and in the Wilderneſs Forty Years, who for their ſakes <hi>ſmote great Nations, and ſlew mighty Kings,</hi> Sihon <hi>King of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>and</hi> Og <hi>King of</hi> Baſhan, <hi>and all the Kingdoms of</hi> Canaan, <hi>Thirty one in number,</hi> Joſh. 12, <hi>and gave their Land for an Heritage unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>his People,</hi> Pſal. 135. 10, 11, 12. <hi>and taught them Statutes and Judgments to do and govern themſelves by and in that good Land which he had given
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58061:38"/>
them in poſſoſſion which were ſo righteous that no Nation under Heaven had the like, and which all Nations would confeſs that this great Nation was a Wiſe and Underſtanding People, who hath God ſo nigh unto them?</hi> Is it probable I ſay that God after he had delivered them ſo miraculouſly from ſo great thraldoms (of <hi>quod libet licet)</hi> ſhould yet ſubject them to the like Lawleſs Perſons or Governments in the world? Examine all his Laws, obſerve all his Statutes, ſearch all his Judgments, and you'l not find any the leaſt footſteps that way tending, only he foretold them what their Kings would do; therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it was their juſt right ſo to do. And becauſe he ſaid they ſhall be his Servants, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 17. therefore he had Right to make them his Slaves, and uſe them like Bruits; whereas nothing probably is thereby meant more than that they ſhould be his <hi>Servants to pay Tribute,</hi> Gen. 49. 15. and to ſerve in his Army, when he went out to ſight their own Battels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 15. But if Slaves be meant thereby, yet it was violent and tyrannous, becauſe they had no Law of God or man to entitle them juſtly ſo to rule over them; ſo that the Prophet did only declare what they would do, not what was their Right to do. Now if it be lawful to cry unto God for deliverance, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo to uſe any rational lawful means and endeavours to extricate and relieve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They that will chooſe a King to the diſpleaſure of God Almighty, its but juſt they ſhould endure the <hi>Iron Furnace</hi> without his Relief. Can any men (not brutiſhly prepoſſed,) believe that God who never breaks his Covenants, but keeps them even with his greateſt Enemies and Rebels, even with the moſt ungrateful and ſtiff-necked <hi>Jews,</hi> and yet ſhould eſtabliſh a Right in Kings and Princes not only to break theirs, but to leave the People without a Remedy till Doomes-day in the Afternoon, till the day of Judgment; there's no doubt then but that they would be all of the <hi>Welſh</hi>-Mans mind, and cry, <hi>Let her alone till then, and drive on ſtill.</hi> When <hi>Samuel</hi> told the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the manner of the King that was to reign over them, was it any more or other than what <hi>Eliſha</hi> told <hi>Hazael</hi> when he ſhould be King what he would do unto the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> viz. <hi>Their Strong Holds wilt thou ſet on Fire, and their Young Men wilt thou ſlay with the Sword, and will daſh their Children, and rip up their Women with Child.</hi> Did <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> by this his Propheſy declare, that <hi>Hazael</hi> when a King had juſt right ſo to do? <hi>Surely no;</hi> for <hi>Hazael</hi> being convinced of the contrary, with great Indignation anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>What is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do this great thing,</hi> 2 Kings 8. 12. 13. And yet to urge <hi>Samuel</hi> for proving an unlimiting power to be of right in Kings to do what they liſt uncontrolably, what is it leſs then matchleſs Impudence and horrible Impiety? When the <hi>Prophet</hi> Jeremiah <hi>told</hi> Coniah, <hi>this hath been thy manner from thy Youth, that thou obeyeſt not my voice,</hi> Jer. 22. 21. Did he by telling him of that wicked manner and cuſtom of his, in not obeying his voice, reproach him, or declare a right that he had to do ſo? No more did <hi>Samuel</hi> by telling the <hi>Jews</hi> the manner of the <hi>Heathen Kings</hi> derive a right to the <hi>Jewiſh Kings</hi> ſo to do; but be the true meaning what it will, what doth it concern Chriſtians, who chooſe Kings, Princes, Dukes, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Captains general from among themſelves, grant them Commiſſions, give them Tribute, grant them Powers, oblige them by ſolemn Oaths to govern (it's true) in their own names, but <hi>by their Power</hi> conferred on them and for their Goods, which if they abuſe, it devolves and returns back to them who gave it, and they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt themſelves of it, in which God concerns not himſelf immediately with it, either by <hi>Dreams,</hi> or <hi>Viſion,</hi> or by <hi>Urim,</hi> or by <hi>Prophets,</hi> but hath 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 6. given them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Precepts in holy Writ to govern themſelves by, <hi>to chooſe able men, ſuch as fear God, Men of Truth, hating Covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over themſelves, &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 18. 21. and hath given <hi>Laws and Bounds to Kings, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 17. 17, 18, 19. which Laws tho' they moſt particularly concern Kings, yet they are not thereby diſobliged from the
obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from all the other Laws of God, to which the whole race of Mankind without reſpect of Perſons is bound to obſerve and keep; ſo that ſince the days of the Prophets the Chriſtians neither ask a King by them, neither do receive any one by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate appointment, <hi>but make Kings of one from among themſelves</hi> according to the Law of Nature, and of Nations, obſerving Gods holy Laws and Precepts. When <hi>Samuel</hi> 1. 10. 25. told the People the manner of the Kingdom, he wrote it in a Book, which Book ſay the Hebrew Doctors the Kings either tore or burnt, that they might more freely tyrannize.</p>

Text or Syllable in the whole Bible (maugre all falſe gloſſes) that concludes any thing for Kings being unaccountable unto human Judgments, or that they have an abſolute Power, or Divine Prerogative: So that in ſumm, The Pulpits and <hi>Leviathan</hi> are ſo far agreed, as to dogmatize Lyes and falſe Doctrines, for to juſtifie that Kings (maugre all mutual and reciprocal Laws, Pacts, and Covenants,) may act and govern how they pleaſe: And to juſtifie and aſſert, that they ought not ſo to Govern, but to obſerve the Laws of God, of Nature, and of Men; but yet if they do not, they are notwithſtanding reſponſible and accountable to none on Earth but to God only for their ſo doing; which in truth differ in their conſequences no more than Herring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do from Fiſher-men, and both ſtink in the Noſtrils both of God and of all good Men, as deſtructive to the well being and good Government of all human Societies, and have no ſound Foundation in the <hi>Law of God,</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but are contrary to them all; for <hi>ſans</hi> doubt, <hi>they that have Authority to give and apply Power to this or that Perſon, have Authority alſo to conſure his Actions againſt the Law of Nature.</hi> 1. Self-preſervation (than which nothing is more dear, and which Nature ſeeks by all means and endeavours to preſerve as inviolable) is common to a Man, with all other Animals, (if you tread but upon a Worm it will turn; and if it have a Sting, or a Fangue, or a Poiſon, have at you.) 2. Then whatſoever may conduce to its other Happineſs of its well-being, it labours to obtain them, and to avoid the contrary, and to hate and revenge the Oppoſers, ſo that <hi>vim vi repellere</hi> is as natural to Man as to all other Animals. Other Laws of Natural conſequence implanted and grafted in him in his firſt Creation for the better Reglement of Communities throughout the whole World, as <hi>to do good to all, to hurt no Innocents, to keep Covenants, Promiſes, and Contracts faithfully, to contribute their utmoſt to procure the Happineſs of the whole</hi> of that Kingdom, that Commonwealth, or that Society, or Community, whereof they are Members. All which are utterly confounded and deſtroyed by ſuch <hi>Leviathan</hi> Pulpit Doctrines. 3. It's againſt the Law of Men and Nations, for where ever there are Laws between Kings and People (wherein <hi>Salus Populi</hi> is ever to be preſumed to be the <hi>Supreme Law,</hi> for that God made the whole Creation not only for the Neceſſities, but for the Delights alſo of the whole Race of Mankind in general, and equally, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons,) ſolemnly made, and ſworn unto by mutual conſent; there they do mutually, reciprocally and ſolemnly bind each other: And the Sword placed in the Magiſtrates hand, is not as the material Sword in the hand of <hi>Alexander,</hi> not to untie but to cut the Traces of that fatal <hi>Gordian Chariot;</hi> but <hi>the eſtabliſht Laws are the true Sword</hi> to which both King and People muſt ſubmit, and be reſponſible; if otherwiſe, making of Laws were but <hi>Leonis Catulum alere.</hi> vid.

               <p>Some places of Scripture are urged, though of very little force when brought to the Teſt and well examined.

Hands to relieve themſelves by any lawful means and endeavours, and pray to God to bleſs their endeavours, and ſo by their prayers and endeavours to co-operate together: 'tis an Appeal to God to judg between him and his Enemies. And is it not lawful, nay, the duty of all States and Kingdoms to make the like Appeals and Supplications to God Almighty? It's probable that <hi>David</hi> wrote this <hi>Pſalm</hi> when he was troubled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> even after he was anointed of God, and becauſe he did then make Supplications and Appeal to <hi>Jonathan</hi> for his life, if <hi>there be iniquity in me ſlay me thy ſelf, for why ſhouldst thou bring me to thy Father?</hi> Will it follow therefore that court was to be made to <hi>Jonathan</hi> only? I doubt not. This is a great Example and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe that are falſly accuſed to appeal to God by Prayers and Supplications for help; and the reaſons that follow are great, <hi>viz. thine Eyes behold the things that are equal, and he tries the heart,</hi> verſe 2, 3.

Are not ſuch Doctrines encouragements to <hi>Kings to lift up their Hearts above their Brethren?</hi> againſt which God hath forewarned and forbid them, that they might know themſelves to be but Men. God <hi>made his own Sabbath for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath,</hi> and hath he not made Kings ſo too? <hi>Moſes</hi> was a <hi>King</hi> with Supreme Power. Well, what then? and ſo let all Kings have if they have the ſame Warrant, Commiſſion, acceſs and freedom with God Almighty, to have conſtant recourſe unto him to carry the Cauſes of their People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and receive his Commands, and communicate them to the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and proſecute them as punctually as he did, and be as faithful in his Houſe as he was. But though <hi>Moſes</hi> had this great and mighty Power, being as it were God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, <hi>ſpeaking unto God, and God anſwering him,</hi> Exod. 19. 19. yet it no where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that <hi>quod libet licet,</hi> that he could do what he liſt, and be accountable to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It's true, the People came to him to ask counſel of God for them, but not to do his own commands without God's commands and advice firſt had; and all this was but to teach them the Ordinances and Laws, and ſhew them the way wherein they were to walk, and the works they were to do, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 20. not to oppreſs, or injure them, or tyrannize over them to give Laws, not receive or be obliged by any them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 144. 14. 15. to make Laws to bind King and People, and yet Kings to break them <hi>impune,</hi> when the very Laws themſelves do not exempt them, is very ill becoming reaſonable men, and that all but Kings ſhould be puniſhed for the breach of them is wicked and unjuſt. It may happen in all Kingdoms (moſt probably in thoſe that are Haereditary,) that ſome Kings may be Idiots, or mad, or follow mad Councils and Adviſors, (a crime of the ſame Leaven,) as did <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and muſt whole Kingdoms then alſo be ſubject to their Tyranny, <hi>to be chaſtized not with Whips but with Scorpions, without</hi> making uſe of their power to extricate themſelves out of their hardſhips and miſeries? Is it not then natural to cry, <hi>What Portion have we in</hi> David? <hi>We have no Inheritance in the Son of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>every man to your Tents,</hi> withdraw your Services, withhold your Tributes, fight not againſt the Intereſt of your Nation; <hi>and now</hi> David <hi>ſee to thine own houſe,</hi> 2 Chron. 10. 16. Though Kings have the great title, yet the Laws are to govern both them and their Subjects, and though all Laws run in their names, yet they cannot do what they liſt, but as he is to command according to Law, ſo his Subjects are to obey him according to Law, not againſt Law.</p>
               <p>Doth God himſelf keep Covenant for ever, and never break any; and ſhall Kings who claim their Titles and Powers from him, take greater liberty and freedom to break the Covenants and Agreements with their Subjects than God himſelf, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be unaccountable? I doubt they themſelves would not accept ſuch a Plea from their own Ambaſſadors or Miniſters tranſgreſſing their Commiſſions. Had the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> power to caſt off their corrupt Judges, (a Government well pleaſing to God himſelf, and to chooſe them another form of Government even Kingly (contrary to the mind even of God himſelf,) and did not God gratify them therein, though they rejected not <hi>Samuel</hi> only, but God himſelf thereby, <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7, 8. <hi>For he gave them a King in his anger, and took him away in his wrath,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 11. Had they ſuch power under the Law, and have not Chriſtians the ſame under the Goſpel? if not, ſhew when, where, and by whom it was taken away. Certainly whoever ſets up himſelf to be ſupream and above all Laws, or to be accountable to none but to God for breach of them, doth as much as in him lies make himſelf an Idol or a ſtrange God to be revered without contradiction. <hi>If</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>erect his Prodigious Idol, muſt all People, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Languages fall down and worſhip it? Gideon</hi> whom the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, <hi>Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy Son, and thy Sons Son alſo,</hi> but <hi>Gideon</hi> anſwered, <hi>I will not Rule over you, neither ſhall my Son rule over you, the Lord ſhall Rule over you,</hi> Judg. 8. 22, 23. By which it appears that <hi>Gideon</hi> by this Commiſſion was as Supream, and had as large Powers as any <hi>King had,</hi> or as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could give him, without formal Covenants or Laws to tye him up; and yet his Anſwer is a document upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Record for ever to all Kings and Princes, <hi>that it is not the right of Men to domineer over Men,</hi> but it belongs and appertains to God only, to rule without controll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And indeed it's both againſt the law of nature, and precept divine, <hi>for Kings ſo to lift up their hearts above their Brethren,</hi> as to rule over them Rigorouſly, Uncontrolably; for God created them all equal, and we ſhall all ſtand in an equal diſtance before Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, where there ſhall be no reſpect of Perſons. What difference and diſtance of ſtations and of honours there is amongſt us, is from our ſelves, and of our own framing, <hi>naked came we into the World, and naked ſhall we return. It is ill,</hi> very ill, <hi>offending little ones whoſe Angels do always behold the face of God
in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18. 10. By all which it manifeſtly appears, that the <hi>Moſaick Kings and Judges</hi> were equally obliged to keep the Laws, together with the reſt of the People, and that there is not any one Law ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the old or new Teſtament that makes any exception or exemption, or to free one more than another from cenſure, if a Tranſgreſſor either againſt God or Man.</p>
               <p>To aſſert that God hath reſerved to his own Tribunal the puniſhment of Kings and Princes more than others, ſo as to free them from being called to an account and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured here on Earth, is a falſe Maxime without ſound reaſon, or good authority: Examine the Goſpel, and ſee if that doth allow that which the Law doth not, and whether the <hi>Divine Herald of Liberty</hi> inward and outward, or civil to all Chriſtians, do deliver us up alſo Captives and Slaves to Tyrant Princes, without a power or liberty to extricate our ſelves from ſuch Slavery and Thraldom. We read in the <hi>Goſpel that Chriſt at his coming ſhould ſcatter the Proud Imaginations of their Hearts, and put down the Mighty from their Thrones,</hi> Luke 1. 51, 52. but no where that he did eſtabliſh the Thrones of Tyrants for good government. <hi>Chriſt himſelf was born under Tyrants, ſuffered under them, made himſelf of no Reputation, took upon him the form of a Servant, and thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us an honeſt and juſt liberty, as to bear with patient minds a neceſſitated ſervitude;</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58061:41"/>
but we no where read that he took away from us our juſt powers of procuring our own Liberties when oppreſſed, but rather confirmed them. <hi>Art thou called being a Servant, care not for it, but if thou mayſt be made Free uſe it rather. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the Servants of Men.</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 21, 23. In vain therefore is the example of Chriſt brought for our enduring of ſuch ſervitude, <hi>who by the price of his Servitude purchaſed and confirmed our civil Liberties; Chriſt having asked</hi> Peter <hi>at</hi> Capernaum, <hi>of whom do the Kings of the Earth take Custom or Tribute, of their own Children (i. e.</hi> their Citizens) <hi>or of Strangers? (i. e.</hi> though under a conquerred condition;) <hi>Peter ſaith, of Strangers. Jeſus ſaith unto him, then are the Children free; notwithſtanding, leaſt we ſhould offend them, pay for me and thee.</hi> Matt. 17. 25, 26, 27. Thus much rationally and naturally may from hence be concluded, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt and <hi>Peter</hi> as private Perſons paid Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> though they had no obligation to pay it, nor <hi>Caeſar</hi> any juſt right to require it; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would give no offence, but would be at quiet, and avoid trouble, Chriſt did command payment. But from hence it never can be concluded, that whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Commonwealths, being unjuſtly oppreſſed with exorbitant Taxes contrary to Law, and without their conſent are therefore obliged to pay them, or that they are thereby forbid or hindred to right and relieve themſelves. Whether by Children are meant the Citizens or Subjects of Kings, according to ſome, or by Children be meant the Children of God, the whole Race of Chriſtians according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> it matters not if <hi>Peter</hi> was of the Children or Citizens, he was therefore free. We alſo (Chriſt teſtifying) are free likewiſe either as Citizens or as Chriſtians. God certainly would never give his Vicegerents or <hi>Patres Patriae</hi> (as they deſire to be eſteemed) authority to oppreſs thoſe whom he would not tyrannize over himſelf, and for whom he made the whole Creation for their comfort and ſolace; no nor yet ſo unlimited Powers, as that if they did oppreſs or tyrannize, they ſhould by no means for ſuch their Tyranny be queſtioned, which is an abſurdity of the ſame nature as great as the other. Is it not a wonderful injury to Gods infinite wiſdom, grace and goodneſs towards man, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God ſhould appoint Kingly Government, and oblige him to keep Laws for the well government of his Charge as his Vicegerents, for whoſe good he is ſet over them, and yet at the ſame time if he violate them all, he may do it without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction till the day of Judgment, and to aggrevate the injury, they endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that injury by wreſting his own word, by coyning evaſions, and creating ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to overſhaddow the true and genuine meaning thereof, and foyſting falſe gloſſes upon them. No doubt but when a fair opportunity offereth it ſelf to an oppreſſed People, to extricate themſelves out of any Tyranny, <hi>Gods Providence is therein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and its their own fault if they make not uſe of it.</hi> Is not Gods Image as manifeſtly ſeen in man, as <hi>Caeſars</hi> on the Coyn? Is not as much reſpect and regard to be ſhewed to Gods Image as to <hi>Caeſars?</hi> I appeal to all rational men, if it be not an injury of the ſame nature to give Kings and Princes power to do what they liſt, or to ſwear them to keep Laws, and yet in the ſame breath to leave them accountable to God only at the day of Judgment, and ſo leave the governed to be without remedy. <hi>Caeſars</hi> have their Rights, and the People have their Rights alſo. <hi>Caeſars</hi> are the Miniſters of God to the People for their good, and to ſee that all render to all their reciprocal dues, not to take them away from them; and in thoſe things wherein they miniſter otherwiſe, <hi>they are not Miniſters</hi> of God but of the Devil. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. 7.</p>
               <p>The Liberty and Freedom of the People is their propriety both by the Law of God and nature, born with them, and ought not to be defrauded or deprived thereof by any ſubtilties; but the rights and powers of Kings over the People are given them by the People, either expreſsly or implyed, and to be always underſtood for their good; the Inſcription upon Coins doth not confer any more right to Kings than unto the People, it only denotes its intrinſick value, and that it is pure, and without baſe mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or allay. Chriſt therefore in this place did not ſo much demonſtrate Subjects duty towards Kings, as to tax the Phariſees, who feigned themſelves Juſt Men, and took council to entangle him in his talk, cogging with him, crying, <hi>Thou art true, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way of God in truth,</hi> &amp;c. of malice and wickedneſs deſigning to betray him, by taking hold of his words, that ſo they might deliver him to the power and authority of the Governor, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 20. and therefore put that captious queſtion to him, <hi>is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give Tribute to</hi> Caeſar <hi>or is it not?</hi> But he knowing their Hypocriſy, anſwered them accordingly, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 14. 15. Thus ſophiſtically by falſe reaſonings and counterſeit gloſſes on plain Texts of Scripture, what is it leſs, or other then to repreſent the great God of Heaven and of Earth a Deceiver of his People, whilſt he ſets Kings over us as his Miniſters for our good, and yet at the ſame time to allow them a Latitude to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58061:41"/>
over them at their pleaſure without controll: <hi>Can men gather Figs of Thiſtles, or Grapes of Brambles?</hi> then may theſe men gather ſuch falſe concluſions from ſuch right premiſſes as cannot yield them. Its undeniable that God never gave any Power to Kings and Princes but what is juſt and right, and equal. <hi>Righteouſneſs and Judgment are the Baſis and eſtabliſhment of his own Throne,</hi> and ſhall Kings pretend to govern otherwiſe? When the <hi>Phariſees</hi> pretending kindneſs (but deſigning miſchief) to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> adviſed him to <hi>depart out of their Coaſts, for that</hi> Herod <hi>ſought to kill him,</hi> Luke 13. 32, 33. Chriſt did not depart, nor yet return any low pittiful anſwer, but boldly anſwered, <hi>Go tell that Fox, I do caſt out Devils, and do cures to day and to morrow,</hi> &amp;c. thereby intimating, that Kings have no lawful Power to wrong their Subjects, or to hinder any from doing good to others, or their duty towards God, though by Fox-like adviſoes they uſurp domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion beyond all juſt right, and that God himſelf eſteems them no other, or better than Bruits according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 20. <hi>Man that is in honour, and underſtandeth not, is like the Beaſts that periſh,</hi> now what is here meant by underſtanding, is declared by <hi>Job the greateſt man of the Eaſt,</hi> Job 28. 28. <hi>The fear of the Lord that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil that is underſtanding.</hi> So <hi>David a King</hi> tells us the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 10. and ſo <hi>King Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. <hi>ch.</hi> 10. with promiſes of great Bleſſings, <hi>He that feareth the Lord, his ſoul ſhall dwell at eaſe, and his ſeed ſhall inherit the Earth, and the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25. 12, 13, 14. All other wordly wiſdom that hath not reſpect to eternity, is but fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bruitiſh, and the eſteem that God himſelf hath of the greateſt men on earth without this wiſdom, is but as that of Bruits. So <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> eſteemed the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> but as a <hi>generation of Vipers,</hi> Matth. 3. 7. So <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Jeremy</hi> to the voluptuous, <hi>when he had fed them to the full, they then committed Adultery, and aſſemble themſelves by Troops in Harlots Houſes, they were as fed Horſes,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 5. 8. So <hi>David, Dogs have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me, the aſſembly of the wicked have encloſed me,</hi> Pſal. 22. 16. So <hi>Iſaiah calls ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and blind Watchmen Dogs, ye greedy Dogs,</hi> Iſaiah 56. 10, 11. And Chriſt forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them <hi>not to give that which is holy unto Dogs, neither caſt Pearl before Swine,</hi> Matth. 7. 6. So was <hi>Paul</hi>'s caution to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Beware of Dogs, beware of evil work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> whereby it is apparent that <hi>there is no mean between a Saint and a Bruit,</hi> be they great or ſmall, rich or poor; Heaven and Hell will divide the whole world, without reſpect of Perſons. And therefore the advice of <hi>David a King</hi> is to be followed, <hi>Be ye not like Horſe and Mule which have no underſtanding,</hi> Pſal. 32. 9. <hi>A Bruitiſh man knoweth not, neither doth a Fool underſtand this,</hi> Pſal. 92. 6. All the Machiavilians and Leviathans, and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Pulpiteers of the world and their Council, without ſuch underſtanding, are but as Bruits and Bruitiſh, void of true ſenſe and underſtanding.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſt ſuffered under a Tyrant; true, but how could be ſuffer but under a Tyrant, that feared neither God nor Man? Chriſt came into the world in the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and to ſuffer; what for?</hi> not to bring us under, but to free us from the yoke of Bondage both Spiritual and Temporal. <hi>Conſider well the anſwer which</hi> Chriſt <hi>gave to the</hi> Mother of <hi>Zebedee's</hi> Children, <hi>deſiring</hi> that her two Sons might ſit the one on his right, the other on his left hand in his Kingdom. <hi>viz.</hi> Ye know that the Princes of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> exerciſe dominion over them, and they that are great exerciſe Authority over them; but it ſhall not be ſo among you, but whoever will be great among you, let him be your Servant, even as the Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s <hi>Sons</hi> dreaming of a Kingdom, that Chriſt ſhould ſuddenly have on Earth, and affecting to be chief in that Kingdom and next unto him, there aroſe among them a ſtrife, <hi>(through Pride cometh Contention)</hi> who ſhould be greateſt among them, whence that proud demand <hi>that one might ſit on his right hand, and the other on his left.</hi> But Chriſt gently rebuked their proud aſpiring humour, and in them all Chriſtians, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Princes of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did domineer and play <hi>Rex</hi> among their Brethren, (a temper very ill beſeeming Chriſtians,) but it ſhall not be ſo among you (in whom the ſpirit of the living God ſhould dwell,) <hi>but whoever will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter, and whoever will be chief among you, let him be your Servant;</hi> and made himſelf the great exemplar of ſo great humility, <hi>who came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter,</hi> of which he gave real teſtimony through the whole courſe of his life, firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down from Heaven his Imperial Reſidence, then refuſing to be made a King here on Earth, when 5000 <hi>deſigned to have taken him by force to have made him a King.</hi> Then <hi>by waſhing his Diſciples feet, breaking Bread unto them.</hi> And to conſummate all, <hi>he became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to death, even that ſhameful death, the death of the Croſs, for us men and for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> and indeed the whole courſe of his Life was but adminiſtration of all good to all, Rich or Poor, without reſpect of Perſons, which is the proper duty of all Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58061:42"/>
But it ſhall not be ſo among you; <hi>i. e.</hi> Proud and aſpiring domination ought not to be among Chriſtians, though they bear the glorious Titles of <hi>Evargitae</hi> or Benefactors, nay of Emperors, Kings or Princes. Kings, Chriſtians eſpecially, though Kings by name and title, yet in truth are but <hi>Servants to the governed.</hi> So <hi>Moſes,</hi> who certainly had as great and as unqueſtionable authority over the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as ever mortal had, to whom God himſelf did dictate Laws, yet did he never proudly domineer over them, (tho' provoked to the uttermoſt, ſo that he deſired God to kill him, that he might not ſee his wretchedneſs) to their prejudice or detriment, but did bear the <hi>burden of them all, carried them in his boſom as a nurſing Father beareth the nurſing Child,</hi> and pleaded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately with God himſelf to ſave them from deſtruction, when the <hi>Fire of the Lord was conſuming them at</hi> Taberah, and prevailed: worthy the imitation of all thoſe who ſtile themſelves Gods Vicegerents: then ſhould the governed have no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>no complaining in our Streets,</hi> but ſhould <hi>every man ſit quietly under his own Vine and under his own Fig-tree.</hi> So <hi>Plato</hi> called Magiſtrates not Lords, but Miniſters and Servants of the <hi>People,</hi> and calleth the <hi>People</hi> not Servants but <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,</hi> as thoſe that allow and give them in gratitude and recompence for their ſervice, wherewithal to keep a Kingly State and Grandeur, and depute them alſo their Conſervators and Executioners of their Laws. So <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls them Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Keepers of their Laws; the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> call them <hi>Ministers</hi> both of the Laws of God and of the People; and no doubt but they are ſo, and therefore they ought to be as Faithful as was <hi>Moſes</hi> in not deviating from Gods Commandments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt in the Scriptures is not againſt Superiority, Kingſhip, Government or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but againſt the haughty and inſolent deportment and tyrannical abuſe of the power committed to their charge, as the Heathen Princes did, which he rebukes here, intimating that ſo to govern,</hi> is to rule over others to their own hurt, <hi>and that to ſuch, a Wo is denounced,</hi> Wo to them that decree unrighteous Decrees, and that write grievouſneſs, which they have preſcribed, to turn aſide the Needy from Judgment, and to take away the right from the Poor, that Widdows may be their Prey, and that they may rob the Fatherleſs.

               <p>Sometimes the very Form of Government may be vicious and faulty, ſometimes they that obtain the Power may be ſo; which may proceed from Men and from the Devil. <hi>And the Devil taking Jeſus up into a high Mountain, ſhewed unto him all the Kingdoms of the World in a moment of time. And the Devil ſaid unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them; for that is delivered unto me, and to whomſoever I will I give it.</hi> Hence is he called <hi>the Prince of this World,</hi> John 12. 30. &amp; 14. 31. Rev. 13. 2. <hi>The Dragon gave unto the Beaſt Power, and his Throne, and great Authority; yea the God of the World,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. Wherefore when it is written <hi>that there is no Power but of God,</hi> it is always to be underſtood, <hi>not of all Powers whatſoever, but of all lawful Powers,</hi> ſuch as he there deſcribed; and of the Powers themſelves, <hi>not always of the Perſons that have the Power.</hi> So St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the Powers that are, are ordained of God, <hi>who by his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and by the expreſs Warrant of his Ordinance never ordained any but what were good and behooful for the governed;</hi> therefore the Apoſtle in this place will be underſtood of lawful Powers: God may and doth permit unlawful Powers for the puniſhment of wicked doers, even by wicked Men, which are God's Sword, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordained ſuch but as his Rod, and Scourges. Wickedneſs, and Vice, and Sin, <hi>being things inordinate, it's not poſſible that God ſhould Ordain them, and yet be ſinful and vitious ſtill:</hi> he that <hi>reſiſteth</hi> the Power, <hi>(viz.</hi> lawful Power) <hi>reſiſteth the Ordinance of God;</hi> which Precept equally binds and obligeth Kings as well as Subjects that reſiſt, or tranſgreſs, or obſtruct the Laws, or endeavour to ſham them either by Force or coining Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I appeal to Heaven, if they that reſiſt Powers not lawful, or abuſers or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turners of lawful Powers, do reſiſt the Ordinance of God or not? I do think that no Man in his right ſenſes will ſay ſo. The Apoſtle yet makes it more plain, that he treats of lawful Powers, when he ſays, that Rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil: <hi>And he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good, for he beareth not the Sword in vain: a revenger to execute wrath on them that do evil.</hi> Who, unleſs Heathens, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of profligated Conſciences will refuſe to be ſubject to ſuch Powers, not only <hi>out of fear of puniſhment,</hi> but <hi>for Conſcience ſake?</hi> for without Civil Government, not poſſible to live in Peace and Happineſs. But what Power, what Magiſtrates ſoever ordains or acts contrary can never properly be ſaid to be ordained, <hi>i. e.</hi> allowed and approved of God; and therefore this is no Precept, no Command to yield Obedience to ſuch; neither is it any Precept or Command to forbid us prudently to reſiſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and right our ſelves; for in ſuch caſes we do not reſiſt the Powers, but human Errors of Kings and Princes; nor the Magiſtrates that are ordained of God, who ought to be ſuch as the Apoſtles decipher; but either Uſurpers, or Tyrants, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Truſt repoſed in them, who yet notwithſtanding, if they muſt be termed Magiſtrates in that only they have Power to vex, revenge, and ravage over God's People; by the very ſelf-ſame <hi>Logick,</hi> the Devil is our Magiſtrate. Of one thing only there can be but one true definition; if therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth here rightly define Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy

and Magiſtrates, (as he doth moſt accurately) then certainly by the ſame words he cannot define Tyranny, Oppreſſion, Male-Government, things Diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſité and contrary one to the other; then certainly to ſuch Magiſtrates only as the Apoſtles here deſcribes do we owe Subjection, Tribute, Honour, &amp;c. and not to their contrary. Reaſons aſſigned are; <hi>For this cauſe pay you Tribute alſo, for they are God's Miniſters, attending continually on this very thing: render therefore, &amp;c. The labourer is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his hire:</hi> and they that hire ought to have their ſervice, and work well done: ſo that if Magiſtrates fail of their Duty, Subjects may ſlacken their Tribute, which is given them only as a recompence of their Watchfulneſs, Pains, and Care in well Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning: Therefore ſimple and abſolute ſubjection is not here required, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with reaſon ſubjoyned, which reaſons are the Rule and Square of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

               <p>But yet the ſaid Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> in the ſame Sermon, <hi>pag.</hi> 11, 12. is pleaſed with great confidence to Pulpit it, <hi>That thoſe that hold ſuch Opinions, are but a few deluded Creatures in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and a handful of zealous Fools in the reformed Churches:</hi> a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cenſure on ſo many great and learned Men. I much wonder at his daring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence thus to cenſure; and, which is worſt, to imploy his Prieſthood and his Pulpit to rail and to delude his Congregation and the World with Paralogiſms, and falſe gloſſes, and miſapplications of plain Texts of Scripture as he hath done, contrary to the very duty of his Prieſthood, which is to feed us with Wiſdom and Knowledge, and not to prevaricate and juggle with plain Texts. To inſtance only in that golden Sentence (as he calls it) of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, viz. touch not my anointed,</hi> Pſalm 105. 15. which very Text, though more particularly ſpoken of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> his Servant, and of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> his choſen, yet it is ſo clearly, and undeniably applicable to God's People in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in whom is all his delight, and not of Kings in particular, that it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; nay, it is a reproof even to Kings themſelves, <hi>viz. He ſuffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved Kings for their ſakes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm,</hi> verſe 14, 15. which alſo is reinforced, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 149. <hi>For the Lord taketh pleaſure in his People, and will put a two-edged Sword in their Hands to bind their Kings in Chains, and their Nobles with Fetters of Iron, to execute upon them the judgment written, This honour have all his Saints.</hi> What is this but to <hi>betray,</hi> and <hi>ſmother,</hi> and <hi>reproach Truth it ſelf?</hi> very ill becoming Prieſts of the moſt high God. He hath done as much by other Texts, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 4. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. &amp; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. And indeed moſt Texts he quotes he diſſembles, and puts falſe gloſſes upon them. But let theſe paſs. I only wonder how Prieſts dare be ſo ſawcy with the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Neither is it true, as often objected, That infinite ſcandals would ariſe and grow from ſuch Doctrines on the Chriſtian Religion: but it is true that they would grow out of the contrary; for ſo ſhould Tyranny be brought into Commonwealths: which as a publick fault is more pernitious. Even as no more is it true, that by this Doctrine there would grow confuſions in Families, Cities, and Kingdoms, becauſe every one might defend himſelf from the Sergeants, from the Comito in Gallies, and from the Prince, who would force them to pay Impoſitions and Taxes not granted by publick conſent.</p>
               <p>For indifferences between Princes and Subjects, both cannot have right on their ſides, but of neceſſity, that <hi>if they who uſe force do it lawfully, the defence must be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and where the force is unlawful, the defence of neceſſity muſt be lawful:</hi> and therefore <hi>vim vi repellere licet,</hi> is always to be underſtood of that force which is unjuſty uſed.

This is a Remedy, but when unjuſt, and prejudicial, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Liberty which God hath given to the governed, but alſo to their Lives, Goods, and Honours, they are not bound to uſe it; and by reaſon of prejudicing another, they ſhould ſin if they ſhould uſe it.

That Subjects muſt be admoniſhed that they make not themſelves more ſubject than is convenient, lest they are inforced to flatter them in their Vices, whoſe ſubjects they make themſelves more than they ſhould.</hi> Beſides, one <hi>abuſe of Power and Authority</hi> gives a greater ſcandal to the World, and is a cauſe of greater miſchiefs than <hi>many diſobediences;</hi> and the Prince, as more eminent, is much more bound by his greater Obligation to God to do his duty. Kings that have a ſerious intent to live Chriſtianly in good earneſt, will be careful to obſerve the Commandments of God, and that they be preferred before his own.</p>
               <p>Theſe Doctrines of <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> have of late been very bitterly controverted by our Spiritual Guides, and Mr. <hi>Miles Barne</hi> tells us, That it is the duty of private Men to ſubmit their judgments in matters of Religion to the determinations of thoſe whom God hath conſtituted to be their Spiritual Guides and Governors, in his Sermon preached before his Majeſty, <hi>October</hi> 17. 1675. which undeniably is falſe Doctrine, (and makes us not their Diſciples but their Slaves,) and we are never the nearer the Truth if we do. For <hi>Preſter John</hi> may believe with <hi>Julian;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> with <hi>Jovian,</hi> both Spiritual Guides, and ſo the Poſition ſatisfied, and yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie as indeterminable and as far undeſided as before. And for certain private Men are no more obliged to believe their Spiritual Guides becauſe ſuch, than Spiritual Guides are obliged to believe private Men; but both the one and the other are to be believed or disbelieved according to the Doctrines they do deliver are true or falſe. But this is not the only falſe Doctrine he hath preached. Beſides his faculty of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe Doctrine, he excels in the faculty of Railing, and dares to Pulpit more againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> than <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel durſt do againſt the Devil;</hi> for in his Sermon on <hi>Luke</hi> 19. he tells us, <hi>That amongſt Phanaticks and Atheiſts, transformed into malicious Fiends by the Helliſh Divinity of that Monſter of a Prieſt the Author of</hi> Julian the Apoſtate, <hi>whoſe whole Book is as great an Apoſtacy from the practice of Primitive Chriſtians, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Obedience delivered by Chriſt and his Apostles, and Chriſtianity it ſelf, as ever the</hi> Apoſtate Julian <hi>was guilty of,</hi> pag. 19. In which he is not alone, being called by others impudent, unskilful, profligate Wretch, and mercenary Scribler, which are ſtones on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not confutations.</p>
               <p>The practice of former Ages is much urged for juſtification of their Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and amongſt them the <hi>Thaebaean Legion</hi> is their great exemplar; who, I doubt not, but had in proſpect, that of Chriſts Kingdom there was no end, that they ſhould reap if they fainted not, that their Combate was to be but ſhort, their Victory ſure, their Crowns ſafe, their Triumph eternal, that God's Grace was all ſufficient here to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, and his Glory all-ſufficient hereafter to reward them, and ſo cheerfully <hi>laid down their Lives at the Emperors unjuſt commands, and died Martyrs.</hi> But not to derogate from their dying according to the dictates of their Conſciences, I humbly conceive, and am of Opinion, that they had been more truly valiant for the Truth, and done more right to Chriſtian Religion, and leſs guilty of being <hi>Felones de ſe,</hi> that having ſo much Power in their hands as they had, and ſuch advantages of the Emperor (he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in ſtraights,) if they had appealed unto the Lord of Hoaſts, by ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Guard, and defended themſelves. For as the Emperor had no juſt Authority to command them to ſacrifice to Idols, ſo they had no Obligation to obey his unjuſt commands; and therefore the <hi>Force being unlawful, the Defence muſt of neceſſity be juſt and lawful.</hi> Moreover, this very Hiſtory is by many learned Men accounted but a meer Fable, and ſo can do them no courteſie, there being no Hiſtorian that mentions it in above Two hundred years after it was ſaid to have happened.</p>

So <hi>Step dame Julia</hi> moſt impudently to <hi>Baſſianus the Emperor,</hi> her Son in Law, as <hi>before;</hi> and ſo acted <hi>Juſtinian</hi> (the greateſt Tyrant according to <hi>Procopius</hi> that ever was,) and his Strumpet <hi>Theodora,</hi> taken from off the Stage to be <hi>Empreſs,</hi> and acted more like Furies than Pious and Rational Creatures, <hi>ſhe influencing</hi> Juſtinian <hi>by her Magick and Intelligence with the Devil,</hi> according to the ſame <hi>Procopius,</hi> unfit Patterns for Chriſtian Emperors to imitate, but very fit for <hi>Leviathan</hi> and his Prieſtly complices to juſtify and live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                  <hi>So</hi> Lucius Craſſus, <hi>that excellent Orator, unto the People at a time when he was Prince of the Senate;</hi> Nolite ſinere nos cuiquam ſervire niſi vobis univerſis quibus &amp; poſſumus &amp; debemus; Suffer us not to ſerve any body but your ſelves all we can, which we ought to do. <hi>For though the Senate governed the People, yet the People gave the Senate that power for their own good and comfort.

Auguſtus was the Founder of the Empire, and yet would not be called Lord, becauſe it was the Sir name of God Almighty, and if he be Father of his Countrey, how can he be Lord thereof? <hi>O, but</hi> Athanaſius <hi>the</hi> Egyptian Biſhop <hi>ſays, that</hi> it is a moſt wicked nefarious thing to call Kings of the Earth before Tribunals. <hi>What then, when the Authority of Men, though had in great veneration, are trumpt up to juſtify any opinion, without producing the grounds and reaſon of ſuch their opinions, it is but</hi> magnificum nihil, <hi>makes a noiſe and a pudder, but neither proves nor convinces. Here's not a word out of Scripture to prove it; and in this there's as little credit to be given to</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>as when at the end of his Creed he boldly affirms, that</hi> that Creed to be the Catholick Faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be ſaved; <hi>A Creed which many doubt whether he underſtood it himſelf, or be yet intelligible to any other; however to place the certainty of Salvation upon ſuch myſterious expreſſions, believe it</hi> quicunque vult, <hi>I am ſure vulgar capacities cannot reach it, and they are the greateſt part of Chriſtians.</hi>

               <p>So St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of a <hi>Proconſul</hi> and <hi>Catechumen</hi> called to be <hi>Biſhop of Milan,</hi> is brought upon the Stage to ſerve the ſame turn, either unskilfully or flatteringly interpreting, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee only have I ſinned,</hi> Pſal. 51. 4. who would have all People ſubject to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and yet the Emperor be ſubject to him. <hi>How did he treat</hi> Theodoſius <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> forbidding him to come into the Church, thereby demonſtrating himſelf to be a <hi>Novice,</hi> (i. e. newly come to the faith, from being a Proconſul and a Catechumen) in <hi>the Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> and lifted up with pride, whom at laſt proſtrate at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops feet, having obtained his pardon, and reſtored to the participation of holy duties, and ſtanding without the Rails, magiſterially and ſawcily told him, <hi>O Imperator interiora loca tantum Sacerdotihus attributa, quae caeteris contingere non licet.</hi> In this his demeanour, he ſhewed himſelf rather a high Prieſt of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Cuſtoms, than a true Biſhop of the Goſpel, <hi>who ought to be blameleſs, and not lifted up with Pride, leſt he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</hi> I wonder in what Goſpel the Biſhop found ſuch authority to be his right to treat Emperors after ſuch a rate. This <hi>Biſhop attributed abſolute dominion to the Emperor over others,</hi> but it ſeems <hi>reſerved Power over the Emperor to his own Tribe of Prelates,</hi> and therefore repulſed <hi>Theodoſius as ſubject to him, ſaying, Coaequalium hominum es Imperator &amp; conſervorum, unus enim omnium Dominus Rex &amp; Creator.</hi> Very well, the Murder is now out, that myſtery which the ſubtilty and craft Eccleſiaſtick had long kept in the dark, the indiſcreet (to ſay no worſe) Zeal of this otherwiſe Pious Learned Biſhop hath brought to light. And this very St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> being commanded by <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> to depart the <hi>City of Milan,</hi> refuſed to obey, and being compaſſed with a company of Armed People, he <hi>defended himſelf and Houſe againſt the Emperors Commanders,</hi> and ſo <hi>reſiſted the Supream Powers againſt which he had taught.</hi> As to that place of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 4. <hi>Againſt thee only have I ſinned,</hi> (whereof before) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58061:46"/>
every Individual hath the ſame right to the ſame Plea; and then I appeal unto and adjure all Eccleſiaſticks plainly to tell us, if Kings ſhould treat their Wives or Daughters after the ſame rate, whether they do really and truly believe, that Kings ſo treating them as <hi>David did <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> did ſin only againſt God, and not offend them alſo. Surely they dare not be ſo confident as to aſſert it no offence to them, and yet ſuch there are.</p>
               <p>If this be currant Doctrine in this particular, it will as certainly hold in all other Sins; ſuch <hi>Prieſts</hi> as preach ſuch Doctrines, do manifeſt themſelves to be <hi>Prieſts of Baal</hi> rather than Prieſts of the moſt High God. What miſchiefs ſuch Preachments have done in the Chriſtian world, let the world it ſelf be Judg; look upon allthe Courts, and lives of all Emperors, Kings and Princes Chriſtian, and tell me if we may not very probably judge by their Lives and Governments, that they think their Authority an Immunity from all obedience to the Laws of God and Man; and no wonder when ſuch Paraſites and <hi>Sycophants</hi> Preach and Print ſuch Doctrines.</p>
               <p>That evil Kings are conſtituted by God; be it ſo, and ſo are all other evils; <hi>ſhall there be Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos 6. and yet the ſame <hi>Prophet</hi> bids us <hi>hate the evil, and love the good,</hi> and therefore for that reaſon have they God only for their Judge. What, above all Laws written and unwritten, natural and divine, and by no Laws to be called to Account by their Subjects, and be found guilty though ſo? Wherefore? certainly no Law of God forbids it, no Law excepts or exempts them, Reaſon, Right, Juſtice, Religion, true Policy and Government, reprove all indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without diſtinction or reſpect of Perſons. I have not as yet read or known any Law written or unwritten, natural or divine, brought to forbid the ſame: And why ſhould not reproofs and cenſures of ſin and vices and wrongs be executed againſt them, becauſe forſooth, though wicked, yet are conſtituted of God: wretched perverſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings! <hi>I have created the Waſter to deſtroy,</hi> Iſaiah 54. 16. Are Deſtroyers therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Laws? Conſider well with your ſelves if the reaſons and conſequences be not the very ſame. How many Kings in Scripture conſtituted by God himſelf, have we known puniſhed, and that by Men? Are not <hi>Popes</hi> (Tyrants in the Church,) after the ſame manner conſtitued by God, as <hi>prima ſedes anemine judicabitur</hi> 77? and yet how powerfully can the ſame men plead for dethroning them, and yet plead impunity for Kings, Tyrants? How ridiculous is it to plead thus againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> (whoſe Province is conſcience only,) to be removed out of the Church, and yet Tyrants over our Bodies, Lives and Fortunes, Conſciences and Liberties, muſt be continued without control. If otherwiſe, then <hi>Kingdoms and States would be turned topſy turvy;</hi> be it ſo, if for the better, why not? If Tyranny and <hi>abuſe of Power</hi> muſt ſtill continue ſetled on its Dregs and Lees, then <hi>Actum eſt, A Dieu</hi> to all the happineſs of the Governed; if things once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>quo jure quave injuria</hi> unto an il habit or figure, muſt they for ever ſo continue without contradiction? God forbids it, <hi>the ſame power</hi> (be it in free States or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms) <hi>being devolved on one or more choſen from among the Governed if abuſed, naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns unto them again, who by their good will, pleaſure and ſuffrages conditionally conferred it on them, and they cannot deveſt themſelves of it.</hi> Power from them who injures others by the moſt juſt law, muſt paſs unto them who ſuffer the Injuries, <hi>for all Men are equally tied by Laws,</hi> than which nothing can be more juſt; mortal Gods to do what they liſt, without control, there are none among us. Without all peradventure, they who have right to conſtitute Magiſtrates over themſelves, by devolving and deligating their own power on them, to manage and govern them according to their own Laws, to ſee them executed according to the ſimplicity and ſincerity wherewith they were made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhams or tricks, or ſhaping or wreſting them to wrong ends and purpoſes, which they are obliged by Oaths (the moſt ſacred tye among mortals) to obſerve. <hi>To them of neceſſity and of juſt right, doth belong the right of examining and cenſuring their Actions, and of calling them to an Account,</hi> and to deal with them accordingly. <hi>Vide Judicium</hi> Lutheri &amp; <hi>Theologorum,</hi> &amp; I.

               <p>IF Kings did rightly conſider as they ought to do, their own true intereſt both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this world and the next, they would con their High Prerogative-aſſertors very little thanks for ſuch their exaltations thereof, but would rather eſteem them as the very worſt Friends they have; for whilſt they magnify Kingly Powers unto the Skies above the Laws, and are not accountable for Mal-government, they thereby <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm</hi> their Subjects, to awaken out of the ſuppoſed Dreams of their juſt Liberty and Intereſt, and to provide for themſelves, and to ſhake off the bondage of ſuch unlook'd for Servitude, wherewith they would ſeem to ſurprize them by ſuch Doctrines. And whilſt they teach ſuch Infinite Power to be the Right of Kings, they thereby render that power to be the more intollerable. Whilſt they teach Kingly Power to be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, they excite the People to throw it off, rather than to ſubmit to ſo unjuſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to be the Right of Kings, whom they have ſet over themſelves for their good, and comfort, and not for their vexation.</p>
               <p>As all Kingdoms and Republicks have their Authority in theſe our days by the Laws of Men to govern, ſo they are obliged by the ſtricteſt Bonds of divine and humane Laws to manage their Government in the firſt place to the glory of God, obſerving his Commandments in general, <hi>to fear him, to walk in all his ways, and to love him;</hi> then to order the Government aright for the good of the Governed, by well ordering of Laws according to their ſimple meaning and true intent, without ſhamming or trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exemplary encouraging, and exhorting their Subjects to Honeſty, Piety and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, puniſhing all ſuch as trangreſs Gods Commandments, eſpecially thoſe of the Decalogue; for this Power is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arbitrary, nor given them for their own uſe only, to manage as they pleaſe, but <hi>for the good and benefit of the Governed,</hi> which they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do by the Laws of God and Man. Preachments and apprehenſions to the contrary, may cauſe even Saints to be miſguided and to act beſide their Rule, and to deem themſelves Arbitrators of the Government wherewith they are intruſted by the true Patrons thereof, and confirmed and ratified as neceſſary for the good of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by God himſelf; for that <hi>over a multitude of People, conſiſting of many and ſundry Families</hi> (as every politick Society doth) <hi>impoſſible it is, that any ſhould have compleat lawful Authority but by conſent of Men, or immediate appointment of God, who hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all,</hi> and who by the natural Law hath made all ſubject. The lawful Power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws to command whole Politick Societies of men, belongeth ſo properly unto the ſame intire Societies, that for any Emperor, Prince, Potentate, or Captain General of what kind ſoever on earth, to exerciſe the ſame of himſelf, or to act contrary to Laws made by publick conſent, and not either by expreſs Commiſſion immediately and perſonally received from God (unto which it is now utterly impoſſible, that any juſt pretence can be made) or elſe by authority derived from their conſent, upon whoſe Perſons they impoſe Laws, it is not better than down right Tyranny. <hi>Laws nor Powers there can be none lawful, which publick approbation hath not made ſo;</hi> and the <hi>publick power of all Societies is above every Individual contained in the ſame Societies of what quality ſoever they be.</hi> I may confidently divine, that no People ever were, or ever will be well pleaſed with Governours that mind more their own benefit, pomp and pride of Life, than the good and ſolace of the governed; it being the natural and fundamental right of the Governed to deligate as much of their own power, without deveſting themſelves thereof, as they think fit to Kings or Republicks, ſubject nevertheleſs to the truſts repoſed in them to be always improved and imployed for the welfare of the Governed.</p>
               <p>All People generally bear and are contented with a moderate Yoak, but from too heavy a bondage all naturally endeavour to free themſelves by all means, though indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. The Hiſtory of <hi>Nodus Gordianus</hi> is applicable to all humane tyes and obligations

of Governments, and ſometime or other will have the ſame fate. Therefore it is very indiſcreet Zeal in any, and much more in Miniſters of the Goſpel, to preach up ſuch Prerogatives to be in the hands of Princes, which are always prone to end in the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and in publick confuſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> a <hi>Spartan</hi> King, obſerving his Neighbouring Princes ſtruggling to get all Power into their hands, and thereby ruining themſelves and their Citizens, he thought it his wiſeſt courſe to take the <hi>Senate to be his Conſort in Government,</hi> and the Power of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> as a check upon himſelf; whereby he eſtabliſhed and tranſmitted a firm Kingdom to himſelf and his Succeſſors for many Generations. Likewiſe the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Theopompus,</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> who lived more than One hundred years after <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> was ſuch, that he <hi>conſtituted the popular Government of the</hi> Ephori <hi>above his own Regal Power,</hi> and gloried that he had left and eſtabliſhed a more firm and durable Kingdom to his Children and Poſterity. No inconſiderable examples, if rightly conſidered, nor unworthy to be imitated. No Law ever eſtabliſhed one Man, King, and Lord above all Laws, neither could they if they would. For <hi>that Law which overthrows all Laws,</hi> (as ſuch a Law would do) <hi>can be no Law.</hi> Can it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be imagined, that the Power, or rather the Impotency of one Man (be he King or Emperor) can have more of Divine Right in him to a <hi>common Evil,</hi> than the Power of whole Kingdoms have of the ſame Divine Right in them to a <hi>common Good?</hi> Far be it from all civil Societies to have ſuch brutal thoughts; for whilſt Kings are exalted above all Laws (as Pulpiteers would have them,) they thereby reduce ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Men to the condition of Brutes, to be brought under <hi>Axes and Harrows</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of redreſs.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that <hi>Natures Law makes no Kings, nor gives any right of Succeſſion, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> when made, nor any right to govern Arbitrarily; nor yet <hi>the Law of reaſon,</hi> which bindeth reaſonable Creatures in this World, and with which, by reaſon they may plainly perceive themſelves bound to ſubmit to ſuch Laws and Ordinances, as publick reaſon doth conſtitute for the good of the whole, and <hi>to prefer the good of the whole before any private good whatſoever:</hi> and therefore Kings from hence cannot have any right to wrong or oppreſs any People, being themſelves inferior to the whole. Now ſeeing <hi>Kings have no right by the Law of God, of Nature, or of Reaſon,</hi> to injure or oppreſs any, it remains therefore, that the <hi>People are by Natures Law Supreme;</hi> and that by the ſame right by which Men firſt aſſociated and took counſel together how to live in Peace, Plenty, Liberty, and to Defend themſelves from Oppreſſion, before ever Kings were or could be ſet over them; by which right alſo for common Security, Peace, Liberty, Juſtice, &amp;c. they conſtituted and preferred one or more <hi>from among themſelves,</hi> to preſide over them for his or their ſingular Prudence and Wiſdom for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement above others; <hi>by the ſame right they may cenſure and renounce the ſame Men for Negligence, Wickedneſs, weakneſs of Parts, or for any Male-Government.</hi> When a People by the Law of God, of Nature, and of Reaſon, do contrive and eſtabliſh a Governour over themſelves, it muſt neceſſarily follow, <hi>that the People are to be preferred before the Governour, be he Monarch or other;</hi> and therefore there can be no right in him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure or oppreſs the People, and therefore the <hi>right of the People is by the Law of Nature and of Reaſon moſt Supreme.</hi>

               <p>There are no Kings, nor any Right of Succeſſion by any Law of Nature, but by the Law of Nature and of Reaſon both, both may be eſtabliſhed; by which very Laws the moſt prudent and moſt deſerving have the faireſt pretence, the diſcerning and diſcriminating of which <hi>lies wholly in the Breaſt and Power of the People.</hi> Shew me one Law of Nature, or any rule of natural Juſtice, whereby the Inferior's guilty of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Crimes ought to be puniſhed, and the like guilty Potentates ought to go ſcot-free: the Law of God declares the contrary. <hi>The mighty ſhall be mightily puniſhed.</hi> Laws are not Cobwebs to catch little Flies only, and let Bees, Waſps, and Hornets eſcape through <hi>impunè.</hi> Kings by Nature are no more Sacred than their Subjects, they are all God's anointed; and if tranſgreſſors, are as puniſhable as they, by the ſelf-ſame Laws of God and Nature. <hi>No Law of God or Nature Authorizeth any one ſo to govern, as that all the governed muſt be ſubject to puniſhment, but the Governour exempt and free from cenſure.</hi> It's true that the Papiſts have an Axiome, as before, <hi>viz. Prima ſedes à nemine judicabitur.</hi> A poſition as falſe as Hell. Where ſuch Laws are in force, the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are infringed and violated. If Kings break their Oaths and their Truſts ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to the People, and become Tyrants, the People are by his Perjury and breach of Truſt (without the help of Popiſh Diſpenſations) diſcharged of their Oaths of Fealty and Allegiance, as alſo by common Juſtice and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                  <hi>The Law of Nature is the Law of God;</hi> between which there is a moſt Divine harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

The Law of Nature and Reaſon ſeated in the minds of all Men, and reſpects the good of all Men indifferently, that the ſtrong may not oppreſs the weak, nor the rich the poor; which Laws cannot be made bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but by common conſent; nor any made Governour to ſee the juſt and equal exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, but by like conſent: and therefore both Kings and Republicks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo eſtated by the People for their own good, it neceſſarily and unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the <hi>People muſt be the more Worthy and Superior;</hi> and conſequently there can be no right in any Monarch or Republick to afflict or oppreſs the People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the <hi>Law of Nature the Right of the People is Supreme;</hi> by which Right before any Kings were erected, the People firſt aſſociated and conſulted for their own mutual Defence, Liberty, Peace, and Happy living together; by which Right alſo in proceſs of time, they did prefer ſome one or other from among themſelves, whom they did eſteem moſt worthy to preſide; and by the ſame Right they did cenſure, or remove upon breach of Truſt; <hi>Nature not particularly reſpecting the good of one, or of a few, but of all in general.</hi>

               <p>No Men can by any Law of Nature lay any claim to Kingſhip or Succeſſion, it muſt come <hi>ab alio Jure;</hi> and that can now adays be from no other but by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages and free conſent of the governed. They that otherwiſe ſit on Thrones, be it by Conqueſt, Faction, Craft, or any other Means or Artifices, are but Uſurpers at the beſt. Natural and Moral Right may ſeem to favour the moſt prudent and juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſit at the Helm of a State, but confer no abſolute nor indefeaſible Right to a Throne or Succeſſion: ſuch Perſons beſt qualified have the faireſt pretence to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but for the weak and ſimple, the wicked and unjuſt to domineer over the righteous and juſt, and to rule with rigour, is contrary to the Law of Nature: and to labour and endeavour to break off the yoak of ſuch Bondage and Impery, is likewiſe according to the Law of Nature, &amp; <hi>virtus vocatur.</hi> The People for certain were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there could be any King; and conſequently Kings muſt be made by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore are ſuperior to them in ſome ſenſe, according to <hi>quicquid efficit tale eſt magis tale:</hi> a rule as true in Politicks as in Naturals. Produce who can, any one Law of God and Nature, or any one Rule of Natural Juſtice, by which Uſurpers, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, perverters of Law and Juſtice, are to be free of puniſhment, and yet the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior People to be ſubject to puniſhments for Crimes of the ſame nature. The Reaſon and Law of Government, be it Monarchical or Republick, is equally natural. Kings by Nature are no more Sacred than thoſe ſeated in the Government of Republicks, who <hi>nemine contradicente</hi> may and ought to be puniſhed, and why not Kings when tranſgreſſors, their Power being given them by the ſame Perſons, and for the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ends and purpoſes, the good of the governed?</p>
               <p>To aſſert the <hi>Oaths and Pacts of Kings</hi> with their People to be obliging, and yet to be unaccountable and unreprovable for any breach of them, is with the Cow to give good Milk and then kick it down: at one and the ſame moment to make good Laws, and yet to aboliſh and null them, which ought to have dominion over both Kings and People.</p>

                  <hi>Then</hi> L.

There were many Acts alſo of the Common Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, by which it was provided,</hi> That no Man ſhould bear two Magiſtracies, eſpecially that of the <hi>Curulis,</hi> in one year; <hi>neither the</hi> Plebaeian, <hi>nor the</hi> Patritian. And all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were before admittance to be ſworn; and not to ſtay therein above five Days except they were ſworn; and if they carried themſelves proudly and inſolently in their Government they were to be caſt out; <hi>the firſt of ſuch was</hi> Tarquinius Superbus: <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards (Kingſhip being baniſhed)</hi> Sergius <hi>and</hi> Virginius, <hi>Tribune Conſuls, and</hi> Cn.

Tiberius <hi>did not eaſily take away Honours from them, on whom he had conferred them, preſuming that the fat Flies would not pill and pole the People ſo much as the lean. And when their Magiſtracy was ended they were not to expect a Succeſſor till thirty days were expired by the</hi> Lex Cornelia, <hi>and then they were to render an account of their Government by the</hi> Lex Julia. <hi>And therefore we read of many</hi> Conſuls and Praetors condemned after their Government ended. <hi>Among the</hi> Grecians <hi>we find that he that could not give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Stewardſhip,</hi> Alogii teneretur. <hi>Among the</hi> Athenians <hi>it was ſo provided by a Law,</hi> That the Governors of their Commonwealth, yea, and their very Prieſts were ſubject to render an account thereof to the People. <hi>The</hi> Carthaginians forbade their Governors Wine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Government, lest thereby they ſhould be deceived. <hi>Among the</hi> Thebans <hi>there was a Law,</hi> That no Man ſhould be a Governor of the publick that had not given his Trade over ten years. <hi>The</hi> Bythinians, that no Man under thirty years old ſhould be admitted a publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> reduced to twenty two years old. <hi>And if at any time, after their Magiſtracy was ended, they refuſed to reſign their Empire to the Succeſſor, or would continue to have the</hi> Faſces carried before them beyond the juſt time, it was a capital Crime againſt the People. <hi>The like was among the</hi> Thebans. <hi>And yet it is recorded, That</hi> Epaminondas <hi>the</hi> Theban, <hi>ſtudying the good of his Country, did continue in his</hi> Praetorſhip, <hi>and refuſed to deliver up his Army to his Succeſſor, deſigned at a time when he had by force of Arms torn the</hi> Lacedaemonians <hi>to pieces, and Civil Wars, leſt if he had quitted his</hi> Praetorſhip, his former Succeſſes had been fruſtrated; for which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, the People notwithſtanding by common conſent abſolved and quitted him. <hi>So ſevere was the Diſcipline of the</hi> Carthaginians, That if the Emperor or Captain General had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ill Counſel, though the ſucceſs proved happy, yet was he to die the ſhameful death of the Croſs for it. <hi>The</hi> Romans <hi>when their Captains had through raſhneſs or unskilfulneſs loſt a Battel, they were fined, and baniſhed.</hi>

                  <hi>It may be true what ſome Authors have aſſerted, That at the beginning of the</hi> Roman State there were no Laws <hi>made by</hi> the common Preſcript of the People, but what their Kings or Generals of their Armies did preſcribe, that was to be taken and obſerved for Law. <hi>The cauſe might be reaſonable, for that they having the Power of the Army they might force obedience as they pleaſed, having by that means the command of puniſhing, and rewarding; and alſo of hearing and determining the Cauſes, Complaints, Criminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. of the Citizens.

But if any thing were to be added or ſubſtracted to the ſame Law before it was propoſed in the Market-place, and before it was ingraven in Braſs, it might eaſily be done, afterwards not.

the Government by the appointment of</hi> Severus <hi>their Father,) and then cauſed</hi> the great Lawyer Papinianus <hi>to be put to death, becauſe he would not defend that barbarous Act of his before the Senate, alledging for his juſtification,</hi> that it was eaſier to commit Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide, than defend it; <hi>but afterwards this</hi> Caracalla was contented <hi>more Majorum,</hi> to have him Canonized. <hi>Divus, modo non ſit vivus,</hi> to deify him (being dead) in another world, rather than to have him a living Co-partner with him in the Empire.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, <hi>Trajan</hi> (that moſt excellent Emperor,) being poſſeſſed of the ſame power, and having publiſhed ſome private and ſpecial Laws, or Indults for great merits; and underſtanding that ſome relying thereon, made ill uſe thereof, by drawing them into Example; and fearing leſt contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Antients, they ſhould be drawn by application unto wrong Cauſes, and being brought into Judgment and Courts of Juſtice, or Pleadings as Precedents, they ſhould paſs for Laws, he refuſed afterwards to anſwer Plaintiffs or Defendants, by any writing or <hi>Libel of Record,</hi> leſt thereby pernicious examples, and as it were Seminaries of ill might ſpring from thence.</p>

The like they did to</hi> Pauſanias and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, Lacedaemonian Kings, <hi>and were ſo terrible, that they erected</hi> Timoris Sacellum, <hi>a Chappel of Terror; which</hi> Ephori, <hi>together</hi> with their Kings, did take Oaths every Month that they would obſerve the Laws of <hi>Lycurgus, and preſerve the Kingdom in peace. In tract of time they grew ſo inſolent, that</hi> Cleomenes broke their Empire, and reſtored the Kingly Power. <hi>It was not lawful for any</hi> Patrician <hi>to accept of being a</hi> Plebeian <hi>Magiſtrate; and</hi> Volero, Tribune of the People, <hi>ordained by a Law, proclaimed with the conſent of the</hi> Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians that the <hi>Plebeian</hi> Magiſtrate ſhould be made without the Patricians, and only the Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians admitted to the Tribunitian Councils. <hi>And though formerly to be</hi> Dictator, Conſul, Praetor, <hi>or</hi> Cenſor, <hi>none but</hi> Patricians <hi>were to be admitted; yet afterwards the</hi> Patrician Magiſtrates were to ſhare and communicate with the <hi>Plebeians. So</hi> Sextius Primus, of a Plebeian was made a Conſul, <hi>which then was ratified,</hi> Lege Licinia, which C. Licinius <hi>and</hi> L.

Licinius Stolo, Plebeians, <hi>the one did bear the office of</hi> Pretorſhip, <hi>the other the</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, with the Patricians. <hi>Moreover the</hi> Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>(in which was placed the greateſt</hi> glory) <hi>and</hi> Cenſorſhip, <hi>we find to be</hi> in common with the Plebeians. <hi>For both</hi> M. Rutilius <hi>the firſt</hi> Dictator and Cenſor, <hi>then</hi> Q. Pompeius, <hi>and</hi> Q.

All the</hi> Patrician Magiſtrates, even thoſe alſo of the Pontiſicates and Prieſts, were made, the Plebeians being firſt conſulted. <hi>In ſumm,</hi> ſo great was the honour of Tribunitian Power, that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> gave it to <hi>Octavius Auguſtus,</hi> and then to the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> as a ſpecial remark of Favour. <hi>Yet it muſt not be omitted, that though the</hi> Conſuls and Praetors might be called to account by the Tribunes of the People, <hi>yet</hi>
Caeſar by the right of his ſacred Power, was free from all Power of the Magiſtrates. <hi>But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> if he did abuſe the Power ſo conferred upon him, or ſhould diminiſh, or infringe the rights of the People, or if he did intercede or forbid, or compel when or where he ought not; or if he

did enterpriſe or endeavour any thing againſt the good of the People, he might be ſummoned by the Conſul or Tribunes of the People; and if found guilty, he might by their Suffrages be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded and puniſhed; <hi>and then he was no more accounted</hi> Sacred, <hi>but</hi> Prophane. <hi>When</hi> nine Tribunes of the People, with Sp.

               <p>Kingly Power ſo tempered, may very well conſiſt with the Liberty of the People. It was ſo tempered and uſed with the <hi>Spartans, Thebans, Athenians, Sicilians,</hi> and others. When all power is given by the People to Kings, whereby they obtain that Title, <hi>yet it is given in truſt for them, for the ſafeguard and wellfare, and not for the Deſtruction or Prejudice of the People, to have the benefit and freedom of their Laws, and not be Slaves.</hi> O, but after this rate, <hi>Kings</hi> reign not by God's, but by the Peoples appointment? Very true, for no Kings now Reign by Gods Perſonal appointment, but by his approbation and allowance only, as all other Governours do; And as if God did not ſo govern the People, that the People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Kingdoms according to the good will and pleaſure of God Almighty. Though the People of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>lex Regia,</hi> gave their power to <hi>Romulus</hi> their firſt King, yet did they not thereby give up themſelves to be Slaves; for among the ſame Laws, they had their Laws alſo in favour of themſelves. And the <hi>Emperor Juſtinian</hi> in the very Inſtitutes acknowledgeth, that the <hi>Caeſars</hi> Reign according to the <hi>lex Regia, by the choice and ſuffrages</hi> of the <hi>People, Populi ſuffragia ſunto: Magiſtratus creanto: Leges ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunto: Pacem bellumque jubento.</hi> And among the fragments, the firſt Law is, <hi>Jus Populi &amp; fuffragia ſunto, quodcunque poſtremum Populus juſſit, id jus ratumque,</hi> 12 Tabul. <hi>lege ſancitum eſt. v.</hi> Calv. 983. 986. When <hi>Proud Tarquin</hi> beſtroad the Throne, and violated all the wholſome Laws of <hi>Servius,</hi> and contemned all the Laws of his Predeceſſors, <hi>reducing all to Luſt, Will and Pleaſure,</hi> they ſoon expelled him, and <hi>changed their Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Conſular,</hi> and choſe <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Valerius for their Conſuls,</hi> who reſtored the Laws, and others reſtoring the People to their antient and juſt Rights; ſuch were <hi>Leges Valeriae, Sacrariae, Iciliae</hi> and others; all which did reſpect the publick good, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made by <hi>Valeria, (Brutus</hi> being dead,) was, <hi>that there ſhould be an Appeal to the People againſt all Magiſtrates adminiſtring wrongfully, and that none ſhould command in</hi> Rome, <hi>but they on whom the People ſhould confer Power ſo to do, who with their Goods were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Sacred; and if any did uſurp ſuch Power without their conſent it ſhould be capital,</hi> Calv. p. 1009.

which was among the <hi>Spartans;</hi> where notwithſtanding the <hi>Popular Power was above the Kingly,</hi> which cannot be denied, where the People paid all Homage, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Honour, and Reſpect to their <hi>Kings,</hi> though the Power remained with them, which they did not ordinarily exerciſe, yet on juſt occaſions reſumed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it.</p>
               <p>It is objected that the People having once delegated their Power to Kings, forfeit it, neither can the People reſume it; yet theſe that thus object, do confeſs, that the People may reſume their delegated Powers from any other kind or form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But what makes the difference, is paſt my underſtanding, when Kingly and all other Governments receive their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Power from the People on conditions, and which they are ſworn to obſerve and keep; and why <hi>that Power which is only Fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary,</hi> and become forfeited for Mal-government, ſhould not return unto them who delegated it, as well from Kings as from <hi>Conſuls, Senates, Tribunes, Duumvirates, Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, Decemvirates, Ephori,</hi> or any other form of Government, is paſt all underſtanding. It is alſo ſcornfully objected, this is to be a <hi>Duke of</hi> Genoa, a <hi>Duke of</hi> Venice, not a <hi>King.</hi> They who have ſo mean conceits of ſuch Governments, (which in reality are as much approved and allowed by God as Kingly, even by the ſame Scripture,) are not worthy to preſide in any Government.</p>
               <p>If the Opinion of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> be true, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come and reign upon the earth 1000 Years, will he not do all things for the good of the Governed? Will not <hi>his eyes be on the faithful of the Land, and on them that excel in virtue? will he not hate the works of them that turn aſide? will he know a wicked Perſon, except to condemn him? will he ſuffer them that have High Looks or Proud Hearts? will not his eyes be on the faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with him? ſhall not they that walk in a Perfect way ſerve him? ſhall they that work Deceit dwell in his Houſe, or they that tell Lies tarry in his ſight? and will he not deſtroy all the Wicked of the Land, and cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord?</hi> And cannot Kings do the ſame, whether their power be abſolute from God, or delegated from the People? Hath not Chriſt been among us already as him <hi>that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> and ſhall his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> think it below them to be like <hi>their Maſter?</hi> Were it not the moſt deſirable condition in the World, for Kings Chriſtian to be ſo ſeated on Thrones, as it could not poſſibly be in their power to do the leaſt injury to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their Subjects, and yet do good to all?

At the Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> III. <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>with</hi> Elianor, <hi>Daughter of</hi> Raymund <hi>Earl of</hi> Provence, <hi>the Earl of</hi> Cheſter <hi>carried the Sword of St.</hi> Edward <hi>(called</hi> Curtein) <hi>before him, in token that he was Master of the Palace, and that he had publick Authority to curb the King if he erred.</hi> The ſame Enſign of publick Authority is continued to this very day before the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> II. at his Coronation being ſet in a rich Chair under a glorious Cloth of State, Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> Knight, Maſter of the <hi>Jewel-Houſe,</hi> preſented the Sword of State, alſo the Sword called Curtana, and two other Swords, to the Lord High Conſtable, who took and delivered them to the Lord High Chamberlain, and laid them on the Table before the King. The like Powers had the Maſters of the Palace in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries. It is plain, that though that great and juſt Emperor <hi>Traj an</hi> had ſo great Power conferred on him, yet was ſo juſt <hi>as to appoint a Judge, (though inferior</hi> to him) over his Actions: How much more juſt therefore was he, when he, ſuperior in Power (having all the Armies and Conqueſts at his beck,) and conſequently could not be forced to obey the Senate or People, yet would do it in <hi>reſpect of his Office and Duty to his Delegators,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acknowledge them to be his <hi>ſuperior:</hi> of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Panegyrick ſaith, That <hi>ſenatus ut ſuſciperet quartum Conſulatum &amp; rogavit &amp; juſſit.</hi> Which are words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and they that might Command, might Judge and Cenſure. So <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Emperor, when <hi>Caſſius</hi> the <hi>Praefect</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> endeavoured to deprive him of his Kingdom, <hi>offered himſelf to the judgment of the Senate and the People of</hi> Rome, as it ſhould ſeem beſt unto them. Now, who could better judge of Kingly Power than ſuch juſt and upright Kings, and in their own Cauſe? Certainly, <hi>by the Law of Nature,</hi> all good Kings have the Senate or the People both for their Peers, and Superiors, in ſome Kingdoms, though Tyrants (hated both of God and Man) will neither have Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, nor Peer.</p>
               <p>As of old, Laws (the Law of Nature guiding) by force were deviſed, ſo when Laws came to be deſpiſed and ſlighted, by the ſame Law of Nature there muſt <hi>recourſe be had unto force again:</hi> ſo to think is juſt, and prudent: ſo to do, is true courage; ſo to think and do, is the height of a prudent vertue. This remains indelible in Nature, That <hi>the Senate, or People are always Superior in ſome Countries to Kings good or bad:</hi> the reaſon is natural, <hi>for that the People do transfer their own Power;</hi> or, (to ſpeak yet more properly) <hi>the uſe and exerciſe of ſome of their own Power unto Kings; the Power it ſelf ſtill virtually remaining in themſelves;</hi> of which they cannot ſo totally deveſt themſelves, but the Spring and Fountain thereof will ſtill remain in them; which is demonſtrable, <hi>for that in making Laws their conſent is ſtill required as abſolutely neceſſary.</hi> The nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and imitate Natures Laws, the more demonſtrable is the Power of the People above the Power of Kings; their Power being only derived from the ſame People, as a Stream from the Fountain.</p>
               <p>It is as evident that the People if free do not ſimply, but hypothetically transfer their Power unto Kings, <hi>neither undeed can they by the Law of Nature,</hi> but only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and for the ſake of Order, of common Juſtice, Peace, and Liberty; from which if <hi>Kings do deviate,</hi> it is always to be underſtood, <hi>that the People have transferred no ſuch Power;</hi> and indeed <hi>transferred nothing, becauſe they transferred it only for certain good ends and purpoſes,</hi> Nature ſo guiding; which ends if fruſtrated or perverted, the very Pacts and Delegations themſelves are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> voidable; nay, void at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Senate or People: and therefore the People muſt conſequently be <hi>ſuperior to Kings,</hi> who though <hi>ſingulis Majores,</hi> yet in true conſtruction of Law and Equity are <hi>univerſis Minores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>a popular State,</hi> it is generally acknowledged that Magiſtrates placed by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be cenſured by the People: and in an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> by the <hi>Optimacy:</hi> and yet it's held monſtrous that Kings ſhould be called to account in ſome Countries; which, if true, concludes thus much certainly true, <hi>That they are more than brutiſhly fooliſh ever to admit of any ſuch Government,</hi> which moſt certainly renders them ſlaves at the will of Kings. How comes it to paſs that Kings only of all other Governors muſt Reign unqueſtionable, uncenſured, uncontrolable? Do Men born under ſuch a Regiment na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally become ſo deſperately ſottiſh and bruitiſh as to love ſlavery better than free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Why do they then preſcribe them Laws, and conditions of Governing, and Oaths for the more certain performance of them at their firſt admittance? That they might with the better grace jeer, and ſcorn, and enſlave them? Or, that they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the Sons and Daughters of Men, might have liberty to break Laws, and perjure themſelves <hi>impuné?</hi> Or be left only to the Judgment of the great day?</p>

Where's the great difference and diſtance between Kings and popular Magiſtrates, Title only excepted? Which Title the very People gave them for the better Grace, Adornment and Majeſty of their own Government. The ſame Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is transferred unto Kings, and unto popular Magiſtrates by the People; both one and the other ſworn alike to obſervance of the Laws; and the obliged to obey not one nor the other any longer than <hi>quamdiu id bene geſſerit?</hi> Who makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? If any, God hath already decided it <hi>on behalf of the popular Magiſtracy</hi> by his own example, who of his own infinite Wiſdom, Authority, and Goodneſs towards Mankind, inſtituted Judges as the beſt Form of Government; but appointed Kings in Wrath, and Anger, and Indignation, and at the fooliſh inſtance of a froward and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious People, and as a puniſhment on them who had rejected him and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rebelled againſt him; whereby it is manifeſt, that <hi>Kingſhip was firſt ordained as a puniſhment,</hi> not as the beſt Government.</p>
               <p>To aſſert abſolute Dominion to be in Kings from the example of Fathers and of Maſters of Families, hath no ground in Nature, Scripture, Reaſon. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Politicks condemns that Opinion, of there being but little difference in the ſimilitude between a Kingdom and a Family. <hi>Regnum à familia non numero ſolum, ſed ſpecie differt.</hi> For Fathers beget their Children. And the People beget or create their Kings, and not Kings the People. And Fathers provide for their Children, but the People provide for Kings, not only for their Neceſſaries but for Superfluities, for their Magnificence, and for their Grandeur: And according to <hi>Diodorus</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Kingdoms of old were wont to be given not neceſſarily to the Sons of Kings, but to them in whom did appear moſt apparent ſigns and tokens of Love and Kindneſs towards the People, and of common good. So <hi>Juſtin, Principio rerum, gentium, nationumque imperium penes reges erat, quos ad faſtigium hujus majestatis, non ambitio Popularis, ſed ſpectata inter bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos moderatio provehebat:</hi> Whereby it plainly appears, that Paternal and Hereditary Impery ſubſcribes and is ſubſervient to Virtue and to the Right of Nations. Which Original of Kingly Dominion, both <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Cauſe,</hi> are moſt eſpecially <hi>natural;</hi> for which very cauſe and reaſon Men did firſt aſſemble and agree on a Government, not that one ſhould inſult and domineer over all the reſt, but whoſoever did injure another, there ſhould be a Law and a Judg amongſt them for the defence and recompencing the injured.</p>
               <p>Primus Rex Agis ab Ephoris eſt morte mulctatus, <hi>192. Ob.</hi> Rex non est, niſi unus ſit &amp; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. <hi>If ſo, then many that were Kings of</hi> England, <hi>were not. To let paſs many of the</hi> Saxons, <hi>who had many Peers in their Government either Sons or Brothers. It's manifeſt that</hi> Hen. <hi>II. of the</hi> Norman <hi>Race,</hi> reigned with his Son. Conſentire vultis de habendo ipſum regem? <hi>193.</hi> Quod opus non foret ſi regnum jure eſſet haereditarium, apud Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges uſurpatio pro Jure ſaepiſſime obtinet. <hi>In the Creation of our Kings, the Archbiſhop asks the People four times,</hi> Conſentire vultis de habendo ipſum regem? <hi>After the</hi> Roman <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> vultis, jubetis hunc regnare? <hi>Of which there was no need, if the King had an abſolute</hi> independent Right of Inheritance. <hi>Therefore as</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror took an Oath of</hi> Allegiance <hi>from the People after the Battel of</hi> Haſtings; <hi>ſo the</hi> People took his Oath that he would keep Faith with them, &amp;c. After which when he broke his Faith with the People, they took Arms again; then he moſt ſolemnly ſwore again, That he would obſerve and keep the Ancient Laws of <hi>England: if he tyrannized over them, it was not</hi> jure belli, <hi>but</hi> jure perjurii. <hi>And when he died, he declared,</hi> Neminem Anglici regni eonſtituo hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redem. lib. Cadomenſ. inde jus belli, &amp; jus haereditarium cum ipſo mortuo Gulielmo ſepultum eſt. Rex non poteſt facere injuriam, quod ſcelerate interpretantur, Non eſt injuria quod facit Rex, quia in eo non punitur. <hi>If it be demanded by what Authority Kings may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and cenſured? It's anſwered, by the ſame Authority, by the ſame Men, and the ſame Laws that delegated their Power to create them King; and that by the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame reaſon. Kings have no Power but what they have received from the People, and therefore they muſt have Power over Kings: and by the Law of St.</hi> Edward, Kings not governing righteouſly loſe the very name of King, and it denies him to be a King.</p>
               <p>It is never to be forgotten, that in the beginning <hi>all Power did flow from the People,</hi> and ſtill doth; which <hi>Tully</hi> excellently demonſtrates, <hi>De lege Agraria. Cum omnes pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Imperia, curationes ab úniverſo Populo proficiſci convenit, tum eas profecto maxime, quae conſtituuntur ad populi fructum aliquem, &amp; commodum, in quo &amp; univerſi delegant quem populo maxime conſulturum, &amp; unuſquiſque' ſtudio &amp; ſuffragio ſuo viam ſibi ad beneficium im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrandum munire poſſit. Seeing all Powers, Commands, Curations</hi> (i. e. poteſtas ſeu mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus adminiſtrandi bona) <hi>do proceed and flow from the People, then thoſe more eſpecially
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58061:52"/>
which are conſtituted and do reſpect the good and benefit of the People, in which the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity do chuſe them whom they judge will moſt eſpecially ſtudy and procure their good; and every one by their ſtudy and ſuffrage may have eaſie acceſs to obtain Juſtice, and Favours.</hi> And all Lawyers do agree and hold, <hi>That all Laws repugnant to the Laws of God, of Nature, or of Reaſon, are not to be accounted as Laws.</hi> And whereas the Power of judging was Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the People, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by no <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> have at any time transferred it out of themſelves, no King of <hi>England</hi> hath been wont, or hath Power, to judge any Man, unleſs by the known and approved Laws, <hi>Fleta lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17. What Power Kings have are given to them by the People, that they may know by the Authority to them committed, that they may do nothing contrary to the Law, and keep our Laws, but not impoſe their own Laws on us; and the Kings Power is really and truly in the Courts of Law, wherein the <hi>People by their Juries have their ſhare alſo.</hi> And their chief Power is in their Senates, and Parliaments, who have a Right and Authority over all Courts and Powers; in all which Courts Kings may both ſue and be ſued, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal Cauſes to be indifferently tried according to eſtabliſhed Laws. If at any time Kings act any thing contrary to Laws, they act then as private Men, or as Tyrants, and not by any Authority transferred on them by God or Man, ſo to do. Hence <hi>Bract. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Non eſt Rex ubi dominatur voluntas, &amp; non Lex,</hi> &amp;c. 1. 3. c. 9. <hi>Rex eſt dum bene regit: tyrannus dum populum ſibi creditum violenta opprimit dominatione,</hi> &amp;c. ibid. <hi>Exercere debet Rex poteſtatem Juris, ut vicarius &amp; miniſter Dei; poteſtas autem injuriae Diaboli eſt, non Dei. Cum declinat ad injuriam Rex, Diaboli miniſter eſt.</hi> As nothing contrary to the Laws of God and Reaſon can be accounted a Law, ſo neither can a Tyrant be a King, nor a Miniſter of the Devil be a Miniſter of God; ſeeing therefore Law is but the product of right Reaſon, and Obedience is due to Kings as the Miniſters of God; ſo by the ſame Reaſon and Law, Tyrants and Miniſters of the Devil may be cenſured and reſiſted.</p>
               <p>Either the People to be governed have a Right and Power to chuſe their own Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or they have not. If they have not, then Kings choſen by them are not Kings, but Uſurpers and Oppreſſors. If they have Power to chuſe, then they have Power to oblige him to what Conditions they pleaſe, and to keep them; and, if they fail of performing, then they are free of the Covenant, as it was between <hi>Rahab</hi> and the Spies.</p>
