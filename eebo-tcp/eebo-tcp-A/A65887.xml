            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Serious Search INTO Jeremy Ives'<hi>s Questions to the Quakers.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SInce <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> his late <hi>Daring Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi> under Pretext of <hi>a Sober Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> and his attempting to prove the <hi>Quakers no Christians,</hi> is now changed into <hi>Questions for the Quakers,</hi> which he saith, <hi>are grounded upon some Observations made upon the Papers lately published by</hi> Thomas Rudyard <hi>and one</hi> W. P. <hi>which are pretended Replies to</hi> Jeremy Ives <hi>his sober Request to the</hi> Quakers, <hi>but will appear by the Light of the ensuing Observations</hi> (he sayes) <hi>to be but Idle Shifts and Evasions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing he begins at this contemning Rate against us, and vilifying and slighting our Friends Answers, and pretends such <hi>Light</hi> in his own Observations; it is needful they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66003:3"/>
should be inspected and seriously examined, however he reckon his Questions and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations so very clear and lightsom Proofs against us, I will assure him, we find no such Validity in them to <hi>u<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ristian us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I observe two general Accusations on which his Matter much depends to render the <hi>Quakers no Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Condemning that in others, which they allow in themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Disdaining, Huffing, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and Reviling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both which I grant with him, are so far from being either Characters of a <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stian,</hi> or Infallible Marks of a Disciple of Christ, that they are wholy inconsistent with <hi>Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Position is thus to be considered.</p>
            <p>For Men to condemn that in others which they allow in them elves, is an Inconsistency and a self Condemnation, where the Matter is the same in every Respect, both as to the Nature and Circumstance; though that which is an Evil in it self is condemnable, and not to be allowed either in one's self or in another; much more is his Condemnation aggravated, who allows that Evil in himself which he condemns in others: Other things that are Lawful in themselves become
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66003:3"/>
accidentally Evil, through the Abuse or Evil-Mind that brings them forth.</p>
            <p>But to the second Position; it's granted, that <hi>Disdaining, Huffing, Slandering</hi> and <hi>Reviling</hi> are evil in themselves, if by <hi>Huffing</hi> he means a <hi>fierce Despising</hi> &amp; <hi>scornful Slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> those that are good, or that deserve it not; and by <hi>Reviling,</hi> a <hi>making a worthy Man base, or calling a Man all to naught:</hi> The Truth of it is, <hi>Jeremy,</hi> thou wouldst appear in these Matters a very grave, sober <hi>Christian,</hi> and a Man only for solid and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Expressions: But whether thou hast not plaid the Hypocrite in these Pretences of <hi>Seriousness</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> and brought thy self under the Guilt, both of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that in others which thou allowest in thy self, and of <hi>Disdaining, Slandering</hi> and <hi>Reviling,</hi> will further appear in the following Examination.</p>
            <p>Thou sayest, that <hi>these Papers, like all the rest of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Writings, are stuffed with vain and frothy Expressions;</hi> and what those are thou instances <hi>W. P</hi>'s saying, that <hi>the Product of many dayes Travail was but a sorry Mouse [the Product of</hi> Jeremy'<hi>s great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.]</hi> Which was with Reference to thy daring and vapouring <hi>Challenge,</hi> falsly term'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66003:4"/>
by thee, <hi>A sober Request to the</hi> Quakers: But it disgusts thee to use such a Comparison as that of a <hi>sorry Mouse,</hi> and why so? Is it because of the Impropriety of the Speech, or that it is too Ironical for such a grave, sober <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> as <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> would be accounted? But I tell thee, <hi>Jeremy,</hi> thou art one of them that <hi>str<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins at a Gnat, and swallows a Camel,</hi> whether thou thinkest these Expressions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or not.</p>
            <p>And <hi>secondly,</hi> to prove us guilty of thy <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Position,</hi> thou sayest that <hi>Our Friends Papers abound with Railings and bitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, thinking to raise thereby a Dust</hi> (a plain Falshood) <hi>to darken the Understanding of the unwary Reader;</hi> and what are these? In calling thee <hi>Audacious, Privateer, Bravado, Hector, Senacherib, Impudent, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further (to shew thy self a very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and sober <hi>Christian)</hi> thou sayest, <hi>That these Papers abound with Untruths, thou wilt not break the Laws of good Manners, as they do, to call them</hi> LYES <hi>and</hi> FORGFRIES; And so that here thy Modesty &amp; Seriousness is such, as when thou hast insinuated, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>No Christians,</hi> nor yet Followers of the Laws of <hi>Good Manners,</hi> for Charging their <hi>Adversaries</hi> (such as thou and thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>T. Hicks)</hi> with <hi>Lyes &amp; Forgeries;</hi> but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66003:4"/>
thou wouldst not be thought so to <hi>Unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Unmanner thy self,</hi> as to use such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as <hi>Audacious, Privateer, Impudent, Impudent, Lyes</hi> and <hi>Forgeries:</hi> Oh demure <hi>Jeremy! Hypocrita cupit se videri justum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>first,</hi> If he be <hi>No Christian</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns that in others which he allows in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, then is <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> No Christian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he be <hi>No Christian</hi> that is guilty of such Language as he himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts <hi>Disdaining, Huffing, Reviling, Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>bitter Invectives,</hi> as namely, <hi>Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Impudent, Lyes, &amp;c.</hi> and thus to charge another, be Unchristian and Unmannerly, then is <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> NO <hi>Christian,</hi> by his own Observation; But that <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> is herein both Self-condemn'd &amp; Guilty, take a View of his Language against us in his Pamphlet, viz. <hi>Mcn of Lying Spirits, gross Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, idle Shifts and Evasions, Bedlam-man, audacious and ridiculous, daring Prophets, your Baseness, wilful Baseness, pretended Impulses and Enthusiastick Necessities, Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Logick, Figments of thy Fancy, little Wtticisms to please thy simple beguiled Clients, this Emperick of the Law</hi> Thomas Rudyard, <hi>what Impostors, they pretend the Spirit to be the Rule, when they can give no more Evidence of it then</hi> Mahomet <hi>or</hi> Muggleton, <hi>the sad
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66003:5"/>
Shifts the poor Men are put to, their Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Principles, such idle Enthusiasts.</hi> Thus <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> through his Observations.</p>
            <p>Judge Serious Reader; Is not here both Huffing, Disdaining and Reviling, and what he himself hath accounted such? But if <hi>Jeremy</hi> think this not enough to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self condemned, and guilty of both Disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Huffing, Reviling and Vanting, let his Salutation to <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> be added, viz. <hi>Thou Pittiful, Fool, thou Knave, thou Loggerhead;</hi> And if to call any Man's Papers <hi>Lyes, and Forgeries,</hi> be a <hi>breaking the Laws of good Manners, and to call a Man Audacious or Impudent, bewray an Unchristian Spirit, and be corrupt Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> as he implies, then has <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> both bewrayed an <hi>Unchristian</hi> Spirit, &amp; hath broken the Laws of good Manners, and condemned that in others which he hath plainly allowed in himself; for in his Book entituled, <hi>Innocency above Impudency,</hi> he doth not only charge his Opposer with <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> but he gives him the <hi>Lye</hi> near thirty Times; and likewise in his <hi>Quakers Quaking,</hi> he has shewn his Envy and Ill-Language suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently. Where art thou now <hi>Jeremy Ives?</hi> Art thou not here found guilty, and allowing that in thy self, which thou hast condemned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66003:5"/>
others for, as <hi>Unchristian?</hi> And also thy Brother <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> whose Quarrel thou hast espoused, hath used such Language to some of us, as <hi>Knave, Impudent Fellow, Audacius Fellow, Coxcomb, &amp;c.</hi> which is much like thy <hi>Pittyful Fool, Knave, Loggerhead, &amp;c.</hi> See now <hi>Jeremy,</hi> how thy own Observation and Charge is deservedly retorted upon thy self. Art not thou found a <hi>Huffer</hi> (yea and a <hi>Puffer</hi> too) a <hi>Railer,</hi> a <hi>Scorner</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer,</hi> and thinks it a great Disparagement to be accounted short of <hi>an Honest Heathen;</hi> but I must tell thee, that there are many <hi>Heathens</hi> that are a great deal more sober, serious and fearing God then thou art, as thy Lightness and frothy Deportment at the late Meetings did evince: However, thou braggest <hi>of thy being able, by the Grace of God, to approve thy self as Honest in all thy Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondencies in the World as the best of them,</hi> and challengest us to <hi>produce the Person or Persons that shall say otherwise of thee.</hi> How thou art <hi>able to approve</hi> thy self, and how thou <hi>hast approved</hi> thy self, have a different Sense: But however, I must tell thee, It had been more proper and more credible for others to have thus commended thy Honesty, then to have done it so highly thy self; but as for these Things, it is not my present Business
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66003:6"/>
to seek or enquire out Occasions against thee in the Concerns of this World; let those speak that are offended, if they have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion given them, or have complained of thee, I have enough against thee of other Concerns.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> untruly chargeth our Friends Papers <hi>too abound with Untruths,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending himself so much <hi>oblieged by the Laws of Good Manners, as that he will not call them</hi> Lyes <hi>and</hi> Forgeries, <hi>of which he shall mention but Two,</hi> which are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>he pretended to be delegated by</hi> T. Hicks, <hi>but was not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That in the Dispute, <hi>when he was to prove us No Christians, instead thereof he put us to prove our selves Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove the <hi>first,</hi> an Untruth, he sayes, <hi>he was concern'd by their Consent, else how came we to direct our Letters to him with Mr.</hi> Kiffin <hi>and others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeremy,</hi> thou art besides the Business here, for thy pretending <hi>to be delegated,</hi> was in <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s Cause <hi>at the Meeting near Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Street;</hi> and that he might be concluded by thee as personating him: Did not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern those Matters whereof we charg'd him? for thou may'st remember this was urg'd at the Dispute; The Letters to thee and the rest, did not concern thee to personate T.

in his Absence there; but only as an Assister of him in his Presence amongst the rest; but that thou wast not so delegated, <hi>to personate Thomas Hicks,</hi> nor that he gave up his Cause to be concluded in <hi>Jer. Ives,</hi> seems evident,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that <hi>Jeremy</hi> and those then with him durst not enter upon the Particulars charg'd against <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> as <hi>Forgeries,</hi> nor would suffer them to be read.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that we have a <hi>Certificate</hi> to the contrary under <hi>Tho.

            </p>
            <p>And to the <hi>second;</hi> I wonder that thou canst call this <hi>an Untruth,</hi> that when thou hadst said, <hi>Thou wouldst prove us no Christians,</hi> instead thereof thou calld'st for an <hi>Evidence of our Christianity,</hi> or put us to prove our selves <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>W.

calling for an <hi>Evidence</hi> on our parts as before, and he now confesseth, <hi>That he did require an</hi> Evidence <hi>for the Rule of our Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by Inspiration,</hi> pag. 6. And was not this then for an <hi>Evidence</hi> of our <hi>Christianity,</hi> while we do not profess any <hi>real Christianity</hi> without <hi>Faith and Practice by Inspiration?</hi> An <hi>Evidence</hi> of our being <hi>Divinely inspired</hi> must be an Evidence of our <hi>Christianity;</hi> for none are true <hi>Christians,</hi> who deny <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Immediate Inspiration:</hi> And I do not understand what <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> scoffs at us as <hi>Idle Enthusiasts</hi> &amp; <hi>for Enthusiastick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> but for holding this of <hi>Immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi> nor do I see but that his Charge of Untruth (in those two things before) is just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be turn'd upon himself as an Untruth against us.</p>
            <p>He concludes, <hi>That he might by all Laws of Dispute require Evidence of Inspiration, being the Rule of Faith and Practice,</hi> he would make the World believe that he is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in all the Rules of Dispute; but I tell him, It had been more proper and reasonable for him to have required Evidence of our being Divinely inspired, as a Man in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring unsatisfied Condition that wants In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, then as one that had given and promised before to prove his positive Charge

               <hi>of the</hi> Quakers <hi>being no</hi> Christians. It was his Part to prove this, or else to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his Confident Rashness &amp; Folly; for could he with any Seriousness demand an Evidence of our being inspired of God (when before he had concluded us <hi>no Christians,</hi> and promised Proof thereof) and saith, <hi>At this turn we could do no more then</hi> Muggleton, which is a Reviling Aspersion: But we are sure it was a sorry Shift in him, instead of proving <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>no</hi> Christians, to put W. P. upon either proving himself a Minister of Christ, or to produce an Evidence for the Rule of his Faith <hi>by Inspiration;</hi> and what that Evidence was he would have besides the Spirit's own self-Evidence, concurring with a Holy Conversation, he did not shew us, but this is like the rest of his uncertain Work against us, to make <hi>a Buz and a Noise</hi> in the World, to render such Odious as are more Righteous then himself, as in his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, Audacious, Daring Challenge he most falsly accuseth us.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That our former Opinions</hi> [I suppose, since we were a People] <hi>were Vile, Absurd and Nonsensical, and that he proved to our Faces to make Void all Rules of Faith and</hi> Christian <hi>Practice.</hi>

            <p>These are notorious Falshoods, and to these two last many Hundreds that were present can testifie the contrary, and that <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> herein is a most false and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Boaster.</p>
            <p>These Falshoods together with his <hi>daringly challenging &amp; grosly reviling us</hi> in his Paper, are notwithstanding entituled by him, <hi>A sober Request;</hi> but now since we find upon the same Challenge another Title put before this, which is <hi>[Quakers no Christians]</hi> Judge Reader, was this proper to such a Paper, <hi>requesting a Meeting to prove us no</hi> Christians? He and his Bookseller might very well have spared this Title until such Proof had been made, as it might have been proper to, and not thus to cover their beggarly Shifts with

notorious Untruths, do but see how <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Work hangs together, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quakers</hi> no <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A sober Request to the</hi> Quakers.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I earnestly request a Meeting with you, to prove, That you are no Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I require an Evidence for the Rule of your Faith, by Inspiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no farther Proof we have as yet from him of his Charge that the <hi>Quakers are no Christians.</hi> Is it not easy to see the Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Folly of these men, and how they make <hi>Lyes their Refuge,</hi> and cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Falshoods?</p>
            <p>For <hi>his daring us to appoint Time &amp; Place,</hi> he querieth, <hi>If this Phrase signifies any more then if you are not afraid to appoint Time and Place?</hi> As if we could have no other Reason, but being afraid of <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> to forbear appointing Time and Place to meet him: Oh Insolent, Vain-glorious Boaster! dost thou not know in thy own Conscience and by sufficient Experience, that we have not been afraid of thee?

After the same rate he further cracks thus, viz. <hi>Whether I had not good Reason to think, you were afraid to hear your selves prov'd No Christians, when all your Wits and Time were chiefly exhausted in two publick Meetings to divert us from the Proof thereof, as Thousands can testifie,</hi> pag. 7.</p>
            <p>A most notorious Untruth &amp; gross Abuse, as thousands can testifie; For,</p>

            <p n="2">2. Hath <hi>Jer.

               <hi>Jeremy Ives,</hi> for Proof of his daring Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and to stop <hi>T. Rudyard,</hi> quotes <hi>Edw.

            </p>
            <p>It seems this daring Champion <hi>J.

the most, and which had the Power and Spirit of God with them, &amp;c. E. B</hi>'s Works, fol. 470.</p>
            <p>Now let any Reasonable Man judge whether this Proposition for a mutual Liberty to preach without Persecution, and to see or try the Effect of each One's Ministry, was not more serious and of another kind then <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi>'s Daring Challenge, mixt with Untruths and Abuses, favouring of a Boasting Scornful Spirit.</p>
            <p>And <hi>2dly,</hi> for E. B'<hi>s Challenge to the Priests of</hi> Dublin <hi>to meet him and</hi> F. Howgil, <hi>to try their God, their Ministry and Worship:</hi> This was when these two were Prisoners in <hi>Dublin</hi> proposed to those of the persecuting Spirit; the Reason whereof is plainly given, <q>They being under Afflictions and Sufferings, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly reproached, and the Lord's Truth greatly infamed by many Backbiting and Slanderous Tongues, especially by profest Ministers in the Ears of their People, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them, as being <hi>Jesuits, Seducers, Deceivers, Hereticks, Blasphemers and Witches,</hi> Fol. 90 <hi>of</hi> E.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66003:11"/>
from such Infamies and Reproaches in the Presence of their Accusers: Had <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> been under such Suffering by the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and made such a Proposition to them, he might have made this his Instance; but he and his Brethren have not been willing thankfully to enjoy their own Liberties qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in a Time of Peace, but have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to render us (who have ben a suffering People) as Odious and Obnoxious as they can, wherein their Design seems most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to stir up Persecution against us, like Ungrateful Men.</p>
            <p>His other Instance is that of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> his Challenge, to fast seaven Dayes and seaven Nights, &amp;c. made to <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> of divers Sorts, as <hi>Presbyters, Independents, Baptists, Fifth-Monarchy Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Jeremy</hi> is pleased to render him <hi>like a Hector or S<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

E's Confidence, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66003:11"/>
how he might have been born up in such a Case, it seems not reasonable that either <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> or I should determine to the World (whatever we think) while none of them dare adventure upon such a Tryal with him: I must confess, the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> were rather to be commended <note place="margin">1 Kings 18.</note> for their Confidence in adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing the Tryal of their God upon <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Challenge, then <hi>Jer.</hi> and his Brethren, though those Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> had but ill Success: But if <hi>J. Ives</hi> objects that S. E. had no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Instance for such a Challenge, but only an Impulse by Inspiration without Evidence: I reply, neither hath <hi>Jeremy</hi> Scripture to controul him herein, nor durst he adventure upon Tryal for the Proof or Evidence of such an Impulse (Yet <hi>Fasting</hi> is more easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Scripture then <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s <hi>Challenge)</hi> However, it is not reasonable we should send S. E. to <hi>Bedlam</hi> before Tryal, or that he be found so fit for it as <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> has rendred him.</p>
            <p>Another Instance is, G. Fox <hi>calling the Doctors in</hi> Europe <hi>to come forth, and meet him in the open Field, and to answer him if they dare;</hi> and for this he quotes <hi>A Primer for the Schollars and Doctors in</hi> Europe, in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66003:12"/>
Epistle, p. 4. and in the Book, p. 40 &amp; 41. Wherein J. I. hath unfairly cited the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is not at all of the Nature of his Challenge; for this <hi>Primer</hi> chiefly consists of Queries upon their seaven Arts &amp; Terms, used in the Universities and Schools of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: In the Place cited the Words are truly thus, viz. <hi>These Queries are to call them out into the Field, that every one may see their Garment, that they may give Answer to every one of these Words, Names &amp; Things; let them come out now to little Children;</hi> thus in <hi>Epist.</hi> p. 4. And after divers hard terms about <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> in p. 40. he queries thus, <hi>Whether or no they are the Words that the Holy Ghost hath taught? answer me, if you can, or da<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But here are not the Words, <hi>Come forth and meet me in the open Field, and answer me if you dare,</hi> according to <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Citation.</p>
            <p>Now consider what Parallel there can be between <hi>G. F</hi>'s calling the <hi>Schollars</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> to come out to little Children, to explain their Terms of Art; and <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Insulting, Scornful and Reviling Challenge hypocritically named <hi>A Sober Request;</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66003:12"/>
surely, the <hi>Schollars</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> might have given a sober Answer unto <hi>G. F</hi>'s Queries, and explained their hard Words and Terms of Art, as publickly in Print, in the open Field or Face of the World, without during them to appointing such a Meeting as <hi>J. Ives</hi> dares and begs for in his Challenge, to prove the <hi>Quakers No Christians,</hi> after he had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opportunities, and made divers Attempts to do it before: <hi>G. F.</hi> used no such Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty nor Hypocrisie or Envy in his calling out the <hi>Doctors,</hi> as <hi>J. Ives</hi> had done against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as appears in comparing <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Primer</hi> (to the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Schollars</hi> of <hi>Europe)</hi> with J. Ives'<hi>s Sober Request to the</hi> Quakers: We value not his Outcry of <hi>Baseness, Railing, and Clamoring, and wilful Baseness;</hi> herein he shews but his fretful Huffing against us, &amp; himself guilty thereof.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>our own Prophets outdoing of him twenty Times,</hi> as he saith, their outdoing is neither of the Nature of his doings, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with those Circumstances; for <hi>his</hi> (as hath been told him) <hi>is False, Impertinent and Impudent:</hi> He by daring us rendering <hi>us afraid to meet him,</hi> which is a gross Untruth, &amp; <hi>Reviling us,</hi> endeavours to make us <hi>Odious</hi> before Tryal, and to vaunt and insult over
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66003:13"/>
us in a <hi>frothy light Spirit,</hi> which hath evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared in him.</p>
            <p>In short: Further to shew the Disparity of <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> his insolent frothy Challenge to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and our Friends serious Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge and Propositions to the <hi>Pope, Cardinals,</hi> and other Persecutors, as <hi>T.

                  </gap>osas,</hi> p. 18, 19. answers <hi>Jeremy</hi> thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>If he means by <hi>Sober Request,</hi> that Expression of his, <hi>If you dare appoint Time and Place, &amp;c.</hi> it is past my Skill to find the Correspondency of the Body of his Sheet to its Head or Title; but if <hi>Daring to appoint</hi> be the best Terms the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> can invite us to a <hi>Religious Discourse,</hi> I must declare his Language is so far from being <hi>scriptural,</hi> that it comes short of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Hectors</hi> or <hi>Sword-men</hi> of our Time, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Daring Challenge shews it self not to be on a Serious Religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, nor in the best Terms of Invitation thereto; but rather in this somewhat like the common <hi>Hectors</hi> or <hi>Sword-men</hi> of the Times, that confide in their own Strength and Art (as he doth in his pedantick Knack of sophistical Twisting and Turning in his

Arguings) he provides, <hi>That none be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to speak</hi> (as the Disputants) <hi>but himself and another, whom we shall appoint;</hi> as also, <hi>that a certain Hour be agreed on for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and another for the Ending of the Disputation for that day, and that neither Party shall exceed that Time, unless by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Consent:</hi> wherein he has very carefully contriv'd his Matter, that he may not be spent, or beaten out of Breath; and as a man that has no super-natural Aid to trust to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doubtful that his Natural Strength should fail (in case his single Opposer should not be stinted to a few Hours) which is quite contrary to the Nature of <hi>S.

Person be stinted and pitcht upon: for otherwise he has Cause to be doubtful, that his God would fail him. I will conclude, that the true God did not call him to give forth such a Challenge as his is; for he hath no Rule nor Authority from the Scriptures for it, nor any Example from Christ's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for such a Daring Vapouring Challenge; nor can he Evidence any special Command for it by immediate Inspiration or Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Heaven (as our Friends profess) for that's inconsistent with his Religion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own presumptuous Will is his Rule and Law for his Challenge, both as to the Matter and Manner of it, as having no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either in the Holy Scriptures or Power of God.</p>
            <p>Whereas from his <hi>Daring us</hi> to appoint Time and Place to prove the <hi>Quakers No Christians,</hi> it was told him, that <hi>then it seems they are not yet proved No Christians;</hi> upon which he demands, <hi>Whether a Truth may not be oftner prov'd then once, especially where some stop their Ears, as the Deaf Adder?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon I ask him, if he had before proved us No <hi>Christians,</hi> or really judged he did so, Was it proper for him to dare and beg for another Meeting meerly to prove us No <hi>Christians,</hi> which is not <hi>again</hi> to prove
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66003:14"/>
us none? or did he expect to open our Ears by going over his Matter again? But if he reckoned us such <hi>Deaf Adders,</hi> that would not hear him before, his Business had been rather to let the World know how rarely he had proved his Charge against us, and not to trouble the World, or alarm City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with his Cracking and Boasting what he would do in his daring Vaunts, which favour of meer Pride, Vanity and Impudence, and not of any Seriousness, or Good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; nor as a man that would really seek our Conversion to <hi>Christianity,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us none; for did ever the Apostles or Ministers of Christ thus dare vilifie, reproach or insult over the poor <hi>Ethnicks</hi> or moral <hi>Heathen</hi> (as we are counted) in the sight of their Enemies, or open View of the World in order to their Conversion) as <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> has dealt by the despised <hi>Quakers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the Question <hi>T. R.</hi> put to him, <hi>Whether this be that</hi> Jeremy, <hi>that was cast into</hi> New-gate <hi>upon a Religious Account, and for his Testimony against</hi> Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>in the year</hi> 1660. To this he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>I am not that</hi> Jeremy <hi>that was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to</hi> New-gate <hi>for a Religious Refusing the</hi> Oath of Allegiance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66003:15"/>
On which I ask, if it was not for some kind of refusing the <hi>Oath?</hi> and whether if a Conscientious Refusing, it was not Religious?</p>
            <p>But that <hi>Jeremy</hi> got out of Prison by <hi>Swearing,</hi> this he denyeth not; for he saith, <hi>I am that</hi> Jeremy, <hi>that took the</hi> Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, <hi>and writ a Book to prove that some Oathes were Lawful, though all were not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, I'le not press him, whether he did not once reckon the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful (when he was committed to <hi>New-gate)</hi> but tell him, that methinks he doth a little like a Temporizer, colour over and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue the Business of his Letter to his Brother <hi>Pittman</hi> and Brother <hi>Sewel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. First, in saying, <hi>I am not that</hi> Jeremy <hi>that ever writ against the</hi> Oath of Allegiance, <hi>either privately or publickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In saying, <hi>I am that</hi> Jeremy, <hi>that did in a Letter blame a Friend for saying, He had rather have given Fifty Pound then have took the</hi> Oath of Allegiance, <hi>and yet swore he took it Freely and Willingly, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which, <hi>Jeremy,</hi> thou seemest only to strike at thy Brother's Hesitation, Scruple and Dissimulation about the taking the Oath, and not at the meer taking it, or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:66003:15"/>
But methinks thy severe Letter to them sounds otherwise, as that it was for taking the Oath, as well as their Scruple or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction in doing it; else, what mean these Passages in thy Letter? <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do well to be angry with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you would be as easily perswaded to part with, as unwilling to suffer for your spiritual Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>How unlike the</hi> Christians <hi>in former Times are you, whose Zeal was so hot for God that their Eyes prevented the Morning, that thereby they might prevent the Rage of the Adversary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I alwayes did conclude, that those that would quit the Cause of Righteousness, would quit the Wayes of Holiness, as yesterday's sad Experience hath taught, to the perpetual Joy of your Adversaries, and the sadning the Hearts, and adding Afflictions to the Bonds of the Prisoners of he Lord.</hi> Thus far <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See here, was it only the Scruple of these Men in taking the Oath that is opposed or reproved, and not their taking it? Or was it the Regret they had upon them in the taking it, that would be such a perpetual Joy to the Adversaries; or rather the Matter of Fact, as it appeared to them, namely, the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66003:16"/>
taking the Oath, and therein acting contrary to the Testimony of others that suffered, to the sadning their Hearts, and adding to their Afflictions? Besides, saith <hi>Jeremy, My Bonds are my Crown, but your Cowardly Spirit is my great Cross:</hi> But it seems he kept this Crown but a little while, if he in a few Dayes after got himself out of Prison by Swearing: And wherein did their Cowardly Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but in their Swearing, contrary t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their Consciences, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> in his chiding Letter saith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now God is proving to see if you will obey him or no; and did not yesterday's Work wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that you are willing to prefer the Fear of a Man that must dye, before the Fear of the great God; and the Fear of them that can kill the Body, before the Fear of the Lord that can cast both Body and Soul into Hell? I have no more to say but this, that your Cowardly Temporizing and Complying with the</hi> PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEPTS OF MEN, <hi>makes me jealous, that your Fear towards the Lord is taught by the Precepts of Men.</hi> Thus far <hi>Jeremy</hi> again.</p>
            <p>Now the Question is, did J. I. in all these Words bear upon their <hi>Hesua<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>on</hi> or <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in taking the Oath, or only reprove their Swearing they took it freely, when they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66003:16"/>
could not really do it? Methinks, if this had been the Thing, and that <hi>Jeremy</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally allowed of the Matter of Fact it self, as <hi>the taking the Oath,</hi> he should have writ in another Strain then he did unto his Brethren for taking it; he should not have charged them <hi>for quitting the Cause of Righteousness to the Perpetual Joy of the Adversaries; nor with adding Afflictions to the Bonds of the Lord's Prisoners; nor with yesterday's Work, witnessing their Willingness to prefer the Fear of a Man that must dye; nor of Cowardly Temporizing and Complying with the</hi> PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEPTS <hi>of Men:</hi> for surely, here is the <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> concerned; but if he had approved of the Oath it self, and only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved of their Weakness in scrupling and taking it in an unsatisfied Conscience or doubtful Mind, he should then have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have removed their <hi>Scruples,</hi> and to have pacified their <hi>weak Consciences</hi> with urging the Lawfulness of what they did, by demonstrating it to them; but the Thing appears otherwise, and that <hi>Jeremy</hi> did fall under the Judgment that he gave against his Brethren, as namely, that of <hi>Cowardly Temporizing and Complying with the Precepts of Men;</hi> as may be suspected from his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:66003:17"/>
               <hi>What if I had been once against the Oath, &amp; afterward had took it, must this needs make me an Impostor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely this doth not clear him, nor render him a Stable <hi>Christian.</hi>

            <p>I suppose <hi>Tho. Rudyard</hi> hath answered for himself to this Matter elsewhere, viz. to a Paper of <hi>T.

The <hi>Baptists</hi> Boasts (about the said <hi>Lying Wonder)</hi> are sufficiently detected in our Friends Answers thereto.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jeremy</hi> thinks he payes us off in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Passages we are now coming to, as in asking, <hi>Whether it be not very Uncharitable for</hi> W.

Treason, <hi>and</hi> Garments rol'd in the Blood of Kings, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must tell <hi>Jeremy,</hi> That he hath herein dealt unfairly by <hi>W. P.</hi> and aggravated his Words by adding BLOOD and TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON] Whenas his Words are, <q>They are true <hi>Gospel-Ministers,</hi> and their Feet truly Beautiful, whose <hi>Gospel</hi> is, <hi>Peace on Earth, and Good-will towards Men;</hi> and not Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rol'd in the Blood of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Rulers and People: No Worldly Armies, Battels, Spoils, Sequestrations, &amp;c.</q> Though its true, that <hi>John Faldo</hi> and his Brethren are retorted upon by <hi>W. P.</hi> for their Preaching up the former War; but this was not to violate the King's Favour in pardoning them, but to give them a Check for their being so busie against us in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Spirit; and particularly, for <hi>Iohn Faldo</hi>'s Abuse of <hi>William Penn,</hi> and medling with his deceased Father; about which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to <hi>W. P</hi>'s own Answer to speak for himself, in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to <hi>Iohn Faldo)</hi> pag 405, 406. And so <hi>W. P</hi>'s Design might be rather to Humble them, and to reclaim them from that old bitter Spirit, wherein they were formerly Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, and yet bring forth their Invectives,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66003:18"/>
tending to stir up Persecution against the People of the Lord [And have not both the Holy Prophets and Christ also reminded such a persecuting Generation, both of their own and their Fathers former Iniquities, seeing them continuing therein in the same Spirit of Envy?] But I doubt not but <hi>W. P.</hi> desires their Repentance, that they may be converted from their Persecuting Spirit, that they may receive Pardon from God as well as from the King.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ieremy,</hi> thou that wouldst seem so Zealous against Uncharitableness, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Laws of God and the King; hast thou dealt charitably by <hi>E. Burroughs,</hi> in saying, <hi>He d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Hast thou not herein shewn a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Spirit to render us obnoxious? And why so? Because <hi>E. B.</hi> in severely Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late Powers of their Down-fall, did by way of Reproof tell <hi>Oliver</hi> what God had done for him, even in the same Letter to him wherein he plainly also telleth him of the <hi>Great Oppressions which the People of God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66003:19"/>
suffered under him, both in their Persons and Estates;</hi> Saying also to Oliver, <hi>If I perish I must speak the Truth; most of the Prisons this day in all thy Iurisdictions do testifie the Unjust Judgments and Great Oppressions and Cruelties;</hi> yea, and further conditionally threatens <hi>Oliver, That God would confound and him;</hi> see <hi>E. B</hi>'s Works, from pag. 551. to pag. 583. how plainly and faithfully he did warn <hi>Oliver,</hi> and those men then in Power, of their Overthrow. To be sure <hi>E. B.</hi> was no Temporizer; neither have we forborn in dealing plainly with those in Power, when we have had Cause, as the Lord hath moved and authorized us.</p>
            <p>And further to clear <hi>E.

their Conscientious Tenderness in this Case, and that according to a good Conscience, if in Love desired, or out of an honest Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for a good End, without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Injury towards them or their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: But they have no Cause to think that <hi>Ier. Ives</hi> doth enquire or accuse them to the World for any good End, or out of any Friendship to them, or Love to their Souls; but rather from a Design of Mischief or Injury, as the Tenour of his Discourse against them imports: Therefore they are resolved rather to suffer his Revilings, and endure his Clamours, then gratifie a mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Spirit, by giving him Account of their Affairs or Proceedings for their Properties &amp; Rights, which only they seek for; and not to injure their Neighbours (or any Man else) in their Names, Persons or Estates.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if either <hi>Ieremy,</hi> or any <hi>Baptists,</hi> or others for him, have made Search in <hi>Chancery,</hi> or do enquire of any Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereto, <hi>whether any of the</hi> Quakers <hi>have given in their Answer upon Oath?</hi> I think that he and such his Enquirers are Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies in other mens Matters (while 'tis not their own Concernments) And whilst their Design and End therein is for Evil against our Friends, it might be supected by those
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66003:22"/>
Officers in trust concerned, as not to be for Good towards them or us, in their Inquiry; and that therefore such busie Inquisitors might justly have met with a Repulse, and been rejected, and not answer'd in their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Attempts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To his falsly accusing the <hi>Quakers</hi> with <hi>daily impleading People at Law,</hi> I say, That though some of them have Occasion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to make use of the Law, they are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated thereto, to maintain their just Rights &amp; Properties from such Unconscionable Men as would otherwise make a Prey upon them, to Ruin them and theirs, and not to injure others, or defraud any of their Rights; in such Cases the Law is used Lawfully, being for Justice and Right: Its probable that if the <hi>Quakers</hi> could neither make use of the Law, nor have their Answers accepted, for what's their own proper Rights, but be devoured by Unreasonable or Wicked Men, our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser would not be so offended, nor inquisitive as he is into our Friends Affairs; but he would think it ill to be so dealt by: If his Brethren should be asked, What think you of Jeremy Ives, <hi>who boasts that he is able to approve himself as Honest in all his Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies in the World as the best of the</hi> Quakers?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66003:23"/>
But hath he done so? hath he performed Promise and Covenant with all, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all his Creditors? have none of them had cause to complain of him in those Matters? Its not unlike but he would be very short at this, and give such an Answer as this, <hi>What's that to you? meddle with your own Business: I will not make you my Confessor;</hi> or, <hi>I have done what I can to satisfie all, or so far as I was able:</hi> And so our Friends can easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, What's their Concerns to <hi>Ier. Ives?</hi> What has he to do to question or accuse them therein? They have endeavoured to keep their Consciences in-offensive towards God and Men, as those that must give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God, and not unto their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who hav<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no Jurisdiction over them or their Consciences.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I must take Leave further to enquire, seeing that <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> and <hi>Henry Don</hi> with divers others, have thus defined an Oath, viz. to say, <hi>God is my Witness, God is my Record; I speak the Truth in Christ, I lye not; my Conscience beareth me Witness in the Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that these Expressions, with many more of the like Nature, are equivalent to an Oath;</hi> and these to evince, <hi>That the Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>himself sware; and that not only
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66003:23"/>
Christ, but the Apostle did both practise, enjoyn and exact Swearing upon others;</hi> and to prove, that <hi>he charged others to swear,</hi> J. <hi>I.</hi> cites 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. &amp; 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 27.

What has he to do to shew himself a <hi>Busie Body</hi> in other Men's Matters? And why should he rake
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66003:24"/>
into his Neighbours Affairs; either to find out Occasion against them, or to prejudice them in their Properties? Should not <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>'s Business rather be, to convince the <hi>Quakers</hi> of the real Definition of an Oath, that they may not interfer with their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rather then to seek to make them odious to the World, as Men perfidious therein? For (this is not the Way to perswade them to <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Christianity) they would not willingly or wittingly profess one Thing and practise another: Thus far I have signified what I really think, in Answer to <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Question.</p>
            <p>As for his high Charge, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How Impious then are the</hi> Quakers, <hi>who some of them swear themselves. and most of them take Pleasure in them that do so?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Can</hi> Quakers <hi>be Men of Conscience and Integrity, that while they judge Swearing, will procure Men to swear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both which are manifestly false; for they neither take Pleasure therein, nor procure Men to swear: if any of them have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for <hi>Witnesses</hi> that do not scruple an Oath, it is the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> not the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> that put them upon, or tender them an Oath; for if their Testimony without an Oath might be accepted, the <hi>Quakers</hi> would
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66003:24"/>
be better satisfied: Let the <hi>Magistrates</hi> enjoyn them to speak Truth upon what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty they shall see meet; we have proposed this for our selves as well as others.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Ieremy</hi> takes the Grant, that <hi>W. P.</hi> gave to his Request for a Meeting to be upon <hi>Dishonourable or Impossible Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and so worse then a Down-right Denyal;</hi> of which he first mentio<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>th that, <hi>If Mr.</hi> Kiffin, <hi>Mr.</hi> Plant, <hi>Mr.</hi> Dike <hi>and Mr.</hi> Hicks <hi>will give it under their Hands, that they will be bound to stand to what</hi> Jeremy <hi>shall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Propose, Affirm or Deny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. P</hi>'s first Proposal runs thus: <hi>viz.</hi> 1st, <hi>Let</hi> Jeremy Ives <hi>make it appear to us, that he is deputed to this Work; for it is beneath</hi> US <hi>to engage against a single Person, as well as beside our Business, as the Case lieth, to think our selves concerned in his</hi> Rodemontado's <hi>and vapouring Challenges: He is Privateer but for himself, and stands upon no Body's Legs but his own, and some think, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well on them neither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why is this Impossible? I suppose he doth not count it Dishonourable to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: But if them Impossible, it argues, they have not so much Confidence in <hi>Ieremy</hi> as he has in himself, and that they think not fit <hi>t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:66003:25"/>
embarque their Cause in that Bottom:</hi> And what Reason is there then for a whole Body of People to subject themselves to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious <hi>Daring</hi> and Examination of such a singular boasting Bravado, if his own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren cannot confide in, nor subject their Cause to him; and then is it reasonable We should meet him alone without a Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them to this Work?</p>
            <p>Another Condition is, <hi>That all we have against</hi> T. H. <hi>may be first debated;</hi> and this is but reasonable, and J. I. unreasonable in interposing to divert our Prosecution of this: The Condition is thus laid down by <hi>W. P.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he</hi> (to wit, <hi>Jeremy Ives) pe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> T. Hicks, <hi>as to the Matter charged by us against him, to wit, of writing</hi> Forgeries, Perversions <hi>and</hi> Slanders.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That before he enters upon proving us No</hi> Christians, <hi>he would tell us what a True</hi> Christian <hi>is, or we go by no Standard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Prove to us that he is that</hi> Christian, <hi>or else he is unfit to prove another No</hi> Christian.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That we are not such</hi> Christians, <hi>but Hereticks and Impostors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To our proposing that what we have against T. H. may be first debated, <hi>Jer.</hi> tells us, that <hi>we will not vindicate the Honour of our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, till we have vindicated the Honour of our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66003:25"/>
Personal Reputations, as being more zealous thereof then of the Honour of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> This is a gross and apparent Untruth; for both our Religion and Principles, as well as our Personal Reputations are concern'd in our Charge against <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> as appears plainly both in his <hi>Forgeries, Perversions,</hi> and <hi>Slanders,</hi> which concern both Doctrine and Practice: but it seems <hi>Jeremy</hi> is very raw, and unversed in the Controversies between us, and yet his Confidence will serve him to engage in the Quarrel for <hi>Tho. Hicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the second; He counts this <hi>another of our poor Put-offs, and Unreasonable, that he should make good any more then he has charg'd against us:</hi> He counts it unreasonable then to personate <hi>T. H.</hi> in the Matter that we charge against him, was it not then Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable he should so deeply engage for him before? But <hi>Jeremy</hi> sayes, <hi>He is ready to make good what he has charged against us, by the Grace of God, if we</hi> DARE <hi>meet him.</hi> But this is to be understood as a <hi>distinct Offer of it self, without Respect to the Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> Tho. Hicks: However, it is but <hi>single Daring</hi> and <hi>Vapouring Jeremy</hi> still, whose Brags and Attempts we value not, but slight his Folly therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:66003:26"/>
To the third: He counts this <hi>impertinent, When,</hi> saith he, <hi>we tell them they are no</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <hi>either of one sort or another;</hi> This he tells the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and it is but his own telling; and I do not think but he doth in this violate some better Perswasions and Convictions, that he has had in himself: And while he confesseth, that <hi>he is a good</hi> Christian, <hi>that hath a Rule for his Faith and Practice in the Christian-Religion, and endeavours to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of his Strength and Understanding to believe and live accordingly.</hi> He concludes, they <hi>are No</hi> Christians <hi>that have no Rule for their Faith and Practice in the</hi> Christian-<hi>Religion; and such are the Quakers,</hi> saith he, pag. 14. See what an Imperious and Censorious Judge this is: He says, we have No <hi>Rule,</hi> though we prosess, believe and practically own the Guidance of the Spirit of Christ, and in Subjection thereto do own the Holy Scriptures: And for our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Conversations,</hi> I hope he doth not conclude, that either the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neral are therein <hi>Unchristian,</hi> or that his own is more <hi>Christian</hi> then theirs; how comes he then to presume, that we have <hi>not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ,</hi> or none of his Light in us <hi>for a Rule,</hi> in affirming, that the Quakers <hi>have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66003:26"/>
No Rule for their Faith and Practice in the</hi> Christian-<hi>Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Presumption is not strange to us, since he could openly tell <hi>William Gibson</hi> and me, that <hi>We were not inlightened with the Light of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could not but then take notice of the Man's Insolency and Foolish Censoriousness; but how doth he prove that the <hi>Quakers have No Rule for their Faith and Practice in the</hi> Christian-<hi>Religion, and therefore are no</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? He thus attempts it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That though</hi> George Keith, <hi>to keep up your Credit with the People, said, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were onned by you as a Seoundary Rule for your Faith and Practice; yet</hi> Edw. Burroughs <hi>contradicts him, and tells us in so many words, That the Scriptures are</hi> NO <hi>Rule or Guide of Faith and Life to the Saints; see his Works, fol. 515. and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile your Prophets as well as you can.</hi> Thus far <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would make the World believe, that he has here given the <hi>Quakers</hi> a deadly Blow, in rendring their Prophets irreconcileable; yea, and to fasten the Contradiction, he saith, that <hi>E. B.</hi> tells us <hi>in so many words, That the Scriptures are</hi> NO RULE <hi>or Guide of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> for this he bids us <hi>see his Works, fol.</hi> 515.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:66003:27"/>
How now, bold <hi>Jeremy!</hi> I have seen the place quoted by thee, and thou hast mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly belyed <hi>Edw. Burroughs,</hi> to prove thy false Charge; for <hi>Edwards</hi> Words in the place are thus, viz. <hi>The Scriptures are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and were given forth to be read and to be fulfilled; yet they are not</hi> THE RULE <hi>and Guide of Faith and Life unto the Saints; but the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of God, that gave forth the Scriptures, that is</hi> THE RULE <hi>and Guide, Teacher and Leader into all Truth:</hi> See also his following words in the next Clause, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, <hi>That the Scriptures are the Words of God; that the Spirit of God is</hi> THE RULE <hi>of Faith and Life to the Saints; that men ought to search the Scriptures, and believe what is therein written, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See now <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> his words are not as thou citest them, <hi>that the Scriptures are NO RULE,</hi> but that they are not <hi>THE RULE and Guide of Faith and Life unto the Saints, but the Spirit;</hi> and yet the Scriptures <hi>to be Searched, Read and Fulfilled:</hi> so that he denyes them not, but plainly implyes them to be <hi>A RULE,</hi> but not <hi>THE RULE,</hi> that is, not the <hi>most Eminent or Highest Rule,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit:</hi> And how doth this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict <hi>George Keith</hi>'s saying, <hi>That we own the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66003:27"/>
Scriptures as a Secundary Rule?</hi> which also implies a primary or Principal Rule, to wit, the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as well as <hi>E. B.</hi> doth in his words before. For my part, I cannot understand any more Contradiction between saying, <hi>The Scriptures are a Secundary Rule,</hi> and yet <hi>not THE RULE and Guide of Faith and Life unto the Saints,</hi> then there is between saying, Jeremy Ives <hi>is a</hi> Baptist-<hi>Preacher, and yet not the principal Preacher among them;</hi> or between <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi>'s <hi>being a Man, and yet not the Chief (or Best) of Men;</hi> though I confess this too mean an Instance for the Subject before, but only somewhat to illustrate the Distinction. I was unwilling to have charged <hi>Jeremy</hi> with <hi>Forgery</hi> (from the Place he quotes) in saying, that <hi>E. B. tells us in so many words, that the Scriptures are NO Rule:</hi> But now upon Enquiry and Search into his Falshood herein, I am satisfied that I should do him no Wrong to charge <hi>It</hi> upon him, and let the Place quoted by him in <hi>E. B</hi>'s Works determine it.</p>
            <p>Again, I find no Inconsistency between <hi>William Smith</hi>'s confessing <hi>Christ and the Spirit of God to be the Rule</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">As in his Primer, <hi>pag.</hi> 10, 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>for trying Spirits, searching the Heart, and not the Scriptures</hi> (yet confessing them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66003:28"/>
to be of great Service) and <hi>G. K.</hi>'s owning the Scriptures <hi>for a Secundary Rule,</hi> that Christ should be preferred before and above the Scriptures, both as <hi>to trying</hi> and <hi>discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and yet they serviceable in their place, as Christ opens the Understanding in them, can be no Opposition.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jeremy</hi> objects, That <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny the Scriptures to be a Rule of Faith and Practice, comprehensive of the whole Duty of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are so comprehensive as declaring the whole Duty of Man, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith and Practice (as to the Sum and Substance thereof, respecting Man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) I know none of us deny: But that they are not that Manifesting Rule of every particular Act of Faith and Obedience that God may require respectively, I think this Opposer cannot deny; but that he hath granted thus much at sundry Discourses, as with respect to such Prophets and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as God might, for ought he knew, raise up in these dayes, and peculiarly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate and send forth with extraordinary Messages to particular Places and Peoples, in which God only (by his Spirit) is their great <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide.</hi> 2. And so God is in discovering to Man his inward Estate and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66003:28"/>
Condition, even the Thoughts and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Heart, with all his Particular Actions.</p>
            <p>But sayes <hi>Jer. Ives, They pretend that the Spirit is the Rule, when they give no more Evidence of it then</hi> Mahomet <hi>or</hi> Muggleton.</p>
            <p>But this is manifest Reproach and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: We give as much Evidence, both in Doctrine and Conversation, as is necessary to evince our <hi>Christianity;</hi> And as <hi>Jeremy</hi> cannot disprove, nor doth he appear to be a Man of that Spiritual Mind and Judgment, as to know what Evidence we have given, or what Evidence we can give, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison is gross and impious; and Neither <hi>It,</hi> nor his bare Charge (nor yet his calling upon us to produce an Evidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) shall serve his turn to prove us either <hi>No Christians</hi> or <hi>Impostors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Condition for a Meeting is, <hi>That</hi> Jeremy <hi>prove himself that</hi> Christian, <hi>or else he is unfit to prove another No</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: To this he saith, <hi>But is not this pretty? As they define a</hi> Christian, <hi>there is no</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>but themselves; and when I have proved myself a</hi> Christian, <hi>which by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is a</hi> Quaker, <hi>then I think the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will be out of Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:66003:29"/>
To this I reply: I must needs look upon this as a very sorry Shift; for, but in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Condition before he is told, <hi>That before he enters upon proving us No</hi> Christians, <hi>he would tell us what a True</hi> Christian <hi>is, or we go by no Standard.</hi> See now here, how plainly this provides, <hi>first,</hi> for an Agreement upon the Definition of a True <hi>Christian,</hi> even such, as both <hi>Ieremy</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> might agree upon: Is it not reasonable, that the Terms of a Proposition, or Matter in Question, should be explained and agreed upon in all <hi>Controversies?</hi> and also reasonable, that when it is agreed what a True <hi>Christian</hi> is, that <hi>Jeremy</hi> should prove himself one before he be admitted to prove others none? And did the <hi>Quakers</hi> herein propose either to be the <hi>sole Judges,</hi> who is a True <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi> or have they hereby demerited this man's Sleight and Derision he thus taunteth them with? viz. <hi>Would it not make one smile to see the sad Shifts the Poor Men are put to?</hi> And what <hi>sad Shifts?</hi> What! to agree upon the Definition of a <hi>Christian,</hi> as a Standard to go by; and then for <hi>Jeremy</hi> to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that <hi>Christian</hi> first? else, What Credit can his Attempts be of, while he doth not prosecute others as a <hi>Christian,</hi> or Partaker
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66003:29"/>
of <hi>Christianity</hi> himself; Seeing he has so hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously charg'd others with being <hi>no Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further; It is not only the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but many others, that look upon <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> to be no True <hi>Christian,</hi> or worthy to bear that Name, or undertake <hi>in the Behalf of all</hi> Christians, <hi>to prove the</hi> Quakers <hi>none,</hi> as he promiseth, <hi>to produce a Deputation from the</hi> Baptists, <hi>if he can obtain it.</hi> Well, I'le assure him, if he doth, we will take it for granted, that the <hi>Baptists</hi> make him their great Agent, and we will look upon their Cause as highly concerned in him, and so far resigned to him; let him do what he can to maintain it, we are not at all doubtful on our parts of a good Iss<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> whom with his <hi>Abettors</hi> we charge with being guilty of <hi>Forgery, Slanders, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath a Fling at <hi>S. Eccles,</hi> charging him, that he saith of <hi>G. Fox, That it may be said of him, as it was said of Christ, that the World was made by him, though the World knew him not;</hi> and then addeth, <hi>Is not this a rare Christian?</hi> p. 15.</p>
            <p>Unto which I must tell <hi>Jeremy,</hi> That in my Understanding he hath both unfairly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and interpreted <hi>S.

               <q>I did not say, nor did I ever believe, that the World was made by <hi>G. F.</hi> but by Christ, who was in the World, and the World knew him not; so I say, it may be said of <hi>G.

                  <hi>First,</hi> For <hi>Idle and Ridiculous Opinions and Practices,</hi> as he would charge upon us in general: I do not yet find that he hath found them, <hi>in such Books and Persons as the</hi> Quakers <hi>declaredly own,</hi> as his words are; that Work is yet to do for ought I see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppose there were any <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Opinions</hi> contained in any Book or Books, said to be published <hi>in the Quakers Names</hi> and Behalf, if they have not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared against them, I deny that their Silence herein may reasonably pass for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Approbation, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> concludes; for its possible there may be Books said to be published in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Names and Behalf, which few, if any of the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ever read; and it were Unreasonable to charge those things upon them, or upon the whole Body of them, which they have had no hand in, nor been made privy to; neither would
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66003:31"/>
                  <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> or his Brethren be so served. Besides there may be Books writ on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of a People by indifferent Persons, which are not wholely to be condemned, or publickly declared against for some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Faults or Escapes where the Intent of the Writer was honest, and the greatest Part or Substance of the Matter serious and true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> Our Adversary asks, <hi>Why do not the Body of the</hi> Quakers <hi>meet together and agree to publish an</hi> Index Expurgatorious, <hi>to clear themselves of such Books they do not own; otherwise it will not be their Private Apologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing for themselves, when their Credit lies at stake, to say, they do not own this and the other Book, that will pass for Excuses among Wise Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I must confess, if he had good Ground for this Proposition, there seems to be some Reason in it more then he has shewn before: But I would ask this Law-Maker, if he doth really look upon the Body of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be attained to so much of sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Understanding, as here he seems to imply, that is as able to clear themselves of such Books &amp; Things, as they are liable to be called in question for, or as are unsound?</p>
               <p n="2">2. His granting that there are such Books as we do not own (and which tend to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66003:32"/>
Hazard of our Credit, if we do not publish an <hi>Index</hi> to clear our selves thereof: This implys, that we have a Judgment to clear our selves, and that so far the Light or Truth is risen amongst us, as not to own those things which may indanger our Credit; and then he should not charge us with those things, unless we did own them.</p>
               <p>Again, As we do not reckon our selves bound so far to take Cognizance of every Book or Paper, so as to read all over that hath been writ by all that have gone under the Name <hi>Quakers;</hi> so neither do we know Occasion to write such an <hi>Index</hi> as <hi>Ier<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>my</hi> prescribes, against any of our Friends Books that are declaredly owned by us.</p>
               <p>For those Opinions and Practices that are generally owned by us, we stand to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as neither being <hi>Idle</hi> nor <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> but Serious and Sound, agreeable to the holy Scriptures, and consistent with <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and value not all the <hi>Gain-sayings</hi> of our Adversaries: But if any Practice or Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Thing extraordinary be laid upon any one Particular among us, we impose it not upon others; and such must not stand or fall to Man's Judgment, but are accountable to God for what they do; For to Man's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Earthly Wisdom many things
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66003:32"/>
extraordinary or peculiar, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of God's Prophets, might seem both <hi>Idle</hi> &amp; <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> and those Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves seem Fools and Mad Men, as they were accounted of old.</p>
               <p>But further, seeing <hi>Ieremy Ives</hi> has before prescribed such a Method, as the <hi>Body of the</hi> Quakers <hi>to meet together, and agree to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sh an</hi> Index Expurgatorious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They that prescribe Rules, should be regular themselves; and they that make Laws should observe and keep Laws. Why do not the <hi>Baptists</hi> (who deem themselves <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Us</hi> none) begin, and shew <hi>Us</hi> such an Example, as he hath prescribed? since there are divers Opinions Contradictory one to another in the <hi>Baptists</hi> Books, both whereof cannot be true; as between the <hi>Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Principle and the <hi>Arminian</hi> (so called) or <hi>between</hi> an absolute <hi>Predestination of particular Persons to Salvation or Damnation from Eternity,</hi> and <hi>the General Grace of God, and Redemption in Christ for all men;</hi> And between <hi>the Impossibility of Believers falling from Grace,</hi> and <hi>the Possibility thereof,</hi> with divers other things, about which the <hi>Baptists</hi> differ among themselves. Why do not the Body of the <hi>Baptists</hi> meet together, &amp; agree first about their own Principles, and then
<pb facs="tcp:66003:33"/>
lish a Declaration against those Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s which may appear inconsistent with <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, Truth</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and an <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorious</hi> to clear themselves of all such <hi>Baptists</hi> Books as are writ to maintain such an Exploded Opinion, that People may no longer be deceived thereby? otherwise, if they refuse this Proposition, begun by <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> we may accordingly take the <hi>Baptists</hi> Silence herein, to pass for Consent and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all the <hi>Baptists</hi> Books, which the Body of <hi>Baptists</hi> have not publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared against: And then from hence I charge <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> with giving their Consent and Approbation to their Brother <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> his Three Fictitious <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi> and all the <hi>Absurdities, Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Abuses</hi> therein contain'd, so long as they are silent, and do not write an <hi>Index Expurgatorious,</hi> to clear themselves thereof; and so of all the rest of the <hi>Baptists</hi> Books, that contain in them both <hi>Idle, Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> and <hi>Contradictory Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Jeremy</hi> accuseth us with <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick-Principles, and new Articles of Faith and Practice frequently enjoyned by Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Inspiration.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>1st,</hi> What he means by the Word <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> which disdainfully he

casts upon us, he seems to intimate, that it<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> such as pretend <hi>Revelation from Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Immediate Inspiration for their Rule:</hi> It seems he pretends to neither, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides thereat, like the Scoffers of the Times: And how came he to get this word <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast?</hi> He should withal have told us its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Definition, and then it would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more plainly in what Sense he useth it. But I would ask him, if the <hi>Baptists</hi> at their first coming forth were not counted <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> by their Persecutors, when they profest the Help of the Spirit, or Immediate In piration in their Praying and Preaching, and the Sufficiency of the Spirit's Teaching, as <hi>Samuel How, William Kiffin,</hi> and many others did formerly? And how many of them did preach up and esteem the Inward Work of the Spirit and Grace of God in the Heart? which, it seems <hi>Jeremy,</hi> thou hast either had very little Experience of, or else art greatly apostatized, and become a Hard-hearted Mocker at the Acknowledgment of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inspiration,</hi> which Principle thou wilt not confute by calling us <hi>Idle Enthusiasts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Its an idle Untruth in thee to accuse us <hi>with frequently enjoyning New Articles of Faith and Practice, either by Immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration or Pretence thereof;</hi> neither hast
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66003:34"/>
thou shewn us what those Articles are, that thou sayest are thus frequently enjoyned?</p>
               <p>Again, I cannot but observe how Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly and Atheistically thou talkest, in conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding, <hi>That if a man pretends a Revelation from Heaven, or Immediate Inspiration for a Practice that's Absurd, the</hi> Quakers <hi>cannot Reprove him by Immediate Inspiration, because he pretends to that for his Practice as well as they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems <hi>Immediate Inspiration</hi> is of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Esteem with thee, and of as little Use with thee: If because some falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tend it for that which is Absurd, others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thereby Reprove him for it; at this rate of Arguing the True Prophets Mouthes should have been stopt from Reproving the False, because they pretended the same the True did, and could say, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And likewise the True Apostles should not have Reproved the False, because they pretended the same thing doubtless, when they transform'd themselves as the Ministers of Christ.</p>
               <p>But if by <hi>Immediate Inspiration</hi> Absurd or Evil Actions cannot be reproved where the same is but pretended, then farewel all true <hi>Christianity,</hi> true Savour, true Sence and Judgment. But doth not the Spirit of God
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66003:34"/>
search all things, and the Spiritual Man judge all things? Surely if this man did really own that there's any such thing in being now, as either <hi>Revelation from Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Immediate Inspiration,</hi> or that there is a <hi>True God,</hi> and that <hi>He is Known,</hi> he durst not talk at this idle sleighting rate, as he doth, about <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inspiration,</hi> as not a sufficient Rule to reprove Absurdities, where <hi>It</hi> can but be pretended for them. But yet a little before he grants <hi>a super-natural Evidence,</hi> that if we can give some <hi>super-natural Evidence why we should be received,</hi> as namely, in writing against the <hi>absurd Opinions</hi> of such <hi>as pretend they are revealed to them;</hi> but what Super-natural Evidence this is that he means, he tells us not, while he does not own the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of <hi>Immediate Inspiration</hi> to reprove absurd or evil Practices &amp; Opinions by: for if a supernatural Evidence doth not attend <hi>Immediate Inspiration,</hi> or <hi>Revelation from Heaven,</hi> it is no where to be found; then it follows, the Spirit is insufficient to evidence it self, or it is not Self evidencing, and such Doctrine as this will at length lead some to be such <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> as to say in their Hearts, <hi>There is No God:</hi> But I tell this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary to <hi>Immediate Inspiration,</hi> That the Spirit of God can no more be without a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66003:35"/>
super-natural Evidence, then the Sun can be without its Light; God has given an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Evidence thereof by his Light in all men's Consciences, which answers to the Spirit's Testimony and Ministry in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Spirit, which men may evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, if they close not their Eyes, or harden not their Hearts to cause their own Stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Overthrow.</p>
               <p>In order to a manifest Decision of the chief Matters in Controversie, I desire <hi>Jez. Ives,</hi> or any of his Brethren for him, to give a plain and ingenuous Answer to these <hi>Questions,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Whether Immediate Inspiration and Revelation from Heaven, are in Being in the True Church in these dayes, yea, or nay?</p>
               <p n="2">II. Whether Immediate Inspiration be not necessary to the being of a True <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi> inward?</p>
               <p n="3">III. What super-natural Evidence or necessary Proof doth <hi>J. I.</hi> require of any ones having Immediate Inspiration from God?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Whether any one be fit to try (or judge of) a Super-natural Evidence, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inspiration in another, but such a one as doth acknowledge and partake of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inspiration in himself?</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:66003:35"/>
V. Whether he that undertakes to prove others <hi>No Christians,</hi> ought not to be a True <hi>Christian,</hi> and first to approve himself such a one upon a true and undeniable Definition of a True <hi>Christian? [Thou Hypocrite, first cast out the Beam out of thine own Eye, &amp;c.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. What is the true and proper Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Discrimination of <hi>Enthusiast</hi> and <hi>Impostor?</hi> and so the real Derivation of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi> and <hi>Imposture?</hi> And whether there be not a plain Difference in the Nature of the Words? For Words and Terms, where either difficult or doubtful, must be explaind before Matters can be clearly discussed thereupon.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Whether it be not an Undervaluing of immediate Inspiration, for any to hold, <hi>That thereby men cannot Reprove an Absurd Opinion or Practice in such as pretend a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven for it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Whether the Apostles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Christians</hi> were oblieged to produce an Evidence of their Faith and Practice by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration at the Demand of their Enemies, or only when God call'd them thereunto?</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Whether to require an Evidence for our Faith by immediate Inspiration be not all one as to put us upon proving our selves <hi>Christians,</hi> or equivalent thereto?</p>
               <p n="10">X. Whether it be proper or reasonable

for one that has charged us with being <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> and <hi>Men of Lying Spirits,</hi> and promised to prove it, insteed thereof to require a Proof or Evidence from us of our being <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>divinely inspired;</hi> and if we do not at his Demand produce such Evidence as he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to conclude us <hi>Impostors?</hi>

Whether divers of the <hi>Baptist-</hi>Preachers have not heretofore imposed their <hi>Water-Bapitsm</hi> as Gospel, or as a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation, and so to the being of a <hi>Christian</hi> and Church of Christ, threatning &amp; affrighting many simple People into Water upon pain of Damnation or the Curse; some by telling them, <hi>They must Dip or Damn?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Whether the <hi>Baptists</hi> are of the same Opinion still, <hi>That their Water-Baptism or Dipping is Gospel, necessary to Salvation, or to be practised upon pain of Damnation?</hi>

XV. And how proves <hi>Jeremy Ives,</hi> that the <hi>One Baptism</hi> (spoaken of <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.) is that of <hi>Water?</hi> And whether his Instance of <hi>Lords many</hi> for <hi>divers Baptisms,</hi> as of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; Affliction, and the Holy Ghost, were a pertinent and meet Instance and Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as between <hi>One Lord Jesus,</hi> and <hi>but One proper Baptism,</hi> to wit, <hi>that of Water,</hi> and between the Lords many &amp; divers Baptisms, to wit, of Afflictions, and the Holy Ghost? see his <hi>Quakers Quaking,</hi> p. 38.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. And what Call, Gospel-Rule, or Precept, have <hi>Baptists</hi> for Night Dipping, and Fleeing or Absenting from Meetings in Times of Persecution? And whether their envious Invectives and abusive Pamphlets, now in Times of Peace against their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, do not proceed from the same coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, which acted them in Times of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering?</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. After the <hi>Baptists</hi> have try'd their Strength, made Enquiry of Apostates, and searched Books and Courts, to pick out Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions against us, to render us as Vile as they can, and not only <hi>no Christians,</hi> but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Government, and all this, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to destroy us; May they not justly expect, that their Mischief will return upon their own Heads, and that they will fall into the Pit which they dig for others.</p>

If they persist in this their course of Envy against us, whether they may not, as men conscious, justly expect a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reprehension; we having Occasion suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient out of their own Books and former Proceedings, to exhibit a <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> both with relation to Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?

Ives</hi> his calling <hi>Arthur Cook, Pittiful Fool,</hi> and <hi>Knave,</hi> and <hi>Loggerhead,</hi> on the <hi>Exchange,</hi> should be doubted of; This may inform, that I have several <hi>Certificates</hi> thereof, under the hands of credible Persons.</p>
