            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When I walked in the way of the Wicked, and knew not the path of the Juſt; when I lived in tranſgreſſion againſt God, and knew not his holy Law to walk therein, then oft times did fear ſurpriſe me, and terrour ſeized upon my heart; For I ſaw that the way in which I walked was <hi>the way that led to deſtruction</hi>: then as I conſidered the way of the World, <hi>I</hi> ſaw <hi>they were all gone aſtray,</hi> and though they had a Profeſſion of God, yet Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him they had not, neither was he to be found in their Aſſemblies: Then my ſoul languiſhed after the knowledge of him, and after the Knowledge of <hi>the way of life</hi>; yet ſtill was <hi>I</hi> captivated with vanity, and the deceitfulneſs of ſin ſtole away my heart: But the good Spirit of God ſtill ſtrived in me, to come out of the wayes of the world, whoſe Worſhips <hi>I</hi> had long ſeen to be but <hi>as the offering of Swines blood</hi>; and in my heart I could not joyn with them, but had a teſtimony in me againſt their wayes; and that which they called <hi>their Ordinances, I</hi> ſaw <hi>there was nothing of God in it,</hi> for <hi>they were but as a ſhadow, vanity, and nothing</hi>; but how to come into <hi>the way of life,</hi> to this I was ſtill a ſtranger, untill the Lord <hi>in his eternal power,</hi> ſent <hi>the Miniſters of the Word of Life, who</hi> were <hi>annointed of the Lord,</hi> and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power from on high, <hi>to preach the glad tydings of the Goſpel to the captivated ſeed,</hi> and <hi>to miniſter to the ſpirits that were in priſon,</hi> whoſe voice I rejoyced to hear, and whoſe <hi>Teſtimony I gladly received</hi>; For <hi>they declared the way of life</hi>; that it was <hi>in the midſt of the path of judgment</hi>; and <hi>the witneſs of God in my heart did ſeal to the truth of their Teſtimony</hi>: and this I ſaw <hi>was the way that the Workers of Iniquity knew not</hi>: For <hi>there is no judgment in their goings</hi>: Then my ſoul cryed unto God <hi>for the pourings forth of the Spirit of judgment</hi> that <hi>I might walk in the paths thereof,</hi> and <hi>that the filth thereby might be purged away</hi>: for <hi>I</hi> ſaw <hi>that my heart was polluted,</hi> and that <hi>there was no habitation for God</hi>; which cauſeth me <hi>to mourn in deſolation, and to wander in ſolitary places</hi>: So as <hi>I waited in the light of his Son, which ſhined in my heart and conſcience</hi>; there he <hi>revealed his righteous judgments, and the juſt rejoyced therein,</hi> yea; <hi>he brought me into

            <p>THat which was in the beginning before the World was, and is now made manifeſt, which we have ſeen, and which we have taſted of, and which our hands have handled of the Word of Life; and that which is revealed to us in ſecret by the Spirit of the Lord, that do we declare openly, even that which we are eye-witneſſes of; for the Word hath took fleſh, and dwells among us, and we have beheld his glory <hi>as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</hi> And this is he who is now appeared in the Spirit, and made manifeſt for this end, that the Works of the Devil might be deſtroyed; and that by and through him the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh might be revealed, for want of whoſe knowledge the people periſh, and many (in divers parts of the World, as I have obſerved) are in great perplexity, and ſome even at their wits end, becauſe of the deſtractions and many cries that are in the World, ſome crying, This is the way; and otherſome, That is the way; and all of them from the Light of the Son of God in their own hearts and Conſcience, which leads in the way of Life and Peace (all who are guided by it and out of all confuſion and deſtractions about Religion and Church-Ordinances and Worſhip, and ſuch things about which the World is in heaps and confuſion, and are preſcribing ways of Worſhip in their own fallen Wiſdom, and would compel all to conform thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (and ſo would bind the Conſciences of people to their wills) which ought to be left unto the Lord, to be exerciſed by his power in matters of Worſhip and obedience towards him; and his prerogative is to rule there: So that people muſt either diſobey God or the Laws of corrupt fallen man; and whether is better? judge ye.</p>
            <p>And this is ſad to ſee and conſider, becauſe there hath been for ſo many years by-paſt ſo much preaching, and ſo much profeſſion of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the like, and that by men of all profeſſions, as they have come into Authority one after another; and many and ſeeming fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes have been made by them all, <hi>That free Liberty of Conſcience (in things relating to God) ſhould be granted and allowed to people of all ſorts</hi>; for the breach of which engagements (with many other) divers have already been rooted out and overturned, and yet thereby men have not taken warning (though beſides warnings have oft been given them in tender love) to perform their promiſes and engagements in theſe things and all other, though much conſiſteth therein as to their eſtabliſhment; and on the contrary to their ruination. Neither have they learned to give the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43377:6"/>
ſame liberty to others (in things relating to the Conſcience) as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would deſire to have; and this is not to do as they would be done unto; and therein they are ſhort of fulfilling the Royal Law of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let all people (who are making Laws to compel mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences) conſider how they are degenerated from God, and how dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath covered them, and hardneſſe of heart hath ſeized on them; ſo that they cannot have regard unto tender conſciences, but in the pride of their hearts would be Lords over the Conſciences of others. Surely they are not guided by the ſame Spirit that the Apoſtle was in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, who ſaid, <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own Conſcience</hi>; and this was true liberty of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all the profeſſion that there hath been, and yet is in the World, and the talk of God and Chriſt, and redemption and ſalvation by him; yet now when the Son of God is come, is there faith to be found on earth? or are people redeemed from the earth, or ſaved from the polutions of the world? <hi>I</hi> tell you nay; for all who are from the light of the Son of God in them they are in the alienation and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and are ſtrangers unto God and his Covenant of peace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate concerning that faith, which gives the Saints victory over the World, and ſo are drove out into the earth (not redeemed from it) but are bond ſlaves to corruption, and live in the polutions of the World; and in this ſtate the whole World lieth, notwithſtanding all their profeſſion and talk of Religion which is amongſt them; and ſo their fruits plainly manifeſt it; and thereby it is clearly ſeen, that their Teachers were not ſent of the Lord, neither have they had his Word, nor ſtood in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; therefore have they not profited the people, nor turned them from the evil of their ways, neither are they brought to the knowledge of the truth, by which freedom and redemption is witneſſed: So their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is vain, and their Faith is vain, and they remain in their ſins, which ſeparates them from God, and are dead while they live, and are unreſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and unreconciled, and have no aſſurance of their eternal well-being. And when any come into a ſerious conſideration; and unto a true ſence of the ſad ſtate they are in, and how they have lived and ſpent their time all their life long, then judgement and wrath, condemnation and pangs, and the ſorrows of Hell compaſſeth them about, and then ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the periſhing ſtate, they are even ar their wits end; yet theſe things they conſider not in the time of their proſperity.</p>
            <p>Wherefore all people every where who deſire to come out of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and confuſions, and hurryings, and contentions about Faith

and Worſhip, and Ordinances, and out of the polutions which the world lives in, and to come into the <hi>ſpiritual Worſhip, which is in the ſpirit and in the truth: To you I ſay, that is the Spirit of Truth in you all (in which God will be worſhipped) which reproves you of ſin in your hearts; and as you come into obedience to that, it will bring you into the ſpiritual Worſhip; for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhip conſiſteth in obedience to the Spirit; and this is the everlaſting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt the Light, the quickening ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for him hath God ordained of old to all that believe and work righteouſneſs for ſalvation.

               <p>ANd the living Faith which gives the Saints victory over the World, this cometh by hearing of the Word, which is nigh unto you all, even in your heart and in your mouth; and as every one comes to hear and obey it, you will thereby be begotten into the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints by which they wrought righteouſneſs; and that is the Faith which giveth victory over the World, and which worketh by love, for the purifying of the Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God; and without this Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; <hi>for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</hi> So ſearch your ſelves, and ſee whether you are in this Faith, yea or nay; or whether your faith be not a dead faith; for that which doth not lead to work righteouſneſſe, is a dead faith; for <hi>as the body without the Spirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo; yet by works only there is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>ANd the living Hope which maketh not aſhamed, but purifieth the heart even as God is pure</hi>: This is not witneſſed nor known, but through the tribulation and patience in the experimental working and operation of the ſpirit of life in the inward parts, and Word of Life; for by the Word of God which lives and abides for ever, are we begotten again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lively hope, which we have for an anchor both ſure and ſtedfaſt in all our tryals, toſſings and hurryings which we meet withal in the World, and amongſt the hypocritical profeſſors thereof, whoſe hope wil periſh in the day when the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven upon all who hold the Truth in unrighteouſneſs; but he whoſe hope is begotten by the operation of the Word and Spirit of Life, even he it is that purifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even as God is pure.</p>
               <p>So all who deſire the way of Life to know, and to walk in the path of peace, which the worker of iniquity knows not; I ſay unto you all, it is in the midſt of the path of judgement, which Chriſt the Light, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God leads unto. So every one, the light in your own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mind, wherewith Chriſt Jeſus the Son of the Fathers love hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened you; and as you wait in it, you wil find it checking and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you for ſin and iniquity in the ſecret of your hearts and conſciences; and as every one comes to be guided by this light, which is the way, it wil be an infallible guide unto you to lead you in the way of righteouſneſſe, and in the midſt of the paths of Judgement; and the worker of iniquity you will ſee judged in your own particulars daily; and the Prince of this World wil come to be caſt out, as you dwell in the judgement; and this is the way whereby <hi>Sion</hi> comes to be redeemed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore dwell in that which judgeth the man of ſin in your own particulars, and join not to that nature which would lead to work iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or unrighteouſneſs, but join to that which (in your own particulars) judgeth it; and here the Croſs you wil know, which the whole World are ſtrangers to; and then the old man will come to be weakned, and <hi>to be put off with his deeds, that the new man may be put on, which is created in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true holineſs</hi>; but this Work is not wrought nor effected, but through many combats, tryals and great tribulations, which formerly you were not acquainted with, while you were led captive at the Devil's will, and followed his luſts, <hi>and the ſtrong man armed kept the houſe,</hi> then all was at peace; <hi>but when the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So as every one are exerciſed with the ſpirit of truth (in your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which reproves you of ſin) this <hi>will lead you into all truth,</hi> and to work righteouſneſs, and wil bring you to fulfil the Royal Law &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which is, <hi>to do unto all men as you would men ſhould do unto you</hi>; &amp; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the motions of ſin and iniquity ſhall ariſe in your hearts, as you watch in the light it wil be ſeen, and by the Spirit of truth it wil be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before it be brought forth into action; &amp; here the Cockatrice is cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſhel, and <hi>Babylons brats daſhed againſt the ſtone; and happy ſhall he be that doth ſo.</hi>

               <p>Wherefore conſider your ways, and how the good Spirit of God hath long ſtrived with you, to gather you out of the polutions, ways, &amp; vain traditions of the World, and every one while you have time, prize it; &amp; <hi>while it is called to day, harden not your hearts,</hi> leſt thereby you provoke the Lord to anger and jealouſie which cannot be quenched; for this know, that his long-ſuffering and forbearance will come to an end; and <hi>his ſpirit will not always ſtrive with man</hi>; therefore while the tenders of Gods love are held forth unto you every one (who deſires to know the ſalvation of your ſouls) receive it; and that which begets good deſires in your minds, and judgeth evil deſires when they ariſe, that own for your guide and teacher; and this will exerciſe your minds in lowlineſſe and humility, and keep down the lofty ſpirit and high imaginations which will puff the mind up above the fear of God. So keep down in the humility; <hi>for this the Lord requires of thee oh man, whoſoever thou be, to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and walk humbly with God, for the proud he reſiſteth; but he giveth grace unto the humble, by which he teacheth them his precepts, even by his good Spirit of Grace which brings ſalvation, and which hath appeared unto all men; by this (I ſay) he teacheth them, that denying ungodlineſs &amp; worldly luſts, they ſhould live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world</hi>; [mark] the Grace which teacheth this, and which brings ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men; ſo that which brings ſalvation is nigh you, the Grace of God which hath appeared unto you; ſo every one mind that, and none turn it into wantonneſs nor into laſciviouſneſs, but every one give up to be taught by it, that the precepts of God you may come to know, &amp; walk in them: And ſo here is the great ſalvation of God, God's Covenant of Light <hi>which lighteth every man that comes into the world; I have given thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Covenant of Light, to lighten the Gentiles, that thou maiſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the Earth</hi>: Mark, God's Covenant of Light for ſalvation, which lighteth every man that comes into the World; in which Light the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them that are ſaved muſt walk; and ſaith God (who is Light) <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, and try the reins; look unto me and be ſaved all ye ends of the earth</hi>; mark again, unto him that ſearcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, all the ends of the earth muſt look for ſalvation; ſo that it comes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43377:8"/>
not from <hi>the Mountains nor Hills, but ſalvation is of the Lord; and God is Light, and in him is no darkneſs at all; and this is the Father of Lights, and is in the Son, and the Son in him; &amp; the Father &amp; Son are one, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world; wherefore dwel in the Light, &amp; walk in the Light, that you may be children of the Light; for the earth ſhall be covered with darkneſs, and groſs darkneſs ſhall be over the people; but the Lord ſhall become the Light of his Iſrael, and his God his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore come out of the groſs darkneſs with which the Earth is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and walk in the everlaſting light of the Son of God wherewith you are enlightened, and walk no longer in the dark paths of ignorance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow the blind guides of the World any more, who have fed you with their own airy imaginations and conceptions, and brain-ſtudy, and have ſpoken unto you a divination of their own brain, and not from the mouth of the Lord, and your ſouls are not ſatisfied with all that ever you received from them; and why will you ſpend your money for that which is not bread, ann your labour for that which doth not ſatisfie your ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>? Oh hearken diligently unto the voice of God (who is Light) that you may eat of that which is good, and your ſouls may be ſatisfied; for why ſhould your ſouls be in poverty, and dry, and barren (now the Fountain of durable riches is open) but becauſe you are alienated from the Lord, and ſtrangers to his Covenant of Light. Wherefore the reſtoration all wait to know, by him who brings back again that which hath been driven away, that the return of your captivity you may come to know and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, out of <hi>Babylon</hi> that great City, whoſe deſolation cometh ſuddenly, and be ye ſeparated from the abominations thereof, and touch not the unclean thing, that you may be received of the Lord into my Father's Houſe, where my dwelling is, in which there is no want of any good thing; for here is all plenty of Heavenly rich virtue, and ſweet conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore I cannot but invite all who are hungry to come freely; for the Fountain is open, and whoſoever thirſts, may drink of the water of life freely.</p>
               <p>But now my Friends, this know, That the way that leads to this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of Reſt, Kingdom of peace, and Fountain of life, is ſtrait and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and none can walk therein but through ſelf-denial, and taking up the daily Croſſe to the carnal mind, vvhich may ſeem hard to ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Reaſonings and Conſultations vvith the vvrong nature, vvhich vvould ſtill live; but that being denied, and the light being joined unto, vvhich manifeſts the vvay, and the Croſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Judgement, for the righteous wil rejoice therein; &amp; though many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and ſometimes many difficulties you may find in the way, yet keeping to the Light in ſingleneſs, &amp; feeling the power of God, and the ſecret working thereof, it will keep the mind cool, and exclude the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulter; and then the way thou wilt ſee open clear before thee, through all difficulties; and as thou waiteſt in the pure fear of the Lord, keeping thy mine ſtaid upon him, thou wilt feel his good hand of love reaching unto thee daily, adminiſtring renewedneſs of ſtrength unto thee, whereby thou wilt be ſufficiently encouraged to preſs on in the ſtrait and narrow way, and the way of his commandments wil be delightful unto thee, and not grievous; and he wil repleniſh thy heart with his grace, &amp; make thee know the aboundings of his love, which vvil exceedingly enlarge thy heart: So let none ſtumble or ſtart aſide at the ſtraitneſs of the way, but be vvilling to ſubmit to the Croſs, that the Crovvn thou maiſt come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, which is immortal and eternal, and then it vvill never repent thee vvhatſoever thou art made to deny; for an hundred fold thy revvard vvil be in this life from the hand of the Lord; and peace, and life everlaſting thou vvilt have the aſſurance of, and it thou vvilt poſſeſs and enjoy; and tbis is of more value vvith the upright in heart, then all the love, glory, or friendſhip of the World, for that laſts but for a little ſeaſon, and then paſſeth avvay; but this Inheritance is everlaſting, and never hath an end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let not your minds be captivated vvith any periſhing thing vvhatſoever, but in that vvhich vvil redeem the mind out of all that is periſhing, in that dvvel, and you vvil knovv a daily dying unto ſin, and to all things of that nature vvhich keeps the ſoul in death; and thereby you vvil be quickened unto God, and the deſires and ſecret breathings vvhich are in you after God, vvil more and more encreaſe &amp; be renevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fervency of heart, and zeal for the Lord will encreaſe alſo; and where theſe fervent deſires and breathings are in any one, nothing wil ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it but the preſence of the Lord; and as this is dwelt with in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſingleneſs, the Lord in his own time will manifeſt himſelf to thy everlaſting ſatisfaction and comfort, and joy, and everlaſting content; Wherefore let not any thing be accounted dear for his ſake; <hi>for he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth father or mother, wife or children, or any thing more then me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not worthy of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I now publiſh the Decree of the Almighty unto all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>That whoſoever will not ſerve, worſhip and obey the God of Heaven, who is Light, and ſearcheth the heart of man, even he ſhall dye, and darkneſs ſhall be his covering, and groſs darkneſs his pavillion; and death ſhall be his life, and the Terrours thereof ſhall compaſs him about world without end.
