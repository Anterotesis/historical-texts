            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas it hath been <hi>ſeemingly</hi> by the inſinuations of ſome <hi>few</hi> of us, caſt on our <hi>whole</hi> Company, that we would lay our ſhoulders, and ſtretch out our helping hands, for the upholding of ſomething, which to our ſelves is both unknown and uncertain; and may likewiſe in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, be a cauſe of diſturbance, if not breaking the peace of the Nation: <hi>We,</hi> to manifeſt <hi>Our</hi> innocency, in the one particular, and vindicate our ſelves from the <hi>ſcandal</hi> thereof, as alſo to ſhew our real and hearty concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, with all other, <hi>Noblemen, Gentlemen, Citizens and others,</hi> of the ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations are expoſed to the publike view, doe <hi>cordially, unanimouſly, and freely</hi> declare.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Liſt</hi> annexed of our names to a Petition <hi>pretended</hi> by our conſent to be preſented to the <hi>Members ſitting at Westminster,</hi> is not at all by us owned, neither do we know any other Authors or Abettors thereof, then ſome <hi>few here under-mentioned,</hi> our names in truth being gained by Collonel <hi>Whitton,</hi> under the pretence to put down <hi>Hackny Coachmen;</hi> but by him converted to another uſe, and that ſo contrary to our thoughts and intentions, that we would ſooner have quitted our neereſt relations, than have conſented to ſuch <hi>ebulliences.</hi> For the undeceiving therefore of the <hi>Gentry</hi> of this Nation, to whom many, yea, moſt of us are oblieged, and conſequently not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; for the rectifying the judgements of ſuch as know us not, and for the ſatisfaction of the whole <hi>free-born</hi> Subjects of <hi>England</hi> who with us claim a birthright in <hi>Magna Charta, and the Petition of right,</hi> we doe further, with <hi>one conſent,</hi> declare.</p>
            <p>That we conceive it fitting, for the <hi>redreſſing</hi> the grievous wants and preſſures, that lie upon all the good people of this Nation, that according to <hi>Fundamentall Right,</hi> the People in <hi>Parliament</hi> may have their <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,</hi> who may receive their grievances, and preſent them in their behalf, whereby to obtain a remedy.</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>Faction and Schiſm,</hi> hath already too great a root, that <hi>honeſt and prudential men</hi> may be elected, whoſe <hi>Eſtates</hi> (as to temporalls) and <hi>Religion</hi> (as to ſpirituals) may obliege them ſincerely, to endeavour a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The onely meanes for attaining of which ends, we conceive by the bleſſing of God, to be a <hi>full and free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> which as we know the Nation groanes for; ſo we cordially deſire, and we ſhall not acquieſce, till we have regained that our <hi>undoubted right,</hi> hitherto <hi>unqueſtioned Priviledge,</hi> and never to be denied <hi>Lawful Demand.</hi> In the defence whereof, we ſhall account nothing too dear to loſe, being ready to quit not onely our <hi>employments,</hi> but to lay aſide our <hi>relations,</hi> and lay our lives at ſtake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Repreſentation is owned by</hi> Ten Thouſand of us, <hi>(which if deſired) ſhall be acknowledged both with our hands and hearts, againſt all the malicious underminings of Col.</hi> Whitton <hi>the Painter and his Decoys: who upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring that forged Petition to the Watermens Hall, being conſcious, that the ranckneſs of the Trepan would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſented, addreſt themſelves to Mr.</hi> Pryn, <hi>to pen their Proteſt againſt it, their names are hereunto annexed.</hi>
