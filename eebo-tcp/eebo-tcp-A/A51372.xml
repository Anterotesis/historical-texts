            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
WELCHMENS
JVBILEE,
In Honour of St. DAVID.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ame,</hi> the Vice-gerent of the
Univerſe, is moſt to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
for her future indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie
to her ſons: for whom
ſhe cheriſheth alive, ſhe will
not permit to lie in the odious
Sepulchre of Oblivion, nor ſuffer their names
to be raced out of the rolles of honour, but
in an annual progreſſion rather to blow their
names abroad with the trump of never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glory. The explication of my meaning,
includes the cuſtomary obſervation of the
<hi>Welchmen,</hi> who yearly celebrate one day to
the honour of St. <hi>David</hi> (once their Grand-Signior
of Chivalry) in great ſolemnitie. He
<pb facs="tcp:63985:3"/>
that was once the Pillar of their hopes, the
Glory and ſole Fame of their Country, is now
honoured (although long ſince interred) in
the memory of his meritorious Name: He
that eſteemed not his deareſt bloud ſufficient
to accomodate his Country, is eternized, or at
leaſt ſolemnized by the ſame, and hath more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
a reſpective remuneration for his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
puiſſance: He laſtly, that once
greatly honoured <hi>Wales,</hi> is now himſelfe
greatly honoured by the ſame. To memorize
any man, ſignifies not only the generall good
opinion, and affection towards the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but likewiſe declares his deſerving ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
Among the Greeks it was called
a worthy thing to be ſolemnized after death:
The Romans likewiſe acknowledged it to
be <hi>glorioſum quid,</hi> a glorious thing to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
any day to the Honour of the dead. And
I ingenuouſly confeſſe I cannot but highly
extoll the indulgent ſedulity of the <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
in remembring their Saint with ſuch
annuall devotion. <hi>Polemon</hi> when he dyed at
<hi>Athens</hi> was once in three yeares honoured
with a ſolemn Celebraeion, and that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be a moſt famous deed. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
accounted an eminent act, when <hi>Caſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
was twice remembred ſolemnly after
<pb facs="tcp:63985:3"/>
his Funerall. But neither of theſe can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be ſo glorious, as that of S. <hi>David;</hi>
for his day is not only once every year duely
obſerved, to the memory of his immortall
Fame: but ſucceſſively continueth without
any praetermiſſion. Yet one thing I cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<hi>viz.</hi> their cuſtome in wearing a green
Leek on their hats hn that day likewiſe: and
here (<hi>Gentle Reader</hi>) give me leave to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
my ſelf a while, to ſee whether I can
ſcrutably, and in a credible probability ſearch
out the meaning, and cauſe of the ſame: Some
report, that they wear this Leek, becauſe of
their generall affection unto it: others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the cauſe to be, becauſe of the numerous
multitude of Leekes that grow in their:
but either of theſe are fallible; for it is more
credibly declared, that S. <hi>David</hi> when hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
went into the field, in Martiall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
he carried a Leek with him; and once
being almoſt faint to death, he immediately
remembred himſelf of the Leek, and by that
means not onely preſerved his life, but alſo
became victorious: hence is the Mythologie
of the Leek derived, and hence it was that
they ever ſince continued reſpectively the
inveſtigation of the ſame, to the ſempiternal
<pb facs="tcp:63985:4"/>
honour of their Champion St. <hi>David.</hi> There
is alſo a common Proverb in <hi>Wales,</hi> that St.
<hi>David</hi> is as bright as the Moon; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
I have oftentimes preſumed to wonder
at their ſimilitude in comparing him to the
Moon, unleſſe be the cauſe thereof, that the
Moon was made of green Cheefe, at whoſe
bright ſplendor perhaps, they may have the
curteſie to toſte it. But be more clement
Reader, whoſoever thou beeſt, and think not
that I ſpeak this in a ludibrious jeer, or abuſe
to the Countrie, for I ſpeak altogether in
praiſe and commendation of it: yet howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
according to the Poet:
<q>Interpone tuis, interdum gaudia curis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If I have been barren in expreſſions for
the honour of St. <hi>David,</hi> you muſt excuſe the
brevitie of time, wherein it was compoſed:
and what remaines, I will conſummate in a
